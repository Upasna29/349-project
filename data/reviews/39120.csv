Then Trion Worlds started bleeding money on failed project after failed project and Rifts Dev team got axed down hard. To try and compensate things went F2P and things were fine at first. Hey we get nifty new costumes and I don't need to pay a sub fee anymore (I still did, even if the original patron perks were pretty bad by recent standards.)\n\nThe shift was subtle at first, gear became purchasable, either directly or in directly through lotto style loot crates that you can buy for special mounts and get decent gear on the side (A great deal till you realize the currency you get for the mounts is character bound, and the gear you get from the chest is based on your characters class. Meaning that before you'll ever have the currency saved to get that special super shiney mount, you'll have wasted more cash then you will want to think about on what is basically worthless chests and gears as opening them on a different character who could use the gear, means your currency is split. Well played Trion.) Tangent aside. What this gear purchasing did was create a stigma in the "PuG" raiding community, as you had to have the achievements to even be able to join the raids, and if you didn't have a guild that did them? You were SoL.\n\nThings like that continued to spiral out of control, when you realized how long it would take to grind out the dungeon and raid tokens to get gear, but feel free to buy Patron status and token boosters to cut down on that time by several hundred percent. Turning what used to be a fairly smooth and natural gear progression into something akin to an Asian MMO's level of grinding. Oh and because of course it is, the pvp is entirely based around who out gears who.\n\nThrow in the usual batch of awful awful people that come with the F2P crowd, and it's hard to even argue if just playing it for the social aspect is worth it. From an Role Play standpoint it does a few things right and many things wrong. The lore is built out of wet tissue paper, and few people even follow that, open world role play is almost impossible to find and when you do? You're going to wish you hadn't. One of the good and bad things it has, are Dimensions, or just player housing. Easily costumizable zones and area's you can do a great deal of things with. Probably the most positive thing about this game these days, minus the obvious cash shop tie in's to building materials. Of course, player housing is always a double edged sword for role play as it becomes cliquish and impossible for new people to really get involved.\n\nIn the end the final nail in the coffin that made me write this review, was when they released the new single zone, not an expansion pack, not a new continent. But one area. They wanted to charge one hundred dollars, for the new class that came with it, as well as some relatively worthless in game items. This harkens back to the Ember isle map they added years ago, it was free, it was an amazing area and I still consider it their best zone. And while you can still reach this new zone for free, and the new class can be picked up for the low low cost of about 30 bucks (Without the cyber swag). I can only stop to realize, Rift really isn't the same. And it's just not worth the time anymore.\n\nOh and there's easily another 1-2k hours missing from that playtime. So there goes that entire year of my life! Shoulda put that time into something I could have gone professional instead. Like Solitaire.","November 17, 2015","false","225.8"," 1,336 of 1,484 people (90%) found this review helpful 356 people found this review funny","90","336","1","356","98"

It has everything WoW has:\nSame interface, mechanics, professions, auction house, instances, raids, BGs, item naming, controls, addons on Curse, talents, etc,\n\nIt also has the additions that WoW has always needed:\n- Random Zone Events (constant, running all the time)\n- Rifts (which appear randomly and massively accros the map)\n- 1 and 2 players dungeons (Chronicles)\n- Built-in mechanics that in WoW you need addons (sell grey items, quest guides, etc)\n- Instant Adventures, which randomly matches you with a bunch of players and then you keep doing infinitely chosen grinding quests in a zone, giving massive EXP and rewards (the best way to level).\n\nBut mostly important it has AN AWESOME CHARACTER CLASS AND ROLE CUSTOMIZATION. It's something like "make your own class and roles":\n- Caster DPS-Tank-Healer\n- Pure caster DPS\n- Caster and Melee DPS\n- Caster with Pet DPS and Healer (or just DPS)\n- Melee Tank with Healing habilities\nAnd a LOT MOOOOOOORE.\n\nRegarding the Free to Play aspect of it: you can completely play the game without ever spending a penny, but a few restrictions:\n- You can't sell on the Auction House\n- Limited bags (very annoying)\n- You will have to grind a lot in order to buy mounts\n\nBut I was so hooked the first day that I bought the Classic Collector's Pack, unlocking a lot of extras, plus giving 1 month of Patron, which means 40% additional exp = faster leveling. Also, I WANTED to pay, because I was willing to help Trion. This game DESERVES money. It's polished, addicting and well crafted.\n\nIf you want to play WoW but aren't willing for a comeback, RIFT is your game!","October 8, 2014","true","101.8"," 689 of 766 people (90%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","90","689","766","29","22"

As of writing this review I have logged almost 4000 hours. Mhmm. Almost four thousand. One hundred and sixty-six days. It's a safe assumption that I'm a veteran player that has been enjoying this game almost since release!\n\nAfter hearing about it, I was worried about Trions Free To Play buisness model. I am happy to report (contrary to other opinions) that there is NOTHING out of reach in game to non patrons (subscribers) or those that don't want to spend hard earned cash for pixels and code, The F2P system in RIFT is created as such to allow people to purchase Credits using in-game currency. It might take a damn sight longer, but you could get everything, including sub time, just by something as simple as selling artifact collections.\n\nCombat is pretty fun, and the souls/roles (Calling/Class) system is one of the best i have ever experienced in an MMO. Mage tank? Sure! Cleric bard? Done! A Warrior healer? Go for it! Each class is updated by the devs fairly regularly, so all of them are fairly balanced, there are a few exceptions (looking at you Physician...).\n\nThe world is huge, and gets bigger with each expansion. It still looks pretty good despite it's three year long run and is still one of my favourite MMOs ever.\n\nTL;DR  Great game with a ton of content, entirely free to play, if you don't enjoy it I'll personally refund your free for free.","September 30, 2014","true","478.6"," 427 of 471 people (91%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","91","427","471","69","17"

I'll keep it short and simple.\n\nPros ☺+ One of the best PvE experiences I've ever had in any game. The world and the raids are extremely dynamic with       fun and well-designed boss encounters.\n+ Great community.\n+ There's always something to do.\n+ A neat wardrobe system allowing you to change the looks of your gear if you're not satisfied with how it looks or the pieces don't match. Purely cosmetic feature. This has been taken even further after Nightmare Tide, as you can now directly "transmog" any gearpiece including weapons directly from your wardrobe tab.\n+ Many different options when creating your spec due to the soul tree feature.\n+ Seasonal events in which you unlock items such as mounts, clothing/gear, companions and more.\n+ F2P. You CAN buy gear with Gems which cost real money, but in order to do so, you must spend a helluva lot of money. It doesn't really have a negative effect on the game. If you're overall bad at the game/your role, gear won't help you. Guilds don't accept people without experience. The game is just as playable F2P as if you paid for stuff.\n+ Free server transfer every 7 days.\n\nCons ☹- Horrible PvP. It's quite unbalanced and gets repetitive pretty fast.\n- Bad customer support. Can barely assist you due to all their policies.\n- Spending a lot of time on farming items such as gear pieces and planar essences is necessary in order to succesfully raid. I do however believe this applies to most MMOs.\n- Too few gear models. Often you'll see the same model used for several different gear pieces with other stats. Just letting you know if you're into cosmetics and looking cool.\n- The amount of players seems to be decreasing.\n\nSo why quit a game you've spent almost 3,000 hours in?It's difficult to give just one reason or explanation. Basically, the fact I had played it for that long might've burnt me out. Other than that, my guild in which we had an awesome community disbanded, and the friends I used to play RIFT with had switched over to other games. Furthermore, I suppose I also just wanted to play other games. I have plenty on Steam and I'm not the type of guy who sticks with just one game forever. I like variation.","December 31, 2014","true","771.5"," 374 of 413 people (91%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","91","374","413","33","7"

Zone events, world events, dungeons, chronicles, raids, PvP (if you like that), instant adventures, etc etc.\n- One of the better housing systems\n- Really good F2P model, with pretty much all content being free aside from things like bag space, some of the souls etc.\n- Can be a really casual or hard core game. It's pretty flexible in that regard.\n- Soul system is one of the better "talent" systems in MMOs.\n\nCons\n- The lore could use some work. It's got the GW2 problem in that the lore is there, just horribly horribly presented, which is sad because it has some pretty cool ideas and concepts.\n- The shop is sometimes overpriced, and they do sell gear in the shop (albiet incredibly overpriced) which may turn off some people. Also they introduce new "lockboxes" all the time which I personally consider a lame version of gambling.\n- The reputation system is horrible. Almost as bad as WoWs.\n- The daily system the reputations are tied to get boring VERY fast, however if you want the best enchants for some slots, you need to do it.\n- If you're a lore junkie, a lot of the world is unfinished. Stories and zones. You'll get disappointed staring at grey blobs on the map that sound cool, but just don't exist, or finishing a story quest chain with far more questions than answers.\nIt makes the world feel unfinished.\n- The subscription fee is no where near woth paying for. You get some boosters and a weekly gift, along with a discount. It's pretty worthless. If you want to support the game just spend $5 to $15 a month on credits and get something worthwhile.\n- Because tanking in this game is so unappealing like so many other MMOs, the old problem of tank shortages comes up a lot. It may be a turn off to some people who like to do dungeons.\n\nIn the end I would recommend the game. I consider it one of the best MMOs out right now. Definitely one of the best F2P ones.","November 25, 2013","true","270.5"," 365 of 420 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","365","420","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/recommended/39120/","3InkSheep","3InkSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/","218 products in account","I've been shaking off the urge to write a review for the F2P MMORPG, Rift, for about a week now, purely because I wanted to write one that did it justice. I'm a little under 200 hours into this game at the time of this review, but despite that, I've barely scatched the surface.\n\nI'll start negative. Rift isn't original, I mean sure, the Rift aspect is, but other than that it's pretty much filled with the same content you'd expect from an MMO. Quests that are uncreative, grinding to level and lots of walking, for the most part. So at this point you might be asking yourself why would you play Rift?\n\nWell, in short, Rift does what other MMOs do, but better. The only exception to this, in my view is the spell effects in game are lacking, they feel a little washed out, but everything else, from killing monsters to presentation is absolutely crisp, responsive and highly polished. The scenery is gorgeous, you'll often find yourself stopping to take screenshots and admire the landscape, and even the monsters. Every area has a totally unique atmosphere and feel to it, each crawling with unique monsters waiting to rip your face off. This brings me to difficulty. Rift isn't easy, at least not compared to other MMOs. The monsters and combat are a lot less forgiving, death comes with a penalty and continous deaths with permantly penalize your stats until you visit a healer. This is a good point though, it makes the grinding aspect of the game more enjoyable, because your attention is focused solely on the game in nail biting moments. Look away for even a few seconds and you could come back to find your body laying on the floor surrounded by dragons.\n\nRift features a huge amount of content. The map is huge, there are several islands to travel, hundreds and hundreds of quests and a huge range of monsters to be killed by. Raids, Chronicles, Rifts, Hunt Rifts, Bounty Hunting, Warfronts, Instant Adventures, Dungeons and so on. To give a perspect on the amount of content, I list eight game types, in just one, for example Dungeons, there is about 40 dungeons in Rift ranging across across levels from 1 - 60. Once you hit 60, it isn't over. You can prestiege and the game introduces a second XP bar for planer attunement, which unlocks new abilities and skills.\n\nI was lucky enough to be invited to a guild on my first day of playing Rift, and I've stuck with it ever since. Joining a guild, working together to do guild quests and form raids/events is where I have the best fun, as I think a lot of people do also. You're able to completely customize your guild to represent and battle others, all the while earning points that contribute to the leveling tree in the guild. This too unlocks perks such as bonus xp, better loot drops, faster health regeneration, teleporting to guild members and so on.\n\nFor those of you who may be collectors, don't worry, Rift has a HUGE amount of collectibles in-game, named "artifacts". Artifacts are found around the map, either by exploring or by looting monsters and/or chests. Rift encourages exploration, if you can see it, chances are you can go there. You'll be searching for these hidden artifacts for hours and hours, and when you finally do get the complete set for a particular catagory, you get rewards. Rift always rewards you for your work, and it rewards well.\n\nProfessions in Rift are quite in-depth, there's enough to keep you digging away for hours, looking for the materials and crafting the items you need to level. The leveling doesn't take too long, there is 375 levels per skill, currently I've managed to achieve this in Fishing, which took about 30 hours or so, just to give a perspective. There is two types of professions; gathering and crafting, both of which tie into one another. You'll be given useful hints and tips as you progress, suggesting which receipes do craft and for what reasons. There is currently about ten professions, give or take, which include: Minning, Butchering, Fishing, Survival, Outfitting, Foraging, Armoursmithing, Weaponsmiths and so on. All the reciepes and materials you craft can either be used, traded or sold either to NPCs are stores or on the player economy driven Auction House.\n\nThis game is ENTIRELY free to play, from level 1 to collecting every item, every piece of armour and maxing every skill. There is no restrictions and no cut out content. There is a store, you're able to purchase some items through real money. This is more of a boost, the items can be obtained in-game and no real world purchases are neccesary or required in any way. Spending credits earns loyalty points, which the more you spend, the more you earn. These unlocks are only available via the loyalty system, but can still be obtained absolutely free. There is an in-game item called "Rex", which you can purchase with game currency, then exchange it for both credits to spend in the store, as well as loyalty points to earn items. This means you can obtain everything in Rift, absolutely free.\n\nAs far as MMOs go, this one is one of the best. It's free, it's filled with content and it's crisp in every aspect. I highly recommend you give this a go, it's a little slow to start off, but you'll find yourself hooked and playing daily, enjoying every second of it.\n\n9.5/10 - A fantastic MMO that achieves everything it sets out to do in a high quality fashion.\n-0.5 for the lacking spell visuals, it's minor, but noticable.","June 15, 2014","true","843.5"," 308 of 358 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","308","358","0","4"

Why would I or someone else pay that much if I or somebody else can get all that for 139.99€. And even that costs way to much.\n\nRIFT DLC editions costs too much specialy if you're planning to spend over 325€. Spend 68€ for Guild Wars 2 Digital Deluxe Edtion with game guide on how to level up ANY of race class + you get great useful premium items.\nI do recommend this game but be warned that play for free has it's limited restrictions unless you want to buy NIGHTMARE EDITION. I am happy enough that is play for free but at least they could do is lower the prices for nightmare edition if it's worthy of getting it.\n\nSome of you may think that some the cons are funny and/or stupid. But that's how I see it.\nEveryone has it's own taste but I love the game myself so I try and ignore the cons and maybe 1 day i'll buy nightmare edition.\nI recommend it but many of you won't like it.

Great graphics, beautiful and detailed landscapes. You can customize your character the way you want to by using different souls available within your selected class. For example, take a bit of Pyromancer for offense, a lot of Elementalist for some serious pet capability, and some Chloromancer to heal the party. Rift also has several pre-built options for those who like to get in and play quickly. Beyond all of the systems in the game, the standard things about the game are also very well done. The audio is phenomenal, and the controls are pretty intuitive. Glitches are very infrequent, and minor anyway. Besides, the game is still fairly new so such things are to be expected. Leveling up in this game is not grindy at all. The game frequently keeps you on quests (storyline and otherwise) which level you up as you play the game, rarely (if ever) forcing you to pull off to the side for some time to just level up. The solo-play material is well-handled, as is the group-play material. Gameplay is mostly solid, and the freedom to progress however you wish is definitely a bonus. The quests could benefit from more variety – something Trion should keep in mind for future content updates – and the overarching story is easily lost beneath the endless strings of ‘Collect this!’ and ‘Kill those!’ If you go in expecting total originality, immediate disappointment is sure to follow, but spend some time with the game, and you’ll be impressed with what Trion has to offer.  Rift breathes new life into the genre, restoring otherwise tired old concepts and proves success isn’t always built on originality.","May 3, 2014","true","184.4"," 236 of 284 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","236","284","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/recommended/39120/","wrath-","Wrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/","145 products in account","Edit: My views haven't changed, but I've rewritten the second half to give some clarity to some common complaints I've heard about this review.\n\nHow about some balance?\nWell, this isn't the easiest review to write. Rather than a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down", this is sort of "thumbs horizontal" I guess? There are very strong positive aspects to this game and very negative ones as well.\n\nTypically, anything that markets itself as "discount [game]", is pretty much going to be "horrible [game]". So, Titan Quest is discount Diablo II, Demigod is discount Dota, etc. In this case, Rift is not so much "discount WoW", but "alternative WoW". Now, I've played WoW for a very extensive amount of time from the vanilla to Cataclysm, so I'm pretty familiar with both by now. From what I've seen, there aren't actually any "downgrades".  What WoW players complained about lacking for a very long time were pretty much stocked to begin with, if not pillars of the game itself. These included:\n\nRegional events that keep areas changing and make it more interesting to live in, which includes their gimmick, rifts (portals from another realm that launch invasions on nearby towns).\n\n1-2 player dungeons and easier match-making for full five player dungeons. In fact, because of how build classification works (tank, DPS, heals, support), you are assured that every party will be pretty balanced for what you encounter, since every party must have a tank, a healer, a support, and two DPS.\n\nGuild quests and better guild management.\n\nMentor level - You can scale your power down to a lower level if, for example, you have a friend join the game and don't want to be grossly overpowered when you play with them.\n\nSidekick (which I don't agree with) - If you are the lowest level in your guild (which is the only explanation I can imagine) and everyone but you is doing some dungeon, you can temporarily raise your level to the party's rather than being left out of the event.\n\nInstant Adventure - particularly useful if you are just going to be on for ten minutes and don't want to get into the game too deep.\n\nBetter UI elements like selling grey items and auction house price trends.\n\nChange classification on the fly - Basically, the skill points that you first chose that got you to whatever level you are can be changed, easily. There's a huge amount of flexibility when it comes to how you play your character. A rogue can be played how you expect it to, relying on range or pets, or it can be turned into an assassin, it can be made into a make-shift tank, or it can be a healer.  Even when it comes to a make, which is typically a glass cannon, there's flexibility about whether you want a nuker-pyro or an AoE damage like stormcaller or AoE heal like chloromancer, you can even have a melee mage. The way you play your character has huge amounts of flexibility with both how you play and how you look, I may never see another game with this range of possibilities. Even though this strategy really only works once you've reached level 60 and unlocked all of your skill points, this is where Rift draws a lot of its strength and it's an awesome dynamic.\n\nWarfronts (medium scale PvP) used to be broken and not match players up very well based on class and gear, but now they seem to be doing better, a few more tweaks with healing and I think I won't have anything to make note of there. The games are pretty good.\n\nConquest (large scale PvP) is a cluster. And honestly, I don't think a lot people enjoy it because you kinda have to play with your leader holding a gun to your head saying "move when I say move, ♥♥♥♥♥". Well, no one enjoys that, but most people do it because the rewards are high enough to justify it. It's more about leader strategy and numbers than anything you do, personally.\n\nThe theming for the original game is great. It definitely loses it and goes off in strange directions when you get into the first and second expansion pack, and that's mildly disappointing, but hey, don't let it get to you.\n\nAs has been described elsewhere, the only thing you cannot do without spending money is using the auction house and all of your potential bag slots - and as little as five dollars unlocks those. This is ridiculously cheaper than the $15/mo WoW charges for the privilege of the same service. That said, the devs still need to pay rent, so a real money store is available in-game. 90% of the items are cosmetic; the other 10% are basically broken into two categories: Spend a small amount of money to get a slight boost to gold, exp rates, etc. Spend an exorbitant amount of money to get significant boosts or an item outright. In, literally, all cases, you may not purchase any item in the store that you cannot get some other way in the game.\n\nSounds great, but how can you vote down something you've played for over 400 hours for free?\nI donno, how can you work at a job for ten years, say you like the work but simultaneously hate working there?\n\nThe players suck. No really, they honestly do. I would take Dota people over these guys in a heartbeat. I have never in my life seen such a hostile group of folks in a game. It's kinda hard to get immersed in the environment and experience that I just described when there are fifty people at any given time complaining about how much they dislike the latest patch changes or the expansion systems or how their support ticket wasn't answered in the same day they submitted it...every single thing that the devs do is just a life-threatening crisis. Over a period of time, this really starts to affect your mood. But it's an MMO, a platform that is supposed to be around social constructs, communication, and collaboration. It's possible to turn off the chat and play completely alone, but dear god why should I have to do that?\n\nOn the free hours I'm so ungreatful for: Like I said, I support some sort of substitute for a subscription requirement in order to bring new players in and pay the dev to continuously add new content, since they continuously need food. I've supported substantively in that regard to the tune of about $60, which I find to be reasonably fair for the time I've gotten out of it. To say that I'm shooting down this game without chipping anything in is factually false and irritating to hear.\n\nUltimately? You should NEVER log in out of a sense of duty or sunk-time fallacy. There's a difference between "logging into relax and have a good time" to "logging into a stressful environment of conflict because of your virtual obligations". It seems like the hostile environment originated by the development team allowing themselves to be treated as punching bags, but changing their mind and punching back. Hard. So, the forums are dev/gamer flame wars, and the in-game world is nothing but passive aggressive condescending tones and internet-♥♥♥ kickings to the minority of people who agree with the devs.\n\nI think where I differ from most people (unpopularly) is that I'm willing to say that the developers are equally as bad as the consumer.\n\nRunning a game you've created for a hundreds of thousands of people is challenging and every machine and gaming instance will be different. People will find bugs and as a dev, there's no hintbook or place you can just google that says how to fix it. Problems take time and experimentation and there's no promise of success. However, allowing a hostile and combative atmosphere serves no one and just lets people feed off of each other's hate. But adopting the same combative attitude as a dev? Is simply abhorrent.\n\nAs a player who has no stake in the matter: I got my 400 hours, the devs got their money, and now it is time for us to part ways. If I had known what I do now, I would not have enjoyed it nearly as much originally, which is why I can't enjoy it now. Those two sentences may be the most reasonable justification for a review decision you're going to find.","December 23, 2014","false","425.2"," 302 of 384 people (79%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","79","302","384","28","19"

I've spent thousands of hours on more MMOs than I'd care to count.\nIn all that time, I've learned to recognize various signs a game on it's last leg has.\n\nOne of them is the increase of micro-transactions. Rift has recently taken various steps such as removing rested exp for free players, limiting dungeon charge accumulation for free players, etc to make their patron packs seem more attractive. This isn't an added benefit for payers, though; it's taking away what was for months (over a year, if memory serves) given to all just to attempt to extort players.\n\nAnother is the ramping up of grind. If you aren't planing on paying, then you're missing out on huge increases to your currency gain. One of the most important things for upgrading gear at the time of writing is Abyssal Accelerators, which are bought with Abyssal Crusader Marks. Patrons get an increase of 40% to their marks gain by default, with additional increases being available from "loyalty" (AKA pay more than a threshold to gain this buff) as well as consumables, going for more than a 200% increase.\n\nA third sign is an increase in premium events. As said before, this is simply an attempt to extort money out of it's remaining playerbase; an event shows up with a mount, pet or other vanity item and demands money out of it's players for it. Usually, it includes a lockbox or some other RNG mechanic to obfuscate just how much money the item actually requires on average.\n\nNext, the addition of previously non-existant "Login each day to win prizes!" mobile-style coercion systems. They provide no true benefit to the player other than forcing him to loyally login each and every day for the possibility that he will buy something, and only give the smallest benefits in return.\n\nThe last sign I want to talk about is the increase in NPCs to hide the fact the game world is empty. The carnival of the ascended is runing at the time of runing and I have seen a grand total of three other players taking part in the activities, at prime time.\nOn the other hand, I saw several dozen "reveler" NPCs; they have nothing to say, don't serve any purpose, and in a healthy game wouldn't exist.\nIn a healthy MMO, there would be plenty of players to render on screen instead and those NPCs would be considered a waste of valuable resources. Rift, however, is not healthy.\n\nSo, all in all, while I very much like the game I cannot recommend it due to it's current business practices, the population of the servers, current progression system, monetization model etc.\n\nIn it's golden days, this was a great MMO. I might even go so far as to say that until recently it was very decent and a reasonable choice for players looking for a fun free experience. But those days are clearly over and as it stands, this is just the desicated remains of what was once a good game.\n\nIf you choose to disregard this warning, I hope you have either plenty of money or plenty of time, ideally both; because without either, you won't get far.\n-Sleepy","April 25","false","453.9"," 118 of 132 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","118","132","6","18"

No Traps.\n\nThat sentence is a complete lie nowadays, playing as f2p became basically a trial, once you get to level cap, surprise, you need to buy Earring Slots and Planewalker to be strong enough for raids. Want to PVP instead? Prepare to get one-shot by wallet warriors with BIS gear that you can't even damage below 10%.\nIf you want to be competitive in either PVP or PVE you simply wont be even close without paying, I bought the planewalker cheapest (20$) package just so I can raid and pvp on “even” ground (earrings and gear which makes huge diffrence, earrings by itself is like 10-15%% of your stats), but even with that purchase it’s impossible to keep up with the people buying monthly sub, as they earn more currency, have higher caps etc. You might think it’s not really pay2win since you can get same stuff for free with time, well technically yes, BUT it takes so long by the time lets say you get tier one set for your class, the game is already in t3, once you are halfway in t2 gear its already t4 out, etc etc. Basically paying players have huge advantage all the time, both pve/pvp they will simply have more stats than someone playing for free. I used to recommend this game as best f2p mmo out, but since last expansion it went completely pay2win, buying rex isnt really viable anymore to keep up, due to rex prices inflating so much it’s close to impossible to farm plat for it to sustain montly sub like that (price tripled on EU during few months i was playing, I assume now it’s way more especially latest move by trion, making earring and planewarlker cash only)\nTl;dr Newest Endgame Raids are not possible without spending money, being competitive in pvp either. As f2p you will only be able to do older content tier’s (most likely 2 tier’s behind the current newest), and pvp is not even worth trying without mid-end gear. F2p is only viable if you play super casually, since its basically trial, but then you might as well go play GW2 which does it better for casual play, or Blade and Soul for pvp, Tera etc.","January 30","false","689.5"," 142 of 166 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","142","166","8","0"

If this is Trion's way of saying , "Non-patrons experience with playing Rift gets even worse",  you could not have done a better job. A better job alienating new potential players that is,along with causing people that supported your game to quit. Your....new choices (for the lack of a more polite and diplomatic term) that you  implemented on the latest patch , have already been commented extensively on the forums and ingame,so I 'm not gonna state something that's not already being stated.\nWhat I am going to say is this : If you expect people to financially support an MMO that advertises itself as free to play,while  all it does is sneak more and more subscriber privileges under the radar, forcing more and more restrictions to free players one "choice" at a time,you will be in for a big surprise. Why? The answer is simple.\nBecause people already have a subscription based MMO out there that they can play and get value for money,and won't waste their time and hard earned cash  on an unoptimised product that uses an archaic graphics engine and won't run properly unless you have a 2 thousand euros worth of gaming rig. People want to make the most of the time they invest on anything ,and the most of the money they spend,and that applies to video games entertainment too.And with the "choices" you keep making, Trion,your game will seize to entertain anyone very very soon.\nSo long story short,game is "free-to-sample",or at least that's what it has become.I have no hours played on steam cause I only use the glyph client.Thus,I can state ,fully confidently,that you should stay away from it,at least til Trion make amends for the increasing amount of cash-grabbing changes that they keep implementing into this game. Don't waste your money on it,don't play it.\n\nEdited on the 20th of February , 2016\nhttp://forums.riftgame.com/general-discussions/general-discussion/suggestions/478215-give-us-your-bag-ideas.html\nSo,there you go ladies and gentlemen,another idea Trion's Rift team will want to charge you money for. And the funniest thing is they present it in a way they think is subtle. In a time where games like Black Desert are about to be released,Trion's Rift development team have the balls to post "tell us what's the next thing you wanna be charged for" polls in their forums.

The game is clearly a polished and honed mmorpg and is pretty good at its current state effective of 6/13/2014.\n\nHowever, the small flaw, which actually is a huge deal for me personally, made me decide to not recommend and quit the game entirely.\n\nThis game is free to play in name only, You are not required to, but pretty much have to if you are going to play anywhere past level 50, meaning endgame. And what would be the point of investing time and energy into a game where you hit a pay wall. the pay wall in rift is its loyalty points issue. basically, in rift, you cannot auction. at all. not one item. unless you have spent 10 dollars. and their is a in game currency coin cap. 2500 platinum which is an extremely small amount when people are running around with tens of thousands of platinum.\n\nAll in all this game is good and i would say probably would suit casual players, but even then the no auction and coin cap rule is foolish IMO on the part of rifts dev team. The rift community is quite tiny and probably not growing due to this one small/large issue depending on how you look at it. But this is the games pay to play wall.

Really.\nOnly thing I can compare it to is WoW. But there the world is pretty static (or at least was, since I've only played it till WotLK and got bored, so no idea how the things look after the Cataclysm). Here you can get a rift open right above your head if you are (un)lucky enough. There's hardly a way to have nothing to do in this game, since the world changes every minute, bringing forth new challenges.\n\nOf things that I like (concerning gameplay):\n- tons of quests, including daily crafting ones (helps improving crafting skills a lot)\n- public group option: now you don't have to put the group up yourself, invite each player separately etc; just one click and you're in with all the group bonuses\n- invasions!!! Those really bring players together (since it takes quite a lot of running around to fend off all the atacking mobs, seal rifts and defend ward stones in different points of the map at the same time)\n- fishing (holy cow, I love fishing in this game!)\n- tons of things-to-do-except-for-standard-MMO-stuff: artifacts hunting, minions quests etc.\n- it's free; like really - everything u can get with real money, you can get with the in-game currency, it just takes time to gather some coin, but it's doable\n\nOnly-one-thing-I-don't-like:\n- Auction House is not available untill you get Loyalty points - and you can get them only by paying real money or buying one terribly expensive stuff in game (called Rift EXchange); but well, I guess that can be forgiven - that's the only inconvenience I met and it's not really a problem - if the AH was available, REX would be even more expensive since the in-game currency would be easier to get or, in worse case, they would make something else not available to provoke ppl to pay; and one can live without AH, especially if u get into some guild where u can trade with your guildmates (or more like ppl just leave stuff they don't need in guild vault and you just come and get what you need, leaving your thing for others).\n\nOf non-gameplay matters:\n- graphic is really great (see screenshots); remember it's an MMO (so u tend to have XX players and mobs on the screen running around, casting spells etc.), and it all runs smoothly even though you can find worse models/animations in single-player games; guys who did the optimization for this game did their job really well\n- also graphics stuff - landscapes are beautiful and vast; sure the map is divided into zones, but it's done neatly and not hurting ones eyes (like suddenly coming out of dense forest into almost-desert plains)\n- I like how female models are done; I'm always irritaded when I see the "very-fantasy" heroines on high heels, with almost no armor and their boobs bigger than their heads; here the female heroes have quite realistic bodies (like one guy said "hey, I noticed my XXX doesn't wear a bra!") and if they're supposed to be warriors, they wear a full plate (even my rogue wears a full leather)\n\nSo if you like MMOs, this one is definitely worth a shot. It has everything a "standard" one should have + some things from itself - and everything done really well.","March 25, 2015","true","725.9"," 106 of 130 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","106","130","9","0"

There are way to many microtransactions. If you are worried about the grind, don't worry. The game literally doesn't start until you are lvl 65. Everything before that is pretty much a tutorial.\n\nIs the game Pay2Win? Yes.\n2 Earring slots have to be paid for with real life money to be unlocked. It used to cost voidstone (One of the myriad of in game currencies) they took that away so they could take cash from their dwindling player base.\n\nOther features. They sell tier 2 gear on the market. People argue that this isn't p2w since T3 has to be earned. The time it takes to earn T2 is a tedious task. As I mentioned there are numerous currencies and notoriety you have to earn with also a bunch of different factions to even buy or use items. The grind for that is tedious, time consuming.\n\nNow that isn't bad, grinding and earning gear. That's what mmo's are about right? Except you spend weeks grinding out currencies because there are caps to upgrade ONE piece of gear. Here is a feel for how many pieces of gear that you can all separately upgrade. Helmet, cape, shoulder, chest, glove, legs, boots, 2 earrings, Neck, Trinket, 2 rings, Synergy Crystal, Seal, Planar Focus and 6 planar essences, two one handed/1 two handed and 1 offhand weapon. All of these require multiple upgrades, cost a VAST amount of in game currencies that is almost impossible to earn unless you have a credit card readily available.\nAnd the ongoing insult if cannot perform is “You’re a casual”. Which in itself is dumb. I understand mmo’s require time to get ahead. Yet in this game playing 20 hours a week isn’t enough. You will be left behind in the dust. 40 hours, you better be grinding the whole time. But I suppose non-casuals have played since launch, have been around long enough they already have all the p2w features that Trion has now implemented in their need for greed. So they don’t get the short hand of the stick.\nPVP\n… that sums it up honestly. Skill? Non-existent. The maps are neat, the queue times are fast and the idea sounds awesome. Pre-65 pvp doesn’t happen unless you like waiting around for hours for one to pop. The game is heavily, and I mean heavily gear dependent. Forget going into pvp thinking you have a chance. You will just be called a casual because you didn’t swipe your credit card before entering. Since pvp gear caps at about T2 you can buy T2 gear meaning you are good to go for pvp. A fully geared player vs some fresh 65’s could 1 v 5 and not drop below 90% That players skill could be average while the other 5 could be the best players on rift but now are in noob gear. Gear literally makes or breaks everything.\nConquest. Don’t bother max gear people just get in premades and walk all over pugs who attempt it. Open world pvp turns into a one sided match. Credit card vs non-credit card. Other factors are people who spent a lot of money on game get awesome boosts like fast mount time, faster mount speed through patron which plays into pvp when someone can cc you and run away and you will never catch up to them. (Very annoying and boring when you actually are winning a fight against team credit card).\nSo if I had to list pro’s and cons.\nPros:\n-	Pve is fun, boss fights are fun.\n-	Wardrobe is really sweet. All armor collected becomes unlocked as skins for free.\n-	Traveling around isn’t very expensive using the teleporters.\n-	Teaming as you level up isn’t bad. Can queue instant adventures, dungeons, and just join adventures who make their party public to share quest mobs.\nCons:\n-	Pay2Win: Buying Earrings.\n-	Gear grind defines your skill.\n-	Pvp is not fun unless you have gear. Give a toddler a remote detonator for a 50 megaton nuke, and an Adult who is in the Navy Seals a hammer and a one mile gap between that toddler. That defines pvp. The most skilled can get stomped on by those with better gear. Hammer vs Nuke. Who wins? *sigh*\n-	Hard to earn currencies, high currency requirements for upgrades, and weekly caps keep you from doing upgrades for weeks on end for one of your 25-26 pieces of gear.\n-	Cash Grabs, Cash shops. Taking away from players each update to create a paywall that forces you to buy patron.\n-	Getting a piece of gear and realizing you need Planewalker: Water. Apparently this zone was free which you can go there for free but you can’t even equip half the gear. It also drops in pvp and in dungeons and usually has nice stats for fresh 65’s.\n-	Game gets buggy, really laggy as well. I had some weird glyphdebugger come up that forced me to reinstall. I have had a few other friends and family also run into this where they couldn’t even play the game for the entire day. Sucks when you actually pay for patron and can’t even use it. Miss out on daily log in rewards and minion quests that you are trying to collect.\n\nIndifferent:\n-	I don’t mind that there is a cash shop. Selling new souls. (Another powerset tree for your class) That’s fine. They worked hard to create that, it’s an addition to the classes and as long as they aren’t some god mode autowin tree I am fine with it. Charging for some school girl outfit, or a katana is also fine. That is cosmetic. A mount, who cares? Other various features like that, that do not make one stronger or better is fine with me.\nIn the end.\nI don’t mind a company trying to make money. That’s what businesses are designed to do, if it works, sell it. Yet a business is also supposed to try to support its customers, and Trion doesn’t do that. They seem to want to walk all over their player base and then milk them for more money while making them grind for months on end for gear. So if you want to quit your job, stop going to school, leave your kids at the orphanage and become a recluse then this game is for you. Or you can use your credit card daily if you don’t have the time. Either way it’s a cash sink or a time grab. Game is fun, but with all of this…it isn’t.\n","May 4","false","549.3"," 75 of 88 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","75","88","7","2"

You can buy EVERYTHING for real money. Buying it for anything else takes a long ♥♥♥ time. You can buy boosts for everything: experience, money, currency collecting, artifact collecting, crafting experience, mounting speed, mount summoning speed...\n\nGetting from 1-60 takes about a few weeks, and getting from 60-65 takes just as long (if not longer).  Unless you buy and use those experience boosts (max time of 2 hrs).\n\nOnce you finally hit level 65, you find there's NOTHING you can do. You can't do raids, cuz you don't have enough gear. You can't do expert dungeons, cuz you don't have enough gear. The only things you can do are nightmare rifts and events, which net you a certain type of currency.\n\nCurrencies\nCurrency in this game is a way of saying "♥♥♥♥ YOU, give us money" by the designers. Basically, you get so god damned little currency from anything and gear costs so god damned much currency, it takes *literally* 3+ weeks to get a single peice of gear. I know what you're thinking: "Oh, he's just exaggerating when he says 3+ weeks. I can grind that out in a week." No. I mean literally 3 weeks. Take for example the chest peice for a cleric at level 65. It costs 21500 of a currency. When you're in the shop page looking at the chest peice, it displays how much of that currency you have in the bottom left of the window. When you mouse over that little currency, it says "You can gain x of y maximum this week." That y is 7000 for the chest peice currency. 21500 / 7000 = 3 with a remainder of 500. That's where I get 3+ weeks from. And trust me, it'll take you the ENTIRE damn week of grinding the same thing over and over again to gather the 7000 of that currency because you get so little from anything (~100 at a time). This is without mentioning that there's 40+ different currencies in this game, each currency gets you something different, from vanity items to gear to mounts to minions and so on.\n\nHowever, you can always buy this stuff for real money. That little button to buy things with real money is always directly to the right of the button to buy it for in-game currency. For the level 65 gear, it's ~30-40 dollars PER peice of gear.\n\nYes, MMO's are all about the grind. I don't mind grinding, as long as it's well balanced and takes a reasonable amount of time. For this game, it takes much longer than what I'd call reasonable.\n\nInventory and Professions\nInventory size becomes a problem within 10 minutes of playing the game. There are about a dozen different crafting ingredients per teir of each crafting profession. You start off with 4 bag slots, but you can buy up to, I think, 9 bag slots (for real money, of course). So, your inventory fills to the brim with just crafting ingredients almost instantly. If you ever plan on doing any profession, as you're leveling up, you want to keep those ingredients, but you don't know which ones to keep for which professions, so you end up keeping them all, and trust me, you'll need them. Unless you want to over-pay for them on the auction house later, or end up having to grind lower level mobs and areas for those ingredients.\n\nSo, all-in-all, if you plan on doing much without extreme annoyance, you'll end up spending $10+ for extra bag slots. For the bags themselves, you can craft most of them, buy them on the Auction House for an inordinate amount of money, or, of course, buy them for real money in the shop.\n\nThe bank has the exact same problem as the player's inventory, small amount of bag slots but you can buy more for real money.\n\nSkills\nSkills in this game are actually a positive. I like them. They're a litte bit complicated and are pretty unique for each class and each soul. Different combos are required to max dps, tanking capability, and healing capacity.\n\nThe basic rules are: use cheap skills and small cooldowns to power up your more expensive and powerful skills.\n\nEach class has a set of different souls. Each soul has a different role: tanking, damaging, healing, or supporting. After buying all the "soul packs" for the game, you can perform every role on every class. This is pretty awesome for me, because I like to pour all my time and effort into one character and eff the alts. I also like the freedom to choose any of the roles on my one class. This form of purchasing, I don't have a real problem with (as long as it's a reasonable price). You're buying base game functionality that they worked long and hard on, and it's permenantly unlocked for your account forever, not some peice of gear for 20 bucks that you'll have to replace in a week or a bag slot for a character to hold more useless junk.\n\nThe prices for the soul packs are reasonable, $20. However, in the most recent update, Into the Wilds, they added a whole new class, the Primalist. To buy JUST the primalist and his six souls, you'll have to shell out ~$45. And they've promised more souls for that class in the future, which I'm sure they'll market for another $20. It never ends with these people.\n\nIt was this last update that finally pushed me over the edge. Previously, I was defending this game to my friends, but now, I just can't. It's too much. Just damn ridiculous.\n\nDungeons\nDungeons in this game are pretty fun. They require some know-how and can be pretty challenging. The bosses don't just lie down and die, giving you free loot. Sometimes you have to CC the add, or silience the add, or kite the main boss. It requires actual strategy, not just tank 'n spank.\n\nRating\nThe only real con I can find with this game is the micro-transactions. However, they mess up EVERYTHING. Like every "Free to Play" game ever, they scew the balancing to favor those throwing money at it. The developers make it extremely tedious to do anything without spending real money so that it's more tempting to pay for it. I'd rather buy the game for $60, $40 for each expansion, and pay a $15 monthly for it and have it take a REASONABLE amount of time to gather resources, currencies, and gear with everything unlocked for me (bag slots, classes, souls, areas, etc).\n\nPlaying this game, you'll end up spending far more money than buying the game out-right with a $15 monthly OR you'll spend 4x as much time doing anything.\n\nOverall, I give this game a D-. It *can* be fun, but it just costs either too much money OR too much time to do anything. Neither of which I have in ample amounts. If you're either a teenager without a job giving you plenty of free time, or you're willing to throw hundreds of dollars away, then you'll enjoy this game. Otherwise, stay away from it, it's not worth your time and money.\n\nP.S.\nI did play WoW from the tail end of vanilla all the way to Cataclysm. If you want a comparison from WoW to Rift, this game is most like the Burning Crusade expansion of WoW (the best expansion in my opinion). Skills are semi-complicated, talent points give bonuses to skills, and dungeons require strategy. I could rant on for hours how Blizz ruined WoW, but I won't do that here.\n\nI will say, if Rift ever goes from free-to-play to buy the game, removing all micro-transactions and rebalancing currencies, I'd come back to this game in a heart-beat. However, I *seriously* doubt they will. So as it stands, I do not recommend this game.","October 9, 2015","false","227.3"," 202 of 308 people (66%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","66","202","308","19","21"

Its a fun game with alots of content to explorer in a massive open world with lots of events all day long.\n\nThe DLC's are very over priced and not really woth the money.\n\nThe in-game store allows you to buy any gear. If you want the best gear you could raid and get it your self, or just use your parents credit card. Gear is expensive so wouldn't recommand buying it with irl money. And whats the point of playing if you pay to unlock everything?\n\nLeveling is alot of fun since you can do alot of content befor max level. You're not stuck with questing untill you reach max level. However, leveling isnt going very fast, ofcourse not, its F2P. They want you to buy experiance potions.\n\nThis MMO is a great example of what an MMO is all about, teamplay. There are lots of open world events, rifts, dungeons, raids and adventures that requires a group in order to complete.\n\nPros:\n+F2P\n+You can scale your level to play with lower level friends. Just adjust your own level and you can play with then without having to create a new character. (Exp will scale to)\n+Good Graphics\n+You can have your own house/landscape\n+Great teamplay/group content (and public groups you can instandly join, no need to create your own)\n+Big open world with fun events 24/7\n+Not stuck with questing while leveling up\n+Tons of events with great rewards\n+Gear looks awesome\n+Possible to change appearance\n+Lots of in-game settings that would normaly requires addons\n+Addon support\n+Auto quest system (Kill a mob for the first time gains a quest)\n+Fun dungeons with bosses that actually require tactics\n+Your talents can make you either ranged, melee, DPS or healer with different ways. (Example: Cleric has: AoE ranged, single target ranged, AoE melee, single target melee, AoE healing, and so on...)\n+Some classes/rolls are really hard to play wich adds an extra challange if you find the game to easy.\n+Auto scale dungeons/adventures. If the dungeon is to high or low level for you, your gear and xp will scale so its woth the run anyway. The drops are still useless though.\n+Tanking mages\n+Tanking rogues\n+Healing rogues\n+Healing warriors... Sounds all very weird if you played World of Warcraft. "Ye, I'm a lvl 65 healing warrior".\n\nCons:\n-Poor spell effects, I dont really feel powerful as a level up\n-No story (Well, there is one, but its not really worth it)\n-Fairly slow leveling\n-No falling damage. Steel bones?\n-You can buy the best gear with irl money, if you are willing to pay for it.\n-Over priced DLC's that you dont need anyway\n-Some classes/rolls are much more powerfull then others\n-Not many classes to choose from\n-Bank got full very fast because of the minion quest system that gives me infinite dimension items for my landscape\n-Some rare mobs cannot be killed solo because they are to overpowered and require a small group. C'mon, we have world bosses for this.\n-Support class, of which i dont see the point. You could better have an Extra DPS that focuses on AoE damage then extra heals or buffs/debuffs..\n-To unlock some class/rolls/race, you need to pay irl money, but then again, its F2P and they need to make money some how.\n-Tanking mages requires irl money payment\n-Healing rogues requires irl money payment\n-Healing warriors requires irl money payment\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nIt's worth a try","August 2, 2015","true","161.7"," 69 of 96 people (72%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","72","69","96","11","2"

Anyways i remember you could buy Earring slots / Water plane equipment thingy with void stones and that was a great way for new people that didnt wanna invest real money get into raiding and other activities cause yes no one would take you without earrings unless they were a elite guild/group.Before there was no way you could buy any raid piece with credits , soon you will need credits to even click the '' Play '' button and ofcourse you can buy any Raid Tier gear piece that you are missing to get sooner into raids.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xaveth/recommended/39120/","Xaveth","Xaveth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xaveth/","12 products in account","After 1k+ hours of playing this game and what I've experienced nowadays as an endgame semi-hardcore player. I can no longer recommend it as the game starts to become downhill and the P2W aspects are rising up lately where it becomes unfair and unbalanced the progression paces with the F2P players simply because most of the powerful gears or BiS can be simply obtained through buying of "Gambling Lockboxes" or paying vast amounts of real money for their "Bundles". Although it's still possible to get them through working for currencies in order to buy them or raiding should you pursue PVE gearing or PVPing for vice versa. But it takes ages in order for you to get its desired full sets in order to advance on the next tier progressions. In conclusion, F2P's luck will matter more along the way to win their rolls on the dropped gear by the boss when raiding or in PUG PVPing is how competent your team is as long there isn't much bads it'll be better.\n\nOne absurd thing that I've noticed is that there will be a potion implemented to boost your character's level instantly into 60th, what a smart move Trion has done to let these payers SKIP MAJORITY of the contents of their game and just advance forward to the expansion...\n\nAlso, one critical aspect comes with "Expansion" souls (AKA Subclasses) which requires to be paid tends to be the most useful and becomes a requisition in certain purposes later should you do raiding or PVPing. Which will certainly influence a couple of F2P players to pay these in order to expand their performances of competence in more different ways (Expanding different builds).\n\nPVPing is broken at the moment  because each soul isn't completely balanced in its proper scalings. A Mage Pyromancer has the strongest ST DPS than the other callings' similar type of souls, a Rogue's Physician whom is an ST healer tends to be unkillable and can easily save its other teammate no matter how strong their opponent's DPS is. And most of the players doing PVP tend to be casual and cares only to finish their dailies with no intention of taking things seriously granted.\n\nThe customer service tends to be unsupportive as it takes a very long time depending on how well they'll care answering the players' concerns (Varying from a week to a couple of months), which will also end up having a generic response similar to what we'll hear from other companies. Therefore, you'll most likely find the answers for your concerns through the old threads on the forum.\n\nWith the new 3.0 expansion. It's even much worse than before. The new currencies have a capacity limit rather than its previous expansion where the currencies have unlimited capacity, and there is no way to remove the cap of new currencies. Also, their new "Earring" slots are locked and is beyond paywall which requires the F2Ps to farm tremendous amounts of currencies which takes around one whole month to farm that non-stop without resorting to the usage of boosts or patrons. This kind of business model they're doing is ramping up to tremendously waste your time to achieve this, and I'd say it's not worth it. Let alone paying them up which I think is around $20-25 is better despite you can earn that amount in less than a month.\n\nSame goes from the other things they have introduced. Such as the Planewalker: Water is the same way of unlocking the Earring slots. There are several amounts of new gears in the game that requires you to have this attunement, or you cannot equip them. Then the new factions which are extremely tough to level their notoriety when you're unbuffed, it's also the same as leveling up your character in that region. There is a couple of players who have completed everything in the three new zones (Main/Side Quests and Carnage), and they still ended up around the 63 or 64th level which is ridiculous.\n\nI'm very disappointed for what they have done in this game. Everything was just fine during Storm Legion. Until they made it much worse to change their business model to cater more in P2Ws than F2Ps. Their motto "No trials, no tricks, no traps" is becoming a lie except that the game is still free to play without trial periods.","October 12, 2014","false","296.7"," 269 of 433 people (62%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","62","269","433","18","6"

(Mind you, this took weeks. Granted, probably because we couldn't play all that much, but it took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever.) Eventually, our little group fell apart, me and my now ex parted ways, and our friend rushed to the level cap and got bored quite soon after. So, fast forward to when this game comes out on steam, and I try to reclaim my old account, thinking I'll give it another go for old times sake, because why not, right? Anywho, long and exceptionally boring story aside, Trion refused to give me back my old account, because I didn't have the CD code, or remember my old as hell password. Despite the fact that I had the name of the account, the credit card, and a bunch of other nonsense. So I tried making a new account, played it, got bored, stopped. And finally, and the last time I'll ever turn on this abortion of a once decent game, I bought the nightmare tide bundle, got the level fifty, and then realized the entire ♥♥♥♥ing expansion was a zone from Cataclysm. Never again rift, Never a♥♥♥♥ingain.","March 21","false","44.6"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","23","29","3","2"

Every class has the ability to switch roles, so you could be tanking in a dungeon one minute and doing solo quests as a DPS the next. MMO newbies can play with preset skill-trees to avoid being overwhelmed, whilst MMO veterans can tinker away with custom builds to their heart's content.\n\n- Dynamic zone events. You can be quietly questing in a zone, when suddenly, rifts open up spawning mobs and eventually, the event boss.  This encourages everyone in a zone to band together to close rifts and take down the boss, which is great fun.\n\n- How you choose to level up is really flexible. Do quests, instant adventures (kill/fetch quests with other players), zone events or dungeons.\n\n- RIFT is still actively being developed. Version 3.0 is due soon (end of Otober 2014)\n\n- Once you hit lvl 50, a new skill tree system (planar attunement) opens up, offering more customisation. A special set of dungeons (Chronicles) designed for 1-2 playes also becomes accessible from lvl 50+.\n\n- If want to try dungeons (designed for 5 players) but haven't got guild friends to join with, you can join a dungeon queue that will automatically match 5 random players together. (Note: the wait time depends on your role, it seems that tanks are in short supply, followed by healers)\n\nCons:\n- Quests can get a bit grindy sometimes; many are of the "collect 20 of .."  or "kill 12 of ..." variety. However, occasionally you do come across more fun/unusual/interesting/innovative quests, lifting the game above your standard MMO.\n\n- Some zones are not well optimized and FPS will suddenly drop from a smooth 60fps down to 20fps.\n\n- Free players can buy stuff from the auction house but can't sell (although there is a trade chat channel available). It is possible however to use in-game currency (plat) to buy something called REX that another player has paid for using real cash. The REX can be used to unlock the ability to sell in the auction house.\n\nRecommendation: If you want to experience the fun and familiarity of an MMO like Warcraft, but don't want to pay a monthly subscription, then RIFT will provide exactly what you are looking for. It is a well-designed, flexible game ... and did I mention it was free?","October 16, 2014","true","96.8"," 65 of 105 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","65","105","2","0"

EX: you need 4kish Void Stones to buy an upgrade component to upgrade your gear. It takes a while to get the Void Stones and it becomes rather grindy.\nIt's overall rather grindy. Grind raids, grind pvp, grind dungeons.. That's all max level is..\nGetting multiple characters geared takes a long time so your better off just having one main and not really playing the other classes.\nYou NEED to raid to get gear at high levels.. You need raid gear to tank the dungeon to get the raid gear.\nThe PvP maps get really stale after the hundreth time you've seen them and the dev's don't really seem to care.\nThere are only two conquest maps, and I really only see one anymore.\nThe dungeons are also very repeative and the low level dungeons become quickly tiresome.\nThey've tried to make instant adventures better but they still make you want to peel your skin off after an hour or two.\nAlso they aren't adding more free hairstyles. :(\n\nIt's a pretty ok game, just try to ignore how some of the races look when they run with weapons or swing their weapons.

(Like many I used the executable/patcher to launch outside of steam even after release. Until I had to reinstall when SL patching messed up, so... that piddly 1k is time after SL only.)\n\nRIFT 'was' an awesome game with good support and a REALLY awesome community. The game had alot of elements, which were in it, were going to be in it, some of which no other MMO's had at the time. In my eyes it was akin to an attempt at the 'Next Generation' of MMO.\nThe game evolved and grew over the first 2 years, it had it's share of bugs and problems, but they worked hard and got things sorted out quickly and fairly.\nThe problems started, when Trion or the development group decided to do an 'expansion', one huge bundle of content to put them far ahead and allow them to evolving the game without having to struggle so much to keep up (Atleast I thought that's why they did it...).\nFollowing this decision there was a major slowing of evolution/updates/content. It was expected, and yet it had bad results.\nDuring the 'Lull' in content, alot of players fell away and some guilds either merged or died out.\nWhen the 'Storm Legion' expansion finally came out, it did help revitalize the community 'somewhat', but with the 'X was the first to' seekers and the massive hunger resultant from the break in content, alot of new content got chewed through by some in a matter of days.\nAfter the initial burst of players, the population went back to, or maybe even more low than before, with even more guilds merging or dissolving.\nTrion decided then to re-vitalize the player base by going Free-to-play. (*Demise music plays)\n\nAbout 3 days after the game went FTP the general chat went from asking for an extra for a raid or new players asking for help to something akin to trolls vs gold spammers. Sure there was idle chat and such before, but nowhere near the same magnitude.\n...Going into a random when guildies are offline, meant having an overgeared party that doesn't know/use mechanics and ignores when told, won't use interrupts or help skills out of fear of DPS loss or who knows what and then rages at the healer when they die from their stupidity despite being over geared. Sure you get good parties too, but it went from more like 4/5 with 1 of the 4 being a 'learning' party, to 2/3 with 1 undergear, 1 overgear and 1 drop/lame, to like 1/6 with 1 being OP and playing right and 5/6 still being OP, but being macro only players who only do DPS and can't move or insist on having 1 only macro with built in 'dispel magic' type abilities and still stand still, both of which have primary skill called 'rage healer or tank and DC'.\n\nWell, PUGS always had atleast a small gamble element, and there were still plenty of 'good community'. A mature player might have to scroll through 50 lines of text to find a question and 'whisper' a new player to help, but the help was still there.\nI stayed for a while and played in some of the decent guilds, but even some of those had troubles from bad players joining and having to be kicked or just getting freebies then leaving. I know of many large kind/good/fun guilds that ended up moving to Badlands, Star Wars MMO's and who knows what else. (I think one even went back to WOW...)\n\nFTP has not wrecked the game. All the higher tier items and things are not buyable, and there is still some good guilds with nice/mature people in them around, so that raiding can still be fun. Sadly, although the FTP element has been implemented reasonably, I can ohonestly say the move has certainty affected the type of in-game community that's there unfavourably. I would not be surprised if the servers ended up reduced to only 1 or 2.\n\nSupport in the same boat as FTP hasn't wrecked the game or made it unplayable, but has certainly affected the community in a negative way.\nTrion changed the handling/personnel of the game around the time of the SL expansion (Not long after release I think it was...)\nThe original support was almost instantaneous in-game and up to 48 hrs outside of, and was very fair in checking logs and being strict but properly compensating and helping.\nThe support now seems more like 72hrs in-game and 1-2weeks outside of (I had patron status if that makes any difference -> AVID trader AH user/trader). And the support became more like talking to a telesales/outsourced helpdesk or the like where you couldn't even be sure if they even knew what the game was called, let alone help or not give 'bad robot' responses.\nThe first big event with a death boss was a good example of this. When I tried to get to the boss it was SO chunky and the game crashed about 2 mins after I finally got there. Sounds bad.... but Trion did patches and within a day or two the event was back up and running I got to participate with only minimal lag during the boss fight. Players were also compensated if they attended the initial event just incase they couldn't re-attend on short notice.\nFrom what I heard the last time a big crash occured recently in RIFT, they just rolled back the servers 6 days instead of fixing. :O I wasn't on at the time, but well... I can totally understand some of the angst that's there.\nIf your an original player who loved the game for having good support the current level will likely hit you like a truck full of concrete. Having said that, it doesn't wreck the game, but it sure doesn't make you wanna play/pay/support it.\n\nNew players be sure to try the game, it has lots of story and content to explore especially if you don't skip the lower levels.\n...For old players... RIFT is like any other thing in life that gets broken... it can never go back to the way things were. You either have to put up with the junk that goes with it or just leave it alone...","March 13, 2015","true","077.4"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","25","37","3","0"

This game doesn't really have a good first impression but once you get the feel of it, it gets addicting and can be a legitimite replacement for what ever MMO you are playing now. (WoW.. Cough.)\n\nIt has a unique class system that pulled me right away when I was playing in the beta. The balancing of the classes are mostly turned towards the PvE side of the game. PvP you ask?.. Well, PvP isn't Rift's strong suit... at all. While it can still be fun, the imbalances can make it frustrating and the enormous amount of 'bad' players can really make you bite your lip. I feel as though rift's PvP is more balanced for group play than solo. Also Facerolling is quite common, so it's best to bring a pre-made party.\n\nThe PvE side of this game though is exellent, it really makes you think what is the best spec for each situation you are in. Actually, the class system makes the game, it is very good. Once you are starting this game, it is wise to not stick to one build; make a TON of them and make the right spec you see fit to your tastes and works in your favor. There is a lot of things going on the map at all times. Rifts, are a key machanic which the name of the game implies. They pop randomly on the map and when you complete one you could get some wonderful goodies in return. An other cool thing are invasions that wonder across the map, making the game feel alive. But during an event, these invasions can get hairy and could literally conquer a whole area. Your quest hubs will be invaded and even main cities. This encourages group play which is very nice as well. You'll usually be grouped up automatically and fight against the baddies is some type of full blown war.\n\nSpeaking of wars, this game is pretty CPU intensive so big wars might make you lag, a lot. Any good mid ranged GPU will run this game well but don't skimp on the CPU, god help you if you don't.\n\nI would love to write more but I am pretty busy at the moment, it was nice to test this steam grading system out.\n\nPS: The ingame store is pretty nice, they put a lot of work into it. Also nothing in the store will give you SUPER MAX ENDGAME MEGA GEARZ. It's mostly costumes and funiture for your ingame home. The lockboxes don't have anything worthwhile inside, though it is good for gamblers or whatever.","December 3, 2013","true","339.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

You can't go wrong with free games. Get bored? Leave for as long as you want and come back whenever you want. You don't have to worry about paying for a month or so of game time when you only want to play for a day.\n-Thanks to Rift Exchanges, which people sell for in game money, you can buy everything including expansions without paying a single penny.\n-You can transfer characters between shards (servers) for free, but there is a limit to how many you can do in a week.\n-You can temporarily move the character you're playing to another shard without limit, though you will return once you log out of that character.\n-If you have no friends who play this that you can quest with, you can just join "instant adventures" which will automatically join you to a raid group. You will even be brought up or down to the level of the group's quests temporarily.\n-If you want to go back and do a certain dungeon but you're too high of a level to normally be in a group, the game will automatically bring you down to the level of that group.\n-This game is in no way pay to win. Everything you can buy you can earn the equivalent of. No one class is really better than another. Also like I said above, you can buy absolutely everything with in game money.\n\nCons:\n-Not a lot of people are low level so you might have a hard time finding a group in your level range, and it is very hard to find a group to do dungeons with.\n-That's about it.","October 8, 2015","true","190.3"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","20","30","2","0"

Wow what a mouthful) set in the plane of Telara, a typical Tolkienesque fantasy world with a twist.\n\nBoth playable factions are arguably good and arguably evil. The Guardians are religious and magic-centred, and despise the technological Defiants, whose machines they see as blasphemy. And this is where you come in; as an Ascended warrior, brought back from the dead to fight the corruption of the Dragons and the sinister Regulos, who want to destroy Telara to save the other planes.\n\nYou will be sent back in time in a Terminator-esque plot to stop the invasion of Telara when it starts - when the rifts came. Rifts are tears in the dimensional fabric of Telara that spew out monsters from other planes - and fun events where you fight waves of enemies falling from the sky. They're what makes RIFT what it is.\n\nWith low specs, lack of "pay to win" features, interesting story, and fun monster-fighting events, you'd think I'd recommend this game. Well... No. Most of the gameplay (not including rifts of course) is actually pretty dull. I would like to know what an Ascended warrior fighting against the game's equivalent of demons is doing picking mushrooms.\n\nI tried out the Autumn Harvest event, as I was bored with the regular gameplay. It was actually a bit of a disappointment - the usual dull grinding, except this time you're given the quests by a devil-like creature in a tiny orange clearing. I was hoping for a Hallowe'en themed rift.\n\nIn short, the game is for the most part dull grinding with few rewarding areas, although the Devs throw a lot of free stuff at players. I would not recommend using your hard drive space on this game unless you don't mind hours of mindless grinding.","November 18, 2015","false","61.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/recommended/39120/","melancholyrose","Mel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/","77 products in account","Grind Till Ya Drop\nOverviewAfter tapping both the "Yes" and "No" buttons several times in response to the question "Do you recommend this game?" I realized that I'm kind of indecisive about the whole thing. My view on it is completely torn down the middle. In some ways, Rift is incredible. In other ways, it's downright terrible. In the end, I find that "fifty percent" isn't enough to recommend the game. I have to say, sorry, but you should pass on this one. But don't leave without reading why I think so. There's a lot of ground to cover.\nBefore you comment on this, I reinstalled the game on the Glyph launcher and stopped playing it through Steam. It might not track my hours correctly, but I have been playing for about 3/4s of a year.\n\nWhat I liked about the game:1) RIFT borrows heavily from WoW, especially early iterations of it. The UI is the same, the cooldown and GCD system is exactly the same, the crafting, the queueing for dungeons and battlegrounds-- I'm sorry, "warfronts"-- the talent trees (again, this is more like early WoW, not the garbage "three choice blocks" WoW has nowadays), the combat, the classes, and even the stats each character needs is strikingly similar to WoW. If you've played WoW, you can pick up RIFT very easily.\n\n2) The talent trees are intuitive and creative, because they can be customized. You can have a build-your-own-spec based on three trees you can pick from and place points in. This makes for a very fun experience in creating your own class. Many of the best specs in the game were found by other players just messing around with the custom talent trees.\n\n3) There is something in the game called "Instant Adventures," a sort of endless barrage of instanced questing zones that you can enter with 20-something people. It's the dungeon instance 2.0, and works great. Well, while you're leveling, anyway. After you're max level, they're obsolete.\n\n4) The graphics are breathtaking and realistic. I definitely prefer it over WoW's cartoonish style.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game1) At first I thought to say "This game is well-populated" but then I forgot that only two servers really are. The rest are deadzones, especially the oceanic server. If you play in the UK... you will be forced to play on a North American server, in timezones opposite of you. That... sucks.\n\n1) At 65 (the current max level) the game sort of... halts. You will not be getting into raids very soon, and I can guarantee you that. You know why? Because you need a certain amount of "hit rating." This is RIFT's equivalent of "item level," except to an insanely unfair degree. The grind for gear is literally endless, and not at all fun. The methods to obtain gear may also be totally obscure to you when you ding 65, as it was for me. There is no set path to take. You might get gear by either winning warfronts (and no, you can not buy gear with the tokens you obtain from warfronts-- you have to get it from the box), or by doing what is called "Nightmare Tide Expert Dungeons" which are exactly that-- a nightmare. Neither of these things are the least bit fun to do, so naturally, it seems even worse when you're doing them just to upgrade gear.\n\nNow, when I say you might get gear, that's because gear isn't guaranteed to drop in the box you get for winning a warfront. You have a chance at it. And if you're like me, you will lose so many games that the chance at gear is even lower than average. I have so many unspent favor ("honor") points because none of it goes toward anything special. Apparently, people tell me that I will use them later to "upgrade" my new gear I get from the boxes from winning warfronts. And it takes tens of thousands of these tokens just to do that. And yes... you HAVE to upgrade them, because otherwise you won't have enough hit on your gear to do raids... or anything else. So even after you get the pieces you need, you still have to lose hundreds of warfronts, get tokens, upgrade all the pieces... it's awful. God awful.\n\nSo, you don't like to PvP? Okay! Do NTEs instead. And wipe constantly on bosses. When you finally do about twenty painful dungeons and get a piece of gear you need, you have to also upgrade THAT with tokens. But not with the PvP tokens. You need "fragments". These rare, coveted Fragments of Darkness and Fragments of Madness are mostly obtained through daily dungeons queues and months and months of weekly quests. I say you'll be doing them for months, because that's how long it'll take you just to upgrade a few pieces of your gear. It is the most sluggish, hellish, most boring end-game I've ever played in my life. It isn't even an "end game". It's just grinding gear. "End game" should imply being able to do things at the end of the game.\n\nBecause of this boring charade, most guilds are casual, because they're forced to be. There do exist raiding guilds, but progression is so slow that you never hear a thing about them.\n\nMore than one person in RIFT has explained this to me: "Trion Worlds made the grind so long because they want you to give up and shell out the dough to buy all of the gear for credits". At first I thought "that makes no sense," but now... it kind of does. You can buy gear with real money in RIFT-- for hundreds of dollars. No average-income Joe can just buy the gear and P2W because it's so expensive. But over months of time... an impatient person could very well buy the gear they need one piece at a time, and it all adds up. I already know a few people that dumped real money on gear pieces because the grind is so bad. I think what they're saying is true. It's all because of greed.\n\nAnd no... being a patron ("subscriber") does not help with this. You have to grind it out just as much as the freebies do. Which brings me to my next gripe:\n\n2) Patron status sucks. I get nothing for being a patron exect a crappy weekly "gift" (usually a trove box with junk in it worth nothing) and something called "affinity"-- yet another type of currency stacked upon the already massive mountain of currencies in the game. Affinity buys you mostly casual, cosmetic crap, and very few things that improve your character. Yes, patrons get bonuses toward mount speed and experience... but the increase isn't by very much, so it's not worth it. You also get "loyalty" for spending real money in the game. Loyalty also gives you mostly-cosmetic junk. No gear, though. Or anything else that might be useful.\n\n3) Notoriety ("reputation") grinds. Because having to grind out a faction's rep on top of grinding for gear and grinding for crafting mats adds to the fun!\n\n4) Dream orbs. You remember enchants in WoW? Okay, think of those, but only imagine they once in a while gave you a useless stat on your gear that means nothing to you, so that you're forced to sink hundreds of gold on them to get the stat you need. Sounds like crap, doesn't it? Well, that's because it is.\n\n5) Lockboxes and troves. Trion will dangle rare prizes in your face in hopes that you're stupid enough to drop a hundred bucks on these "limited editions troves" they release. They do that by showing you this sparkly, awesome mount that can be won inside. The chance at getting these mounts is extremely low. It's been tested a few times by people with even more time on their hands than I. You'd have to buy over a hundred boxes at five bucks a piece. Come to find out, people are stupid enough to buy these, so they keep making them. Keep it up, RIFTers. Keep being part of the problem.\n\n6) Plat is hard and slow to earn unless you spend real money on tradeable credits\n\nFinal Thoughts"Gear-grinding" is used as "game content" in place of real game content.","May 2","false","215.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","14","20","2","0"

They took what was good about WOW, and in some cases improved upon it.  Crafting/combat and professions are decent.  The lore and background writing are very good.  Questing isn't too much of a grind.  Graphics are quite good also.\n\nThe problem?  You can play for free, but it's tough.  Extra bank slots, etc. cost money.  You have to have credits/REX to purchase these things and boy do they make sure that EVERYTHING can be upgraded for a price.  You can buy REX with ingame money, but it takes a lot of platinum and that takes a lot of time to earn.  Now I got the monthly subscription for $15 a month.  Turns out it just gives you some perks that really aren't that helpful.   It does not increase your bank vault, etc.  You STILL have to buy credits to do that.  So the subscription is not really worth it.\n\nNow I could live with the cash shop mentality and just spend the $15 on credits rather than the subscription.  That would be the better choice in my opinion.  You're still getting a high quality game for your money.  The DLC's are another story though.  Drastically overpriced.  $150 for the Ultimate Nightmare edition?\n\nI played a character up to level 35 and was enjoying it, but the fact that nonPVP is not an option turns me off.  Getting constantly griefed by a 60+ over and over is not fun.  Especially since the server was touted as PVE/RP.   Apparently that makes no difference and every server is set up the same, no matter what it says.  I would happily pay for the game if I had the option to actually have a co-op role playing type experience, but sadly that's not available here.\n\nConclusion.   If you're looking for a mature, role-playing game to enjoy and not be all about who's the biggest imaginary badass, then this is not the game for you.\n\n\nP.S. The coarse and racist language on the chat is pretty bad.

The free to play system does not sway into pay to win, and actually overall has improved the quality of the game from when it was subscription based (I played for 4 months at release).  The graphics in the game are of high quality, but not to the point where it takes the rig of God to run it.  The environment is well done and captivating.  The soundscape is something I was very impressed with ...  from the music to the combat sounds to the dialogue (it isn't overloaded with dialogue thank god) it all sounds just right enough to help immerse you in the game.  The combat mechanics and skill trees have been very fine tuned since the initial release.  They have become quite a charm.  The about of talent customization you can have in this game is....jaw dropping and awesome - an MMO theory crafters dream come true (I happen to be one).

As in all RPGs, the player assumes the role of a character.\nIn RIFT, powerful rifts threaten the entire world as they rip into reality and release powerful forces that threaten to devastate all of Telara. New characters, events, treasures, and more are introduced with each breach and rift. The world is consistently changing around you and is dynamic.\n\nThe rifts have created divisions and schisms among the Telarans. Players are given the option to either seal the rifts forever or to use the power of the rifts in order to create their own power.\n\nThus, it is your choice to follow the one of the two rival factions, that, both want to save the world, but with their own unique way.\n\nGuardians are the chosen of Telara's gods, the Vigil. When the tyrant Aedraxis called forth the power of the Plane of Death and devastated Telara, the Vigil chose the most powerful souls taken by the Shade to be the archons of the next age. A golden age awaits, but Telara must first be saved — by deed, by example, or by the sword. Its people must be redeemed, its corruptors cleansed. Only then will the Guardians be imbued with the divine and ascend to a higher level.\n\nThe Defiant do not care whether the gods abandoned the world or not. To them, this entire planar convergence disaster is the gods' fault in the first place. Indeed, as soon as things went from bad to worse, the gods suddenly and inexplicably disappeared. Instead the defiants worship machines and technology.\n\nEnough with the lore, now onto gameplay. RIFT™ has both PvE (Player vs Environment) and PvP (Player vs Player) systems. In each mode, players attempt to uncover the secrets of the planes. The game also features an innovative new class system, called "The Ascended " that has limitless possibilities to build and advance your character. The player chooses a soul from one of the four callings: warrior, cleric, rogue or mage. These initial souls begin weak, though as the player progresses so does the soul. As these souls become more specialised, the player will be weaker in for example combat, but will gain magic strength. Players can later choose to augment, or even replace, embraced souls with other souls from within their calling. This is called "Soul Attunement".\n\nAs far as content go, I mentioned PvE And PvP content. PvE content consists of Dungeons, Raids, and - what else - Rifts. Rifts are a main feature in the game "Rift". Rifts appear first as tears in the fabric of Telara, and eventually fully open on their own. They can also be opened using a Planar Lure. Dungeons are instanced areas designed for a group of 5 players to complete. Players can create their own groups or find other players through the looking for group tool. Raids are instanced areas designed for groups of 10 or 20 players to complete. All raids are designed for level 65 (At the time of composing this) characters.\n\nPvP content consists of battlegrounds called Warfronts that are tiered by level, and conquest, a huge scale battlefront consisting of three factions striving to conquer the zone.","May 1, 2015","true","292.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I've tried other free-to-play MMOs (Tera to name one), but they felt really linear and they wern't structured that well (if that makes any sense). Not RIFT. This game has everything you'd expect from an MMO. Dungeons, various PVP battles, and (my favorite thing about RIFT) RIFT has A LOT of world wide random events that encourages every player to come together and conquor. RIFT is by no means a pay-to-win game either. Everyone has access to everything. The only limitations free-to-players have is only having two character slots, a currency cap of 2500 platinum (which is a lot), and not being allowed to create auctions (which may sound bad to some, but there's trade chats, no player-to-player trading restrictions, plus you can earn that privilage by buying REX from players with in game currency). I highly, hightly encourage you to at least try it.","November 25, 2013","true","130.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Don get me wrong WOW apart from the cartoonist graphics has put the bar way way high when it comes to game play and everything else. Problem is that after 7 years of gaming and a ton of money i decided i won't play games with a monthly subscription. I want either free to play games or just buy to play games. After wow it was so hard to find an MMORPG game and i was looking around for months trying all the free to play games or at least free to try games. I wanted a game with a great content , good community and game play like wow but with different elements and different if not better graphics.\nI found Rift and i tried it. At first it felt a bit strange compared to wow although very similar. I loved the graphics and the game play so i continued (It is free anyway so nothing to lose apart from some of my free time). The more i played the more i loved it until i fell in love with it. Overall it is a great game and it can be perfect. What i didn't like to the point that i can say i hate about it is   first the macro thing. I was used to play wow with just 3 to 5 keys where i had all my rotations. Here you can't do that .\nNow about the money. It is a fact that if you want the dlcs or the extra packs you have to pay alot money. This things are overpriced. It is also bad marketing. A gamer that respects himself won't pay that money. For example i see that the DLC is about 30 euro and the packs start from 25. If i am going to pay 30 Euro i am expecting not only few more classes. i am expecting a new race, at least 5 more lvls , and new content with at least 10 new dungeons and raids. a DLC or a PACK the way they are in rift shouldn't cost more than 9.99.\nTo tell you the truth they should be 4.99 . And guess what! The company would make more money like this cause almost everyone could and would buy then. More people would start the game and less people would quit. For 30 to 50 euro i am not expecting a pack or a DLC i am expecting a new game or at least a really good and huge expansion .\nSo as not to get me wrong or cheap .\nI am 41 and spending 50 or 100 or even more for my hobby is nothing but i am expecting equal value. Today i log in to steam feeling i want to spend  money on a new game or on an old one. This review came from a man that 9 months ago spent 4.000 euro for a new desktop pc and hotas joystick and pedals just to play Star Citizen. I am angry and sad about Rift because i love it and want to continue play it and see more people play it . In order to have that , The company has to start giving value back for the money they want. Content people !!! CONTENT, make the customers happy. Make things cheap so people will be happy to throw some money for value at you. Today as i sead i wanted to really spend some money in to Rift. Call it shopping therapy if you want, so i logged in to the store looking the DLC and the packs, comparing them looking at the price and the value i am gona get and i didn't buy anything because i was disappointed.\nI appreciate the fact that it is a free game and people especially younger people that don't have money to spend can enjoy the game up to a good point. I was more than happy to spend about 50 euro so far progressively as i was getting to know the game for things like earring slots, extra bug slots, extra char slots and staff. I was happy to give back to you in the form of money the enjoyment i was getting and i want to continue give you money. I mean 750 happy hours for 50 euro is nothing. Plz help me and give me reasons to give you more money. Revive the game, add meaning full contend and price it low so all that can pay will buy it. The rest wont anyway.\nMaybe i got it all wrong and you are progressively making content and soon more lvls and continents and dungeons and all that and that content will be for free and for everyone and in that case i am sorry cause i got it wrong but still for the 30 euros you could add a new race for example. Anyway Right or wrong i had to take everything out of my chest.\nOverall it is a great game and you know what ..now that i am thinking about it i feel alot better and will go back in to the steam store and find a way to spend money in Rift . It might be the DLC or a pack or in game currency as a thank you for everything i got for free so far. Maybe we the people with money to spend can help you keep it free for the people without money.","April 16","true","146.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

As of 3/1/2016 here is a simple guide to what content is locked and what isn't.\n\nNot Behind a Paywall\n-Main story line\n-Rifts\n-Zone Events\n-All zones and areas\n-Low level dungeons\n-Low level PvP\n\nBehind a Paywall\n-Dungeons (or all the fun ones, at least)\n-PvP warfronts (or all the fun ones)\n-Gear slots (no, im not kidding)\n-Raids\n-Auction house\n\n\nAsk yourself, would an MMO feel complete with no dungeons, PvP, raids, or auction house? I'd personally say no. Trion has been slowly pushing their fingers into the player's wallet, and as of recent its gotten out of control. I used to love this game, but when I saw that dungeons which I used to be able to participate were locked, and even gear slots which I willingly bought were unavailable to me because I wasn't a 'patron', I had enough of trino's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

The rift system is very similar to the public quests however they spawn randomly, are elementaly based, and tie into larger invasions where swarms of monsters wander around a map and it takes raids of people to clean it up! The class system is extremly open, there being 4 classes with each one having 8 diffrent trees (similar to a single tree in wow) that you can mix and match to have 3 trees at once. Healing mages, tanking rogues/clerics, an amazingly nice looking world, mixed with some top notch content for a new game. Once you reach lvl 20 is where the real pvp and instances begin, expect a new instance every 4 levels, then once you reach max lvl progress in heroic instances and raids, or work on lvling up your pvp rank. Rift is a fresh face in the mmo market and welcomly accepts the old style of plays into it, taking heavily form warhammer and wow but doing so with style and effect.","April 13, 2011","true","239.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sure, other things (like the dungeon experience imo) are better in WoW, but RIFT compensates with lots of really cool smaller features that add up quickly. For example, if you outlevel a dungeon/zone, but want to go back and grab the quests, you can set your 'mentored level' down, which essentially allows you to temporarily lower your character's level at will. Player housing is also present, and you can view other player's intricate designs on persistent leaderboards based on user votes.\nCombat is similar to other ability based RPGs, such as WoW, with the exception on the level of freedom that you get to design your own class. You can manually choose all your abilities from a set of about 10 talent trees (called 'souls') for each class, of which you can have 3 active at once. This means that almost every class can fill almost every role (DPS, tank, support, healer), and you can save your ability sets to allow you to change between roles on the fly (eg DPS → healer), giving each character a lot of versatility. Note that as this game is now free-to-play, some souls are locked behind a paywall, although at £15 if you shop around, it isn't too bad.\nMoving onto the game's implementation of free-to-play, you can easily complete the game (and the expansions – which are free to access) without paying anything, with all the in-game shop stuff being optional. If you do subscribe (£8.99/month last time I looked), you get the usual XP boosts etc that you would expect from a sub to a free MMO. A nice change however is the fact that the game was originally designed to b pay-to-play, so all the quests and story etc is scaled to those at 100% XP rate – subscribing just allows you to skip out parts as you see fit (and the XP boost can be toggled off). This is a nice change from other games like SWTOR, which feels like it's the subscribers that are getting the 100%, with the free players left at about 75%.\nOverall, it's a solid offering from Trion, which I feel is equal to, and better than is some cases, WoW.","May 21, 2015","true","11.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There have been some changes since the last time I have played and I think they are nice additions to the game. Ill be here honest when I first saw that I had a house I was kind of meh over it. 2 hours of organizing my house went by and I remember why I shouldn’t play games that let me collect things. It was surprisingly fun to play with the housing and I wonder why wow still doesn’t have something like this. The new rifts and zone events are very cool.

Rift also has several pre-built options for those who like to get in and play quickly. Beyond all of the systems in the game, the standard things about the game are also very well done. The audio is phenomenal, and the controls are pretty intuitive. Glitches are very infrequent, and minor anyway. Besides, the game is still fairly new so such things are to be expected. Leveling up in this game is not grindy at all. The game frequently keeps you on quests (storyline and otherwise) which level you up as you play the game, rarely (if ever) forcing you to pull off to the side for some time to just level up. The solo-play material is well-handled, as is the group-play material. Gameplay is mostly solid, and the freedom to progress however you wish is definitely a bonus. The quests could benefit from more variety – something Trion should keep in mind for future content updates – and the overarching story is easily lost beneath the endless strings of ‘Collect this!’ and ‘Kill those!’ If you go in expecting total originality, immediate disappointment is sure to follow, but spend some time with the game, and you’ll be impressed with what Trion has to offer. Rift breathes new life into the genre, restoring otherwise tired old concepts and proves success isn’t always built on originality.","August 15, 2014","true","57.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The Rifts are kinda cool, especially because they are a feature that is open to players of all levels.

Totally in house seems to create a game where you seemingly achieve nothing at all, just grinding away doing much the same things over and over and over again and the game environment showing nothing for your efforts.\nIt is hard to realise how much a solid story impacts Lord Of The RIngs online, until you spend time playing another MMO without a story, just activities seemingly done without purpose and leaving no result.\nInstead of playing through a story, you simply spend a whole game on empty side quests and instances.

The latter is probably also money related since it appears they have cut developer staff to the bone and they can't afford or choose not to invest further in the core engine.\n\nIt is free to play, so you can get a taste of it at little risk but not likely to be a long term game for anyone these days.","September 9, 2015","false","334.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkStorm/recommended/39120/","TheDarkStorm","๖ۣۜR3BORN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkStorm/","346 products in account","Having never played World of Warcraft makes comparing MMO's such as RIFT very difficult to do. As it stands, RIFT delivers an exceptionally well crafted world that's as diverse as it is gorgeous. Lore plays a huge part within RIFT's story, and content is implemented in such a way as to reduce incessant grinding of monsters to close level gaps, content gaps, etc. RIFT's biggest claim to fame currently is the players ability to have near complete control in class building, skill building, and content pathing. Any variety of class is up for grabs, and is subject to change if the player wishes it. The combat system in RIFT is nothing spectacular, but more of the same - such is the case with MMO's. The PvE content is a blast and is (in my humble opinion), what RIFT is really all about. PvP has it's place, but end content rewards just aren't up to par - as of yet (and really, I wouldn't even know). Trion, in the case of RIFT, certainly does not disappoint when it comes to quality content, updates, expansions, as they have been fairly consistent - and free.\n\nIn conclusion (speaking as one who's never touched WoW), RIFT both dazzles and amazes in terms of it's free content, the quality of said content, and Trion's willingness to keep the current demographic relatively happy.\n\nEDIT: RIFT has been charging steadily for certain beneficial upgrades like extra skill sets, class sets, and available number of equipable traits (such as foraging, mining, etc). While RIFT still maintains it's free to play philosophy, it has also been funneling players into purchasing certain upgrades such as the ability to swim in water while riding a mount, something which previously was denied players. Most definitely an easy method for a quick buck! Regardless, RIFT is still a much enjoyed title - even with it's slowly (again opinion), developing flaws.","November 27, 2013","true","638.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Bought the game in 2011 and quickly leveled a rogue soul to 50 back then, maxed crafting to 300.  At some point, got bored and quit and went on to other games as happens in this industry.  And then it surfaced as a "free to play" MMO in my Steam queue.  I'm so glad that it did.  I decided to check it out and I'm hooked all over again.\n\nJust a few bullet points for the returning players / original box set purchases on what you'll find:\n\n- All my characters were on the trial server.  Easily transferred to a "real" server.\n- If you purchased a box set back in the day, you've already unlocked some of stuff new players have to pay for.  Namely, a few extra character slots, auction house access, extra bag slots.  That was nice to find out.\n-  Graphics have been much improved.  I logged in once before this and thought, no way, graphics are too dated.  Well, at some point along the line, they did a major overhaul.  It looks nice.  Could still use some optimization, won't lie.  I had to bring my settings down some and my machine is not a slouch.  But neverthless, still looks good.\n\n\nHere's what they have added off the top of my head since I played:\n\n-  Instant Adventures:  Think instant raids that level you quickly and give you quick coin.  If you don't relish the thought of leveling all over again, this is the way to level up quickly.  It's also a way to get a "dungeon group" of sorts since noone really does the dungeons actually in the game anymore.  Scales to your level starting from level 10.\n-  Minions.  New collectibles that go out and run adventures for you and bring back loot.  Sort of a card game as well.\n-  Costumes.  Unlock costume items as you find them and now make your character look how you want no matter what he/she is actually wearing (I love this, won't lie).\n-  Diminsions - Housing essentially.  You get a personal house and your guild can purchase one.  You can purchase diminsion items to decorate and your minion can go on missions to find items as well.\n-  Chronicles / Planar attunement - Honestly, no idea yet since this is all stuff you do with your character post level 50 and I actually started a new character to refresh my memory on how to play this game again. :P  I have looked it up and it seems as if it's a way of customizing your character even further however.\n\nAt any rate, yes, the standard "pay" features are in this game as any:\n\n- Pay for extra soul walks or wait for a cool down.\n- Pay for extra bags\n- Pay for additional souls\n\nAnd so forth.  But they are not as obtrusive as other games.  And frankly, I've already purchased the $24.00 add on pack and might consider others in the future.  I like the game that much again.","September 22, 2015","true","257.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

It's a pretty good MMO and the story reminds me of an atheist vs theist world. Atheists had the power of science and theists were told by Gods to destroy this blasphemous technology. This severely weakens the fire power the people had, allowing for an evil force who resembles Satan named Regulos to nearly consume all of Telara. So atheists basically travel back in time 20 years to a Telara where the beginning of Rifts (It's like the Oblivion Gates) start appearing. As for guardians side, you're a theist that works under the Gods and dies defeating Regulos's shade. The Gods notice your power and ressurect you 20 years into the future where Regulos and the Rift holes start appearing because of your power. This is all given to you during the tutorial, which is not the main game and world of telara. Even after the tutorial, there is quite a steep learning curve and the game will continue to provide new hints, you can turn them off if you want, but I don't recommend it until you read them all at least once.\n\nNaturally, if you're in a PvP server, there is more heat between the guardians and defiants. There will be moments where you'll be thinking, "Will that guy attack me or not?" And you're waiting for them to respond and see that they think the same thing as well. Definitely adds more tension into the game. PvE enviroment is a lot more casual, so the game works well for both casual and hardcore players of the MMO genre.\n\nYou also get to have your own dimension, which acts like a house and can be decorated. Adds a little bit more to the roleplay if that is your thing.","February 15, 2014","true","17.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotharaxe/recommended/39120/","lotharaxe","Lothar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotharaxe/","36 products in account","Rift carries a D&D style with not so nicely aesthetic characters, tending to more realistic and practical designs, also bringing a few of the usual races of the popular TTRPG system with your classic "lots of races that are pretty much human" like elves, dwarves, humans and similar variations. Even though that's not it's best point (if you don't like it that is), the game truly shines on what really matters for a MMORPG: Gameplay, Customization and Lore.\n\nGameplay-wise Rift doesn't rise above most of the titles of the genre, having at least a proper responsive point-and-click combat that feels just right. It is in Customization that this game sells it's name, mostly in Class customization, since it allows your character to freely choose 3 from 8 or 9 (maybe more) talent trees that will both decide skills and passive abilities of your character. Reseting such skills is free of real money charge, so switching builds freely will be pretty much your joy in this game, and something you will wish to have in any title you come across after playing Rift. Character-looks-customization-wise, the game simply offers an equipment look tab that allows you to equip anything you have on it, disabling the equipment stats but prioritizing its looks over the equipment in the normal tab. Simple, practical, effective: Awesome.\nLore-wise this game shines probably just like WoW or D&D, it's deep with all kinds of stories in loading screens, NPCs, quests, books to read through the game that can be collected, collectables with stories that become prizes and other things, the game is huge and clearly RP friendly.\n\nIf I recommend this game? This is a seriously well built MMORPG, for both a game and for a MMORPG. If you like the genre and don't necessarily want inovation but something just well done, get in just now, it's also free!","March 10, 2015","true","52.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

(Many areas are underwater, you'll drown without the expansion.) When you do see the later levels it's wonderful... *UNTIL* you hit max level, then there is a huge gap in gear, with no in game solution, that will prevent you from progressing... unless you spend at least £20 on some store gear. These are not huge sums and perhaps this is not a huge issue, but it feels disingenuous for a 'free to play' game that constantly promotes it's products in game.\n\nOverall, after many hours of fun, you start to feel that the developers have a hand on your wallet just waiting on your word to remove cash.

You can change servers and recustomize your character (Excluding gender / race change) without having to pay real money. Changing servers is free, but recustomizing your character is expensive. (In game currency.)\n\n-Only 4 classes, but many different souls (Specializations) to choose from, and can have 3 souls active at a time. You can play your character however you want to.\n\n-PvP is fun in my opinion. Kind of reminds me of Unreal Tournament / Quake in the sense that it has an announcer that will announce events. "First Blood" "Killing Spree" "Unstoppable" etc. I found that pretty cool.\n\n-Has an in-game video recorder, which is a first for MMOs. However, it does not record sound last I checked. Not for me anyway.\n\n-UI Customization is good, you aren't too limited in that regard.\n\n-Average playerbase is usually friendly and helpful.\n\n-Can be played even on very bad computers. (Obviously your experience may not be ideal, but you should generally be able to play the game.)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons: Only 6 races. 3 per faction. 4 of which are literally copy, pasted, and reskinned. There are only 2 unique races. Bahmi and Dwarves.\n\n-Game is not incredibly populated.\n\n-Only a few servers that I know of that have a decent playerbase, the rest are dead. For lack of a better word, the questing is, what I'd call, corridor questing. There aren't multiple same-level zones to choose from, should you decide you don't want to play in a certain. You have to level in a line of questing areas. No choice.\n\n(No more cons come to mind at the moment.)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere's more that can be said, but overall I enjoyed the game. It's certainly not bad by any means. It'd be better if it was more popular and had at least 1 more race for each faction that wasn't copy / pasted. If you get this game, it's certainly not a bad idea to bring a friend. I'd give this game a 7/10. It is subscription based. $15 per month. With new accounts, when you subscribe and set up a payment plan, your first month is free. (Your monthly billing will begin on the second month.)","February 27, 2013","true","342.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is Amazing. Very good graphics, the combat mechanic is great. Rift is the best MMO I have played ever! You are taken to the world of Telera in hopes to start the ultimate evil- Regulos and the dragons. The characters are immersive-because of the character creation setup. There are 4 classes Warrior Rogue Mage and Cleric. When I saw this though, I thought aww thats not enough. But what I didn't know was that there are these subclasses called Souls that can further increase and specify the gameplay that you want. I have played for about 2 days and I am already level 23.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProbablyABigDealSomewhere/recommended/39120/","ProbablyABigDealSomewhere","Monster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProbablyABigDealSomewhere/","381 products in account","Pros: Easy to pick up and learn; has many similarities with other popular MMOs. You can change servers and recustomize your character (Excluding gender / race change) without having to pay real money. Changing servers is free, but recustomizing your character is expensive. (In game currency.)\n\n-Only 4 classes, but many different souls (Specializations) to choose from, and can have 3 souls active at a time. You can play your character however you want to.\n\n-PvP is fun in my opinion. Kind of reminds me of Unreal Tournament / Quake in the sense that it has an announcer that will announce events. "First Blood" "Killing Spree" "Unstoppable" etc. I found that pretty cool.\n\n-Has an in-game video recorder, which is a first for MMOs. However, it does not record sound last I checked. Not for me anyway.\n\n-UI Customization is good, you aren't too limited in that regard.\n\n-Average playerbase is usually friendly and helpful.\n\n-Can be played even on very bad computers. (Obviously your experience may not be ideal, but you should generally be able to play the game.)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons: Only 6 races. 3 per faction. 4 of which are literally copy, pasted, and reskinned. There are only 2 unique races. Bahmi and Dwarves.\n\n-Game is not incredibly populated.\n\n-Only a few servers that I know of that have a decent playerbase, the rest are dead. For lack of a better word, the questing is, what I'd call, corridor questing. There aren't multiple same-level zones to choose from, should you decide you don't want to play in a certain. You have to level in a line of questing areas. No choice.\n\n(No more cons come to mind at the moment.)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere's more that can be said, but overall I enjoyed the game. It's certainly not bad by any means. It'd be better if it was more popular and had at least 1 more race for each faction that wasn't copy / pasted. If you get this game, it's certainly not a bad idea to bring a friend. I'd give this game a 7/10. It is subscription based. $15 per month. With new accounts, when you subscribe and set up a payment plan, your first month is free. (Your monthly billing will begin on the second month.)","February 27, 2013","true","342.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can click on the base of any one of the three soul trees and swap it with like, another 5 possibilities, effectively making 8 skill trees available to your class, and endless combinations of 3. One issue I have so far is that I appear not to be able to sell anything to vendors that isn't gray. This is rather annoying and doesn't make sense.

So on my hotbar I have this macro that casts all my various buffs and armors that I'll hit every so often to make sure they're refreshed and active at all times. First command in the macro - use S'mores. Every time the effect of my S'mores is about to run out I just hit the key for my macro, happens to be 2, and the effect is refreshed. I am a bunny FOREVER. Infinibunny.\n\nSo I go fight mobs and stuff, blah blah blah, and it's funny because people will actually stop and look and act confused because here's this bunny being followed by another bunny and it's hurling fireballs at people (I'm a Pyromancer/Elementalist thingy and yes, you can use all your abilities WHILE BEING A BUNNY). My character's name is even Bunnychu (it had been just "Bunny" but I had to change it when I transferred servers, sad :/) so I think this adds to the effect. The whole thing is marvelous.\n\nMy human form is cool too because I have purple pigtail braids and I dye all my clothes purple (I'm very particular about my outfits and which clothing I want to be shown wearing) so I look pretty cute but who doesn't want to be an INFINIBUNNY that THROWS FIREBALLS and CONFUSES PEOPLE?\n\nThis game is fantastic.","October 29, 2013","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are fixes and such usually every wenesday (as far as a holiday schedule I have no idea).\n\nCons: Without proper knowledge of an MMO or its key bindings, mappings, or any of the different attributes that follow, new players may have difficulty with leveling or succeding where they would know should there a technical "partner" to be with them.

For example there are 4 classes and each class has 8 different skill trees(Reffered to as Soul Trees) for different play styles and each skill/soul tree is like a subclass.\nCLERIC SUBCLASSES:\n\nCABALIST- The Cabalist is an offensive Cleric who draws on powers that others fear. Using ritual and sigil to call forth seeping death and suffocating water, he devastates the battlefield with powerful attacks that catch all of his enemies in his grip\nDRUID- Druids are melee Clerics who forge bonds with Fae creatures, strengthening their bodies, minds, and spirits by drawing upon the magical energies of their companions.\nINQUISITOR- The Inquisitor is a cleric who no longer follows the doctrines of life or death alone; instead, they stand between these forces demanding purity from both. An Inquisitor passes judgment on those who are worthy, and damns those who are corrupt.\nJUSTICAR- Justicars are healing clerics who fight shoulder-to-shoulder with their allies in close combat. Conviction builds with each swing of their weapon, bolstering nearby comrades and powering the Justicar’s potent healing magic.\nPURIFIER- These Clerics draw upon a pact with their long-dead ancestors as the source of their offensive power. While Purifiers wreathe their allies in flames, they can unleash a spirit vanguard to visit wrath upon their foes.\nSENTINEL- The Sentinel brings the blessings of light to all who do the will of the gods. Capable of healing many wounded at one time, Sentinels bolster their allies and protect themselves with divine wrath.\nSHAMAN- The Shaman binds the power of the icy north to his very being, wreathing himself in pure elemental force. This power augments a Shaman’s attacks, making him a powerful melee combatant, and provides shields and reactive healing.\nWARDEN- Echoing the soothing ebb and flow of the tides, Wardens specialize in slow healing that escalates over time, making them ideal for prolonged fights that would exhaust most healers.\nMAGE SUBCLASSES:\n\nARCHON- Archons are support specialists who steal their opponents’ strength and convert that raw energy into beneficial magic. These mages bolster their allies and unleash potent kinetic blasts, quickly turning the tide of battle.\nCHLOROMANCER- The Chloromancer is a healing specialist who draws on the vital energies of plants and nature to find a balance between life and death. They harness these energies into a devastating force, or recycle destructive magic to heal their allies.\nDONINATOR- The Dominator is a support Mage who terrorizes opponents, leaving them unable or unwilling to act. Those who muster the courage to assault a Dominator will find themselves at the mercy of arcane shields that turn the fury of their own blows against them.\nELEMENTALIST- Elementalists are mages who specialize in manipulating and controlling the raw energies of the planes. Through fierce discipline and strict study, these mages dedicate themselves to commanding the harshest and most chaotic forces known to exist.\nNECROMANCER- Necromancers are damage dealers who synergize with their pets. The majority of a Necromancer’s damage comes from a fully supported and buffed pet. In an emergency, Necromancers can also serve as secondary healers by sacrificing their own health to their allies.\nPYROMANCER- Pyromancers are destructive mages whose sole focus is the mastery of fire, from launching massive incinerating blasts, to trapping their opponents behind a smoldering wall of flame. No other Ascended can match the sheer destruction at the Pyromancer’s fingertips.\nSTORMCALLER- Stormcallers are mages who channel the raw fury of the wind and water to command the battlefield, chilling their opponents to the bone or stopping their hearts with electric shock.\nWARLOCK- Consummate practitioners of the dark arts, Warlocks embrace the grim forces of entropy and death. Protected within a cloak of shadows, they lurk on the edges of the conflict, as their deadly energies inevitably consume all that stand in their way.\nROUGE SUBCLASSES:\n\nASSASSIN- Masters of subtlety and subterfuge, an Assassin’s ability to walk in the shadows allows them to bypass obstacles and launch devastating surprise attacks. A rare few survive the initial assault, only to succumb to virulent poisons.\nBARD- Singing the songs of battle and playing heart-stirring cadences, Bards embolden their allies and cripple their enemies through rhythm and rhyme.\nBLADEDANCER- Blade Dancers are masters of wielding edged weapons. They specialize in ritualized combat movements that are lightning fast. Blade Dancers can overwhelm even an accomplished opponent's defenses, setting them up for a devastating coup de grace.\nMARKSMEN- Marksmen are offensive sharpshooters trained to thin enemy ranks with ruthless efficiency. They combine swift hit-and-run attacks with devastating volleys, endlessly harassing targets, sowing the battlefield with dead and crippled foes.\nNIGHTBLADE- Possessing deadly agility and mastery of the blade, the Nightblade can also draw upon the planar magics of fire and death to deal doom in a variety of ways. Favoring light armor, their ability to stalk and quickly eliminate their adversaries means the unfortunate quarry rarely has the chance to defend, let alone counterattack.\nRANGER- Rangers are consummate hunters who know the strengths and weaknesses of every beast, taming animal companions to augment their considerable prowess in ranged combat. This synergy between bow and beast allows Rangers to handily overcome the most daunting obstacles.\nRIFSTALKER- The Riftstalker is a defensive specialist who bends the planes to enhance his constitution and shift in and out of the physical dimension. These highly skilled and survivable combatants keep their opponents’ focus while easily evading incoming blows.\nSABOTEUR- The Saboteur is a cunning Rogue who uses explosives and other incendiaries to cripple opponents and control the battlefield. With proper preparation, a Saboteur can destroy enemies without ever giving them a chance to join battle.\nWARRIOR SUBCLASSES:\n\nBEASTMASTER- This Warrior's journey begins by bonding to a spirit companion. The spirit beast fights beside the Beastmaster with speed and strength and sees him through his darkest trials.\nCHAMPION- Champions are powerful Warriors who excel at melee combat. Wielding massive two-handed weapons, these battle-tested fighters find few equals in one-on-one battle. Champions strive to become one with their blade, constantly honing their fighting skills to win glory through warfare.\nPALADIN- Righteous defenders of the weak, Paladins use heavy shields and divine blessings to stand as a bulwark against their foes. The Paladin’s large shield not only offers protection, but affords many opportunities to launch devastating counters in close combat.\nPARAGON- The Paragon moves like a furious storm, never giving his enemy time to regroup. A master of dual-wielding, he uses parries and disciplined forms to build up power attacks and stay out of danger.\nREAVER- Reavers are warriors who combine the art of combat with the entropic energies of death. The slightest touch of their weapon can spread disease, incite madness, and death to those unlucky enough to face them.\nRIFTBLADE- Riftblades are Warriors who learn to enhance their attacks with elemental magic, allowing them to cast bolts of force across the battlefield and strike with boundless energies.\nVOIDNIGHT- The Void Knight is a defensive Warrior who uses eldritch techniques to counter magic-wielding foes. Spells that would bring another Warrior low are shaken off by a Void Knight, reflected back at the caster, or stored in pacts the Void Knight can unleash to devastating effect.\nWARLORD-A Warlord’s commanding presence expresses itself in auras that inspire her comrades to victory and cow her enemies into submission, allowing her to control the field of battle.\n8.5/10 Great!","November 19, 2013","true","129.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Talzoor/recommended/39120/","Talzoor","Talzor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Talzoor/","32 products in account","This game is Riftastic.\n\nGamplay: 8.5 of 10\nGraphics: 8.5 of 10\nSound/Atmosphere:  9 of 10\nCommunity: 7 of 10\nEnd Game/Replay Value: 9 of 10\n\nDon't let my play time fool you, I have 3 characters lvl 60 and 1 with top gear (I just reinstalled my game on steam).\n\nI don't know what made me play Rift at first.\n\nWarhammer Online was dying and I found myselt not having as much time for MMORPGs.\n\nI tried SWTOR my first F2P, it was okay but the end game didn't grab me.\n\nSo as a last attempt I switched over to RIFT. Tired of leveling up and going through the questing stuff I mainly stuck to the pvp.\n\nAfter a day or so of learning the soul system I realized that you can customize your character in an incredible amout of ways! You get four starting classes: Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Mage. but you can customize them anyway you want, for example: tired of healing on your cleric and want to be a Tank instead? Just once flick of a button and all your skills (plus quickbars) change to reflect your role change.\n\nReally refreshing, I use the role change constantly and I see others do so as well.\n\nThe game is kinda your standard MMORPG with quests and leveling, the story is pretty cool as well as the dungeons and bosses. They are hard, but not too hard.\n\nLots of floating rocks and invading monsters to kill.\n\nTwoards the end of the game you join conquest, a massive free for all capture the node type game. The more you play it the more perks you earn, yet if you stop playing you will lose those perks as they degrade overtime.\n\nI play on the PVP server and it is active, people tell me that the other servers are doing good as well.\n\nThe servers allow for cross queuing, which cuts down drastically on wait times for dungeons and pvp warfronts.\n\nThe games difficulty revolves around mastering the soul system, you get 3 souls to chose from and a limited amount of abilities from each soul.\n\nFinding the right combination can be the difference of being OP and average.\n\nMy advice: Don't just listen to people in-game/forums, test out your own abilities and do your own trial and error.\n\nFor instance, people told me not to make a rouge/ranger as they are "useless" well that just motivated me to make one even more.\n\nGranted my ranger isn't powerful one on one, but in a group or duing a Warfront I can easily get top dps and I notice the support my character brings.\n\nCons:\n\nAfter playing Warhammer Online I was spoiled with a good tank class that mattered (in pvp and pve). Since then no other game can seem to get it right.\n\nWhich mean's RIFT is basically a game of DPS and Healer (maybe support if you know how to do it properly).\n\nThis makes the game a tad bit bland but never boring.\n\nOver Powered (OP) Classes - (happens in every game) but be prepared to see an over abunence of Mage:Pyro, Warrior:Tempest, Rogue:Assassin.\n\nF2P - I understand Trion has to make money somehow but they do charge you for extra bag space. Granted I never needed it but if you want to craft or do something which requires lot of bag/vault space be prepared to fork over money.\n\nIt's not pay to win (P2W), you don't need to pay to be the best in the game. Paying just really helps you get more powerful in a shorter amount of time. Like for a redicilous amount of money you could buy all the top tier armors/weapons but can also earn those items the normal way by grinding.\n\nAll in all it's a very good game, they update often and I'm glad I found it.\n\nOverall Rift gets a 8 out of 10\n\nTalzor/Lafixer PvP server lvl 60 Cleric/Rogue","January 2, 2014","true","164.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The quests are your standard kill these or collect this. However, Rift features many other things to do practically right from the start.\n\nClosing rifts - Randomly spawning rifts that have several waves of mobs that must be defeated, each a little stronger. Best done with a group but can be soloed. Some good xp and loot from doing these.\n\nInstant Adventures (starting at level 10 I believe) - Go into an instant adventure and get put into a group all working towards completing the different quests culminating in a big boss that is best done with a raid. Great for taking a break from quest grinding and earning some good xp, in-game money, and loot.\n\nI have not tried PVP yet but I have heard it is good.\n\nThe part I appreciated the most is that as soon as you have the coin you can buy a mount. Big relief not to have to run everywhere.\n\nThe professions are your standard gather/crafting and need to be leveled and new recipes purchased.\n\nThis is a free to play game and quite honestly one can play and not have to pay anything. However, until a real money purchase is made the Auction House is locked to sales and the amount of coin held on a character is capped. I believe a small purchase of only $5 will unlock these but since I have yet to purchase anything I'm not sure. This is not a pay to win type of game. You can get boosts, open up bag and character slots, purchase vanity items and mounts but nothing looks like it will give you an edge over free players.","January 27, 2014","true","148.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Forced Conquest kinda sucks and it seems to be fairly random when they start as it can be over an hour wait to get into one.\n\nSome other complaints are the lack of end game content; also seperation of gear from PVE and PVP; you will need 2 sets at high level.. and even more if you play different roles. Conquest has TERRIBLE FPS(im talking 10-15 at lowest settings if that) and i would consider this to be a mid-high end pc.

It has all the trappings of familiar mmos, yet brings its own distinctive flavor to the table. Rift has a wonderful storyline and is great for an RPer, because they'll be able to add their own story easily into the lore. Rift also has a variety of ways to level up characters without become too boring and repetitive. Like many other mmos, yes there is a rep grind to get the better gear, but there are many ways to actually do the grind.\n\nRift recently went free to play and has an honest f2p system. The game isn't p2win at all. F2players are able to play with minimal difference from the subscribers. If you're looking for a challenge, this is definitely something to try.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Raids, instances, pvp, instant adventures. Chronicles: 1-2 people instances.\n2. Collections to search for during the leveling process.\n3. Dimensions: aka player housing!\n4. Really robust dimension decorating system.\n5. Great crafting system.\n6. Easy to understand leveling system.\n7. Myriad of classes and class trees.\n8. Great community\n9. 6 races to choose from\n10. Frequent updates\n11. Fully customizable ui\n12. Minmal addons required\n13. The game is geographically HUGE.\n\nCons:\n1. talent trees are a little tricky at first, but luckily the game comes with premade builds\n2. Aoe can be a bit hard to see at first, adjust graphics accordingly.\n3. Will need a bit of a higher end computer to play at full glorious detail.\n4. This is one of those games where having a supportive guild can really make or break it for you.\n5. Instances/heroic instances are accessable to all, however raids are usually ran by guilds.\n6. It can be a bit much to learn at first.","December 26, 2013","true","068.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Forced Conquest kinda sucks and it seems to be fairly random when they start as it can be over an hour wait to get into one.\n\nSome other complaints are the lack of end game content; also seperation of gear from PVE and PVP; you will need 2 sets at high level.. and even more if you play different roles. Conquest has TERRIBLE FPS(im talking 10-15 at lowest settings if that) and i would consider this to be a mid-high end pc. I5 3770K 16gb ram. sapphire radeon hd7870. granted it is 40v40v40 so there is alot going on.\n\notherthan conquest it runs maxxed out on ultra at 60+ frames and looks pretty good in my opinion.\n\nat the end of the day; it was a good experience and definately worth the ~25 dollars I put into it. (you can easily spend zero)","January 27, 2014","true","145.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What Rift has going for it is it's familiar, yet you never feel like a mundane, simple mortal or weakling: from the very start you're an ascended, and you feel powerful.\n\nThe skills are colorful and visually appealing, and feel satisfying. Your class is determined by 3 souls (similar to WoW's specializations), only you can mix and match any 3 out of 8 that you can unlock total (plus there's a PvP soul you can also unlock.) In short, this gives you acces to a lot of skills and the freedom to pick and choose your most significant ones (much like in Guild Wars) .\n\nLeveling is quick. Quests are clustered together and never take long (a slight grind that is far faster than it ever was in WoW), yet in addition Rifts will pop up, sometimes even invasions, which players are eager to pop up and seal off due to the large amounts of rewards and XP.\n\nGreat MMO.","July 27, 2011","true","78.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But what I didn't know was that there are these subclasses called Souls that can further increase and specify the gameplay that you want. I have played for about 2 days and I am already level 23.

The quests are your standard kill these or collect this. However, Rift features many other things to do practically right from the start.\n\nClosing rifts - Randomly spawning rifts that have several waves of mobs that must be defeated, each a little stronger. Best done with a group but can be soloed. Some good xp and loot from doing these.\n\nInstant Adventures (starting at level 10 I believe) - Go into an instant adventure and get put into a group all working towards completing the different quests culminating in a big boss that is best done with a raid. Great for taking a break from quest grinding and earning some good xp, in-game money, and loot.\n\nI have not tried PVP yet but I have heard it is good.\n\nThe part I appreciated the most is that as soon as you have the coin you can buy a mount. Big relief not to have to run everywhere.\n\nThe professions are your standard gather/crafting and need to be leveled and new recipes purchased.\n\nThis is a free to play game and quite honestly one can play and not have to pay anything. However, until a real money purchase is made the Auction House is locked to sales and the amount of coin held on a character is capped. I believe a small purchase of only $5 will unlock these but since I have yet to purchase anything I'm not sure. This is not a pay to win type of game. You can get boosts, open up bag and character slots, purchase vanity items and mounts but nothing looks like it will give you an edge over free players.","January 27, 2014","true","148.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example there are 4 classes and each class has 8 different skill trees(Reffered to as Soul Trees) for different play styles and each skill/soul tree is like a subclass.\nCLERIC SUBCLASSES:\n\nCABALIST- The Cabalist is an offensive Cleric who draws on powers that others fear. Using ritual and sigil to call forth seeping death and suffocating water, he devastates the battlefield with powerful attacks that catch all of his enemies in his grip\nDRUID- Druids are melee Clerics who forge bonds with Fae creatures, strengthening their bodies, minds, and spirits by drawing upon the magical energies of their companions.\nINQUISITOR- The Inquisitor is a cleric who no longer follows the doctrines of life or death alone; instead, they stand between these forces demanding purity from both. An Inquisitor passes judgment on those who are worthy, and damns those who are corrupt.\nJUSTICAR- Justicars are healing clerics who fight shoulder-to-shoulder with their allies in close combat. Conviction builds with each swing of their weapon, bolstering nearby comrades and powering the Justicar’s potent healing magic.\nPURIFIER- These Clerics draw upon a pact with their long-dead ancestors as the source of their offensive power. While Purifiers wreathe their allies in flames, they can unleash a spirit vanguard to visit wrath upon their foes.\nSENTINEL- The Sentinel brings the blessings of light to all who do the will of the gods. Capable of healing many wounded at one time, Sentinels bolster their allies and protect themselves with divine wrath.\nSHAMAN- The Shaman binds the power of the icy north to his very being, wreathing himself in pure elemental force. This power augments a Shaman’s attacks, making him a powerful melee combatant, and provides shields and reactive healing.\nWARDEN- Echoing the soothing ebb and flow of the tides, Wardens specialize in slow healing that escalates over time, making them ideal for prolonged fights that would exhaust most healers.\nMAGE SUBCLASSES:\n\nARCHON- Archons are support specialists who steal their opponents’ strength and convert that raw energy into beneficial magic. These mages bolster their allies and unleash potent kinetic blasts, quickly turning the tide of battle.\nCHLOROMANCER- The Chloromancer is a healing specialist who draws on the vital energies of plants and nature to find a balance between life and death. They harness these energies into a devastating force, or recycle destructive magic to heal their allies.\nDONINATOR- The Dominator is a support Mage who terrorizes opponents, leaving them unable or unwilling to act. Those who muster the courage to assault a Dominator will find themselves at the mercy of arcane shields that turn the fury of their own blows against them.\nELEMENTALIST- Elementalists are mages who specialize in manipulating and controlling the raw energies of the planes. Through fierce discipline and strict study, these mages dedicate themselves to commanding the harshest and most chaotic forces known to exist.\nNECROMANCER- Necromancers are damage dealers who synergize with their pets. The majority of a Necromancer’s damage comes from a fully supported and buffed pet. In an emergency, Necromancers can also serve as secondary healers by sacrificing their own health to their allies.\nPYROMANCER- Pyromancers are destructive mages whose sole focus is the mastery of fire, from launching massive incinerating blasts, to trapping their opponents behind a smoldering wall of flame. No other Ascended can match the sheer destruction at the Pyromancer’s fingertips.\nSTORMCALLER- Stormcallers are mages who channel the raw fury of the wind and water to command the battlefield, chilling their opponents to the bone or stopping their hearts with electric shock.\nWARLOCK- Consummate practitioners of the dark arts, Warlocks embrace the grim forces of entropy and death. Protected within a cloak of shadows, they lurk on the edges of the conflict, as their deadly energies inevitably consume all that stand in their way.\nROUGE SUBCLASSES:\n\nASSASSIN- Masters of subtlety and subterfuge, an Assassin’s ability to walk in the shadows allows them to bypass obstacles and launch devastating surprise attacks. A rare few survive the initial assault, only to succumb to virulent poisons.\nBARD- Singing the songs of battle and playing heart-stirring cadences, Bards embolden their allies and cripple their enemies through rhythm and rhyme.\nBLADEDANCER- Blade Dancers are masters of wielding edged weapons. They specialize in ritualized combat movements that are lightning fast. Blade Dancers can overwhelm even an accomplished opponent's defenses, setting them up for a devastating coup de grace.\nMARKSMEN- Marksmen are offensive sharpshooters trained to thin enemy ranks with ruthless efficiency. They combine swift hit-and-run attacks with devastating volleys, endlessly harassing targets, sowing the battlefield with dead and crippled foes.\nNIGHTBLADE- Possessing deadly agility and mastery of the blade, the Nightblade can also draw upon the planar magics of fire and death to deal doom in a variety of ways. Favoring light armor, their ability to stalk and quickly eliminate their adversaries means the unfortunate quarry rarely has the chance to defend, let alone counterattack.\nRANGER- Rangers are consummate hunters who know the strengths and weaknesses of every beast, taming animal companions to augment their considerable prowess in ranged combat. This synergy between bow and beast allows Rangers to handily overcome the most daunting obstacles.\nRIFSTALKER- The Riftstalker is a defensive specialist who bends the planes to enhance his constitution and shift in and out of the physical dimension. These highly skilled and survivable combatants keep their opponents’ focus while easily evading incoming blows.\nSABOTEUR- The Saboteur is a cunning Rogue who uses explosives and other incendiaries to cripple opponents and control the battlefield. With proper preparation, a Saboteur can destroy enemies without ever giving them a chance to join battle.\nWARRIOR SUBCLASSES:\n\nBEASTMASTER- This Warrior's journey begins by bonding to a spirit companion. The spirit beast fights beside the Beastmaster with speed and strength and sees him through his darkest trials.\nCHAMPION- Champions are powerful Warriors who excel at melee combat. Wielding massive two-handed weapons, these battle-tested fighters find few equals in one-on-one battle. Champions strive to become one with their blade, constantly honing their fighting skills to win glory through warfare.\nPALADIN- Righteous defenders of the weak, Paladins use heavy shields and divine blessings to stand as a bulwark against their foes. The Paladin’s large shield not only offers protection, but affords many opportunities to launch devastating counters in close combat.\nPARAGON- The Paragon moves like a furious storm, never giving his enemy time to regroup. A master of dual-wielding, he uses parries and disciplined forms to build up power attacks and stay out of danger.\nREAVER- Reavers are warriors who combine the art of combat with the entropic energies of death. The slightest touch of their weapon can spread disease, incite madness, and death to those unlucky enough to face them.\nRIFTBLADE- Riftblades are Warriors who learn to enhance their attacks with elemental magic, allowing them to cast bolts of force across the battlefield and strike with boundless energies.\nVOIDNIGHT- The Void Knight is a defensive Warrior who uses eldritch techniques to counter magic-wielding foes. Spells that would bring another Warrior low are shaken off by a Void Knight, reflected back at the caster, or stored in pacts the Void Knight can unleash to devastating effect.\nWARLORD-A Warlord’s commanding presence expresses itself in auras that inspire her comrades to victory and cow her enemies into submission, allowing her to control the field of battle.\n8.5/10 Great!","November 19, 2013","true","129.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty much a FTP WoW, but without some of the annoying crap.  Like playing the MMOs, but also like to do a lot of soloing?  This is for you.  I personally did not care for WoW's dungeons due to the pettiness.  Here, RIFT forces some group play via randomly (and constantly) spawning Rifts on the main board.  Join group, close Rifts, kill mega-boss, collect loot.  No gripping, whining or trolling. Then go back your soloing.\n\nFor those enjoying dungeon crawls/raids and are not anti-social, the dungeons are fun and sprawling.  The final bosses have unique game mechanics and good loot drop.  The dividing is based on the roll-need-greed system.\n\nTrade-chat.  It is what it is.\n\nIs it really FTP?  Yes.  You can buy cosmetics, pets and unique rides, but most of these can also be bought for platinum.  The only thing I am disappointed about is that you need to buy into the Auction House to sell items, or buy REX off the auction house to open it up.  Really though, it's only $5 (USD), ordyou can earn the plat and buy REX, which with some creative mat gathering won't take forever.\n\nTL;DR:  Free except auction house.  solo-friendly.\n\n","April 24, 2014","true","130.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You can just levelone "rogue" and get a Tank, Melee, Ranger, Hunter, Stealth and Support spec.

Too quickly, which killed it for me as I was able to try different builds with very little effort. I decided to pursue other games on the market till the free-to-play came on the market, and I came back to give the game another shot.\nLeveling is still easy, and classes are either pro or gimp, but I still find it amusing to play. Ultimately my favorite aspect of the game is the PvE, and the idea of the rifts bringing people together to play as a team. Really love that community aspect of the game, as it aids in higher level PvP.\nIf you want a free game that you can sink 300+ hours into without feeling drained, make a few friends, and kill a few baddies, then Rift is the game for you!","June 21, 2015","true","360.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can change servers and recustomize your character (Excluding gender / race change) without having to pay real money. Changing servers is free, but recustomizing your character is expensive. (In game currency.)\n\n-Only 4 classes, but many different souls (Specializations) to choose from, and can have 3 souls active at a time. You can play your character however you want to.\n\n-PvP is fun in my opinion. Kind of reminds me of Unreal Tournament / Quake in the sense that it has an announcer that will announce events. "First Blood" "Killing Spree" "Unstoppable" etc. I found that pretty cool.\n\n-Has an in-game video recorder, which is a first for MMOs. However, it does not record sound last I checked. Not for me anyway.\n\n-UI Customization is good, you aren't too limited in that regard.\n\n-Average playerbase is usually friendly and helpful.\n\n-Can be played even on very bad computers. (Obviously your experience may not be ideal, but you should generally be able to play the game.)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons: Only 6 races. 3 per faction. 4 of which are literally copy, pasted, and reskinned. There are only 2 unique races. Bahmi and Dwarves.\n\n-Game is not incredibly populated.\n\n-Only a few servers that I know of that have a decent playerbase, the rest are dead. For lack of a better word, the questing is, what I'd call, corridor questing. There aren't multiple same-level zones to choose from, should you decide you don't want to play in a certain. You have to level in a line of questing areas. No choice.\n\n(No more cons come to mind at the moment.)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere's more that can be said, but overall I enjoyed the game. It's certainly not bad by any means. It'd be better if it was more popular and had at least 1 more race for each faction that wasn't copy / pasted. If you get this game, it's certainly not a bad idea to bring a friend. I'd give this game a 7/10. It is subscription based. $15 per month. With new accounts, when you subscribe and set up a payment plan, your first month is free.

Too quickly, which killed it for me as I was able to try different builds with very little effort. I decided to pursue other games on the market till the free-to-play came on the market, and I came back to give the game another shot.\nLeveling is still easy, and classes are either pro or gimp, but I still find it amusing to play. Ultimately my favorite aspect of the game is the PvE, and the idea of the rifts bringing people together to play as a team. Really love that community aspect of the game, as it aids in higher level PvP.\nIf you want a free game that you can sink 300+ hours into without feeling drained, make a few friends, and kill a few baddies, then Rift is the game for you!","June 21, 2015","true","360.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm a player of some of the classics: Dark Age of Camelot (remember that one?), a year or so of World of Warcraft, another year of EQ2, and several years of LOTRO. Finally, I couldn't resist the bug anymore and decided to check out Rift since it was F2P. I was not disappointed. The game pushed the art of game designs beyond what I had experienced in some very rewarding ways:\n\n1. Design your own player classes. Yes, you have to choose the overall categories of Warrior, Rogue, Cleric or Mage, but out of the 9 skill trees available for each one, you can pick whichever 3 you wish. For very small prices, you can also assign different "roles" to your character, meaning that you can have one build set up for solo, another for PvP, and yet another for Raids. Very special! I am an inveterate tinkerer. I love tinkering with Rift class design.\n\n2. Free form player homes. In Rift, player homes are called dimensions. Players may have access to many dimesions of their own, and each is a separate instance. Yes, you can invite your friends, and there is one for your guild. But, the degree of customization and construction you can do in each would make a Minecraft afficionado proud. Gone are the hard limits and creativity-stifling "hooks" of LOTRO. Now you put your items where you want them, the size, the angle, the stacking of item on item for actual built objects, etc. What a new world! I got to see in a video where one female player had taken one of the smallest dimensions available and built multiple dwellings in it, including a theme house for the three bears. Amazing! and lovely! BTW, some of the plants and trees can blow in the wind. Wonderful.\n\n3. Instant Adventures and Rifts: Some of the special things Rifts will offer you is, on 10th level, your character can run off and Instant Adventure. These are happenings that form instant PUGs where basically everyone runs to kill things or manipulate objects from event to event as long as you can stand it. Since players are sharing experience, this is a fast expereince machine, a great way to discover players to make friends with, and -- if you're like me and you're running a lot of characters -- Relieves the boredom of doing the same missions over and over. It at least interrupts them. The Rifts dynamic is fun because you sometimes discover where the next planar rift could occur and you can open it yourself. Then, players will zoom into your area to help you fight the denizens of the rift and close the thing back up. All of the benefits of instant adventures are in the Rifts, plus the granting of mucho neato loot.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that this is a game where you could easily spend and spend without limit. Many of the bundle packs for sale are quite pricey, although comparable to the price you'd pay for a year of playing a charging MMO. The in-game store can be pricey for some things, but if you are a careful shopper you can also buy things for loose change, including mounts. f you want to break down and completely outfit your character with weapons and armor, you can do the whole package in high quality stuff for a few dollars. That's nice if you've got a character you love, although the balance without purchased stuff -- if you don't make the mistake of accidentally attacking red (elite) enemies by yourself (which I have)  -- the balance is still good with what the game churns out in your quests.\n\nI'm hooked. This is a great game. I'll be playing it for a while. Take it on and enjoy!\nTelp","October 23, 2014","true","302.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll keep this simple.  RIFT is my all-time favorite MMORPG.  It doesn't take the genre in a whole new direction.  What it does do, though (and quite successfully, I might add), is offer a stunning and exciting take on the classic MMO formula.  Classes have seeminly endless levels of customization, encouraging players to try different combinations of skill trees called Souls to build the perfect character for their play style.  This, along with the living world invasion events, where dozens of players hold off hundreds of enemies in an active zone event, comes together for an awesome MMORPG experience.  Sick of whiny twelve year olds playing World of Pandacraft?  Play RIFT.  It has an awesome community of gamers who take the experience seriously, and offer up endless help to those who need it.  It is a welcome challenge, too, offering more than just an endless chain of "Kill 10 wolves" quests (though those are there, too).  I have barely scratched the surface of this game in terms of content.  It's free, and it's complete, so give it a try.  If you like WoW, there is no reason not to, at the very least, give RIFT a shot.","July 2, 2014","true","219.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I say this as a longtime fan of the genre and a veteran of many similar MMOs. While it still doesn't quite reach the pinnacle of combat design polish of a game like World of Warcraft, it gets damn close, and I'd easily call worthy of the silver to WoW's gold. The class or "soul" mechanics that are used in developing your character's abilities make for a wider variety of potential characters than any mainstream MMO I can think of, while retaining a reasonable level of balance (no MMO is ever completely balanced, sadly).\n\nMore importantly than those two things in playing it today though is the question of whether going F2P has changed the game for the worse. I've been playing since shortly after release, and I feel pretty confident saying that the game has constantly improved since that time, and shows no sign of slowing, even after the change to F2P. The "restrictions" (as all F2P games tend to have) on what you can access without paying any money are pretty reasonable. You can access all zones and raise your character to cap (60, as of this writing) and then continue on and participate in endgame content as you please. You won't have access to the Storm Legion souls (new souls, one for each class, originally added in the expansion, now available by themselves, as the remainder of the expansion content is free), but that's about it (as far as I understand it, I've continued to be a paying customer since the conversion).","December 22, 2013","true","23.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If that's the case, you could try TERA for it's "action oriented combat" and hopefully you won't notice how dull questing is there, but let's get back to RIFT!

The controls will be very awkward for most when you first start but you can completely change the key bindings and I would always be happy to make it much easier for you. This game allows you to really get involved with what goes on with your character. You can change everything about them and how they play against others. There is pvp where you test your skills against other players with your unique class or you can join a group and run through dungeons where you fight harder mobs and bosses. If you want to level other ways there is also the traditional questing. This is where you do something for someone in the game in exchange for experience which helps you level up. The max level is 60 and it is a very long journey. Everytime that you level up you get a little stronger and the end game level 60 content is worth the wait. So if you are considering playing this game then my advice would be yes and if you ever need help please ask about anything involving the game.","January 3, 2014","true","108.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I do like the way that rift's rip into a world and can cause huge fights in the middle of nowhere if no one closes them...full blown bosses can drop out of a rift.  I've seen 20+ people fighting a boss + enemies that fell out of a rift.  There is also tons of crafting, and there are tons of collectables, etc.  I'd say by about level 15 to 20 you should be seeing some pretty big rifts appearing out of nowhere.  This is very different from games like WoW.  If the rift is allowed to grow, big, big enemies can eventually come out of it.  Basically, rifts are giant holes that appear and start spewing enemies.  If no one closes the rift, then the rift levels up and even harder enemies come out of it.  Eventually, if left unchecked, the enemies will attack a settlement or other players.  They also cause land/environment deformations, and there are several different types of rifts.  And then, there are dungeons, which are a whole different ballgame.\n\nGraphics - I think the game looks great.  Some places look better than others, but overall, I've always thought this was one of the nicer looking MMO's.  It's aged a bit, but still looks pretty good.  The environments and attention to detail really help the game last and not get old too fast.  I don't think the screenshots do the game justice.  It looks a lot better in action.  I think the graphics are great.  So long as you don't go in expecting Crysis 3 looking graphics, you will likely be pleasantly surprised at how well the game looks, especially if you are coming from something like WoW.\n\nOverall, I've greatly enjoyed the game, I just wish I had more time to get back into it.  Check out some of my screenshots if you want to see some that are better than those in the preview up above.  This game is a great MMO.  If you are burned out on MMO's, it's not going to re-invigorate you, but once you get into it, it is a little different and has some interesting moments.","January 20, 2014","true","142.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game has a lot of faults, yet at the same time it does a lot of things correctly as well. Not specific enough? Well lets get specific.\n\nThe good things? It is fun, the grind isn't bad at all - you can literally get to level 50 in 1-2 weeks without even noticing it - and still get good gear provided you know what you're doing. (If you pvp, do warfronts, and you'll get plenty of pvp gear.) PVP is very accessible - it doesn't require you get the best gear on the right away. PvE is very fun as well, and is diverse provided you're progressing at a good rate.\n\nNow comes the bad stuff. For me this game got old really fast at level 49. I didnt bother to do quests because, well, i was already outleveling them because i was pvping. (Although you could de-level by mentoring and do them to get a 'challenge.')  Additionally, this game is not rewarding. The loot is terrible most of the time - and if you're pvping you'll never ever use it simply because you'll probably have enough 'favor' (ingame currency) to buy better rift store gear, and as another addition, the auction house is locked down until you've managed to either shell out five bucks, or get a rift-exchange in order to get 1500 credits.\n\nNow the AH and pvp doesnt make the game. There's a lot i didn't see, and a lot i didn't get to do. Among more pros, the classes are diverse, and you can play more than one role, making switching 'easy-as-pie' if you want to try something else. But for me, the game got repetetive, and in the end, despite the innovations, still reeked of the deriviative mmo-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t most ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes tend to smell of nowadays anyway. Not much new. However, still gets a 'recommended' simply because its enjoyable.\n\nTo sum it up.\n\nPROS\nGood and diverse classes. Easy to play multiple roles.\nDiverse PvE content.\nPvP can be fun, and is easy to get into.\nSomething i did not mention - Professions are enjoyable.\nThe grind is barely noticable. (Until 50-60)\n\nCONS\nLoot is a joke, and the rift store reflects on this, making this game absolutely unsatsifying in some instances.\nGets repeteive.\nAH is locked for selling (You can still buy.) down unless you shell out 5 bucks, or save a bunch of ingame currency to buy a rift exchange. (rex)\n\nOverall, good mmo, but has its fallbacks.","February 26, 2014","true","152.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I'll keep this simple.  RIFT is my all-time favorite MMORPG.  It doesn't take the genre in a whole new direction.  What it does do, though (and quite successfully, I might add), is offer a stunning and exciting take on the classic MMO formula.  Classes have seeminly endless levels of customization, encouraging players to try different combinations of skill trees called Souls to build the perfect character for their play style.  This, along with the living world invasion events, where dozens of players hold off hundreds of enemies in an active zone event, comes together for an awesome MMORPG experience.  Sick of whiny twelve year olds playing World of Pandacraft?  Play RIFT.  It has an awesome community of gamers who take the experience seriously, and offer up endless help to those who need it.  It is a welcome challenge, too, offering more than just an endless chain of "Kill 10 wolves" quests (though those are there, too).  I have barely scratched the surface of this game in terms of content.  It's free, and it's complete, so give it a try.  If you like WoW, there is no reason not to, at the very least, give RIFT a shot.","July 2, 2014","true","219.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its got great graphics for those with the computer for it but no middle man for those who play on the lesser.\n\nWhy I say this is because when starting up a new game, any gamers first instinct is to go into the settings to allow maximum advantage of the cames aesthetics and play. When I personally went through RIFTs settings I first put them as high as possible and it was lovely albeit, still not as fancy as guild wars2; above par for being f2p.\n\nThe problem is when lowering the elements it was difficult keeping each portion on a level that would run with a lower end computer without having to pull some farther down than others, thus giving the game not so very fluent appeal.\n\nAnother issue with the settings were key-bindings. It was a bit constricting since the game itself is supposed to be modded for player appeal.\n\nAll around the game itself is fun in a slower pace but still well-rounded and would completely recommend for those looking to pass the time until ESO:TU. :)","April 30, 2015","true","18.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its got great graphics for those with the computer for it but no middle man for those who play on the lesser.\n\nWhy I say this is because when starting up a new game, any gamers first instinct is to go into the settings to allow maximum advantage of the cames aesthetics and play. When I personally went through RIFTs settings I first put them as high as possible and it was lovely albeit, still not as fancy as guild wars2; above par for being f2p.\n\nThe problem is when lowering the elements it was difficult keeping each portion on a level that would run with a lower end computer without having to pull some farther down than others, thus giving the game not so very fluent appeal.\n\nAnother issue with the settings were key-bindings. It was a bit constricting since the game itself is supposed to be modded for player appeal.\n\nAll around the game itself is fun in a slower pace but still well-rounded and would completely recommend for those looking to pass the time until ESO:TU. :)","April 30, 2015","true","18.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have not experienced any of that, customer support is helpful even nice at times (too nice) and i havn't met one 12 year old at all and this 'small' community i heard about doesnt exist! infact i keep running into players everywhere. I heard talk about being able to use real money to become practically immortal but i havn't seen this or even seen other players with this kind of power.\n\nSo in short, too all the negative comments i see.. Are you sure you were playing rift? or was it some other game that you simply confused for it during one of your drunked drug filled episodes?\n\n1) The Games fun to play\n2) Decent player activity\n3) Game is fairly balanced\n4) crafting is fun\n5) graphics are nice\n6) characters can be as diversive as you want them to be\n7) you arn't restricted by race (you can be an opposing factions race playing for the other side if you wish)\n8) Many active guilds\n9) Why are you still reading this, just go and play already.. :)","June 2, 2015","true","346.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathecus/recommended/39120/","Deathecus","Deathecus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathecus/","292 products in account","One of the better MMORPG's out on the market currently with undoubtedly the best Free-2-play systems available. You don't need to spend any money to unlock zones, or quests. You can hit level cap without ANY hinderence. Unlike other f2p MMO's they tend to penalize the experience gain, well in Rift everyone earns 100% but subscribers earn even more experience!\n\nRift has a very rich PvE experience, Such as:\n\n- A very fleshed out end-game raiding. Multiple 10 and 20 man raids that vary in difficulty and tiers, whether in organized guild runs or Pugs in general chat.\n- Plenty of dungeons to run with expert mode(heroic) which allows for greater challenge and better loot and badges/emblems/tokens to redeem for epics.\n- Chronicles, which are single or 2 player story-based instances that drops blues/epics that may be slightly weaker or on par with expert dungeon gear - they are usually pretty quick and can be done once daily to help gear along with dungeons for pre-raiding.\n- Huge open world content! Giant boss battles that dwarf whatever Guild Wars 2 dynamic event bosses have to offer, As well as huge rifts in which potentially several raids participate in.\n\nPros:\n- A very classic/BC WoW feel. Very good class building and talent/skill system.\n- Player housing! Be as creative as you can be! Crazy things can be done here, albeit not as indepth as Everquest II.\n- Casual and Hardcore friendly. Enjoy exploring the world, doing quests, collecting mini-pets and mounts, and searching for artifacts across the world, collecting titles and achievements, also items for your house! There's also plenty of things to grind for the super hardcore players.\n\nCons:\n- The grind can get tedious if you're not used to the older style of World of Warcraft, however It's still easier than some of the more hardcore old school MMO's.\n- Auction house is not usable unless you have spent at least 5 dollars in-game OR have bought the game or subscribed for at least one month.\n- PvP is kind of lacking, very basic WoW-style battlegrounds is all you're going to get here. PvP ranks are also very long to grind.\n- While most of the game is completely free, you are not able to play the expansion "souls" (classes technically) without buying them seperately or owning Storm Legion. They can be bought in-game for around 20 dollars and it includes 4 souls (classes) Not entirely necessary, but definitely useful to own end-game raiding when multiple roles are needed.\n\nOverall it's a great MMO, especially for older WoW veterans and newer MMO players a like. Very accessible but also has a lot of depth in terms of class building and skills.\n\nSubscription can also be bought with in-game gold, although it will be very difficult for newer players, if you manage to hit level cap and do a bit of farming you'll be able to afford it without too much of an issue.\n\n\nIt's free! Give it a shot, the first few levels might be a bit rough and boring but once you get going it's a wonderful ride!","November 28, 2013","true","585.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

I had played WOW for years and felt like if I wasn't playing in all my downtime I was throwing my money away on it. I tried out DDO and do love that game for the content, however DDO did not have the game flow and player interaction that I had got used to in playing WOW. Finaly with RIFT you have the ability to move thru areas of the game fluidly and have easy interaction with other players. The Soul Tree gives you an interesting way to make your character unique. The rift incounters/invasions are awsome and allow you to form huge open raid groups easily. There is a real money store to buy from, mostly for cosmetic items and unique mounts and such, and you earn rewards thru the loyalty program. I would recomend spending the $5US to unlock full use of auctionhouse. Patron membership is $15 per month, which is close to what it costs for most pay-to-play games. However the game is totaly playable including endgame content without paying. I really do recommend checking this game out.","March 28, 2015","true","269.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

There's some interesting dynamics and things I don't care for.  The fact that each class has the ability to be dps, tank or healer is convenient but the fact that each one can switch their spec on the fly makes building a dynamic group difficult because everyone can do everything... so you are not needed.  They will constantly change skills and trees in an attempt to balance, but they overdo it to the point where you have trouble keeping up with the changes and sometimes ruin what you had.  Like most MMOs these days, top level and end game has a huge gap, to the point where you feel like you're a level one fighting a top level when you face off against a top geared player.  Lastly, the constant paid DLCs result in paying even more money than if this game weren't f2p... $355 for all of it?  This game has a lot of fun stuff but not worth getting attached to.","April 16","false","135.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

no\ncan u get everything in game without paying money? yes\ncan u get equipment from the store?yes, but equipment that is mostly useless\nis game dead? in old world zones it may look so but once u get to 60-65, no\ndo i need dlcs? trion doesnt know the real defenation of DLC(downloadable content) anything called dlc is actually either vanity items or things u can buy in game\n++++++++++++++\np2p,p2w:\nrecently there has been changes to patron system which brings up the question wheter the game is p2w/p2p, the answer is no, while some of the perks that made the game a bit easier are gone and are patron only now u can play the game without spending a single penny, in fact u can buy patron in game , u just need to farm a bit, im not talking about heavy grinding but spend 1h a day in game trying to make plat(money) either by collecting mats or by soloing old instances and u will be able to collect enough currency though u might jnot want to spend them on patron early on cause there are other important things like soul packs and earrings to spend them on.\nwell if u consider paying for unlocking some basic things in game like earrrings(that u wont even need before level 65 and then u can easily farm enough plat to get them) p2p, then u r wrong, i havent played GW2 personally but from what ive heard u need to spend money to enter some of the zones and in fact u need to pay in order to level up past some point, now thats called p2p, meanwhile in rift u can access everything and even buy them in game(except for a few vanity items)\nthough i will be honest i hate the fact that u need to spend credit on boxes in order to get some of the cooler mounts, i rly hate that\nbuying equipment:\nwell u can get all the equipment in game and the equipment that u can buy is not as good as the gear dropped from the bosses of the same tier,and u can also buy them with in game currencies,but they are only usefull for filling slots, but hey thats not the point,\npoint is the current raid standard is T3 but you can only buy T2 with credit and u need to spend in game currency in order to get T3, another nice thing to point out is, there is only 10~15% bonus currency for patrons or the guys that are using boosts, u cant get more than that for the current max tier\n\nraiding:\nin order to raid u need achivment, is what some ppl think\nif u dont have achivments fear not, just look for progression raids, there are many guilds/groups that want to give raids a try but dont have enough ppl, u can always join them, or alternativly  u can join a guild.\nthere are many perks for joining a guild like bonus currency and your guildmates(depending on the guild u joined) probably wont mind helping u gear up and might even craft u stuff and most of them dont mind helping u with getting into raids.\n\nPVP:\ncan be a pain but can be fun at the same time, there are maps for 10to 20 ppl and unlike moba games u r not a hero, if u think u can just go in and kill enemy u r mistaken,yes u might be able to single a few of them out but if u act reclessly u r dead,healing and support are way more important than they are in moba games, and given class system in this game(soul tree) u dont know what u r facing, someone might have enough health to be a tank but might be a tank/healer hybrid\nso does gear mean u r awsome? well i,as a mage, have been killed by too many lower geared assaasins and have also killed many guys that out gear me, i would say the way u play your calss/soul is more important than gears,though due to nerfs some of the souls might not be a good choice for pvp nowadays, like warlock(r.i.p)\n\nwhy do i love this game(pros):\n+wardrobe: well u can run around naked as a tank and be immortal, or u can wear heavy plate as a rogue\n+soul system: unlike other games u can switch between healer,tank,support or damage dealer at a moments notice(well at least wwhen u r not fighting) and can do them all with any calling(mage,cleric, warrior and rogue) that u r using, of course each of them is unique in its own way, mage healers need to actually attack their enemies to heal their friends and they can summon undead as a necromancer while rogues have to sumon beasts\n+macros:dont have enough fingers for pushing all thoes buttons? use a macro, u can find them on net or easily make them yourself\n+dynamic world\n+crafting\n+community\n+dimensions: well i got lost in alabiranth that our guild master made and took 2h to finish it and then my senpai said that i have only found one ending and i haven found the real ending plus the bonus, spent 1~2 hours more to find the hidden content and damn they were hidden well, u have to give this whole dimension thing a try\ncons:\n-well as a non patron u can only quene for random warfronts(pvp maps) and dungeons,though u can ask a friend who is a patron to help u with them\n-sometimes u wont be able to understand what the quest or story is about\n-mounts in boxes, i hate thoes","February 22","true","512.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I'm not saying that because I'm some bitter P2P guy who just hates all the F2P gamers.  The community really did drastically change when the game went F2P, especially in the lower levels.   It can be a bit frustrating at times rolling a new character.  The chat spam is ultimately what turned me away from the game.  No matter what you do, you can't keep up with it.  You're nearly constantly spammed.  I have spent quite a few of my sessions ignoring spammers a lot more than what I should have to.\n\nAlbeit, this was all around 6 months ago, so maybe things have cleared up.  This was an amazing game in it's prime - easily beating out every other MMORPG I have ever played.  But, sadly, I just can't recommend it anymore, which is sad because I made some great friends and had great times in RIFT....","June 15, 2014","false","202.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

If you are not questing, you are fighting to close Rifts with easily joinable public raid groups. If you’re not closing Rifts, you are fighting pitch-battles against Rift armies trying to get a foothold in the world. If you are not fighting Rift armies you are fighting against Rift force fortresses that have been constructed by unchecked armies that emerged from unchecked Rifts. The world actually changes and progresses in response to player action or inaction. Love it! The crafting system is amazing, the professions keep you busy and the graphics are fantastic. Seriously, no other MMO has ever kept me so engaged for so long.\nI just took out Patron Status (I am now a subscriber) and a game needs to be very good for me to do that. Also, it’s quite cheap and flexible. A month costs less than $12AU. Really worth checking out. Head and shoulders above other MMOs and I have played many. Oh, and it’s finished. Yep, it’s a working game in which I have been forced to endure 0 (zero) bugs. I am still trying to finish the first FlashPoint in Star Wars Old Republic due to an end mission crash more than a year after trying the game and here is a fully tested and functional MMO. This game is what professionalism is all about.

Id rate this a solid 9.5/10 even though some combat elements did let it down.","December 9, 2013","true","110.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Great F2P Model, good gameplay, goo story and overall very engaging.\n\nLike all MMORPGs you start off with a specific combat type, however, unlike many other MMORPG this combat type is highly dynamic offering you countless types of classes.\n\nYou are set in a world interacting with multiple worlds, in the sense that the world where you do your regular actions is frequently invaded by planar creatures, creating a good atmosphere where regular global events to fend off attackers take place. These events are called rifts  (tears in the fabric of your universe).\n\nI'm still in the beginning of this game so I will update this review as I progress through it, but so far I'd highly recommend this game for its fair model, and hell, it's free. Give it a shot!\n\nIf you are a fan of MMORPG you won't regret downloading it!\n\n8.5/10\n\n","January 19, 2015","true","40.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Great little Minion adventures you can use that will reward you loot/artifacts and more.\nEnjoy the Dimensions aspect where you can Build your own Safe Haven where others can visit and see, loads of variety in items to use and manipulate to make it as you want.\n\nWill say this only downfall i see in it as from this point is as a F2P Player you can not Create AUCTIONS, although doesnt look like you have to spend much to gain that ability just a bit annoying.","January 19, 2015","true","339.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

MOBAs in general have much more lively and balanced pvp matches. And they are f2p as well. Raiding in general is a laggy low-fps jerkfest. My hardware isn't the top of the line, but it handled GTA5 at a decent detail level and framerate. Maybe people who like terrain puzzles and hunting artifacts? Maybe that's the real target market of this game still? Maybe the 5mans? Except that you'll be waiting for a 5man queue to pop maybe once an hour? The scintillating general chat?\n\nEdit: The other thing that annoys me is how the expac souls are engineered to be so much better than the vanilla souls, so that you'll be forced to buy and play the new soul packs. So, if you are say, a mage, you will be forced to play harbinger, whether you want to or not, just because it does the required amount of dps needed to pass the content. Just one example of how f2p ruins a game over time. Another gripe would be how pvp rarely ever feels balanced, where almost every match feels like you're stomping the other team or you're getting stomped on. It's rare you see comebacks or even close scores at the end. It wouldn't matter except that they merged pvp and pve gear together, so that any change in pvp now affects pve, and if there's one thing pvp is always lobbying for, it's change, change, change.\n\nEdit: The thing that really annoys me about this game is the lag. I'm sure that other MMOs do trickery to mask the underlying network latency, and perhaps Trion should look into that. That and the annoying little bugs related to the UI and display that have been in the game since launch. Their QA isn't nearly up to the level that Blizzard's is. And instead of fixing the bugs, Trion seems more interested in rolling out game after game after game. With probably the same sort of bugs in them too.\n\nEdit: Not really pay to win, unless you're willing to shell out $100s. I'm guessing like all freemium models, they're relying on a few big whales to fund the playtime for everyone else. The current level cap 5man experts are decently hard. I can see where they tried to require teamwork, but all it has really done is make the tank shoulder an unequal burden in a PUG. Hence, players willing to tank are rather rare and you will be sitting in an expert queue for quite a while. The entry level raids are also decently hard too and do require even more teamwork to pull off. All in all, if you refrain from being a whale, it's a decent amount of content for not much money. PvP is rather laggy, if you ask me. I asked other people whether this sort of lag was normal and they said yes. So if you like crisp clear PvP, be prepared to be a little bit disappointed.\n\n\nI played this game when it first came out. At the time, it was quite challenging, the 5man experts required quite a bit of teamwork to pull off properly. I left it when it was still hard, and still a subscription game, mainly because the internet I had sucked at the time. Can't really heal when you're lagging 5000ms. Not really fun either.\n\nI decided to revisit it again, seeing as it's now f2p and subscriptionless, just to see what it's like these days. Everything is now easy mode, you're only in danger of dying if you get out of range of the healer. Otherwise the mobs just die in front of you and give you that sweet XP. The world is also ridiculously easy too, they've set the aggro radius on most mobs to be quite small, it's fairly easy to saunter in somewhere, hit a quest and then saunter back out.\n\nI'm disturbed by the fact that you can now buy purple gear at the level cap. It may be a tier behind and the current tier you may have to play for, but it looks a lot like pay to win. I've no objection to paying for things, and in some ways, f2p makes for a nicer experience. Because nobody's on the clock (either you or the game designers) you don't feel that urgent need to zip through the levels to get to the cap, so you can get on with raiding. And the game designers (who you're really playing against) don't feel that need to slow you down, so they can get more money out of you. Time is money. You want to move fast, they want you to move slow.\n\nBut paying to win goes a bit too far. I haven't reached 65 yet (only 55 now), so we'll see.\n\nEverybody (if you're willing to pay for it) can now do every role. Mages, can literally tank. Yes literally. The mage tank is no longer a joke. Warriors, can heal. No, not with bandages. They really can heal.\n\nBut if you just want something to kill time with, and all you care about is questing and 5mans, there's a lot of free content they're just giving away. Even if all you do is just dps with one of the original soul combos, it'll probably take you at least a month to get to 65. And then you can just move on to something else :P","June 5, 2015","true","627.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

BiS gear is still only avalible through Raiding and PvP progression and will stay like that.\n\nAs of this review the game has entered it's second expansion and this will be based off of 3000+ hours of gametime since I have stopped playing RIFT through steam.\n\nFirst and foremost, RIFT offers an insane amount of customizability compared to other MMOs on the Market. There are the four basic classes, Clerics, Mages, Rogues and Warriors. Each of these classes can perform EVERY major role (tanking, healing, support and DPS). As a warning though, in order to get every role avalible for every class, you need to purchase two packs that launched with their respective expansions (so unless you pay for the expack souls, mages can't tank, warriors can't heal, rogues can't heal, clerics can't support). Aside from this howewer, the game is still very functional and you can still fill a majority of roles with the exception of one. Another interesting feature is that you can mix and match souls (specs) together to make unique playstyles to suit how you want to play the game.\n\nSecond, RIFT offers some entertaining large scale zone events. You could be wandering around in one of the game's leveling zones collecting items, completing quests, etc and suddenly you get a notice on your screen that something is going on in the zone. 2 minutes later dimensional portals (Rifts) open up and start spewing out mobs into your leveling zone and player areas. At this time it is tasked to the players to close those Rifts and go ham on the raid boss that had the bad luck to be leading the invasion. These events provide both a fun way to level and boast a wide variety of objectives, thereby keeping the game fresh.\n\nThird, RIFT features excellent graphics compared to other MMOs (as long as you're not playing on a toaster). RIFT is a game that both plays good and looks good. Character models look good, the enviorments look great and the fantasy world is a prime example of how you design an MMO. Telara feels alive and this is one of the things that keeps me hooked to RIFT.\n\nIn regards to the combat, it plays like WoW, but RIFT's customization allows for consistent changes to the flow of combat.\n\nIn essence, if you're looking for a MMO to play or have yet to try one, I'd recommend RIFT.","December 27, 2014","true","802.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'd explain I don't want this security and Customer Service would explain I have to have it, yet day after day the same problem and Trion doing nothing to fix it.  Thus, tired of the hassle launching Rift, a hassle that's not necessary and goes against the Security purpose of Dynamic Internet Protocol Addresses ("Dynamic IP").\n\nFast forward to today and you'll find that since Rift is now using "Glyph," Trion's verions of Steam for their games, they added "a security layer" which is hassle-filled and bugged to no end Coinlock, only this time it's worse than it was in Rift.  Suffice it to say I'd recommend to every gamer to avoid any Trion Game until they make their security control freak attitude optional, that the player can opt in or opt out, so we have a way to play their game when their flawed idea of a security system denies us the ability to play the game and basically shows the sensitivity of a cowlicky baby.  I mean, I haven't changed computers yet their coinlock locks me out as though I have, again 3 times a day!\n\n\nJust the truth about Trion, I mean, their paranoia is so bad that the Defiance Beta had a system that made an account on your computer that you didn't control. You could delete it but then the game wouldn't play, and all to protect their game.  Well, if it's too much hassle for the players to play the game Trion then you haven't much to protect, for your Free to Play model that needs as many players as possible to meet statistical averages of volume of purchases from your store so the company can make money from the game just lost a bunch of player's.  Trion devs would probably lose their minds if they did away with this meaningless IP method of security that only makes launching and playing the game a hassle but in removing this method their player base doubled.\n\nIf you like to click an icon, pick the game and play it then AVOID ANY TRION GAME!","August 29, 2014","false","584.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That is how this game felt like.\n\nSeeking for a new MMORPG to play, I saw this game's trailer and was attracted to it. I started to download it and was surprised that it was over 18GB and thought that it must be really awesome. After the download, there was a patch that was over 13GB so I became impatient and was like, "This better be good." Then after gruesome hours of waiting, I was able to enter the character creation (which was unimpressive), and was finally in-game.\n\nSo first look, the game is visually good (just visually though). I ran around, explored and quested for several hours and this is what I have observed:\n1.) The game is too passive and lacking\n- I can't believe this was released in 2011 and it still plays out like an incomplete game today with little to no scenario and AI. It feels like those custom made warcraft maps in the works where only the terrain and units were layed out and has nothing much else to offer. Mobs are just standing all over the place or roaming all over the place with almost no purpose. There are a lot of things you can see and interact with that seems to have no significance at all.\n\n2.) Poor mechanics and balance\n-Special mobs or bosses, don't seem any different from the regular ones, just higher hp. Character's normal attacks are almost negligible, skills suck, your hp goes down almost the same rate as whatever it is your fighting then you regen everything so quickly after being out of combat for some time. Potions felt so irrelevant, you get mobbed by two enemies of same level, you use one, not so much hp recovered and the cooldown is so slow you just die unless you run, good thing the system is so undeveloped that if you just run with low hp you'll survive somehow because all of the nearby mobs just ignore you. They say dynamic battles in their site, but i don't see anything dynamic at all even in their videos.\n\n3.) The interface and controls are not so user friendly\n- This is the first time in my whole gaming history where it took me quite a lot of time to figure out how to navigate and use the interfaces. Equipping, buying, selling, etc. everything was just ugh.. not so convenient and the game heavily relied on right-clicking for no good reason.\n\n4.) Unattractive and unamusing character 3D models\n- For a game that looks so grandiose with a folder size of 37.5GB, it is just so sad that the character model's designs and movement are so mediocre and generic. Aside from the disappointing character creation options, I went in to battle just to find out how lame these models move. I can't believe that I was already using or chaining skills with what I was seeing, as they were not so far off from looking like a normal attack.\n\n5.) Lots of features and game elements\n- This game has a lot of content: multiclass characters, mounts, fishing, crafting, cooking, alchemy, blacksmithing, rifts, bigass bosses, etc. Aside from the visuals, this was the only other good thing about it. The system was just so bad despite being a non-beta game that I spent most of my gaming hours just fishing instead.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is such a waste. It has a lot of good concepts thrown into it that you just don't see or feel being projected in-game. If they can rework and improve their system, then it can probably be one of those games with ultra large communities that last for years.","December 22, 2014","false","33.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","3"

MOBAs in general have much more lively and balanced pvp matches. And they are f2p as well. Raiding in general is a laggy low-fps jerkfest. My hardware isn't the top of the line, but it handled GTA5 at a decent detail level and framerate. Maybe people who like terrain puzzles and hunting artifacts? Maybe that's the real target market of this game still? Maybe the 5mans? Except that you'll be waiting for a 5man queue to pop maybe once an hour? The scintillating general chat?\n\nEdit: The other thing that annoys me is how the expac souls are engineered to be so much better than the vanilla souls, so that you'll be forced to buy and play the new soul packs. So, if you are say, a mage, you will be forced to play harbinger, whether you want to or not, just because it does the required amount of dps needed to pass the content. Just one example of how f2p ruins a game over time. Another gripe would be how pvp rarely ever feels balanced, where almost every match feels like you're stomping the other team or you're getting stomped on. It's rare you see comebacks or even close scores at the end. It wouldn't matter except that they merged pvp and pve gear together, so that any change in pvp now affects pve, and if there's one thing pvp is always lobbying for, it's change, change, change.\n\nEdit: The thing that really annoys me about this game is the lag. I'm sure that other MMOs do trickery to mask the underlying network latency, and perhaps Trion should look into that. That and the annoying little bugs related to the UI and display that have been in the game since launch. Their QA isn't nearly up to the level that Blizzard's is. And instead of fixing the bugs, Trion seems more interested in rolling out game after game after game. With probably the same sort of bugs in them too.\n\nEdit: Not really pay to win, unless you're willing to shell out $100s. I'm guessing like all freemium models, they're relying on a few big whales to fund the playtime for everyone else. The current level cap 5man experts are decently hard. I can see where they tried to require teamwork, but all it has really done is make the tank shoulder an unequal burden in a PUG. Hence, players willing to tank are rather rare and you will be sitting in an expert queue for quite a while. The entry level raids are also decently hard too and do require even more teamwork to pull off. All in all, if you refrain from being a whale, it's a decent amount of content for not much money. PvP is rather laggy, if you ask me. I asked other people whether this sort of lag was normal and they said yes. So if you like crisp clear PvP, be prepared to be a little bit disappointed.\n\n\nI played this game when it first came out. At the time, it was quite challenging, the 5man experts required quite a bit of teamwork to pull off properly. I left it when it was still hard, and still a subscription game, mainly because the internet I had sucked at the time. Can't really heal when you're lagging 5000ms. Not really fun either.\n\nI decided to revisit it again, seeing as it's now f2p and subscriptionless, just to see what it's like these days. Everything is now easy mode, you're only in danger of dying if you get out of range of the healer. Otherwise the mobs just die in front of you and give you that sweet XP. The world is also ridiculously easy too, they've set the aggro radius on most mobs to be quite small, it's fairly easy to saunter in somewhere, hit a quest and then saunter back out.\n\nI'm disturbed by the fact that you can now buy purple gear at the level cap. It may be a tier behind and the current tier you may have to play for, but it looks a lot like pay to win. I've no objection to paying for things, and in some ways, f2p makes for a nicer experience. Because nobody's on the clock (either you or the game designers) you don't feel that urgent need to zip through the levels to get to the cap, so you can get on with raiding. And the game designers (who you're really playing against) don't feel that need to slow you down, so they can get more money out of you. Time is money. You want to move fast, they want you to move slow.\n\nBut paying to win goes a bit too far. I haven't reached 65 yet (only 55 now), so we'll see.\n\nEverybody (if you're willing to pay for it) can now do every role. Mages, can literally tank. Yes literally. The mage tank is no longer a joke. Warriors, can heal. No, not with bandages. They really can heal.\n\nBut if you just want something to kill time with, and all you care about is questing and 5mans, there's a lot of free content they're just giving away. Even if all you do is just dps with one of the original soul combos, it'll probably take you at least a month to get to 65. And then you can just move on to something else :P","June 5, 2015","true","627.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

The interface and controls are not so user friendly\n- This is the first time in my whole gaming history where it took me quite a lot of time to figure out how to navigate and use the interfaces. Equipping, buying, selling, etc. everything was just ugh.. not so convenient and the game heavily relied on right-clicking for no good reason.\n\n4.) Unattractive and unamusing character 3D models\n- For a game that looks so grandiose with a folder size of 37.5GB, it is just so sad that the character model's designs and movement are so mediocre and generic. Aside from the disappointing character creation options, I went in to battle just to find out how lame these models move. I can't believe that I was already using or chaining skills with what I was seeing, as they were not so far off from looking like a normal attack.\n\n5.) Lots of features and game elements\n- This game has a lot of content: multiclass characters, mounts, fishing, crafting, cooking, alchemy, blacksmithing, rifts, bigass bosses, etc. Aside from the visuals, this was the only other good thing about it. The system was just so bad despite being a non-beta game that I spent most of my gaming hours just fishing instead.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is such a waste. It has a lot of good concepts thrown into it that you just don't see or feel being projected in-game. If they can rework and improve their system, then it can probably be one of those games with ultra large communities that last for years.","December 22, 2014","false","33.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","3"

MOBAs in general have much more lively and balanced pvp matches. And they are f2p as well. Raiding in general is a laggy low-fps jerkfest. My hardware isn't the top of the line, but it handled GTA5 at a decent detail level and framerate. Maybe people who like terrain puzzles and hunting artifacts? Maybe that's the real target market of this game still? Maybe the 5mans? Except that you'll be waiting for a 5man queue to pop maybe once an hour? The scintillating general chat?\n\nEdit: The other thing that annoys me is how the expac souls are engineered to be so much better than the vanilla souls, so that you'll be forced to buy and play the new soul packs. So, if you are say, a mage, you will be forced to play harbinger, whether you want to or not, just because it does the required amount of dps needed to pass the content. Just one example of how f2p ruins a game over time. Another gripe would be how pvp rarely ever feels balanced, where almost every match feels like you're stomping the other team or you're getting stomped on. It's rare you see comebacks or even close scores at the end. It wouldn't matter except that they merged pvp and pve gear together, so that any change in pvp now affects pve, and if there's one thing pvp is always lobbying for, it's change, change, change.\n\nEdit: The thing that really annoys me about this game is the lag. I'm sure that other MMOs do trickery to mask the underlying network latency, and perhaps Trion should look into that. That and the annoying little bugs related to the UI and display that have been in the game since launch. Their QA isn't nearly up to the level that Blizzard's is. And instead of fixing the bugs, Trion seems more interested in rolling out game after game after game. With probably the same sort of bugs in them too.\n\nEdit: Not really pay to win, unless you're willing to shell out $100s. I'm guessing like all freemium models, they're relying on a few big whales to fund the playtime for everyone else. The current level cap 5man experts are decently hard. I can see where they tried to require teamwork, but all it has really done is make the tank shoulder an unequal burden in a PUG. Hence, players willing to tank are rather rare and you will be sitting in an expert queue for quite a while. The entry level raids are also decently hard too and do require even more teamwork to pull off. All in all, if you refrain from being a whale, it's a decent amount of content for not much money. PvP is rather laggy, if you ask me. I asked other people whether this sort of lag was normal and they said yes. So if you like crisp clear PvP, be prepared to be a little bit disappointed.\n\n\nI played this game when it first came out. At the time, it was quite challenging, the 5man experts required quite a bit of teamwork to pull off properly. I left it when it was still hard, and still a subscription game, mainly because the internet I had sucked at the time. Can't really heal when you're lagging 5000ms. Not really fun either.\n\nI decided to revisit it again, seeing as it's now f2p and subscriptionless, just to see what it's like these days. Everything is now easy mode, you're only in danger of dying if you get out of range of the healer. Otherwise the mobs just die in front of you and give you that sweet XP. The world is also ridiculously easy too, they've set the aggro radius on most mobs to be quite small, it's fairly easy to saunter in somewhere, hit a quest and then saunter back out.\n\nI'm disturbed by the fact that you can now buy purple gear at the level cap. It may be a tier behind and the current tier you may have to play for, but it looks a lot like pay to win. I've no objection to paying for things, and in some ways, f2p makes for a nicer experience. Because nobody's on the clock (either you or the game designers) you don't feel that urgent need to zip through the levels to get to the cap, so you can get on with raiding. And the game designers (who you're really playing against) don't feel that need to slow you down, so they can get more money out of you. Time is money. You want to move fast, they want you to move slow.\n\nBut paying to win goes a bit too far. I haven't reached 65 yet (only 55 now), so we'll see.\n\nEverybody (if you're willing to pay for it) can now do every role. Mages, can literally tank. Yes literally. The mage tank is no longer a joke. Warriors, can heal. No, not with bandages. They really can heal.\n\nBut if you just want something to kill time with, and all you care about is questing and 5mans, there's a lot of free content they're just giving away. Even if all you do is just dps with one of the original soul combos, it'll probably take you at least a month to get to 65. And then you can just move on to something else :P","June 5, 2015","true","627.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

It's free, but I would totally pay money to have it. There are a few microtransactions in it, but they aren't necessary to have fun in the game. They're actually pretty pointless, but I guess they have to make money some how.\n\nThe basis of this game is all about rifts (how the title of the game originated). There are MMO-typical quests throughout, but there are also rifts which are tears into other dimensions. These rifts produce monsters, and you must fight them off to seal the rift. There are many types of rifts, from fire to water to earth to air, and many others I didn't mention. Several mobs appear which you have to fight off (sometimes alone, sometimes with friends). There are different stages within a rift. The higher stage you get to, the harder the mobs become to kill. When a rift is finally sealed, you get rewards. Most importantly, you get planarite (how much you get depends on the stage you reach). Planarite can be used to buy planar goods, which can help you with battling more rifts or by improving your armor to make you more OP. So far, I've only gotten to level 21 or 22, but I can tell that I will be playing this for a long time.","June 8, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I'd explain I don't want this security and Customer Service would explain I have to have it, yet day after day the same problem and Trion doing nothing to fix it.  Thus, tired of the hassle launching Rift, a hassle that's not necessary and goes against the Security purpose of Dynamic Internet Protocol Addresses ("Dynamic IP").\n\nFast forward to today and you'll find that since Rift is now using "Glyph," Trion's verions of Steam for their games, they added "a security layer" which is hassle-filled and bugged to no end Coinlock, only this time it's worse than it was in Rift.  Suffice it to say I'd recommend to every gamer to avoid any Trion Game until they make their security control freak attitude optional, that the player can opt in or opt out, so we have a way to play their game when their flawed idea of a security system denies us the ability to play the game and basically shows the sensitivity of a cowlicky baby.  I mean, I haven't changed computers yet their coinlock locks me out as though I have, again 3 times a day!\n\n\nJust the truth about Trion, I mean, their paranoia is so bad that the Defiance Beta had a system that made an account on your computer that you didn't control. You could delete it but then the game wouldn't play, and all to protect their game.  Well, if it's too much hassle for the players to play the game Trion then you haven't much to protect, for your Free to Play model that needs as many players as possible to meet statistical averages of volume of purchases from your store so the company can make money from the game just lost a bunch of player's.  Trion devs would probably lose their minds if they did away with this meaningless IP method of security that only makes launching and playing the game a hassle but in removing this method their player base doubled.\n\nIf you like to click an icon, pick the game and play it then AVOID ANY TRION GAME!","August 29, 2014","false","584.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm looking at you, DDO, LoTRO and you other little ninjas hanging out there.\n\nOne complaint though, it's way too easy, with the group I frequently play with, not even well geared, we can handle dungeons undermanned, we can solo rifts meant for a standard group, it's actually one of the reasons I never play this game longer than a month or two at a time, before having to take a break again, as there's no real challenge, it can't be right that I can tank an entire boss as a mage without getting hurt. I hear this was very different before it became F2P, why it would change for the worse, I don't really understand, mass appeal for the casual gamers out there perhaps?\n\nThere's a few features that I'd like to see implemented:\n- Being able to play music, I was once a very loyal LoTRO player, and there was nothing better than freestyling on a lute for me, in my house.\n- Lotteries, chance to win ingame cash, mounts, pets, cosmetics as long as you sign up from the marketplace perhaps.\n- Actual challenges, I hate fighting a boss and suddenly seeing 50+ people taking them down in a matter of minutes when it was supposed to be difficult - force their damage to event related bosses, to be lowered perhaps? Anything?\nAlso, it seems to be headed in the direction of WoW, where you can win by simply rolling your head on the keyboard, please don't do that, it's the reason I quit playing that game (back when you could only be level 40 or so).\n- I'd love to see more races with more unique traits, it doesn't seem like that anything you pick will ever really be more than a simple convenience for you at times, where most of it only functions out of combat, or makes such a little difference that simple looks wins the battle over practicality, and doesn't even deserve a spot on your hotkey bar after you reach up high in the levels.\n- Fix the auction, I'm at that point in the game where I don't care if I buy one thing for 2 platimum one day, and 32 for the same thing another day, simply because I make so much that money has lost its value to me entirely. There is no sense of consequence about frivelous spending whatsoever.\n- Progress is too fast and "linear", from the time I started I feel like I could max everything out in no time at all, on top of that, once you've played through the first time, you find yourself rushing things because there's only a few different paths you can take before you've played every single mission and storyline, add a little more factions, areas, rivalry between factions (meaning you won't be loved by everyone in the end, add consequence and critical thinking!!)\n- Add more variety to the adventures, they stay fun for 5 minutes, then you start seeing the same pattern repeating itself over and over, this makes me quit, repetition is a game killer.\n\nAll that being said, I enjoy this game more than most, it just needs that little kick to actually keep me in the seat more than what it does, and it's a sure winner in my book.\n","June 11, 2014","true","659.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I personally was unable to log in to my old account so I tried making another account. This was a pain in the ♥♥♥ as Trion's website barely ever responds and constatly times out. However, when I evenutally created my new account i went to sign in on Glyph's launcher... I was given "2024 error message" which currently has no easy fix. I then found a large work around for this god awful bug the game would never patch as I received a plethora of other errors.

When you get out of one of the 2 faction spawns (Guardians or Defiants). This game INCOURAGES exploring the world, they have fetch quests but its not as bad as some other MMORPGS. They give you the quest, you finish it and go to a different person, some long distances some small. The skill tree is really good, could use a bit more in my oppinion but decent. The community is very friendly, invite people to guilds so they can help them if they have questions or even be very kind and give you a free mount or such. I was lvl 20-25 (cant remember) but you get a 60% speed increase when on the mount, people in my guild were talking about that mount which is 25plat which is quite a bit for a lvl 20-25 and i said that its very hard to get one, one of the guildies/guild member brought me that mount to be very very kind and they were a high ranking player. PVP is truly amazing and takes alot of skill and time, the most annoying thing in pvp for me is getting your faction swapped to the enemy team to balance it out which is a good thing but you want to be with your faction, either way its fun. The game has a wardrobe feature meaning if you have a piece of armor or something you can but it in your wardrobe slot for example, Helm and it goes into your wardrobe slot and it gives the look but not the stats. Microtransactions are okay... i guess, you dont HAVE to buy them for the game to be good, they are just things like if you play a mage you get 3 BASE things to choose from, example stormcaller, warlock ect and the Microtransactions give you a couple of new ones that dont make a HUGE difference. The Map is ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE and each zone like Gloamwood, Silverwood and every other one has their own secret stash like thing, if you open it you get ramdom armor of your class that rounds down to every 5 LEVELS, if you are lvl 20 you will get a lvl 20 item. If you are lvl17 you will get a lvl 15 item. Puzzles are great, they require teamwork like pressing several buttons that open a globe that your break and has a key in it, then it spawns a chest with a dirty bag, the same thing like the secret stashes like i said previously.\n\nI would rate this game 7.5/10 but i do recommend this game if you love MMORPGS\nCons:\nThe start of the game is very very boring and you need to be about lvl 15 for ♥♥♥♥ to kick off.\nCan be very annoying to get the kind of gear you want but its an MMORPG sooo......\nMicrotransactions are ehhh, would be better without it but.....\nWish there was gliders and boats like Archeage but mounts are good enough.\n\nPros:\nFriendly community\nCharacter creation is very very good.\nFun game after lvl 15\nGreat PVP\nWardrobe\nHuge map\nGreat secret treasures\nGreat puzzles that require teamwork to complete","April 21","true","77.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It's an okay game to play VERY casually; fishing, getting reputation, and closing rifts is always fun.\n\nUnfortunately, this game really has gone downhill fast. The community has torn itself apart with the changes to microtransactions and Patron status, which created a rift between the free players and Patrons. "Community" doesn't really exist any more (what's left of it is a select few players on the forums who have spent thousands on the game and wouldn't quit no matter how bad things got), and the game's a shell of its former self, with most of even the most dedicated players giving up on the sad excuses for "expansions" and the "no tricks, no traps" promise being long dead.\n\nIt's still good for some casual fun, but if you're hoping for the exceptional, full-blown free-to-play MMORPG it once was... you're going to be disappointed.","May 29","false","13.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

When Trion (damn them) made the game free, it all started going downhill. The became lazy with updates, most lacking any solid story, not to mention the fact that the quests were repetitive. I could tolerate this to an extent. However, the deal breaker for me was the major class changes. Every class could play every role, which got rid of the diversity, and even changed some of the souls completely. My main was a reaver tank, Therefore, my entire character was torn apart and made irrelevant. This game had so much potential, and I enjoyed it even more than WoW.

Took me over an hour just to get my profile to register on the launcher and after that I got to enjoy the bliss of this game.

The game is clearly a polished and honed mmorpg and is pretty good at its current state effective of 6/13/2014.\n\nHowever, the small flaw, which actually is a huge deal for me personally, made me decide to not recommend and quit the game entirely.\n\nThis game is free to play in name only, You are not required to, but pretty much have to if you are going to play anywhere past level 50, meaning endgame. And what would be the point of investing time and energy into a game where you hit a pay wall. the pay wall in rift is its loyalty points issue. basically, in rift, you cannot auction. at all. not one item. unless you have spent 10 dollars. and their is a in game currency coin cap. 2500 platinum which is an extremely small amount when people are running around with tens of thousands of platinum.\n\nAll in all this game is good and i would say probably would suit casual players, but even then the no auction and coin cap rule is foolish IMO on the part of rifts dev team. The rift community is quite tiny and probably not growing due to this one small/large issue depending on how you look at it. But this is the games pay to play wall.

Though I have to be honest I dont know if it is.  A while back i was invited to test this game....and didnt due to lack of time.  It came out so now i decided to give it a try.  The first thing i noticed is that this game is on a free to play model now with a subscription if you want one.  Thats neat...and i suppose some people hate it or like it.  Anywise I downloaded the game and was immediately given the ability to log into the game with an account or as a guest.  I decided to reclaim my old account to do this.  Anywise....i started up the game and was immediately told about a patch and how i could play but had to wait for downloading in game...since the big patch was big.\n\nSo i went into the game....and decided to make a character.  A few deceptions became evident.  First off 6 races....there is only 3 per side....you have to choose a side...with each race simply being an analog of the others...with slight changes to looks and some slight different abilities they can get.  Already with this mechanic i can see this game is going to be full of issues and other weirdness.\n\nYou dont make a game requiring you to play sides...sorry thats an automatic going to make the game lame function.....but maybe i can slog through anywise.\nSo i made a character.....noticed the graphics for some of my choices had not loaded yet.....ok warning sign two.....the red flags with this issue are evident....those pictures should have been loaded a while back but where not....means bad optimization and probably bad other things......if they are too lazy to fix something like that which is a simple fix...then they are probably too lazy for much story or fun gameplay.....ok goign to try to slog through that as well.\n\nSo i start the game and get a...failed to connect to server and black screen,\nBeen like this for over 15 minutes.......i have a black screen with what i assume is a waiting load icon.\n\nAt this point with these issues like this......i can say maybe this game is fun....but these red flags show....a huge amount of issues.....if they have this sort of thing happening.....the game is probably fairly bad.\n\nbut i am going to slog through or try too.....\n\neven though this rating says recommend.....i may alter it.....if i can ever play this game.\n\nOk I finaly got into the game....graphicwise it isnt bad...both sides start with similar quests.\nFlow of the game is typical.....but i can see this is definately is a cash shop game....lots of things locked requiring unlocks and a plethora of things to buy in the cash shop.  Control wise its typical has a power bar....which you can flip pages on and you can add power bars which is a huge plus.\n\nOnly draw back for powers is this game uses the archaic and idiot global cool downs.  As in you use one attack and 5 of your other attacks are cooling down....in the real world someone isnt going to stand around waiting so many seconds to use a differing manuever....unrealistic....and annoying.\nBut onthe plus side you can have many powers and use many power bars.\n\nYou can change your focus of abilities as well...as long as you have not spent souls on powers in a focus....and unfortunatly some of the focus' seam to duplicate each other....only the names and some graphics are different for skills.\n\nSo the supposed many focus things is a bogus lie....but then it does add to the concept of tailor making your character.\n\nI find myself disapointed with this game....with those features in those ways....but i will slog through to see what the rest of the game offers.\n\nOk so following the main storyline...we find we get cutscenes....and a very disjointed storyline.  Storyline is the world you are on has these rifts to other worlds opening and wreaking havoc....possibly this is due to a war with gods.\nEach faction side player is a resurrected hero....one side represents some holy divine group .while the other group wants to protect it a different way.  Looking at costumes and things I believe its a matter of one uses technology while the other uses magic.....storywise its not very clear why they are against each other or what the division truly is....as you can see on the side that supposedly uses magic...totems and things are actualy constructs from technology items.\n\nAt a certain point you fight bad guys who you get told have come from rifts....but for whatever reason at a ceratin point you get sent back in time...to prevent the war and fix the world....not sure why this is done....because the point you get sent too...is just as hosed as the place in time you left....go figure on the logic.\n\nAnywise while running around you will get the usual quests and missions...and also run into rifts that open giving further mini-quests.\n\nThe cash shop can provide you with everything.....so in essence you can use it for pay to win....yet.....why would you bother when you can most everything in game.\nThere are the usual a few cash shop things you can only get from there...and there is a subscription mechanic you can still use.\n\nI have played an assassin like character for a bit now....and after slogging through many things found that indeed the stealth isnt just a buff....as you eventualy can turn it on and off and not have to turn it off....only problem i am having now is deciding where my soul points go....as i dont know my maximum points...so i have to be kind of stingy in what i get.\n\nNow i mentioned focuses for each of the 4 class types....it looks like each character can get 3....now the reason you might take duplicating focus types....ie...ones that are similar is for the extra bonus power up you get to fight or do things.\n\nFor me right now i looked at the premade focus packages...and chose one...but decide to fit my assassin better i wanted to be able to not only have assassin skills but teleporting and better fighting.  So i altered my focuses to assassin, riftwalker, and blade dancer.....there is no package that uses these three...so i named my build ninja.  I feel strong kind of.....as an assassin strike does not one shot kill....but the ability to eventualy be invisible for as long as I like is a must have for me.\n\nANywise i am digressing in to things you should find out for yourself.\n\nPerhaps others will like it or maybe they will hate it.....I do not think this is a bad game....so i recommend this title for those who want something different.  But its not enough different from other games to warrent a huge amount of time to play it to figure out if you like it or not.\n\nIt is free to play...so far i am playing free....dont know what i am missing for not being a subscriber....but maybe i will find out later.","March 8, 2014","true","230.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Ive played played RIFT in BETA and for the first year of its release. Revisiting this game recently as it went F2P I wanted to see what has changed and if the PvP was competitive. The game has no open-world pvp, I couldnt find anyone to fight other than lvl 65's which as a lvl 28 mage would have been suicide to engage. So I was left to que for warfronts that did pop fairly regularly.\n\nThe class balance in the game is terrible, a decently geared bard will never die. Add to the pay to win store that pretty much means you either smash the other team or you get obliterated. Good, fun, close, tough matches are unicorn rare.\nFor me the game is a terrible choice if you like PvP, if you like PvE I am the wrong person to ask.\n\n","March 16, 2015","false","49.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","4"

While I had to pay a fee each month to play this, it was soon found that there are hundreds of talent tree combinations that are all viable for everything! It's amazing, and it really shows how much care Trion put into this game. I specialized and generalized and each had its merits in the grand scale of the game.\n\nThe world is also huge. There is never downtime, unless you make downtime by going into a city and standing there. I was questing once when I was a low level and a rift opened  right above me. As I was fighting for my life, another rift opened up a few meters away. Then, both rift's creatures started fighting eachother, it was amazing how alive the world feels!\n\nFinally, the community is amazing. People who are jerks or trolls get black listed by everybody, so they can no longer progress. This means that people don't do those things and everyone is super helpful. Even endgame grindy quests are made fun and easy with good partners.\n\nBasically, if you like WoW, or if you want to try a new MMO, play Rift. With the money you save from subscription fees, you can put it to supporting Trion through their store, and the community and world will ensure that you have a good time.","January 1, 2015","true","38.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
