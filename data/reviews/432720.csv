I'd like to compared the grappling in this game with "A Story About My Uncle" with me saying that ASAMU's grappling is a lot more accurate and smoother regarding connecting with a surface/orb and just a general faster momentum from preforming long and distance jumps. While this game have a lot more complexity regarding the grapling mechanics and playthrough, I'm just hopeful that the basic nature of this mechanic gets a lot more refined.\n\nI didn't compare the game to Mirror's Edge because it's feels somewhat far from it, as Mirror's Edge core gameplay mechanic is its complex movement system, while Welkin Road's core gameplay is its complex grappling system.\n\nThe gist: It's a pretty good game and definitely worth the asking price from the looks of it. It's a "pretty good game" although not to the standards as I was hopping for, but it definitely can be =)","April 13","true","1.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/432720/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor those of you who loved the original Mirror’s Edge and either refuse to have Origin on their system and don’t have a console you may be somewhat disappointed in the fact that it wont be coming to Steam. However, I’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to miss out on the excellence that is parkour on PC this year thanks to the outstanding Welkin Road that is currently in Steam Early Access and has been developed by the highly talented Gregor Panič.\n\nAlthough the graphics and the overall look of the presentation are quite simplistic it’s in the actual gameplay that the game shines. It’s among the most challenging yet relaxing games that we’ve featured to date and I look forward to sinking my teeth into the game and actually learning how to really play and beat the game. The aim of the game is to use your parkour powers – that’s a full accompaniment of grappling hooks and your body – crawling, crouching, running, walking and jumping – your way from ledge to ledge and over a whole host of different types of barriers that present themselves in the most awkward and devilish of places.\n\nI was a huge fan of the level design. The game is linear but it gives you just enough wiggle room to make it feel as though it is open enough that different strategies can come into effect. The biggest challenge in the game is to really understand the control scheme. Once you’ve learned the best way to control your character you’re pretty much set up to take the game by storm. Of course, the barriers and the obstacles aren’t very easy but most of the time it’s just learning and thinking about the best way to encounter them rather than them presenting as an impossible mountain to climb. Thankfully when you die you respawn quickly right at the obstacle that you succumbed to so you don’t have the annoying and aggravating problem of having to repeat content over and over again just to die at the obstacle that you failed to defeat the first time, rinse and repeat ad nauseam.\n\nThe game may be in early access but you can definitely forget about all of the demons that come with that tag. It’s been exceptionally well developed and continued support has come hard and fast. The few people that I know that have encountered problems with the game have had communication with the developer, Gregor, who has been extremely quick and super friendly to deal with. This is clearly a passion project for him and as much as he hopes to make it a financial success it is clear that the financial aspect of the product runs a distant second to his desire to release the best game possible.\n\nIf I were to criticize the game in any aspect it would be the lack of a narrative or story. I would like to see one implemented for the retail release of the game. A short back story and reason for the game’s existence would be fantastic otherwise it runs the dangers of becoming just another of the countless fun but lacking puzzle-esque games on Steam. Thankfully there are Steam achievements which currently satiate the thirst of the game being Steamified and I am hopeful that trading cards will either come with the game at retail launch or beforehand.\n\nAt $12.99 parkour fans are going to get their monies worth. If you’re not sure if the game is for you then wait but if you are interested in the game then you have the all clear to make that all important purchase decision.","May 2","true","15.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Why? Because:\n\n- All the puzzles are designed to the maximum pixel limit. Pixel perfect precision is still, and will never be something that is enjoyable in puzzle games. HOWEVER, this is OK if this only happens a few times towards the latter levels of a puzzle game. Here, it's almost every single puzzle that feels like an unbeatable obstacle. The problem is that the level were designed from the developer's point of view, who has so much more knowledge of the most finicky bits of the movements, and not from a player's POV that will take a considerable amount of time to perfect some of the hardest moves. Instead, you're faced with seemingly impossible obstacles as early as level 3...\n\n- The targetting system of the orbs is completely unpredictable, and there are definitly problems with distance measuring where sometimes you can clearly see your grappling beam actually hit the orb but it will simly not grapple whatsoever.\n\n- The movements, in particular jumping, are incredibly finicky and feel very unstable. You feel as if you could just fumble down anytime even when just running (it hobbles from left to right way too much). This can, however, be disabled, so it's advised you do so.\n\n- Finally, there are clearly optimisation problems on the grappling walls who just feel incredibly akward and jumping off of them is a nightmare.\n\nThe truth is that this game has a ton of potential, but currently reaches no pinnacles anywhere. Here are some of the things it does very good:\n\n+ The visuals are great. Simple, but great. Mostly cubic and one prominent color mixed with white. The phong shading on them gives more life to the overall picture and the clouds are among the best I've seen so far.\n\n+ There is one thing that carries the game, and that's the checkpoint system. It's so good it actually makes me wonder whether the developer himself was clearly aware of just how mundanously difficult the game is.\n\n+ The music of the menu is great. Now add music in-game while we're playing and it's perfect.\n\n+ The physical movement of swinging around does feel realistic (but as mentioned, the controls are completey hampering this).\n\n\nFor now, I cannot recommend it because the negatives outweigh the positives by a longshot. What I think is most keenly felt is how there is just no story whatsoever. There are supposedly secrets in the levels, but they are nothing more than just 'trophies' to say you were able to get on spot X or Y. How amazing would it have been if this game had a story that elaborated on how this world got created, what it's purpose it, what the orbs are and where your powers come from. Combine this with ambient music that stages the atmosphere and this game would be a masterpiece.\n\nIf that could be implemented, along with some obvious bugfixes and optimisations, I would immediatly change my rating to a high thumbs up. But for now, I can't. Don't get me wrong however, I think that for the amount of playtime you would actually set in the game, this price is worth it. They're not charging too much, which is a step in the right direction. Just wait for some patches that make this game just a little more forgiving, and we're in for a great score.\n\n(Will adjust my review and rating as this game evolves)","April 15","false","5.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

The road ahead will test your resolve, your concentration and your reflexes, forcing you to master your swings and movement as you learn new techniques to overcome the obstacles in the world… or plummet to your doom.\n\nThe gameplay is driven by two core components: grappling and parkour. Make use of the two grappling hooks to swing from point to point, creating momentum while using parkour-inspired movement to explore the world. Sprint, leap, balance, run on walls and hold on for dear life as you perform incredible, high-altitude, acrobatic stunts.\n\nYou have full control over the grappling hooks, as well as the direction, speed and timing of your swings.

This did not affect my opinion about the game. You can also check out http://www.thegamerholics.com/ for more gaming news and content)\n\nWelkin Road consist of a campaign mode with eleven levels, and an “S” ranking system (like Resident Evil). Each of the eleven levels brings a new mechanic into the game, which adds variety to each level as the game progresses, since these new mechanics carry over into the later levels. The game is really simple in its premise. Players must sprint, walk, grapple, wall jump, and wall run from one checkpoint to the other: until they reach the pillar of light at the end that carries them to the next level. Since the setting of the game is on variously colored blocks that are raised high above clouds in the air, this might be what parkour heaven looks like?\n\nEach new grappling mechanic is presented through varying colored orbs that hover throughout the level. Players must interact with these orbs through their grappling gloves (which look pretty slick to me), and manipulate their own momentum and movements to reach the next parts of the level. There is the most basic red orb (as an example), This orb is the first orb that players encounter since it is the first level. It simply sits in a predetermined position, making it easy to grapple to and swing around endlessly, or change the direction that you swing to land onto a platform on your side. Things get more complex quickly, with orbs like the blue orb, which run out of energy after about three seconds. This means grappling it for more than that time will result in you plummeting to your death. This introduction of varying mechanics is a great feature that keeps the levels progressively increasing in difficulty, and staying refreshing.\n\nWelkin Road gives players access to all eleven levels from the start, so anyone feeling adventurous can hop right into the final level and punish themselves by trying to figure out all of the game's’ mechanics on their own. When players do play the campaign mode, they will progress from one level to the next, with tips offered at various puzzles or obstacles. These tips are optional in the game’s menu, but also only appear as a pop up message that players can activate, and read by clicking “F1” (by default). This was something I really enjoyed, since the game allowed me to first try to out various obstacles on my own. Only when I had died around ten times did I open the tips to get more insight into how to properly succeed.\n\nThere is speed run mode as well, where players can challenge themselves to race to the end of each level, once they have mastered the game’s mechanics, or even just for fun. Welkin Road also features secrets hidden throughout each level, the number of the secrets per level is listed when players starts the game, and is shown in the campaign menu screen.\n\nWelkin Road’s mechanics function well, but the game does not feel perfect. The movements feel fluid when wall running, sprinting, and jumping. Wall jumping took a patch and some really good timing to nail though. There is a collision sound that plays when your player hits a wall, indicating when to press the spacebar to jump off of it. This threw off my timing more than anything, since it did not seem to be in perfect synchronization with when my character was actually touching the wall. Jumping upwards with wall jumps felt nearly impossible at some points of the levels as well, but the newest patch has made these motions much easier to complete. The physics of the grappling mechanic felt fluid as well, and stringing together jumps from one orb to another orb was manageable. My real issue was not the mechanics of the game but more so the level designs of certain obstacles. There were many jumps, or grappling sequences in the levels that took almost pixel perfect precision to complete. I loved the challenge of many of the obstacles, and figuring out solutions on my own. Yet  many obstacles required literal perfect timing across three or four jumps, which at times became frustrating more than anything. The game is far from unbeatable, but players should simply be ready to die plenty of times, and players should make sure their mouse settings are just right.\n\nThe game features a minimalist style, in both its art and music, which I found relaxing and undistracting. As mentioned before, each level occurs on white blocks mixed with a single color, which corresponds to the color orb of that level. The game is well optimized and lets players adjust the usual settings like contrast, brightness, bloom, resolution, and more. There is only music in the game’s menu but not while playing the actual levels. This was not an issue for me, I enjoy the atmosphere created by a game where you can hear the sound of the environment: especially atmospheric heavy games like Skyrim or Dishonored. Music does often enhance experiences however, so the same soft and soothing type of song in the menu would make the game more enjoyable for some.\n\nWelkin Road lacks any narrative which for some may turn them off from the game. It was designed as a first person parkour, puzzle simulator and functions great at being just that. Adding these sort of mechanics into a full fledged game in the future would probably be a great asset, but for now, Welkin Road is entertaining, simple, yet a fun challenge.\n\nPros:\nMinimalist Art Style\nFluid physics and player movements (slight improvements needed)\nClean graphics and good optimization\nRelaxing Atmosphere\nDevelopers active on Steam discussion page\nInteresting, well implemented game mechanics\nWell designed levels\nChallenging\n\nCons\nGame mechanics are not perfect\nNo in-game music (subjective)\nMinimalist art style (subjective)\nMisspelling of “collect” in campaign menu (minor but just something I noticed)\nNo narrative (subjective)","April 20","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyLegendary/recommended/432720/","SkyLegendary","SkyLegendary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyLegendary/","79 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I've been playing Welkin Road for a bit and I think it is a fantastic game. I feel like the game is challenging and pushes me to go farther while I swing from orb to orb like spiderman. That being said, I still think there can be (a good amount) of improvements to make the game the best it can be, but let's compare pros and cons first!\n\nPros:-Pretty minimalistic design (Hey, I like minimammalissm)\n-Challenging levels\n-Replayability (honestly this might be the game I'd love to speedrun)\n\nCons:-Poor player model (Looks like stock, poor shading during parts of gameplay)\n-Confusing controls (What even are the keys to make a tether go up and down anyway??)\n-Not much to look at (Although minimalism is great for the game, there's just a straight level with no pretty scenery or aesthetics, just blocks...)\n-Lack of diversity (1 orb, 2 orb, Red orb, Blue orb)\n\n(Room for) Improvements:-Change Gameplay\nAlthough the gameplay right now is enjoyable, it really is annoying to have to wait until I get to a certain point to be allowed to lock onto an orb and even MORE annoying to miss an orb and have no way to recover as I fall to my imminent death. I would absolutely love if the tether length was unlimited and you just have to aim it to hook onto the orb, similar to games such as "The Story of My Uncle" or "Windlands".\n\n-Change Player Model\nI'm going to be blatently honest, the player model looks like ♥♥♥♥. The texture quality is pretty bad and the entire thing looks like the hands of a 60-year-old man. What I think would suit the game a lot better is a white, shiny, futuristic robot with a center palm and floating fingers, like something out of a sci-fi movie. It would fit the minimalistic style while also fitting the vibe of the game.\n\n-Steam Workshop/Modding\nI know it is already planned, but I want more than just a level editor, I would love to have access to mod the game with new mechanics, environments, etc. For it's minimalistic design, this would be a great improvement for others to add more to the game.\n\n-More... depth\nRight now the game is kind of bland without any scenery, atmosphere, or story. Adding little structures of civilization or ruined buildings or different things would make the game a lot more interesting and fun to play to see what I might come across next. "Windlands" does this BEAUTIFULLY with moving rock titans and interesting atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the game is fun and challenging, but if there were more variety and more interesting... things, I guess... then I think Welkin Road could be a wonderful, and beautiful, game.","May 5","true","5.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Even without the speed run leader boards I found myself running levels continuously to beat my previous scores. There are some puzzle elements that are a bit odd like the grappling wall that don’t really fit the game but the rest of the puzzles and mechanics are fantastic. If you’re looking for a Parkour game that holds a little bit more challenge than some of the other games in its genre, specifically focused on speed running than Welkin Road is definitely worth a look, if you’re after something with a bit more than just gameplay as its focus, Welkin Road doesn’t offer any story or much at all past its gameplay.","May 2","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I prefer to play these type of games on my gamepad so this may not be a problem for you if you are good with mouse + keyboard controls but for me it is always a hassle\n\nI'll try to solve all levels over the next couple of days on my Youtube-Channel, if you get stuck, you may want to check this walkthrough out:\nhttps://youtu.be/uejYUCMO48E","April 14","true","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Set in first-person, The graphics looks nice, but there isn’t a ton of detail. The sound is mostly ambient wind and your own footsteps. The only things to focus on are the geometric sections in front of you and how you aren’t going to fall to your death.\n\nFrom the get go, almost every step of the way each platform is a new way to get from point A to point B. By level 5 I felt like I was still playing a tutorial despite each level taking me thirty plus minutes each to get through. Some of my stats said I had fallen 100 or more times before reaching the end.\n\nI’m not suggesting that “the game’s no good because I suck.” Far from it. The trouble I had with Welkin Road is that it’s going to test the patience of a lot of gamers that could really love it.\n\nIn Welkin’s Road, trial and error along with overcoming physics give you a real reward to successes. The game is in early access, though, and the only way to go from here is up (or down, if you lose your balance). While the game definitely has some pace issues, and a lot of frustration, if you’re willing to practice and want a new type of platforming experience, players will definitely want to try Welkin Road.\n\nFull Review at  http://www.heypoorplayer.com/2016/04/19/welkin-road-early-access-review/","April 19","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finished the campaign in 6hours of playing and ofc it has the speedrunning mode which records your time. So you can realy see where the focus for this game is.\n\nIt looks awesome and feels awesome once you get the hang of it.\nno real bugs that i've encountered expect where it won't let me finish stage 11.\nThe level is fine but the teleporter at the end just won't register me being there.\n\nMyself being a huge fan of surfing in counterstrike, even though this is alot different for sure gave me some of those vibes that I get with surfing.\n\ncan't wait for future updates","April 29","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
