Only 3 leaders left Gandhi, Caesar and Washington.\nyou draft an 'end game' plan in your mind, you will make friends with Gandhi (for obvious reasons he's chill) then procede to befriend Caesar.\n\nThen you will take out Washington because he is a ♥♥♥♥ and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior HE MUST PAY. 20 turns later all is going to plan, we are now on Washingtons doorstep, Gandhi and Caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation. All we need to do is eliminate the pesky Americans and ith all our military now on American soil this should not take long.\n\nThen after the swift invasion of America we will make a vote for world peace at the U.N (in rome of course) with our new found Indian and Roman brethren it is a sure win!\nBut all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start, quickly they become louder and louder, "what is this!?" you think to yourself, a false alarm? You shrug it off maybe Caesae bombing a city state.\n\nThe game pauses... Gandhi appears on the screen, with a sinister grin he shouts "WAR" in your face. Only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight. The camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy, the capital of your glorious nation.\n\nYou then hear a rumble, just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine, you realise it is too late... you can only watch as the missle closes in. As your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people, then silence.\n\nBefore what had just occurred had sunk in, before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the  humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears. Suddenly countless 'stealth bombers' appear seemingly out of no where, soon the sky is blackened by planes, the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains. You faint from the shock of what is unfolding.\n\nYou awake shortly after, Gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire, now with 'giant death robots' making the most of his seemingly never ending turn. As Gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes what's left of your broken nation all you can do is weep, your people hacked down in their prime and  your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn.\n\nWhy oh why did you turn of autosave? did it really speed your game up? was it worth it?\n\nGhandi is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he acts like your friend but WILL nuke the ♥♥♥♥ out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself. 10/10","October 13, 2014","true","177.3"," 3,754 of 3,852 people (97%) found this review helpful 2,743 people found this review funny","97","754","3","743","77"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeonDeclis/recommended/8930/","LeonDeclis","Leon Declis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeonDeclis/","240 products in account","I am the peaceful nation of the Celts.\n\nWe shall be the nation of religion, and of diplomacy.\n\nThis went well; we ended up next to the Babylonians, and we expanded nicely in peace. However, I have always believed in "dibs", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened.\n\nIn order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitor and warriors to help defend our religious allies.\n\nBabylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders.\n\nI offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted.\n\nNorth of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome.\n\nWhile they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon.\n\nI had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them.\n\nMy civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall.\n\nEventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world.\n\nThey all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway.\n\nDemocracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful). And if you don't like me, I'll pay your best friend to backstab you.\n\nThrough this, I came to understand American foreign policy. So Civilization is if nothing else, an educational tool.","March 29, 2015","true","215.4"," 2,087 of 2,154 people (97%) found this review helpful 2,152 people found this review funny","97","087","2","152","40"

It doesn't require lightning reflexes, speed or precision, however it is probably one of the most complex games ever created.\n\nYou're able to pick one of many civilizations to guide from 4000BC to the Present, allowing you to shape their culture, military and economic structure among others. You control everything, from where to build a city, how you allocate resources, scientific research, religion, espionage, tourism, corporations, and more.\n\nThe game has an extremely intricate diplomacy system as well which allows for you to befriend or antagonize the other civilizations. There are multiple ways to win a game, allowing for multiple play-styles.\n\nAs someone who has been playing the Civilization games for over 20 years, I strongly recommend Civilization V with all of its DLC.\n\nCivilization V has also made our list for the top 35 games of the generation. To see where it ranks, here's the video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIHmom_lP4\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","November 26, 2013","true","763.7"," 1,333 of 1,459 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","333","1","0","35"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalxavenger/recommended/8930/","totalxavenger","Rosario","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalxavenger/","58 products in account","Having not a great deal of experience with previous Civilization games, I was expecting myself to find this installment of the series hard to get the hang of, imagining myself spending hours trying to work out how to start up a civilization that will "stand the test of time". Instead, I found the game to be extremely helpful and newbie-friendly. Like other strategy games, you learn the basics then gradually build up a better understanding of the game and its mechanics, feeling more and more like a pro with every minute gone by. After about four hours playing I felt pretty confident, but even today I am learning things I never knew or had any comprehension of in the game. The simplicity which has been introduced to help newcomers coupled with the fact that the game maintains the same look and feel with older generations is a really positive thing that was pulled off very well.\n\nThe game offers serious levels of depth due to the vast number of playable races, multiple methods to seek victory and the ability to play on completely randomly generated maps every game, with available templates to choose from if so desired. I have only played a handful of games right to the very end since they can last for many days, especially if each session isn't particularly long. Every game feels very different to the next, providing this title with a lot of replayability.\n\nThe AI is sometimes criticised but I think that it is well done in this game with a large range of difficulty levels to choose from, ranging from literally zero experience to the grandmaster level. They can often be somewhat unpredictable but I personally see that as a good thing, I mean, what's the point in playing such an in-depth strategic game like Civilization V when you can anticipate what the AI will most likely do? Part of the magic of this game is that it immerses you into the position of a leader, facing situations where you have to make decisions on the spot with no idea what your opponent is going to do.\n\nOverall this is a great game worthy of your money, but I would advise waiting for it to come on sale as it frequently does, it isn't the newest game in the world either.","November 25, 2013","true","193.2"," 648 of 699 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","648","699","2","8"

Yes otherwise I wouldn´t have spent 600 hours in it and still booting it up now and then.\n\nCivi V lacks nothing on graphics or gameplay, it is top of the line and there it is 100´s of mods for those who wishes to change their gameplay in anyway possible.\n\nCivi V is not as detailed or brutally hard as the former games in this installment, however that is a great thing in my eyes as it gets a lot of new players to test out the series that the rest of us have enjoyed for so many years.\n\nThe DLC`s Gods & Kings and Brave New World adds a lot of the things we are use to from ealier series and is diffenetly worth getting for anyone who likes the more complex version of the Civi series, that beeing said the other DLC`s is mainly just new maps or new nations to play with and really only something you should pickup if you are a huge fan or on sale.\n\nSo Civi is as it always have been, you start with a settler and one more unit and here you go form a nation that will stand the test of time. There is multiple ways to achive victory and it is important that you play to your nations strenghts and use your enemies weaknesses through the different time periods of our planet. This is classic Civi after all.\n\nTho do not let it fool you, Civi is a game that takes a long time often 6+ hours pr map and often one nation is just gonna hate you more than anyone else, in my case it was Poland wich wanted to nuke and kill me no matter what, they did a good job sometimes too.\n\nAll in all a great game and a great installment of the Civi series that brings a lot of new players and a lot of life into the series, so if you like complex games that takes time and patience then make sure you pick it up!","June 7, 2015","true","601.7"," 186 of 199 people (93%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","93","186","199","13","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/recommended/8930/","fancyfishie","Fancy Fish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/","796 products in account","SID MEIER'S CIVILISATION V - Just one more turn?\n|| 9 ||    Score    Comment        Graphics    8    Visuals are simple but pleasing, good textures on the landscape tiles, nicely detailed units with lots of variety, good animations and an intuitive unobtrusive UI.  Zooming in and out on units, cities and terrain allows you see all the little  details while also giving you the ability to see the "big picture" strategic view. Graphics are vastly improved from previous games in the series. If I had one wish I guess it would be to have your cities and their buildings represented better visually. Cities grow and spread with population and advance with technology/era and have several different styles depending on the nation you select, and the building of wonders will add the wonder to the area surrounding your city but it would be great to have further customisation of your cities so you could really make them your own. The Civilopedia (like an in game wiki) is a little difficult to navigate and while informative could use some work.      Audio    8    Game Music is relaxing and fitting, from the dawn of civilisation, the age of exploration or the grand age of empire building it just seems to work well and I very rarely feel the need to turn down the music volume (as I do with other games). The ambient sound is excellent, move your screen to a coastal area and you will hear the wash of the sea, select your boats and you will here the crack of oars or ring of their bell. The little touches and details like these really make the game a joy to play.      Gameplay    9    Civilisation is a turn based 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game, a game of grand strategy & micromanagement, a game where the objective is to grown your civilisation and eventually conquer all through Technology, Culture, Diplomacy and Military might. This is by no means a simple game, it takes time to truly learn and fully appreciate but once you get into a game your hooked. Civilisation is by far the most addictive game (maybe with the exception of certain MMORGP's) out there. The "just one more turn" is a running joke because you will often find yourself planning on playing just one more turn to build something or win a battle and then you will look to the clock and find several hours have past. The start of the game is exciting, turns move quickly and you see your planning quickly realised, mid game you must continue your expansion and put in place what you will need to win. The only place where I feel this game falls down is late in the game, by this point sometimes there will be a clear winner, technology advancement will slow and your empire will often be so massive and units so numerous that just taking your turn can take quite a lot of time. Overall though gameplay is outstanding. The AI can be a little quirky at times but for the most part is challenging and tactically sound. Relationships between civilisations are all based on their predisposition and events which occur throughout the game and can therefore be somewhat predictable.        Story    8    The Story of history rewritten, the story of civilisation, so many details make up this game and so much background history on every aspect (via the civilopedia). The DLC add's on (amongst other things) quests which add to the story but in truth these add little to the game. The narrative is really what you make it, the interaction between the leaders of the other civilisations, all struggling for power, the alliances and conflicts mean there is very rarely a time of true peace or a dull moment.         Replayability    10    Fully customisable random maps, different scenarios, different civilisations and leaders. Make your own maps and scenarios, full integrated into steam workshop with hundreds of brilliant mods. It all adds up to a different experience each time and near infinite replayability.         Multiplayer    6    This is not an easy game to play multiplayer, the nature of the game means that you will all need a large amount of time to play a game through to completion, which may be problematic (especially with friends in different timezones or for people with connection issues). The most enjoyable aspect of multiplayer I found was the hotseat mode. In this mode you play locally and multiple players take the game in turns (like a boardgame), once again the time required to get near the end means you could be in for a very long (but very enjoyable) game.        Overall    9    While some purists will prefer the earlier Civ games in the series, I feel that Civ 5 (and especially with the main DLCs) is a worthy successor. It has the right level of difficulty and depth, much improved visuals and solid gameplay which will make you wonder where the hours went.\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

Having only had one PC in the family home at the time it was a constant tussle of bribes, threats and outright clashes with my younger brother as to who was going to get the chance to play. As any good Civ playing person would know, is not a "quick fix" kind of game. Hours would mysteriously vanish right before ones very own eyes so a battle lost here was a sore defeat for that day!\n\nI missed Civ IV, having taken a long break from gaming habouring the notion in my head that I had somehow outgrown playing computer games. Truth be told it was more along the lines of not really being able to afford a decent PC at the time (hey I had just started working and I needed to eat and pay rent). I do know, however, that there is an ardent Civ IV fan-base that proclaim IV is still the master game but I am not going to get into that debate since I have no point of reference having never actually played it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=215698176\nSo how does Civilization V compare to its much older sibling? As far as my tastes and expectations for a game of this nature go - it surpasses them. Civilization V sees you guide a pre-historic civilization at the very dawn of man through to the modern era using war, diplomacy, culture, tourism and various technologies as they become available for your civilization to use (these are selected from skills trees that offers a variety of gameplay styles early on in the game depending on how you level your civilization). You will have access to a wealth of information regarding your progress such as Diplomacy and Espionage through to Trade Routes and City Production Output (just to name a very few).\n\nIt can sometimes be a little overwhelming to the new comer as you try to grasp all the various little bits of information that enable a safe and successful passage through time for your chosen civilization. The game does include a tutorial in the beginning but it really is up to the player to decide what to do with the wealth of information he or she is presented with. Don't despair though - you do quickly get a hang of things and besides mistakes made are valuable lessons learn't for future civilizations. You can learn at a quicker rate by diving into a multiplayer session but expect to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you since there are a great number of very good players out there but it's a really good way to learn. For the uninitiated, I suggest working from the easiest difficulty setting upwards to the more advanced in your attempts to become a better player and master the games intricacies.\n\nWhilst it would be easy to praise everything from the production values to the graphics engine (which supports DirectX II) to the soundtrack - we have come along in leaps and bounds since 2001 - what really makes the difference is the move to a hexagonal tile over the square tiles previously employed on the grid. This is a smart move and I am surprised to see it only show up in the games fifth iteration. It certainly goes well with the renewed combat system which no longer allows you to stack your armies on one single tile like you previously could. I also liked that they have now included the ability for a city to defend itself by simply firing onto an enemy within the correct tile radius. This means that your armies no longer have to babysit your cities and Capital and can now actually get out onto the front-lines of the war effort should you find yourself at war with one or more other civilizations (although it would still be a wise decision to keep some of your stronger units around your Capital city).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=215698622\nThe game also introduces City States, which are computer controlled non-playable cities, that one can trade with or conquer depending on your proclivity. There is also an option to use diplomacy, however, in the base game this was a mighty gold coin sink since these City States at time of release where so fickle and demanding they could plunge you into bankruptcy before you knew what was actually happening and ruin a play-through. Thankfully this problem has been addressed in the subsequent standalone expansion packs, Gods and King's and A Brave New World.\n\nSpeaking of the expansion packs they really are essential purchases ensuring that you are getting the maximum Civilization V experience. Not that the base game lacks anything at all that would make it feel incomplete - these expansions add new features such as Religion and Espionage as well as International Trade Routes and ability to form a World Congress in the modern age. I particularly like the inclusion of the World Congress, when formed, sees all leaders of the civilizations in game meeting to push through global proposals. The game becomes very much less predictable with this inclusion and much more exciting because there are now ten times more points of conflict that can arise. Want to place a heavy tax on militaristic civilizations crippling them from an upkeep perspective or see more of the arts flourish amongst all civilizations? There are a host of options that arise here that can drastically alter the end game. Tourism and Great Works by various artists are also introduced which opens up the game in exciting and wonderful new ways.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=215596438\nThere is also a very vibrant modding community with Civilization V having benefited from the Steam workshop inclusion. There is more than enough content available through this medium and the games official expansion packs and DLC which should see Civilization V reign comfortably for quite some time into the foreseeable future. If you enjoy grand strategy games, I wouldn't hesitate advising you pick up Civilization V. If price is an issue - I have noted that the game repeatedly goes on a big dip sale when the Steam holiday sales roll around so I would strongly urge you to pick it up then if you haven't already.\n\nCivilization V is a time sink of a game so don't be surprised to see yourself sitting in front of your computer all red and blurry-eyed as you watch the sun peak in the early morning sky. Civilization V is still one of my absolute favorite games in my games library and something I constantly keep installed. Firaxes have done an amazing job with this title and I heartily recommend it to any gamer with not only a passing interest in history or strategy but for anyone looking for quality and fun in equal measures.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","January 3, 2014","true","167.7"," 195 of 227 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","195","227","0","5"

Since release, many DLC have been released, but most attention goes to 2 expansion packs, Gods & Kings and Brave New World, each adding much needed content to the somewhat lacking base game.\n\n* Gameplay\n\nSimilar to the previous titles in the series, V gives you the leading role of a civilization starting in 4000 BC with a Settler to found your first city and a military unit. From there, you must guide your civilization to glory using diplomacy, war, culture, trade, religion, science and espionage. Each civilization is based on a real world culture and appropriate advantages, unique units, buildings and so on. The goal of each game is to emerge supreme in one of 4 victory conditions: Diplomacy, Domination, Culture and Science. If neither is fulfilled by the year 2050, a Time victory is given to the civilization with most points. Opposing you are, depending on choice, from 1 to 15 rival civilizations with fairly decent AI, regardless of difficulty, although they sometimes make questionable choices. Strategy and tactics are thus important, whether is it in city placement, unit position or expanding cultural options. In each game, several resources have to be taken care of:\n\nGold (pays for the upkeep, instant building, as bribe in diplomacy)\nHappiness (prevents revolts and enables Golden Ages)\nStrategic resources (allows powerful units and buildings)\nCulture (for Social Policies that give empire-wide boosts, further expanded with Ideologies) All of this leads to many hours spent in intricate detail planning of synergies. And of course, if you ever get stuck on a question, the ingame Civilopedia is a vast source of information laced with many sarcastic remarks.\n\n*  Expansions, scenarios and custom content\n\nAs mentioned, many DLC have been released for V, ranging from new civilizations, maps, scenarios and game overhauls (Gods & Kings and Brave New World). Personally, I believe having both expansions and new civilizations adding content are a must for anyone looking to invest a significant amount of time in the game, although the map packs are fairly redundant and can be downloaded for free from the Steam Workshop. There are also many scenarios based on historic events, with many changes from a regular game and there are also many mods for download, ranging from simple UI changes to adding completely new content and civilizations (often fictional).\n\n* Closing comments\n\nSid Meier’s Civilization V is an excellent game which offers many hours of enjoyable gameplay, but I recommend having most DLC’s as the base game is lacking in content. However, prices are rather high, thus it is best to wait for a sale. The game also offers at least 4 hours of beautiful made-for-the-game soundtrack. A must-have game for anyone who has an interest in history, strategy and micromanagement and a lot better than Beyond Earth.","August 21, 2015","true","453.9"," 74 of 79 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","74","79","2","3"

Well, along with Civilizations 1, II, III, and IV.\n\nIf you enjoyed other Civilizations games, it's highly likely you will enjoy this one as well.\n\nThere are a few things that are notably different from other versions of Civilizations.\n\nThe most obvious is the units per tile restrictions. In Civ 5, there is only allowed 1 unit type per tile, meaning only 1 combat unit can be on any tile. In some ways it's better, in some it's worse, but it does lend itself to strategy of positioning of your army being much more important than in earlier versions.\n\nAnother is that cities, when attacked, take damage themselves instead of any unit defending. I believe it's related to the 1 unit type per tile, because it would be odd if you only had to kill one unit to take a city.\n\nThese two differences from earlier versions does give the game a different feel from earlier versions, but it does still feel much more similar to Civilizations than it does to a game like Colonization/Civ4Col, although not that it would be a bad thing if it was similar to Colonization, another great Sid Meier game.\n\nOverall I highly recommend it to anyone considering, just make sure you have time to play because you will be hooked.","May 13, 2014","true","445.0"," 66 of 71 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","66","71","0","0"

Got angry and ended up wiping out the entire planet with nuclear weapons and (unintentionally) dominated the world with military might. Don't f*ck with me. 10/10\n+ You may encounter Genghis Khan during your Civilization experience and he'll be your best friend even if your civilization doesn't have the great military strength. Also has a cool personality and usually got your back in the midst of trouble. #BestFriends4Life. 9.5/10\n+ Want to do a historical reenactment with your selected civilizations? Go ahead. It may be historically inaccurate but you ended up enjoying a lot more than you originally intended. 9/10\n+ Don't have any allies with other civilizations? You can gift a unit or send gold to city-states to become your friends and allies. At least, you're not lonely in a hostile world where everyone can backstab you like a sneaky b*tch (I'm looking at you Gandhi). Hey, it's a good thing when city-states will fight (and die) for you. 8.5/10\n+There's something wrong when you have the Freedom Ideology and ended up dominating most of the planet by the Information Era. 8.5/10\n+ In the middle of war, you would most likely hear depressing orchestral soundtrack...and ended up making peace with your enemies. Not because that you lost interest in war or you feel bad for wiping out enemy units and annexing cities, it's because the soundtrack will make your heart cry. 10/10\n+ The best political simulator. Ever. 10/10\n\nWith endless replay value and unlimited ways to deal with your friends and foes in a hostile world, Civilization is still considered as the gamer's cocaine from many owners who own the franchise. Still don't have the game?

Trust me!*\n\nAlexander the Great (Greece) reviews the components needed to make the Spaceship. He notices that he needs the engine, but doesn't have the proper technology to obtain this piece for a Scientific victory. Angered at this, he asks his remaining friends for some research agreements to get the tech he needs to win. He gets two from his friends, Ramkhamhaeng (Did I spell that right? Anyway, Siam) and also Pedro II (Brazil) but it wouldn't go into effect for about 30 turns. Alex just groans and begins to switch up his productions and his science so he can aim toward getting that engine. Oda Nobunaga (Japan) then begins to take down Ramesses II's (Egypt) last city, which was his capital. Siam gets angered by seeing that Oda is taking down all of their allies, and attempts to charge at him. Japan was able to sweep his army and destroyed all of his cities with his deadly ability where wounded units still fight at full strength. Pedro II sends a Spy to Oda's capital to see where he will strike next: Him or Alex. Alex and Pedro set up some defenses and attempt to build a wall to defend themself from this unstoppable force. Oda decides to hit Pedro first, and slowly takes down all of his cities, one by one, and took down Rio de Janeiro. The Greek forces began to hold the enemy Marines and Paratroopers off. After a successful ambush by an XCOM Unit, Alexander had some time to finish up the engine technology. The next turn, Sparta and all of the other cities besides Athens were destroyed by Oda's unstoppable force. However, right when Oda was about to charge in and destroy Greece, both Research Agreements were used and got the technology needed. Alex quickly moved all his units away from Athens and used his remaining gold to purchase the engine. It was pricey, but he was able to attach it to the Spaceship. Japanese units were closing in fast, and the Greek soldiers started dying quickly, but right when the artillery was about to fire, they all see the glorius sight of a spaceship flying in the sky and going to space. Oda looks at the spaceship and starts yelling in defeat, knowing that he lost to Greece with a Scientific victory, right when they were about to get a Domination victory.\n\nIn Civilization V, or Civ, those events are actually pretty common. It takes a little while to get used to, but once you get into it, it becomes very addictive to the point you haven't slept in days. Yep, days. My head is pretty rotten right now from playing this, but god, you NEED this game. If you got to purchase any game on Steam for free, make it this. Just buy it. You WILL love it, and I guarantee it. Even if the AI can be annoying... But yeah, just friggin BUY IT.\n\nWhy are you still reading this!? Why haven't bought this game yet? Gandhi is going to NUKE YOU SO HARD, he could just- *whack*\n\nHello, Gandhi here. You better buy this game or else I'm willing to nuke you and your cities. And your family. And your friends. And everyone you know. And just about everyone else on this planet.\n\n11/10","April 10, 2014","true","95.8"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","53","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GriffonDefender/recommended/8930/","GriffonDefender","GriffonDefender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GriffonDefender/","62 products in account","Fireaxis has managed to pull off a fantastic game here - Civilization V has a very in-depth play system that is easy to understand for beginners, and yet complex enough to keep even the most advanced user thinking. The turn-based system is quite fair, though a little bit does rely on luck if you're playing multiplayer (Who gets to host is 1st player, and thus gets "Priority" on wonders, so if both you and player 1 have 1 turn left on The Great Library, Player 1 will get it first), but I personally play a lot of singleplayer. The bot difficulty level increases at a high rate as you go up - 1 is basically playing against yourself, 2 may be challenging for someone learning the game, 3 is an ok difficulty, though still a bit easy, 4 is the equivalent of a moderately skilled human player, and 5 has the tactic of a skilled player, plus extra science/food/production, so I personally play on level 4. I won't go into details about levels 6-8, because I've never tried them, nor do I plan to in the near future.\nThe UI is quite user-friendly - If there is an action that needs to be done, it will show up in the lower-right corner just above the minimap. There are 4 "advisors" that help new players understand what to build, and how it will benefit them, as well as whether or not to attack an enemy unit, and even who you may stand a chance against in a total war!\nSpies also add a new level of strategy to the game, as you must decide whether you will try to steal technology from other people, or if you will protect your own technology. Then you add spy promotions, in which Recruits will almost always be beaten by Agents, who will almost always be beaten by Special Agents. By changing spies around that have different promotions, you can achieve a different level of defense and offense in espionage. For example, if you want to steal from a country that has lots of tech, but you just want intrigue about another nation that has little tech, you can send your Special Agent over to the country that has lots of tech, and your Recruit to the other nation.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun game, the only drawback is it's price, but if it ever goes on sale, it is definitely worth picking up if you're into strategy games.","October 16, 2014","true","315.3"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","51","55","0","1"

Civilization is one of the best games I've ever played if I want to go casual or have a little thinking. From trade routes to the welfare of your people. From allies with other civilization to building a utopia. And from building an army to starting wars- Wait, those start tears. You play as a random leader (Or pick a leader) with various units and skills and you try to build the perfect civilization or beat the other players (Other civilization) in a war until you are the last one alive. You have to worry about gold income, happiness of your people, and the welfare for the population to go up and a growing civilization. What I really like is the personality of each of the AI playes if you play solo (I think it can happen in multiplayer too). As for the victory, so far, you have to build a utopia (Adopt 5 full policy) or be the last civilization. And that means, you guessed it, war. It is also a game of trust if a civilization likes you or not (Or a player decides).\n\n\nInteresting facts:\nGeorge Washington adopted communist in the year of 1400 AD.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a huge a-hole around other civilizations and declares war after being on their good side.\nAskia Mohammad is friendly even if he is carrying a sword and has a burning kingdom behind him.\nMohandas Gandhi has disposable nukes in his closet.\nSources: This game","October 1, 2014","true","42.1"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","30","32","2","0"

You can destroy your foes in a Domination Victory with your army, you can use education and science to win in a Science Victory, or maybe try for a different victory. Whether your more of a warmongering player or a peaceful player, Civ 5 is a great game to play with friends, family or maybe just randoms. You can make allies, enemies, or maybe just friends (that may or may not backstab you!) with other civilizations. You can explore the world and settle more cities to expand your civilization more, research technologies to unlock more features, make money by trading luxury resources and other stuff, and make wonders that will help your civilization in different ways. The game is also newb-friendly, as the guiders will help you grow your civilization through your first and upcoming journies. If you've played the previous Civ's, you're probably going to like Civ 5. The DLC "Brave New World" makes Civ 5 a whole lot better, such as it completely changes culture victories which makes it more interesting and fun overall to acomplish a Culture Victory. It adds more civilizations and wonders, and changes the way you make money by actually making you make trade routes with other civilizations or City-States to make money. However, the vanilla game without DLC is still pretty good. I, personally believe the game (and DLC) is worth the money.\n\nOverall, I rate this game 10/10.","November 1, 2014","true","452.6"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","1"

At first, the game can be very intimidating. You have no real idea what to do, and you just go with the flow. You soon realize the mistake you've done, as you get crushed by your opponents. After a couple of games versus the AI, you start the comprehend the way you should go about playing, and the game starts shining. It's very fun to play alone (I've personally never played against another person) and there's no timer or anything forcing you to rush and make irrational decisions, so it's very relaxing. There's a lot of different countries you can play as, each one having different traits to bring to the table, making it refreshing to play over and over to try different play styles.\n\nBelieve me, you might say "Just one more turn", but we all know you're lying to yourself.","December 24, 2013","true","28.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

Of course, you could say the same of Civ games of the past, but what makes Civilization V a praiseworthy successor is how it changes up key elements of the franchise. The game's core values--expansion, exploitation, exploration, extermination--are as strong as ever. But the newer tactical combat and addition of city-states give strategy veterans new ways of tackling their goals, while a friendly interface and expansive Civilopedia help newcomers get up to speed relatively quickly. There are a few aspects of Civilization V that could have used a bit more attention, but even as is, this is yet another classic edition to a series that consistently rewards and renovates. If you have even the remotest interest in worldwide domination, you owe it to yourself to get lost in one of the most rewarding turn-based games in years.\n\nAdvantages:\n+ Hours of addictive turn-based glee\n+ Fantastic new tactical combat system\n+ Excellent interface makes it easy to keep track of every aspect of the game\n+ Great automation features allow you to focus on the big picture\n+ Lovely visuals and classical soundtrack\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Inconsistent, overly aggressive AI\n- Scattered annoyances, particularly in multiplayer","June 27, 2014","true","18.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","2"

This game gives you absolute freedom.

Don't know how to start? Your councillors will give you some advice. Don't want to play it only by yourself? You can take your friends to play with you. Moreover, everything is accompanied by various sounds; figures are not static. And what I found really good is that you don't have to do boring quests like:"Build 10 factories and 5 farms", because you decide what to do by YOURSELF.\nI think that everyone, who like strategy games, should try this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/8930/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Whenever a game with as much hype and legacy as Civilization V comes along, it generates a tremendous amount of discussion and debate. Even before the game's release, as snippets and details are discovered, would-be fans are either extolling the virtues of the Greatest Game Ever or decrying the Greatest Travesty of the Gaming World. Some will exclaim that Civilization V is not a Civilization title at all, while others will say it's merely a gussied-up, carbon-copy version of a previous installment. The truth, of course, is always somewhere in between. For me, Civilization V is a very good game, with many elements distilled from previous titles, mixed with a healthy dose of fresh ideas. It's not simply a re-make of an earlier version, and that's not at all what I wanted. It does make some rather major changes to the Civilization brand, and for the most part I found those changes to be solid ones.\n\nSo what's new this time around? First up are the civilizations themselves. Each civilization boasts two unique units and/or buildings, along with a special ability that sets them apart from the rest of the world. CivV has moved away from the mix-and-match Civ traits we saw in earlier games, meaning the special abilities in CivV truly set a civilization apart. For instance, the Iroquois nation gains the ability to use forests contained within friendly territory as roads, while the Aztecs gain valuable culture points with each enemy defeated.\n\nAfter choosing their civilization and setting up the parameters of their game world, players are transported to a beautiful, hex-based world map. I won't wander into the minefield argument here about hex-vs.-square, other than to say that I like the new layout. Being a card-carrying boardgame geek, I feel completely at home with the move to a more...table-topish feel for the game. Civilization V also boasts an alternate view which makes the map simple, clean, and very "old school" in presentation. I prefer to play on the more detailed map, but it's nice to have the option for the other.\n\nAs always, Civilization V is a game of cities. Once a city is planted, it begins "working" the ring of hexes surrounding it. For each level of population in a city, a citizen can be assigned to gather resources from a single hex. Terrain type and special resources dictate how much food, production, and money can be accrued, and each of these are vital to empire expansion. Food determines how quickly a city will grow, production how quickly the city can construct buildings and train units, and money takes care of just about everything else. Through certain buildings, cities also generate Culture to help them expand.\n\nSpeaking of Culture, this value is treated a bit differently in Civ V. Culture points, useful in expanding city influence, also take players down a social technology tree filled with Social Policies. These policies are a set of ten mini-trees, each of which can focus the civilization into a particular style of play. Some are better for war-mongering empires, while others will give a large boost to technology or additional culture. Each step in each tree confers a new bonus, and researching heavily down the Social Policy path is a new victory condition. If players completely research five of the social policies, they gain the ability to research the Utopia Project, culminating in a game-win.\n\nOf course, players still have the tried-and-true technology path toward a space-race victory. The tech tree is the heart of progress in Civilization V, as always. A bit smaller than in previous Civ titles, CivV's tech tree nonetheless offers plenty of difficult choices on the path to victory. Other than offering the player the most powerful units, Wonders, and buildings, the technology path also allows players the ability to construct the Alpha Centauri starship and send it on its way for victory.Of course, a player's civilization doesn't exist by itself in the world. In addition to other civilizations, Civilization V introduces City-States. These minor civilizations cannot achieve victory by themselves, but they can offer some impressive rewards to those civilizations that win their favor. This can be accomplished by gifting money, completing requests for aid or exploration, or even eliminating rival City-States. Each City-State maintains a favor rating for the civilization, and at its highest level a City-State will create an alliance, gifting the civilization with resources and units. Of course, more aggressive players can simply wipe out those pesky upstarts and take the cities for their own.\n\nThose aggressive civilizations will need some armies to accomplish their goals, however. Here is where some of the biggest changes have occurred in the Civilization franchise. Players are now much more limited in the number of units they can field at any given time. Not only do units take much longer to train, many of the more powerful units now require much-limited Strategic  Resources in order to build. No longer does a single iron deposit or oil field allow players unlimited building of swordsmen and tanks--each Strategic Resource point now only gives a few of these vital resources. Players wanting to field a vast array of units must control multiple Strategic Resource locations, a feat with is difficult at best.\n\nGiven the limited amount of units available, each is now much more resilient than before. With a large pool of hit points, units can take several rounds of combat before falling. Ranged units also get quite a facelift--all ranged units can now attack up to several hexes away. Now, attacking an enemy city is much more rewarding than before, with my armies displayed across the fields of battle, each positioned carefully for best combat efficiency.\n\nThe cities are much more durable this time around, as well. Cities now have a defense rating, depending on size, population, and buildings, and they can hold their own in combat even without a garrisoned unit. Cities can also bombard enemy units, weakening forces before they even reach the walls. Even with these defenses, however, a city cannot withstand a siege for terribly long, and so friendly forces will need to be stationed nearby for quick defense.\n\nFor those planning a conquest route, that victory path has also been updated. Now players merely have to ensure that no other civilization is in control of its originally-founded city. This is not as easy as it sounds, of course, but it makes for a quicker victory type than hunting down each and every last unit on the map.Expansion of empires is now kept in check with by the Happiness resource. Happiness, now a global value, decreases each time a new city is founded or a city gains population, with additional cities having a greater penalty than population.\n\nCivilization V looks, sounds, and plays wonderfully. Everything is slick, polished, and very user-friendly. The map is very impressive, while each unit is easily identifiable. The user interface allows players to quickly locate any information, unit, or city easily and without fuss. I even liked the new Leader animations, with each speaking in their native tongues. Being a veteran of the series, I was able to quickly jump in and get going, even with all the changes made this time around. Plentiful tooltips and a detailed Civlopedia allowed me to wrap my mind around most of the concepts within my first hour of play.\n\nCivilization V is, once again, going to consume countless hours of my life in turn-based bliss. With the "boardgame" feel and the slick, polished features, I know I'm in for many sleep-deprived mornings. Fans of the series, or turn-based 4X games in general, will have a blast with this for a long time to come. And while it might be a little daunting to newcomers, Civilization V is also a great place for those who might want to wet their feet in the 4X pool.","January 2, 2014","true","662.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

There they were, the great Khan and the great Ghandi marching side by side down a path  towards my empire! I the great Paccal, of course, could not let this great transgression aside. So I talked to my great correspondent Frezdful calfrul and asked him for holy advice. He, by smoking a green plant and drinking the blood of sheep, had great premonitions and then told me only by sacrificing my relatives that I could defeat the great evil headed towards my empire. My unbreakable belief in my correspondent lead me to an awakened power deep within the bottom half of my body and there I was flaying my relatives and sacrificing them towards the great sun king. This, of course, manifested a great power within myself. I became ferrocia the great lizard king. I uttered a few words "feerotoa aoiasjiogjoiasj" and by doing those measly acts I increased my kingdom's science output to >9000 and construction to >9000 and built many troops over my 5 city large empire.

How I'm in love with history of humankind? Or how Sid Meier made a deity of history-based sandbox games? Nope, there are too little space for that.\nDo we need some comparisons, like with Paradox games or Total War series? Nah, they are distinct. Too many details, too narrative. Those games are awesome, no doubt, but not in an aerial way, like Civilization does.\nMain catch of this game is in its simplicity. Everybody can rule an empire there. Though, it's a sandbox, it has a different face for every player. You want to rage a war and hold the whole world under your color - do that. Or you want to be in peace with everybody? Oh, you can do that too, in dozens of variants. Dozens? I mean, thousands! The devil is in the details, you know.\n\nCivilization V - is a peak of long lasting walk. I liked first and second games, especially second, those fundamentalists are gorgeous. I'm still prefering third Civilization, when I'm going for domination victory. Fourth game feels like Win Vista to me... Overall, fifth Civ game - the most complex and balanced of all. Cultural achievments, market deals, political unions, and religion issue - all are far better than before. If I was supposed to play in one game for life, there are good chances that I'd picked that one.\n\nOne thing I have to add - no matter what strategy you want to use: make a Louvre and Hermitage full of stuff, build a spaceship, or run the league of nations - you want an army. Your army. Every strong player could tell you that. History tells you that. Today news, like Ukranian story, telling you the very same. If you don't feed own army, soon you're gonna be feeding somebody else. Si vis pacem, para bellum.\n\nPeace, people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narukoopa/recommended/8930/","narukoopa","✯ Narukoopa™ ✯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narukoopa/","178 products in account","All of my reviews are based around my personnal opinion, they're not swayed by a majority of people liking or disliking it.\n\nRelease:  23 Sep, 2010\nGenre:  Strategy\nDeveloper:  Firaxis Games\nPublisher:  2K Games\nMode(s):  Single-player, Mutliplayer\n\nBetter than  Sid Meier's Civilization IV\n\nWorse than  Nothing. Maybe going outside? Nah, its better than going outside.\n\nTL:DR\nWhat can I say? After almost six years this game still holds many hours of enjoyment. Civ 5 is one of those unique games that can hold the interests of any type of gamer. There are different civilizations to choose from, each with it's own real historic leader. Each map is randomly generated according to the settings you've given it. For example, you can set the map to be split into several islands, or have it all on one big island. There are different difficulty settings to choose one to fit your style. There is a lot in this game that can't really be covered in this review, but if you want a beautifully drawn, strategic and challenging game, this is definitely for you. A must try!\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nNOTE:\nDidn't include Story because there isn't one, and didn't include gameplay because it's more or less covered in the 'About' section.\n\nAbout\nAs I mentioned before, Civ 5 is a turn-based strategy game that puts you in the posistion of a leader of a civilization. You decide everything. You decide where to settle your cities. You decide what to build in them. You decide what to research. You can be a civilization thats all about making wealth and culture, or you can be a civilization thats hellbent on destroying others. All of this is up to you. You have dozens of settings to choose from, all layed out in a way that shouldn't be confusing. As mentioned earlier, each map is randomly generated, all according to the settings you've applied. For example, You can have a small map with only a couple of civilizations inside it.\nThe game is set into a turn taking genre. Each turn, you'll be able to move your units to a certain distance, then the next turn move them further. Building and researching also takes turns. You can also change the pace of these turns, whether they be quick, or longer.\nAs well as civilizations, there are other people in the world with you. You have City States that are smaller versions of civilizations and are bound to only one city, and you have Barbarians, that will move around the map raiding city states and that will sometimes attack you.\nAll of this is only a portion of whats in the game. Your civilization, your choice.\n\nDesign & Graphics\nOne of my favourite things about this game is the way it is designed. You have beautiful landscapes in every game you load. From plains to hills and even oceans, all designed beautifully. Each civilization you meet sends you to a cinematic page where you talk to the civilization's leader, each with a beautifully drawn background. Units are designed with great detail, and not to mention, the iconic wonders you can build based off real famous landmarks like Stonehenge and The Pyramids.\nAs to be expected, it doesn't take a super powerful PC to run this game. I can run it just fine on maximum settings. The worst you could get is probably the minor stutter between turns. Other than that, its fine as far as I know.\n\nUI [User Interface]\nThis is where Civ 5 gets a lot more in-depth. When you load a game you will notice a lot of buttons around the screen. Each one has its own purpose, which might make players a little bit overwhelmed to begin with. But, with tutorials enabled, the game pretty much tells you what this is and what you do here the moment you click on the button. Settings are easy to navigate, should you need to edit anything. If you consider buying the dlc for this game, the UI does change a bit, with buttons moving to different places and new ones appearing. Again this is covered by tutorials so you shouldn't have to worry.\n\nSoundtrack\nI just had to mention this because this is my favourite thing about this game. Each civilization has their own soundtrack, a lot of which is actual famous tunes. When you're at peace, you have relaxing and calm music, composed of strings and woodwind instruments, and when you're at war you have dynamic and thrilling music composed of horns and drums. There is a huge variety of tunes all right for the perfect moments. If you ever get the chance, I would highly recommend just sitting back and listening to it.\n\nPros - Huge amount of content\n- Beautifully drawn\n- Outstanding soundtrack\n- Plenty of replayability\n- Educational if you want to learn about the leaders :)\n- Very relaxing\n\nCons - Multiplayer could be better\n\nFinal Recommendation\nI've played this game for years now, even before I came on Steam, and I can say that I still haven't got bored, and I doubt I ever will. The best strategy game and one of my favourite games of all time. It can be unrealistic, like having Gandhi build nukes, but at the same time it can be mildy addicting, playing with or without friends. If you're after the perfect strategy game, this is the one to pick!\n\nFinal Verdict - 10/10.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2EDj8yfMoQ\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading my review and I hope it was of some help to you.\nIf it was make sure to give it a thumbs up!\n\nYou can also check out my other reviews here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/narukoopa/recommended/\n\nBe sure to join my group for more reviews like this one - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/narukoopasfriends\n\nThanks for Reading!","April 2","true","144.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/8930/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nSid Meier’s Civilization V is one of the best Strategy games I have ever played, period. I struggled to get into the Medieval total war games, however I’ve been playing the Civilization games since I was twelve-years-old.\nThe game is rather expensive, and to get all the achievements you need to get a fair amount of DLC, I purchased Civ5 Gold edition, so I was forced to also buy the “Brave New World DLC”. So fair warning; if you’re after everything, expect the DLC trick.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  There are three main aspects to Sid Meier’s Civilization V, 1) Single Player Matches, 2) Single player Scenarios, 3) Multiplayer Matches.\nAs single player you may select from a list of nations to play as, you may chose as Rome, Greece, Germany, the United States, Russia, England, and many others. You play against other NPC’s, you can choose your map size, map style, and other specialized options.\nIn the scenarios you are usually given a choice of nations that were in that scenario, often times the scenarios are historic events, such as the conquest of Genghis Khan, 1066 conquest of England, or the Fall of Rome.\nLastly, in Multiplayer you can have a battle of wits against your friends; you can play co-op on the same computer, or play online with your steam friends. This mode is definitely an incentive for people whom are more competitive.\n\nGame Play:  As I’ve elaborated already, you can choose your country, be sure to read the perks that country has, certain countries are more effective at certain things. Some countries start out with special units, others get bonuses from conquering barbarians, and still others get great benefits’ from city-states.\nThe game has a lot to keep in mind while you play; thankfully the game has “advisors” which help you get used to the game really fast. They always pitch in their opinions and explain what’s happening in the game. Are you an advanced player and tired of hearing them say the same things over and over? No problem! Just disable them in the options menu in game.\nYou start with building your first city which becomes your capital, and then you build armies, settlers to build more cities, workers, buildings, wonders, and much, much more.\n\nAchievements: I wouldn’t be consistent and true to my nature if I didn’t add notes about achievements in my reviews, let’s face it, many of the achievements in Civ5 are a grind, win as every nation, play as every map size and type, chop down 1,000 tree tiles… A lot of these achievements aren’t particularly interesting, however I enjoyed them greatly, and many people who might be looking to get away from grinding might prefer to avoid this game for the achievements alone.\nMany other achievements are very challenging to get, at this time I haven’t started to work on getting Deity (the hardest difficulty) achievements, but many of those achievements are very difficult to get, and often times require some tricks you pick up from playing.\n\nPrice: As I have already indicated, expect this game to be rather pricy, the “vanilla” (original) version of the game is $29.99. If you are just looking to play a strategy game, I think that’s a fair price for the amount of time you can put into this game. But to get more enjoyment out of your game, the DLC does bring new scenarios, new nations, and new elements to the game that really makes the game just that more dynamic.\nIf you are looking for the whole set, I would recommend buying the Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Complete Edition. It’s standard price is $49.99, I would also recommend waiting for a price reduction either on Christmas or the Summer Steam Sale, or keep your eyes open for a Humble Bundle sale.\n\nConclusion:  While the game might be expensive I have personally put 219 hours into the game at this time, for me that’s the mark of a good game (And having great replayability), if you enjoy playing it enough that you hit the 200 hours mark. I have enjoyed the quality of the game, the game style, playing it with my friends and family, and enjoyed getting the various achievements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loopuleasa/recommended/8930/","loopuleasa","loopuleasa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loopuleasa/","252 products in account","Civilization: The bread and butter of turn-based strategy games. The absolute pinnacle of eye-needling, back-breaking thousand upon thousand of turns over the course of what I think are the longest "games" you'll ever play. The only game that's longer than a Civ marathon game is life itself.\n\nAs a huge (pirate) player of Civ4 + expansions I must say I am pleasently surprised with Civ5. I though it was lacking the depth the fourth had, but in reality it's just overall better; (everything probably due to the fact that death stacks are no longer in the game)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9/10 Strategy - if you're a fan of anything that involves tactics, macro-managing, resource-management, general strategy you'll feel at home in this game. Everything is so smooth and straightforward you'll be dying to pass the test of time and try your best to emerge victorious as the greatest civilization. Skill roof is damn high and it's one of those games that's hard to master. Definitely a collosus of the strategy community.\n\nCons: AI in the game is barely potty-trained. It just follows a given route most of the time and it's painstakingly predictable once you played a lot.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8/10 Multiplayer - Awarded a 7.5 because multiplayer, as a concept for this game,is impossible without dedication and a group of friends to meet-up around the clock at various points during a week to pick up on "the last save". It's hard to set up, but boy it's so much fun. Really worth going for multi.\n\nSingleplayer rocks a lot if you don't manage to find friends.\n\nCons: Time consuming, difficult to maintain a game or find people who will.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10/10 Game Mechanics - Combat and tactics are just so satisfying compared to old Civ games. Tech advances are meaningful. Territorial management makes you feel like you own your civilization. Balance is properly set, with the exception of the "spawn roulette" that will obviously give random locations with random benefits and resources. Maps are great. Modding community went to space and there's a lot to be imported from their work. Learning curve can go through your regular linear graphs. Everything is intuitive and easy to learn. One game that has a whole lot of depth.\n\nCons: Haven't found any negatives on the game mechanic side\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9/10 UI and Graphic style - Everything is smooth as butter. The Devteam have done a great job with this game and everything is polished. Graphic style fits beautifully with the nature of the game and it doesn't distract you from the important part: the game itself.\n\nCons: I would love to have more data and info instead of this minimalism, but that's just me\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDLCs aren't that great, the only real advantage for me would be the modding community, that usually moves fast towards modding the expansions.\n\nCons: DLC/Expansions. They cost money and divide the community.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBig fan of this game and the series. Few games have managed to make me wish for "one more turn" until the sun rose the second day and my clock showed me 7 AM, and this is one of those games.\n\nThe great heir to the previous stellar game and I recommend it to anyone with any of the following:\n- time on his hands\n- great love for strategy\n- great love for turn-based games\n- some playful love of history\n- friends you can play with\n- money to spare (check discounts if possible)\n\n~  ~  ~  ~  9 / 10  ~  ~  ~  ~","June 29, 2013","true","174.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","4"

No micromanaging 50,000,000,000 things per turn later in the game, unlike other turn-based strategy games like Rome: Total War II. A lot of game mechanics are autonomous, making smooth turn-by-turn play.\n\n2. Nicola Tesla is a Great Engineer in this game. He has done some great stuff for humanity, if you aren't aware.\n\n3. There is a Game Of Thrones mod for this game. There are freakin' Game Of Thrones factions and characters in it. That is amazing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/8930/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","UPDATED 2014\n\nOriginally, I said in my review in 2011: "Pretty good, but lacking a lot of features from Civ IV, reminds me more of a remake of Civ II at its core. Still as super addictive as the rest of the franchise with a few new twists.... Lots of DLCs to waste your money on too!"\n\nFast forward to 2014, with more than a few hundred hours played under my belt, the game is officially complete with multiple small DLCs & balance/fix patches plus the 2012 & 2013 feature expansions in Gods & Kings and Brave New World which have significantly changed the gameplay. There are now a massive number of civilizations to choose too, not to mention a massive number of tailored scenarios to challenge you!\n\nThe major expansions particularly, have really rounded the game off nicely, reintroducing many of the earlier missed features from Civ IV. Introduced more new things like world congress, advanced trade routes, tourism & cultural 'Great Works' to complement previously missing features like Religion & Espionage. Along with this content there was also balancing out all civilization victory paths providing some unique gameplay options to explore. There remains a more simplified approach to all of this, streamlining many features meaning less micro management. This does make the game more accessible to newer players, but in some ways feels perhaps too simplified now. It would have been good to still have more advanced micro management for those that are up to the challenge.\n\nAlthough more simplified game design, you will find more things to keep you busy. More end game content for example to cover those dull periods where things become stagnent. Then there is off course the huge number of achievements to unlock, many of which offer a true challenge (and sometimes a bit of luck!).\n\nOverall, even 4 years on from my first game, it is a game I always end up going back to. That is rare in the current generation of disposable gaming.\n\nIt is the most enjoyable & rewarding strategy game around bar none!\n\nJust one more turn....\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","May 28, 2011","true","596.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I had constructed the Great Wall, and I had over 30 ground units and 50 Naval Units.\nNeedless to say, I was the most powerful player in the game.\n\nWhile exploring the rest of the Earth however, I met Catherine the Great, the leader of the Russian people.\nShe was the most beautiful person I ever laid my eyes upon.\n\nSadly, I couldn't understand her because she was, well, Russian.

Civilization V is the latest, and arguably the greatest in the series.  Lots of leaders to pick from, and every expansion has added a lot of depth to the game.  With several victory conditions and different civilizations with their own strengths and weaknesses to choose from, replayability is endless.  Playing with friends in a FFA against AI's civs for hours at a time is also fun.  Highly recommended if you're a turn-based strategy fan.","December 1, 2013","true","366.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/julioc95/recommended/8930/","julioc95","Julio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/julioc95/","235 products in account","Dwarved by the expectations of feature-hungry fans and a remarkably successful history, the Civilization series is one of the last bastions of traditional, turn-based 4X strategy games, perhaps acting as the sole major life support for an increasingly whittling genre.\n\nIn retrospect, it is a game that initially failed on many fronts. Upon launch it was rightly heavily criticised for under-performing in many aspects that Civ 4 had proudly refined - trading, religion, and diplomacy, amongst others. However, with the addition of both expansions, "Brave New World" and "Gods and Kings", Civ 5 recovered most of the features it had lost or underdelivered on. Regardless, issues regarding bugs, illogical AI, poor performance, online connectivity issues and abusively priced DLC remain open wounds to this very day. Firaxis has now had 4 years to deal with at least some of the game's remaining problems, but have instead neglected them, preferring to focus on Civilization: Beyond Earth.\n\nOverlooking the aforementioned issues, however, will reveal a deep, rewarding, well paced game in which planning ahead is rewarded with the chance to steamroll enemy civilisations. Victories can be achieved either using culture, tourism, science, military force, or diplomacy, laying the groundwork for day-long matches that can twist and turn whilst simultaneously providing endless intrigue, machiavellian scheming and gargantuan military campaigns. Rushing to build the next World Wonder is often equally as thrilling as pillaging a hostile city's tiles whilst trading with allied civilisations for emergency gold supplies in order to purchase those last few bombers needed to take the heavily fortified city. Should you prefer to take a more Littlefinger-esque approach, spies can steal technology, manipulate voting and even provide political intrigue and military intelligence; embargoes can cripple trade-based economies; even international congress votes can be traded for luxuries, resoruces and cities. Allegiances are frequently earned and lost, ensuring the game is never predictable, and with the seemingly endless policies, technologies, units and ways to turn your initial settlers into a sprawling, international empire, Civilisation 5 provides plenty of replayability to be a staple of your gaming time for years. Just bare in mind that if you want to get the most out of the game, you will absolutely have to read its built-in wiki to make up for the needlessley steep learning curve and often infuriating lack of vital information.","September 10, 2014","true","206.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Completely serious, here.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's a perfectly realistic simulation.  Far from it.  However, it will quickly demolish any racial and/or nationalistic delusions the player holds and forces them into the harsh reality of why societies succeed or fail - and the fact that most of it comes down to where started out on the map, a few "minor" decisions early on that snowballed into major consequences centuries later, and no small amount of plain random luck.\n\nIt also shows us how technology evolves and the iterative nature of scientific progress.  That is to say it demonstrates how everything is build on top of everything that came before it.   It also demonstrates how the world started off as mostly one big land grab until it ran out of land to grab, and how the timing of our world wars shortly thereafter was almost inevitable.  And, much like real life, how the modern "stalemate" has transformed the nature of war into a class of competing cultures and jockying for position, if only because all the players left on the board are simply too big to be taken down directly.\n\nAs for the game itself, compared to Civ4 the graphics are obviously better.  The new "one unit exclusive" hex mechanic took some getting used to, but in the long run it's still doable and does make unit rotation & survival more important than the old "stack everything to the max" method.  Most important, however, is that this is the Civ game that opened the door to modding and the Steam Workshop - and that makes a world of difference, trust me.\n\nIf Civ5 has one flaw anywhere I'd say it was in not getting Leonard Nimoy to come back & do the tech blurbs for them a second time.  I'd like to hear how that decision was rationalized in the board room.","May 24","true","157.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","10"

Also the multiplayer servers are extremely unreliable, it is very difficult to play out a full game with random players (if everyone in the game is your friend you can save the game regularly, and reinvite everyone when it crashes).\n\nUnlike most strategy games, Civilization V is much more than simply military confrontation/combat. Every player leads one of histories civilizations from the start of time, when military combat is limited to club warriors and ancient archers, and your empire consists of a single, small, undeveloped town, until the information era, by which time the players in the lead would have nuclear weaponry, modern armor, helicopter gunships, internet, and stealth fighters, and your civilization could have over a dozen cities, each up to 50 times larger than your original village.\n\nThe success of your civilization depends not only on your battlefield prowess, although it is a necessary component, but in your ability to build your civilizations economy, science, and culture faster than your neighboring civilizations, and in keeping your civilizations population happy. A serious setback in any of these parameters will affect all of them, and will allow other civilizations in the game to bypass you, and eventually either destroy you or win peacefull through science, culture, or diplomacy.\n\nA major positive about the game, especially in singleplayer, is the diversity of the strategies you can use, with each particular civilzation usually suited only to one or two win conditions.","August 22, 2014","true","871.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

The following seven nights were spent doing nothing but playing Civ, and Civilization 5 embodies nearly all of the same traits and innovations that made the original so great.\n\nI've spent a couple hundred hours last year in Civ5 with Gods & Kings and loved every minute. I recently purchased the newest expansion but haven't completely explored the additional game-mechanics much since even after this long, I'm still trying to master to base games mechanics and the religion that Gods and Kings introduced.\n\nBut over-all, Civ5 is the turn-based strategy game to currently end all turn-based strategy games. If you've never played a Civilization game before, that's just fine, Civ5 can be a perfect introduction to turn-based strategy. Or if you've played all the previous games nearly to death like I have, this game will completely kick-down the door to almost everything you wanted from the other games. The hexagon tiles took a little bit of getting used to for me, but since its something I remember from the first big table-top games I ever played, I don't mind it at all and think it adds a bit of an old school feeling to the board.\n\nThere are a few hang-ups in the animations / unit movements (aircraft orders need an over-haul because they drastically tie up your time in late game in comparison to any other unit) but other than that, graphically Civ5 is beautiful and the board features and resources are about as detailed and distinct as your computer can handle.\nThe sound and music is immersive and high quality as you might expect from an A-list Sid Meier game.\n\nThe interface and controls are almost perfect in my opinion. A couple data-charts are a little bit buried down through the menus, but I can't really complain about that since even "buried down" in the menus at worst only means 2 or 3 layers into readily accessible options anyway. So nothing is very far away. Testament to the games refined user interface, I think, would be the fact that many gamers have easily played Civ5 with a console-gaming style controller with the upcoming SteamBox "living-room PC." And that's definitely saying something substantial when talking about as complex a turn-based strategy game as Civ5.\n\nUltimately, I'd say this would go on my Top 10 of all time. Definitely worth purchasing and supporting the developers who brought it to us.","March 8, 2014","true","77.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Indeed, Civilization V is the kind of game you can sit down, popcorn and soda in hand, and become completely engrossed in political crises, border tensions, and epic battles. While it may not train your reflexes or aiming abilities, you'll certainly find yourself performing insane feats of balance as you try to maintain your Civilization's military defense, culture, scientific advancement, religious development, and economic power. You'll find a game that is admittedly not immediately exciting, but which will involve the player in incredibly complex situations, never playing out the same way each time, always offering a new story.\n\nHowever, there are some valid criticisms worth considering. I will address two primary problems with the game that are connected to smaller issues others have brought up. Firstly, much depth and complexity present in Civilization IV has been stripped from the game, and it shows. In Civilization IV, leaders acted very often according to their historical personalities -- Gandhi would have an aversion to war, wheras Genghis Khan might be attracted to the possibility -- in Civ V, Gandhi will happily crush your entire country to seize your spice resources. The hostility and viciousness of the AI in Civ V, by contrast, detracts from the game's believability. Besides the hostility of the computer players, they are also gloriously stupid, they make insane trade offers, demand whole cities in wartime when they are losing, and capitulate in war when they have the advantage. As deep and involving as the game is, the AI manages to detract from the experience often enough to be worth mentioning.\n\nThe second criticism worth considering is that too often it breaks the spell of depth and plays more like a strategy game. It IS a strategy game yes, but the game is also about civilization, and how complex and wonderfully intertesting human society can be, and sometimes the play to win mentality that is inherent in the game (especially it's AI) as well as many of the players can weaken the game's ability to absorb the player into the story of human civilization.\n\nBeyond these criticisms, the game presents itself well, the interface is much cleaner compared to previous iterations in the series, and the warfare much more interesting. In previous titles, units could be stacked on top of one another, so often the winning of wars came down to who had the most material power to build the biggest unit stacks. As a result of the removal of unit stacking, material power will help, but an ability to position units correctly and actually strategize will win you the battle even in the event you are outnumbered. Thus Civilization V may rightly boast of having the best combat and warfare the series has seen.\n\nHowever shallow the game can be at its' worst, it's intensely engaging and dramatic in the most positive sense at its' best -- every action that is simple or basic in one game is dramatically important in Civilization. For example, moving units close to another Civilization's borders, somewhat tedious and uninteresting at face value, raises the tension as you prepare for an epic war against their evil, imperialistic civilization. In the context of world civilizations, all actions become pronounced and important -- helping the game tell a story of warring global civilizations in crisis rather than simply telling the story of a competitive match between two players, each trying to win.\n\nThat dramatic worldly context is what allows the game to tell such interesting new stories upon each playthrough and definitely what makes the game so incredibly addicting, involving, and engaging. Despite the admittedly valid criticisms, I couldn't possibly recommend this game more.","June 30, 2013","true","574.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

By itself, Civ V is one of the best strategy games I've ever played; with the right mods (of which there are plenty), it becomes truly addictive.\nGenerally, one of my biggest gripes with empire-building games is that your empire supports your military conquests. In CiV, your military supports your empire. I have maybe one game in ten where I'll initiate a war; most of the time, I'm way too busy creating the most dominant empire in the land. And it varies every time: right now I'm pushing a game where my religion covered half the globe; the game before that, my scientific accomplishments were second to none. Every game is different; if you play the same way every time, you're not going to get far.\nI can't emphasize enough how important it is to get both expansion packs. Gods and Kings was praised for adding the religion mechanic, but its primary benefit is a major revamp of the combat system and technology tree that makes both of them so much more neat and logical. Brave New World drastically alters both the culture and the diplomacy victories, and both are for the better, forcing you to put effort into those victories through the whole game.\nAnd get mods. I can't tell you which ones to get, but absolutely get some. As you play the game, you'll start to notice little things you wish it did differently. And 90% of the time, someone's already made a mod to fix that. I'm playing with over a dozen right now. Some make wonders more usable, some add more luxury resources or religions, one of them makes scouts usable past the medieval era and another removes the cap on XP you can get from barbarians, and a whole mess more. I've actually reached a point where I'm mixing and matching my mods based on what type of game I'm trying to run. This game will very likely become my #1 most played game, and pretty much the only thing that's going to stop me from accumulating 1,000 hours in it is Life.

Once you start playing this, you can't stop. Civilization V is just a good game. It has one more turn factor which makes you want to keep playing even when you already won.\n\nSid Meier's Civilization V has very deep and challenging gameplay. You start from scratch with only a settler and a warrior, build your first capital city, then keep building up your nation/empire. From the dark age of 4000 BC, the dawn of human civilization to the modern globalization age of 2000 AD, you forge your empire from a single capital city and then expand and build more city, do research to strengthen your empire in all aspect, create military power for defense purpose or go on a global conquest, and manage your national economy, culture and diplomacy with other faction. Every unit can be leveled up just like an RPG games which make every unit is unique and count. You can even rename those unit when they level up to make them a little more personal. Choose your own path for your civilization, war, peace, culture, science, all will lead you to great victory.\n\nSid Meier's Civilization V has good graphics quality overall. The maps are beautiful. Unit and city has quite good detail. The UI is also great, you can switch between tactical and world map view.\n\nThis game is very great and addicting. Sometimes which is most of the times, even if you already won the game, you still continue playing it. I recommend this.\n\nRating 9/10","September 28, 2013","true","209.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

As this is my first foray into the genre. So I will speak to you in a tone that a posthumous contender in the pursuit of world domination or maybe just I want to build a spaceship guy might use.\n\nI've found this game to be extremely daunting at first but wanting to break its doors down as so many people seem to have hundreds if not thousands of hours playing this game I decided I needed to finally give it a real shot. After 4 and ½ games or so I can easily see why someone spends hundreds of hours in this game. I tried doing the tutorials at first and despite their contrived nature to teach the games mechanics I found them to be constraining my idea of what these games were about to begin with.\n\nSo I decided to jump into a game and just see what happens and figure it out as I went. I started on Beginner difficulty (there is actually one below that but it seems that almost seems like a sandbox of sorts.) I found myself understanding more than I thought I would right off the bat. I ran through 2 games  after about 15-17 hours. I progressively started understanding the tech tree a little more each time. Each time getter better and better. Understanding what I needed to do stave off unwanted attacks as well take cities that were becoming a nuisance to my empire. As well what tiles were good for building cities. Luxuries and resources.\n\nHowever, not everything was understood in the beginning. I didn't actually understand what it was I was supposed to be doing to WIN. After all this was a game and not just an exercise in making the map one color. I actually googled what winning exactly meant in these games and so I came across the 5 ways of 'winning' or victory conditions in Civilization V.\n\nDomination – This requires you to be the last empire still in control of your original capitol.\nScience – This requires building a spaceship and having it launch from your capitol (This is my favorite)\nDiplomatic – This requires that a majority of City States find your empire the most favorable.\nCultural – This requires the you complete 5 trees in the social policy branches.\nTime – This requires you have the highest overall score at turn 500\n\nAt this time I have only won using the Science and Domination conditions. I actually turn off Time condition because after about turn 400 every thing feels very rushed and I find I enjoy Civ in a much greater capacity if things are more relaxed.\n\nThere really isn't much more to say without writing an extensive 1000 page guide should I ever acquire that much knowledge in this realm of game. Its a very addicting game. At no point does someone say I need to go to bed, just one more turn and then proceed to ONLY do one more turn. I now play on Price difficulty which is two higher than beginner and seems to be a nice balance  from what more experienced players have said of relaxing but still difficult gameplay.\n\nTHE GIST\nThis game opened me up to a new genre. One of those genres that some people seem to exclusively play stay for the occasional CRPG or something of the like. I remember one game I played when it was 9pm, I had decided I had played enough and needed to get some other things done. The next time I looked up at the clock it was 3am. I never said I was good at moderation.","March 20","true","45.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

However, just as Civ IV progressed, so did Civ V through the years.  This review reflects Civ V with the 2 expansions (Gods and Kings and Brave New World).\n\nOnce again, we face the "Just one more turn" syndrome that this game has always provided.  This 4x turn-based strategy game continues to evolve by enhancing the multiple victory conditions for the game.  Many scenarios are available and the Steam Workshop for Civ now creates easily assessible mods for the game to increase replayability.  The AI still makes strategic mistakes, but evens out a bit at the higher difficulty levels due to AI bonuses/player penalties,  The end-game has greatly improved over previous iterations of the series due to the enhancements to diplomatic and cultural victory conditions.\n\nThe replayability and replayability of Civ V is so good, that I will nitpick on a couple of areas for improvement (and mods are out that resovle this too).  Those improvement areas are to make the different cultures even more unique (more unique looks between the cultures) and speeding up the preformance on huge maps.  Otherwise, this Civ V with the DLCs is an excellent game that will take up just one more turn.","January 18, 2015","true","756.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Theres a really nice feel and charm to watching your units fight it out, esp sending bombers to far away cities, or maybe a nuke. Sending some crossbowman to rain arrows down on bandits, or parachuting marines across Islands and so on..\nThe fights just taking place on the campaign maps also lets the game be extremely well polished as its just one genre/area to work on, unlike say the TotalWars which are real-time and turn-based in one, and leads to a jack of all trades but master of none, as we all know how janky the TW series is.\n\nWell Civ5 is the fecking master alright, Brilliant game and daftly addicting. Got it in Crimbo sale and I've not played much else since.\n\nBuy it, its in humble-bundle right now for silly cheap price.

I was VERY sceptical about CivV. After CivIV, I thought it couldn't be better, and when I first saw CivV, I decided to stick to IV. The vanilla game is....unfinished. There are features missing you'd find in other civ games in the base game, like religion. With Gods and Kings, the game finally becomes playable and is somewhat good. But after buying Brave New World, I can finally say this game is worth it.\n\nWith all the features it gives you, CivV is a great 4x strategy game offering countless hours of fun. Damn, with all the DLCs and expansions, i can't even say which is better, IV or V. Compared to previous civilization games, I have to mention the new features like Social Policies and Ideologies and caravans, which are great and work really well. Civ V is also much easier to get into for new players than previous Civ games.\n\nCity states are a new feature as well. Being friends with them brings you various benefits, but you can play the bad guy as well and annex the hell out of them.\n\nReligion is very well made. You practically make your own - select symbol, name it and select perks which give you various bonuses. You can also reform it later and add more perks.\n\nDespite my initial doubts, the change from squares to hexes helped the game to feel more vivid. Changes to war unit system (no more multiple military units on one field) make the war more strategical and you can actually change the balance of power in the late game (unlike in CivIV where war in late game meant stalemate no matter how much units you pumped in) . I love how the culture is remade. It not only expands your cities but you also buy social policies with it. And what's more, with BNW you also generate tourism which can culturally influence other civilizations and take them over.\n\nIn short: if you like 4X strategies, get the complete edition of CivV. It's totally worth it.\n\nPros:\nLooks good\nWith BNW, it's a true successor of Civ series\nCity states, social policies and all other new features are very well made and fit together very well\nIt's so good it's a timesinker.\n\nCons:\nAI turns take long to compute\nCould be better optimized (but no stuttering or lags, rather textures unloading and reloading etc.)\nMods not working in multiplayer (although they should according to their description)\nIt's so good it's a timesinker.","February 22, 2014","true","186.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

They have successfully created a game that I believe to be one of the greatest strategy games of all time. From it's beautiful designed map to its incredible well layed out and detailed UI, the game is almost flawless.\n\nIn Civ 5 you have a range of empires to pick from and options that allow you to change map layout, size and much more. Once you begin you will start with small city set 4000 years BC from here you build up that city and create others over time as they grow you will be jumping from technology to technology beginning with simple techs like pottery and ending in the future with a space race and giant machines. With little to complain about and so much to be positive about this game is a must have for fans of the strategy genre.","March 15, 2014","true","373.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","2"

This is the kind of game that almost literally sucks you in and immerses you in it's gameplay. Few games have the ability to keep you so focused that you lose track of time completely.\n\nOne beautiful aspect of Sid Meier's Civilization V is how the game presents win conditions. In many games today, you're only given one option to finish a job and that's usually the option of killing everything on the screen. That isn't the case with Civ V.\nWhile you can fight your way to the top, you can also get through the game using clever diplomacy. Maybe instead of diplomacy you'd rather develop your country's scientific endeavors to win the space race. You might be the kind of person who prefers art and culture, though, so you could also focus on that and become the most cultured civilization ever known.\nAll of these options are completely valid for clearing the game.\n\n...And you will be clearing the game quite often because the replay value is tremendous. I thankfully bought all of the DLC while it was on sale, but the DLC is some of the best I've seen. After going through the base game several times, the added content took all of the weaknesses of the original game and revamped them into wonderful strengths.\n\nOverall, Civilization V has incredible value and it's nearly guaranteed you'll be spending a few nights huddled near the glow of your monitor with a bowl of microwaved food.","July 30, 2014","true","115.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IMWarden/recommended/8930/","IMWarden","Warden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IMWarden/","123 products in account","There's no other game quite like it (even EU IV/CK). Has a lower learning curve in comparison, but it's still a sizable beast to conquer; there are lots of intricate mechanics and strategies you can find yourself learning hundreds of hours into the game. Oh, and it takes forever to finish a game even on Quick so if you're the impatient type, this game may not be for you unless you go Duel/Quick every game.\n\nMP is fun. AI becomes much too predictable, so introducing the unpredictability of human thinking into the equation naturally mixes things up. The team mechanics for Co-op are interesting at first, but besides sharing beakers for research, there really isn't much to it and you often end up fighting for things like wonders, land and city-states like any competitor would. Also, no achievements can be unlocked through MP (except the one...), which is mind-boggling. As someone who dislikes the AI, it is annoying having to jump back into SP to get the achievements I would otherwise have received through normal play.\n\nBalance wise, there are some aspects that could be improved; there are obviously superior wonders, civs, even resources (I'm looking at you, salt), as well as obviously inferior ones like Angkor Wat, Denmark and most of the plantation luxuries. Some units also have pretty crappy ugprade routes -- Pikeman, the most accessible and strongest Medieval melee unit suddenly becomes an at-best situational anti-cavalry Lancer, and the Crossbowman, also the most accessible and strongest Medieval ranged unit becomes a one range Gatling Gun. Range is huge in this game, so increasing the damage in compensation for the lost one tile of range is like cutting someone, then offering them a band-aid.\n\nTechnical specifications wise, the graphics are a nice upgrade from IV (and for a game released in 2010, it's fair). Some of the music is pretty awesome, but they're easily forgettable and as I already listen to other music while I'm playing, turning off the music hasn't impacted me at all.\n\nAll in all, a 9/10. I know most of my review has been negative, but anything not mentioned here, I generally endorse.

It is nice to see in Civ5 that it is possible to evolve the franchise without losing most of the ideas that made you love the original games.\n\nWe still have Civilopaedia, which is a nice way to learn a bit of history. We still have the wonders, and now they improve lots of stuff. We still have to think 5 turns ahead, because one wrong move may leave your army and cities too vulnerable. We still have the Spaceship and the Conqueror finales, and now have another 3 ways to win the game.\n\nThe different finales, together with the huge amount of playable civs makes the game challenging for many replays. I finished about 20 games and still have lots of achievements to get.\n\nIt is also nice that it is possible to run the game even in slow PCs, albeit there is a big loss of visual quality. But still, the fun of this turn-based game compensates.\n\nIn the Brave New World DLC, there is a major overhaul, because of the inclusion of tourism. I suggest you get the complete edition, so there is no problem when trying to play online.

When it dropped in 2010, I couldn't play it on even medium settings as I tried out the demo.  Well, being an all or nothing guy, I didn't want it until I had a PC capable of playing it at max. settings with no hiccups.\n\nThat wasn't the only thing keeping me from the game, but the announcement of the new hexagonal grid and one military unit per tile rule, I was massively sceptical and honestly didn't think I would go for it.\n\nWell, after waiting 4 years and playing religiously for the past week after purchasing it, I can gladly say it's the best move the series has made.  I cannot believe I never noticed how mundane stacking 20 units to a tile was, to easily vanquish the enemy without thought.  Now, thinking and tactics come into play, and you have to know each unit's attributes, advantages and disadvantages, and suddenly the game series with extrordinary depth, just became that much deeper and more addictive.\n\nIt's not without some faults, that even with the most recent patch after years of its release, still haven't been fixed.  Like for instance, if you have no ground military unit in a city, good luck accessing your missiles and other air units.  But these are minor and hardly take away from the yet another incredible addition (or should I say addiction?) to the franchise.\n\n10/10, will rack up far more than the current 47 hours I've put into it, when all is said and done.\n","June 19, 2014","true","473.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

You select a civilization, start a city, and build your empire in many ways. Unlike some strategy games, Civilization V can be won in more than one way. These victories are: Cultural, Scientific, Diplomatic, Time and Domination. With the several different types of victory, this in turn shapes how you play the game, giving way to some unique strategies.\n\nWhile the base game may not come with nearly as much content as it would with the two expansion packs, it's still sufficient enough to have lots of fun with. It would be in your BEST interest to get one, or both, of the expansion packs for Civilization V. They add much new content, ranging from civilizations to changing some aspects of gameplay (i.e traderoutes in Brave New World)\n\nI find myself playing for hours on end, even if I play the game on quick. There's no shortage of gameplay here, and you'll always be coming back for just that one extra turn.\n\nThe modding community. It exists. It's great. Always an added bonus to any game: modding support, and a large modding community. As you may have noticed in the Tools section of the Steam Library, Civilization V comes with its own SDK (Source Development Kit) to assist you in making mods and maps. Maps are very simple to make, and modifying the games XML format files requires merely a text editor. XML is a fairly simple data storing language, and can be modified quite easily. If you decide to get more into modifying the game and get lost, there are many guides online to help you through your journey.\n\nI whole heartedly recommend getting Sid Meier's Civilization V for yourself, especially when on sale. It's a bargain you can't beat.\n\n\n\n***There are some minor setbacks to the gameplay, such as experiencing slightly elongated waiting periods after pressing the next turn button during the  late-game period. This may or may not be because of my older hardware (going on 7 years), and more often then not doesn't show up at all.\n\n***I've not been experiencing any elongated waiting periods as of approximately July 2014.

It's a bargain you can't beat.\n\n\n\n***There are some minor setbacks to the gameplay, such as experiencing slightly elongated waiting periods after pressing the next turn button during the  late-game period. This may or may not be because of my older hardware (going on 7 years), and more often then not doesn't show up at all.\n\n***I've not been experiencing any elongated waiting periods as of approximately July 2014. I currently run the game on maximum settings at 1920 x 1080 resolution.","June 9, 2014","true","750.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

From what I have seen, Civ5 seems much more suitable for newcomers, with a less overly complicated UI and overall gameplay. It's not too simple though as 70+ hours in, I'm still using new tactics by using new aspects of the game to reach my goal. This is THE BEST strategy game I have ever played and without potentially 100s of hours of content with dozens of civs, maps, randomization, mods and more, this is a game I would recommend for ANYONE, strategy fan or not.

Get a giant earth map, add a dozen or two opponents and fight for world domination!\nDo you want to start your own religion and watch it spread across the globe like a true pandemic? Well start one, send off your missionaries and start an inquisition, you will be Supreme Pope of Your-Cult-Name-Here soon!\nDo you want to play out historical battles throughout the history? Well, not much else to be said than: you can!\n\nSome people might enjoy setting the difficulty setting all the way down, and steamrolling their opponents; others might do the opposite and try for the challenge of beating the game with a severe handicap. Playstyle plays a huge part in how you will enjoy Civ5, but once you start a map, it is as if it will never end.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game has both upsides and downsides, when playing with others you need to coordidnate who does what, and it can trim parts of the game from your own experience (as in, you have to share certain wonders, it is not beneficial to have multiple religions and it will suck fighting for superiority). Beyond that, it can be great divvying up an opponents land between you and your friend, for example.\n\nGet Civilization V. It is definitely one of my all-time favorites.\n/One more turn.","April 18, 2014","true","376.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","7","8","8","0"

It certainly requires tactics, which fills my gaping cassum of desires like a big bottle of cider. This type of gameplay is simple and soothing like a plane pilot before screaming mayday, at least at first before you're cursed and find yourself coerced into huge wars that go on longer than my drinking at any bars.\n\nWith multiples nations that don't have much hesitation, one awkward gaze and you'll be bashed into a haze by five of the loons, when you're just armed with a pair of spoons. But with some mates in sight things became alright at least while they survive, sometimes they wouldn't be alive long.\n\nThe blood thirsty nations flood you with all the troops they can spare in large scoops, all because you have the kingdom that is up roaring in applause, or you made the mistake to rake one of the smaller nations for their creations that everyone hated and requested to be berated anyhow. No such thing as peace, in this huge game of chess that you are at cease with 1 piece on the board of the many stored that are civilizations that resulted in nothing but huge cremations. If you make nice and not threaten anyone, but before you're beaten they'll practically speak some random squeak and before anything can be prepared, you see it pop up "WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED."\n\nBut don't worry with technologies at hand, aided by the religious doxologies from downloadable content, that adds a congress that is not flawless. The leaders gang in times where I'd prefer them to hold a revolver to my head with a loud bang. Unless you're rich and not stuck looking like a dip switch, you have not many delegates from a few city states to aid you because you got in heated debates to embargo you or not.\n\nWith friends of course in the end it is fun, just sometimes extremely laggy but seemly unnoticed when the turns take longer everyone gets stronger, each person having a massive army which makes the enemy become quite barmy, moving them all sometimes lasts until next fall, but we never cared because we shared each other’s help while hearing the enemy yelp, while the staffing got left to clean up the mess we were laughing and heading to the next target that'd inevitably have a bloody carpet.\n\nOtherwise can recommend.","September 30, 2014","true","300.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Even if you have less than four players in your match, you will still crash frequently. Multiplayer is not designed well on this game, there are too many gamebreaking glitches to name of which can only be done in multiplayer games. This is because the developers did not pay much attention to polishing this portion of the game, since they seem to have been very busy releasing the 15 (!) pieces of DLC which were made for this game. This DLC has only divided the very tiny multiplayer community further because it can be hard to find a match of people who have the same DLC as you.\nThe singleplayer is where this game shines, the developers obviously spent a huge amount of time polishing this portion of the game, and this is what gives it replay value. You can easily spend six hours on a single game of Civilization V and still want to play more. There are a few balance problems however these are relatively small.\nOverall Civilization V is my favorite game despite some of the game's shortcomings.","April 5, 2014","true","298.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Well then look no further, friend. Welcome home.  Civilization's 5th iteration is a great entry in this franchise and is addictive as it is fun.  Prepare to loose many hours.  Some may tell you this one is a weaker game than 4 or not worth playing without all the DLC.  I am not really in that group. I had a lot of fun with the vanilla game. The expansions add depth to mid and late game stages and provide more options for victory, along with new civilizations (each which has its own perks).  If you have even a mild itch for strategy games then press buy.\n\nAlso note this game is VERY moddable - all supported by steam workshop.

Relgion I found to be much more interesting online vs other human players, as they are likely to suffer from the same boredom you do and makes spreading your religion seem much more meaningful fun as a result.\n•I found myself sometimes being frustrated with a lack of some of the diplomacy tools the Ai have, such as the ability to call you out if you have troops surronding their border, and I hope that for Civ 6 the ai is smarter so this artificial difficulty does not need to be added.\n•My final issue with this game is the lack of balance you find in the policy trees, and games can become stale as you do the same optimal opening strategy over and over, now while you can go for a piety start it is rarely worth it unless you're trolling your friends online, or have some incredibly situational strategy.\n\nSo all in all I think this is a great game for any pc gamer to pick up, and the flaws I mentioned only really become a issue when you've played as many hours as I have, so what are you waiting for go pick yourself up a copy now!\n","June 9, 2014","true","578.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Picked this up randomly due to a friend talking about the previous one, and although the early game is a bit dull and repetitive, it's well worth the time invested. Multiplayer is amazing, giving you more than the stereotypical "kill your enemy by purchasing units" approach that C&C and Stronghold went with; however, that rush attack is still a really viable strategy for the warmongers like myself. ^.^ as much as I've fallen in love with Civ, its diverse victory conditions, and its generally good gameplay, it falls a bit flat for me at points. The graphics will sometimes bug out randomly, though rarely enough to "break" the game. Also, if you're playing offline against computers, you may as well go solely for domination or a quick cultural victory, as diplomacy is non-existent. AI will attack you after you give them trades, return units, and declare friendships, which takes away from the overall experience - so play either hotseat mode with a couple friends or find a few players in the community online to play with if you want to get the most out of it. Prepare for a long game, as Civ can last quite some time. The learning curve isn't so bad, but it's not a jump in and play game for sure - you really need to get the nuances down and read the tooltips that say what things can do (fortunately, the advisors aren't half bad at keeping you posted). All in all, worth the purchase, so go ahead, pick this game up, and see if your civilization can withstand the test of time.\n\nPros:\n-Awesome gameplay; can win through multiple methods\n-Graphics are typically good (barring some random sporadic glitches)\n-Not a steep learning curve - you can get the basics in one or two games tops\n-Has a hotseat mode for a more "old-school" multiplayer approach (big deal if you have no internet, or want to play with people who don't own the game\n-Tons of options to change the game as you please (no barbarians, victory types, etc.)\n-Lot of modded content for those looking to spice the game up\n\nCons:\n-AI is frustrating; other leaders will go from allied to at war in a matter of seconds for no real reason\n-Loading times can be long with multiple players\n-Graphics can bug out at times\n-Could use a little more variety across the board (just my opinion)\n-Montezuma.

You will keep telling yourself this, "just one more turn, and then I'll go to bed."  Well that turn could turn into 20 turns and before you know it, 3 hrs have passed.\n\nSeriously, this is a brilliant game for anyone who likes Risk.  Every playthrough is dynamic and awesome.  Also, there is a wide variety of civilizations to choose from.  Though each civilization is simile,  they have different unique units that are a ton of fun to control.  In addition, each civ leader speaks in their native language. Now thats some impressive research!\n\nSomething that may be a problem is that even though now the AI (in Brave New world) has been tuned down a bit (they were too agressive in the earliar DLCs like Gods & Kings) and probably won't provoke you into unnescessary war , it feels they are too passive as no bot provokes you anymore except when you deliberately do so.  When the main content gets boring, the comunity has done some great mods that keep the experience ongoing such as maybe a new civilization  or a new map design like Middle Earth from Lord of the Rings.

This leaves the course of your Civilization up to you, and can provide very comic moments in history. One of my best moments was winning a domination victory as Ghandi (the mighty warlord), and Picasso being a Zulu! Although the goal is pretty much set in stone, I am somewhat disappointed by the lack of back story of your Civilization during the game, and that it is just thrown at you as a wall of text during a loading screen, forcing you to scan through the passage to find anything interesting out.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe Graphics in Civilization V are beautiful, and have a lot of variation. I find the connected textures very effective at making the randomly generated world you are in feel like a real part of planet Earth - from a long winding river surrounded by dense rainforest, reminding me of the Amazon, to a row of snow-capped mountains seeming almost to similar to the alps. So far in my many hours of play, I have encountered no graphical bugs in the game, which is surprising considering it is a randomly generated world, with  almost limitless combinations of what may be on each tile.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nOn the whole, the game play of Civilization V is intense, exciting and sometimes causes the AI to be a bit too overwhelming. I would certainly recommend playing a couple of single player games to get used to the controls of the game and the personalities of most of the Civilizations, but after a while I found that it just doesn't cut it. Luckily I had a friend who had also purchased the game and so far we have spent countless hours playing together. Online multiplayer (not a private game) is a mixed bag though. You sometimes get thrown in with some people who want to have a laugh and end up trolling you or actually making good company during a game, sometimes you come across extremely serious players playing on Deity (the hardest game mode - the description states that "only the best players in the world can beat this game mode") and you end up getting overwhelmed, and sometimes you meet people like yourself, and you have a great time.\n\nCONCLUSION\nOverall Civilization V is a brilliant game that will keep you entertained for hours, and can be replayed forever as long as you enjoy single-player or have a friend who is up for the challenge of a game.\nGoal/Story - 8/10. The goal is clear, but there isn't much of a background, and when you do see what your Civilization's history is, it is thrown at you as a wall of text and you have  few seconds of loading to read it.\nGraphics - 10/10. Graphics are beautiful and everything is rendered correctly and connected textures are fantastic!\nGameplay - 9/10. With friends it's a blast, in single player it can sometimes get a bit too intense, and multiplayer is 50/50.\nOverall - 9/10. Great game! But I find it lacks a bit of information, and the variation of players is extreme.\n","January 27, 2014","true","335.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The streamlined interface, and the removal of staples such as unit stacking were a bit of a shock, and the feeling was different.\n\nWith patching and updates, however, Civilization V has grown into its own game that stands apart from its predecessors.  I won't say it's better than previous games.  I won't say the historic immersion is the same (although Brave New World goes a long way to making that come back).  So unfortunately, coming into Civ V after playing a previous Civ game will feel awkward and possibly unsatisfying, but this is a game that rewards you with the time you put into it, it gets better as you play it.\n\nWhat remains missing however, is the diplomacy.  The expansions have done a lot to repair the broken diplomacy system, and it works much better than before, but there remains a lack of choices for the player.\n\nMany systems from previous games, such as spying, tech stealing, and religion, have been restored magnificently to the game in the expansions, but remain missing from the base version.  With Brave New World, a lot of the community feels that the game is now on par with the previous game, Civilization IV: Beyond The Sword.  I'm not sure I agree, but it certainly is a close call.  Civilization V is far less tedious than Civ IV, but still not as immersive.\n\nMost of the complaints about Civilization V come from older players, familiar with older Civ games, but Civilization V is a great starting point for the series and strategy games in general.  Compared to similar games like Europa Universalis, or even Civilization IV, Civilization V is very easy to learn and has an intuitive interface and adjustable difficulty.  Even on higher difficulty, the game features unobtrusive advice which you can choose to follow.\n\nNo matter if you're a newcomer or a Civ-veteran, Civ V still has the infamous "One more turn" addictiveness this series is known for.  And overall, this is my favorite game on Steam currently, and I often have recommended it to people.  It's an all-around great game.\n\n-----\n\nOriginal recommendation, June 2012:  This is not the most satisfying Civilization game.  It may be one of the most fun, however.  The classic game is still there, streamlined and reengineered so that less time is spent micromanaging, and more time is spent planning your conquest of the world.  The graphics are the best of any Civ game so far, and there are many gameplay surprises that keep you replaying and trying out new things.  It is becoming one of my all-time favorites.","July 30, 2012","true","092.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is workshop friendly and the community is actively perpetuating content for it. Expansions actually have purpose and add dimension to the game. With all these new features, the games depth and strategy is no longer confined to country tierlists.  Hex-style grid was a great addition and feels very natural.\n\nCONS: As a long-standing fan of the Civilization series, I can't say I like the movement away from the board game feel of older installments (Civ2 and Civ3, specifically.) The graphics and animations are a bit unnecessary to me for this reason, though they are excellently-done and very beautiful.\n\nOVERALL:  My qualms with this game are entirely from the point of nostalgia. At the end of the day, I'm willing to say goodbye to my virtual "Risk" board game in favor of what Civ is blossoming into as a series: a highly-complex strategy game that is a blast to share with like-minded friends.\n\nSCORE: 10/10","February 9, 2015","true","135.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Oh Civ 5, how I underestimated you this past summmer when I saw your GOTY edition on steam. How I was hesitant to buy you and thought your gameplay was boring. If only I knew...\n\nI bought this game out of pure review score, which of course -being a 90- I assumed was something special. As many of the steam games that are bought during sales do, it sat on my library quite some time while I was busy murdering Teemos on the Fields of Justice. When I finally got tired of that, I decided to check this game out, so I double clicked on the icon, and went into the game with little to no prior knowledge of what lay in store ahead. I booted up the tutorial, grabbed my water and said, "Well Civ 5, do your worst."\n\nI was greeted by a Morgan Freeman like voice, telling me about America and its past, along with some facts about George Washington. This narrator got me so pumped up; the combination of music, the epic dialouge, the VOICE, mother of god THE VOICE, I had so many goosebumps running over my body that I could hardly contain myself! And then I did it, I pressed Begin Your Journey, little did I know this would take me above and beyond what I believed was a true gaming experience. It started out simple, a settler and a warrior unit, and some lady telling me to found a city. I plop it down and start producing a monument, moving my warrior around and reasearching pottery. I found my neighbor soon after, the Incas, and I was greeted by a stunning display screen with a great voice actor and interface. Soon enough I had made a Declaration of Friendship and one thing led to another and all I remember was me saying just....one....more....turn.\n\nI ended up playing the tutorial for ~6 hours straight. Yes. 6 HOURS ON THE TUTORIAL, AND IT WAS GLORIOUS. I ended up panicking and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the fact that I could not save my progress, but I digress, it was the tutorial after all. Nowadays I find myself using my spare hours to play this meth like game. My grades were rekt, my relationships were rekt, my reading life was rekt, my League career was rekt and my plans to play Bioshock Infinite were REKT.\n\nAll in all I give this game a 20/10 and reccomend you pick it up now that it will be dirt cheap with the summer sale, only and only IF you would like to have some -Ghandi nuking you, Would you like to make a trade agreement with ENGLAND, cursing that damned jungle king Monty, and OH MY GOD THAT WOUNDER WAS ONE FREAKING TURN AWAY FROM BEING BUILT I JUST WASTED 25 DAYS OF PRODUCTION AND ONLY GOT A MEASLY 100 GOLD SANIADSUFLUDSBASFJDSBFJSFDSLFA- filled afternoons then this is the game for YOU!\n\nLife Status: rekt ☐ | not rekt ☐ | Tyrannosaurus rekt ☑","June 19, 2014","true","338.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","5","5","3","0"

The streamlined interface, and the removal of staples such as unit stacking were a bit of a shock, and the feeling was different.\n\nWith patching and updates, however, Civilization V has grown into its own game that stands apart from its predecessors.  I won't say it's better than previous games.  I won't say the historic immersion is the same (although Brave New World goes a long way to making that come back).  So unfortunately, coming into Civ V after playing a previous Civ game will feel awkward and possibly unsatisfying, but this is a game that rewards you with the time you put into it, it gets better as you play it.\n\nWhat remains missing however, is the diplomacy.  The expansions have done a lot to repair the broken diplomacy system, and it works much better than before, but there remains a lack of choices for the player.\n\nMany systems from previous games, such as spying, tech stealing, and religion, have been restored magnificently to the game in the expansions, but remain missing from the base version.  With Brave New World, a lot of the community feels that the game is now on par with the previous game, Civilization IV: Beyond The Sword.  I'm not sure I agree, but it certainly is a close call.  Civilization V is far less tedious than Civ IV, but still not as immersive.\n\nMost of the complaints about Civilization V come from older players, familiar with older Civ games, but Civilization V is a great starting point for the series and strategy games in general.  Compared to similar games like Europa Universalis, or even Civilization IV, Civilization V is very easy to learn and has an intuitive interface and adjustable difficulty.  Even on higher difficulty, the game features unobtrusive advice which you can choose to follow.\n\nNo matter if you're a newcomer or a Civ-veteran, Civ V still has the infamous "One more turn" addictiveness this series is known for.  And overall, this is my favorite game on Steam currently, and I often have recommended it to people.  It's an all-around great game.\n\n-----\n\nOriginal recommendation, June 2012:  This is not the most satisfying Civilization game.  It may be one of the most fun, however.  The classic game is still there, streamlined and reengineered so that less time is spent micromanaging, and more time is spent planning your conquest of the world.  The graphics are the best of any Civ game so far, and there are many gameplay surprises that keep you replaying and trying out new things.  It is becoming one of my all-time favorites.","July 30, 2012","true","092.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

In randomly generated map (though its not your only option) play the leader of a slightly to heavily flavoured nation and quest for world dominition. Either kill everyone, make them love you, make a utopia or be the first to send the rocket to space. Sometimes you'll be the baddy, sometimes you'll the curse the vandal leader who will play purely combat while you build your latest wonder. This game's realism is really informative and there are many things to learn from this simulation. It's replayability is one of it's strongest points since you'll definitely want to try again for a better setting (resources and other civ placement), different map size, different nation etc.\n\nFor those familiar with previous installments:\nIs there anything better than a resuscitation of a game you already love with new graphics, new/different nations and a slightly different approach to some of the mechanics? I cant say this is wholly an improvement or a deterioration in terms of realism since, although the diplomacy is MUCH better and a diplomatic victory is actually an option now, the religion mechanic for example is more of "game" nature than the more realistic Civ 4 counterpart. This is less blocky and repetitive than Civ4 and much easier to play though you may not like all the changes (NO MORE STACK OF DOOM! :P)","January 17, 2015","true","410.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The base game feels dumbed-down to appeal to a mass-market boardgaming crowd, and the Gods and Kings expansion adds tacked-on variety but still no depth - systems have no meaningful interaction with each other, and any one decision or strategy feels as good as another, without any lasting consequence.\n\nThe Brave New World DLC, on the other handm finally gives Civ V the depth you expect from a Civ game, with elegantly interacting system mechanics throughout and actions you take in the Stone Age still delivering payoffs thousands of years later. With Brave New World, Civ V turns from an unfocused and unengaging flop into a must-play strategy title.","January 25, 2014","true","89.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

From the stone age to the space age, lead your civilization to span the globe, competing against your rivals as you establish cities, research technologies and build your units to stand the test of time. This review is based on the game with all DLCs and both Gods & Kings and Brave New World expansions.\n\nPros: Bringing the game to hexagons and limiting it to 1 unit per tile, are two bold steps away from past versions that completely changed how strategy worked in this game, as you must now plan, prepare and place your units for assaults and sieges. You have a huge selection of factions to chose from, each of their leaders being memorable opponents that may end up as friends or foes depending of which religion they adopt in the early game, or which social ideology they identify to in the late game. Will you use brute force to have your armies march through your enemies, overrun other cultures with yours with the tourism generated by your artists, writers, musicians or artifacts from archaeological digs, use trade routes and influence to have other nations and city states to elect you World Leader of the united nations, or surpass humanity’s science as you send the first interstellar ship to Alpha Centauri?\n\nCons: There is no story or quests in a game, and only a few scenarios. The AI negotiation, although better than past Civilizations, is still broken when it comes to negotiating or reasoning with it. The game itself is a resource hog, and the game will slow down in late game no manner how powerful your PC is.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.\n\nI strongly recommend this game! The replayability is incredible, you can play a thousand game and never play the same one twice. The variety of civilizations allow you to try different approach, different styles and different strengths with each play through.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","November 7, 2014","true","309.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have had many hours of fun, either in singleplayer or in multiplayer, although the graphics for the game are not brilliant (good if you haven't spent lots of money on your PC) it still captures you into emersive game play. The game at first can seem complicated and hard but you quickly learn how to effectively play the game and win a game, this may not seem to be impressive f you haven't played Civilization 5, but trust me when you have played you will know what i mean. If you have a lot of time on your hands or even little this is a good game for you because you can alter the game speed to suit you, from the fastest been "quick" (they put a lot of effort into the name) and the slowest been "marathon" (seems they got someone more creative to think of that name). The me can take a long time on "standard" speed, but is does all depend on what difficulty you go for as Civilization 5 gives you a range of options like the other Civilizations depending on if you want to become leader of the world through violence and tyranny turning all the other "Civs" against you, a "domination victory". Then on the other hand you can be peaceful and gain friendship with the "civs", gaining a "technological victory" or a "cultural victory". These are just some of the "victory's" you can achieve. The "technological victory" is one of the hardest to achieve as basicaly it means be the first to get to "Alpha Centauri", which is another planet far far away, so of course this means building a space ship. The "domination victory" is very clear (through the word "domination") just control the capital of every other "Civ" in the game, as a warning though other "Civs" do not think very highly of someone who attacks other "Civs" so they will attack you (only if you attack a few of them). The "cultural victory" is one of the hardest victory's to get, this is because it takes a long time and you need to play as the right "Civ" that is got traits that gain them extra culture. A good "civ" to play as is "Napoleon" because he gains culture from "chateau's". The game has a lot of DLC's, but luckily for you if you are considering getting Civilization 5 they have stopped making DLC's and are making Cilization 6 (this may sound like Civ 6 is coming out soon but no one knows) so steam have made it so for £34.99 you get Civilization 5 and all  11 DLC's including "BNW" (Brave New World) and GAK (Gods And Kings). this is a very good deal considering individualy it cost £78.35, so it is better than half priceand the DLC's make the game SOOOO much better its worth every penny. For a game where there is so much you can do either in muliplayer or in singleplayer giving you many hours of fun it is worth getting, i HIGHLY reccomend this game.","March 3, 2014","true","739.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

And also play on player created maps ranging from the Elder Scrolls series to Game of Thrones.\n\nAnd also with online. You can play with your friends and/or other players. But be warn if you make any save during that match it is highly wise you know the people first. Last thing you want is an epic matching occuring and then suddenly the player no longer shows up after a day or two.\n\nThere are many things to do in this game from customizing your match playstyle both online and on singleplayer. Plus testing your skills in scenario modes. Another cool thing as well is the animations in the dipolmatic menu when dealing with other leaders. Although if you don't have a hig rig PC it is wise to turn that off completely. And don't play for too long. In my personal experience with this game it is always wise to have the autosave saving at least around 3 turns you make.\n\nA slight problem with this game is the AI. Sometimes they make really odd choices, Like for example, instead of surrending. They fight it out till the end. Or if you take down HALF of their cities and embargo their civilzation from making trade. Instead of making peace and trying to find comproise they will still act like idiots and still wage war. Even on the lowest setting as i find out. Also be warn as well, if you play this game on higher diffculty, my advice? take your time, and plan everything out. If you don't plan very well you will be crushed.\n\nAt this point it is wise to get ALL of the DLC since the majority of the mods rely on them.\n\nOther than that, I recommend this game.","June 6, 2015","true","187.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuki8/recommended/8930/","kuki8","Kuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuki8/","129 products in account","My review is mostly related to the single player part and the AI of the game, which i both consider to be very relevant in this game.\n\nFirst of all: With the BNW add-on the CIV5 game gained new potential. Especially in late-game the game has become a lot better. However, Civilization 5 still lacks a lot of the strategic component of former installments of CIV or Alpha Centauri (one of my all-time favourite games). Especially without GK and BNW the game is very simplistic and strategically non-challenging, offering few ways to win and few actual decision-making. This is a shame, especially when comparing the game to its predecessors.\n\nWith BNW the strategic component got a lot better, allowing many different paths to victory, exploring new strategies, and finally giving culture an actual purpose and allowing you to win with culture. A downside however is, that the different civilizations and leaders are poorly balanced. For example when playing at the last two difficulties, it seem almost impossible to win (unless you use specific AI and gameplay exploits...). This is mostly the case because it is generally not possible to keep up with the rapid technology advance and army production of the AI. The AI can do this because it receives massive bonusses and you receive a massive handicap. As an effect of the research and construction speed handicap, you will very often find yourself in a situation where you cannot build certain wonders in your game, even with an ultimately optimised building strategy and a perfect starting position - which is quite frustrating and will limit your selection of feasible strategies in higher difficulties, to a small selection - most of which are based on exploiting the overall weak choices the AI makes in wars.\n\nThe AI also often reacts irrational and seems random, for example the way it changes from being your best friend, to backstabbing you and siding with your enemy, in just one turn, or when they declare war on you despite the immediate outcome being obviously negative for that civilisation as well as already having another enemy at its neck. The options for diplomatic interaction are overall weak.\n\nMy main point of criticism is that the AI is dumb to the point that it can only be seen as challenging by that it produces a lot of military units and advances a lot faster in technology than you. This also means that you inevitably have to prepare for often long wars against an ridiculously large stream of enemy units that you might often destroy easily due to the AI's weak decision-making while attacking. Often you can only win with perfect start position and by exploiting certain game mechanics and the mentioned lack of AI tactics. This is what makes this game of little interest to me. A strategy game that offers a lot of different ways to win needs a good AI and not one that acts as military-unit factory.\n\nFor example, games with the difficulty setting at which the AI has the same handicaps as you feel like a pony-ride to any halfway experienced player, even when there are lots of rivaling civilisations on the map. However, once you play at higher difficulties, the AI plays with the exact some behavior and underlying "intelligence" but can manage to be ahead of you at all times in matters of creating wonders, researching technologies, producing culture, and army. At the "king" difficulty, where you already have penalties, I found it possible to win pretty much any game at any starting position with any civilisations or leaders. But at the last two difficulties the AI advantage becomes clearly unfair, the intelligence of the AI however is still not any better. It is apparent that the AI "knows" what goes on on the entire map and will use this knowledge to its advantage. In addition, the advantages it receives are not possible to be compensate using smart decisions. For example, at Deity difficulty, Firaxis basically throws you into a gladiator fight where you play a limbless and "slow" person. You fight against dumb, aggressive and cheating brutes that will turn hostile at some point, no matter what. Sounds more fun than it is. I found it to be still possible to win at deity, but you are WILL find yourself limited to a very very small set of tactics and choices and even leaders: The most likely option to win is militaristically: you have to wait for your enemy's rare appearance of a weakness, at which point you have to attack with your limbless body hitting the enemy gladiator continuously, which will feel like cracking a hard nutshell with a rubber spoon, until the target slowly turns into a pudding-like consistency. You will have to forget all the other tactics and playstyles you might have previously liked to use, once you play in that arena you have to stick with what the little that's left, being severly crippled in your abilities and fighting against dumb hostile brutes.\n\nThumbs down for the AI","December 29, 2013","false","339.6"," 302 of 573 people (53%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","53","302","573","17","33"

The harder the diffuculty the more the AI have the advantage. Civ 5 has tons of civilizations to play as each with their own unique advantages. I would say the best part of Civ 5 is during the medieval and Industrial time periods. These are times where I have the most fun at. The reason I don't really like the modern era is becuase the game usually feels drawn out and boring by that time. But if you go to your game options and start the game during the medieval era then the modern era will feel a lot more fun. Overall Civ 5 is a really fun game and has an endless play time to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/recommended/8930/","totalwargamer","Sleep deprived shift worker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/","88 products in account","Sid Meier's Civilization V\n\nPositives:\n\n+ This is an in-depth, turn based strategy game. It features a massive technology tree for the ancient, classical, medieval, renaissance, industrial, modern and future eras. Conduct research to unlock new buildings and units.\n+ Multiple victory styles to suit your own gameplay goals. Aim for world domination, or try for a cultural victory by constructing world wonders and acquiring great works of music, writing and art. Build the first spacecraft through the Apollo program to win a science victory.\n+ Lots of units available for each era, ranging from archers and cavalry to giant death robots and XCOM specialist squads.\n+ There's a well fleshed out system for city development and unit recruiting, whereby you need to balance your productive output with your food and gold output. For your empire to be successful, you need to work the land with citizens appropriately. The more food you have, the faster your town grows, but this usually comes at the expense of production, resulting in longer building times.\n+ This is the ultimate empire building game. Workers can construct roads between cities, and later on railways. They can erect plantations on exotic goods like wine and sugar or ensure resources like stone and gold are extracted with mines. Settlers can found a city in faraway countries.\n+ DLC adds a lot of new features, like religion and tourism, which impacts the game a fair bit and makes it more interesting.\n+ Battles with enemies seems boring at first, but soon you realise that it's much more intricate. The positioning of your troops, the type of unit, the terrain you're on and unit capabilities directly affect your damage or defensive rating. So, battles become quite intriguing.\n+ Multiplayer co-op!\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Stupid diplomacy system which doesn't make much sense. There's several faults here. You can be allied to another civilization for thousands of years (renewing the friendship agreement when it expires), but the simplest of transgressions results in them "denouncing" you. For example, in one of my games, my spy successfully stole technology without being detected. But somehow, the AI knows that you've taken this research, and threatens me. Very unrealistic. When you denounce them in return, they're suddenly "hostile" and then attack soon after. There doesn't seem to be any complex formula governing diplomacy, it's so simplistic. The AI doesn't take into account your previous good standing with them or mutual objectives. It doesn't recognise your past support for them in wars and trading doesn't seem to have much positive diplomatic influence or effect. This really ruins a core part of the game.\n- AI can be overly aggressive on normal difficulty and above. It always seems as if it's scripted and the AI has decided to target you. Even if you take the initiative early on and conquer another civilization, there's another ready to invade you. This happened on multiple occassions to me. It would be fine if there was some logical reason behind their attacks, or if other civilizations experienced the same struggles. But it's not like that at all.\n\nOverall Score: 8.0/10\n\nSid Meier's Civilization V is a grand strategy game filled with many hours of content. It can be really, really fun, but also quite unrealistic at the same time. The game has many pros and only a few cons. I suggest buying Civilization V - Gold Edition, which is cheap and has most DLC included, along with the Gods and Kings expansion. The only package which isn't included is Brave New World, but that's not necessary to enjoy the game.","February 8, 2014","true","119.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/recommended/8930/","mendozacheers","Mendozacheers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/","4519 products in account",""Just One more Turn!" is Civilizations unofficial motto, anyone who played the game and enjoyed it will understand. Known as the biggest turn-based strategy game today with it's rather unique hexagon tiled playfield, Civilization has entertained many throughout it's lifespan - myself included. I used to play a bunch load of Civilization III as a kid and Civilization V has done a wonderful job of replacing that for the past 4 years. Back in the days, turn-based strategy games were pretty common but today it feels like most games are real-time. Turn-based means you take turns to make your move rather than everyone making them at the same time, like in every traditional board game.\n\nEvidently Sid Meier's Civilization V is the fifth game in the series and it has really just gotten better and better by every game, the core mechanics are always there but with some variation between each game. The fanbase is rather scattered when it comes to agreeing on the best Civilization game, a lot of people still prefer Civ IV, personally I love Civ III a lot but Civ V takes the prize. The main problem with Civilization V when it came was the lack of content compared to what Civ IV already had. Today, 4 years later, tons of DLCs and 2 expansions have been released for the game and it finally has more content than it's predecessor.\n\nThe game is about to create, reign and fulfill a civilization throughout hundreds of years and overcome the obstacles alongside, either online or vs computers. Explore, expand, exploit and exterminate - 4X - is the best way to describe the typical steps when playing a game of Civilization. Explore is for the first section of the game, where you settle your first city and scout the surounding area for resources or opponents. Expand is when your small settlement becomes several, either through settling another one or through conquest. Exploit is the description of diplomacy, treaties, spionage and rigging elections to make your cause the ultimate. Exterminate is pretty obvious, if diplomacy or expantion does not work, take the matter by the sword (or the nuclear warhead).\n\nThere are 4 way of winning and becoming the master civilization; Cultural, Diplomatic, Scientific and by Domination. Along those victory types are also paths for your civilization to easier obtain said victories. For example; you could focus your empire on trade and become a superpower through riches. Essentially buying votes for a diplomatic victory, units for domination or technology for science. You could also be the founder of a religion and slowly but steadily gain your trust from the people of other civilizations that way. I was hoping to see a pure Economical and Religious victory condition, but sadly there are none.\n\nIt feels like I have done pretty much everything in Civilization V since it's release but I still get really tempted to get back in there, and just let the hours disappear. Suddenly you sit there, 5 AM in the morning and be like "What the hell just happened? I am not 12 anymore, I have a f*cking job!". I remember when I used to plan my next move during bathroom breaks, I couldn't even think of something else for 5 minutes! "Just One more Turn!" I am really looking forward to Civilization VI and Civilization: Beyond Earth.\n\nI recommend Civilization V for everyone, not just strategy fans but everyone interested in having control and making decisions for an imaginary empire.

G&K's revamps the technology  tree, adds more buildings, units, and civilizations, includes an espionage system, and adds a religion system to the game. BNW adds a new cultural system/victory, new civilizations, ideologies, trade routes, and a world congress. Both DLC packs are a must-have for the full, complete experience.\n\nBe prepared to be a victim of "just one more turn".","June 28, 2014","true","377.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

[KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]\n\nI always tried to play Civilization but the outdated graphics and the 2D squared tiles never managed to catch my interest. With Civilization V they finally introduced hexagonal tiles and a rich 3D world, so I grabbed the Gods & Kings expansion and gave it a try!\n\nAt first the game is overhelming with informations and details, but it will take you hand by hand and introduce all the mechanics step by step.\nAfter 30 hours and 493 turns I finished my first play and I was able to manage almost everything. This game is simply GARGANTUOUS. There are TONS of things to do and manage. There are dozens of leaders each one with its strenghts and weaknesses. There are 5 different ways of winning a game and you can customize the map in even the smallest detail! There are also premade scenaries, steamworks support and a very populated multiplayer! Simply WOW!\n\nJust three advices:\n1. Do not read the tips and tricks or they will ruin your fun showing the best strategies (there aren't so much so knowing these may lower your fun of trying new ways to beat the other civilizations).\n2. Buy the expansions, these are not money-sucker DLCs but they really improve the base game.\n3. Always keep an eye on the clock: I started playing it at 23.00 and I left the game at 6.00 with conquered cities, allies, powerful armies and... frozen legs! It sucked 7 hours of my life without me realizing!\n\nBest played with Keyboard and Mouse\nRecommended Buy Price < 50$\nScore 9/10","March 1, 2014","true","35.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You won't want to go to bed, do homework, take a much needed shower or go to work. The truth about this game is that it makes you want to keep playing, you will think to yourself, “its 11:30 I need to go to bed, then think i'll be alright one more turn then im done, next time you look at that clock its 5:44 and I have class in three hours.”\n\nCity builder: Something that I love about Civilization 5 is the city building aspect of the game being able to customize what each city produces or specialize that city can give you a huge advantage over your opponents. If you want your city to be able to produce tons of troops or want it to be a mecca for scientific advancement you have the ability to customize, you can make any city what you want or need it to be.\n\nWinning: With any game that is a city builder there are many ways to win. My personal favorite is to conquer the world, crushing armies. The feeling when an enemy player comes to you and offers everything they have to save their capital, is the best feeling in the world! Other ways of winning are being the first person to build the space station, or having a culture that influences other nations. One of the hardest victories to achieve is the diplomatic victory, you need to have the rest of the world like you enough to elect you to world leader.\n\nErrors/ AI issues: My biggest complaint about this game is the errors that still exist after four years.  I wouldnt say its game breaking but very annoying when you have spend five to seven hours and are close to the end game when the game crashes. Then to combine this issue the AI needs to be reworked to make smarter decisions while at war. The AI will continue to suicide units into cities when they could easily take the cities by using archers or other ranged units to weaken the city.\n\nPrice: Best thing about Civ 5 is that the price. You get a great game that gives you hours if not years of gameplay. Even tho it has been out since 2010 its well worth the asking price, on steam you can pick this game up for $30 or get the complete edition for $40. The complete edition comes with more civs and two expansion packs that add a lot of new gameplay features and just builds on an amazing game!","June 4, 2014","true","012.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game doesn't stale as you head into the late game because of the World Congress and Idealogies you are able to pick up once you get closer to the Atomic Era. Idealogies does a great job of creating rivals and allies as you align with the people you share Idealogies with.\n\nThis game is relatively easy to run and can be accessible to most poeple. The multiplayer is fun if you can find friends to play with as it is more interesting playing with people you known. There are some faults with multiplayer as the game will often reload itself for no apparent reason.\n\nOverall great game and is a must own for anyone that enjoes 4x strategy games.","February 21, 2015","true","461.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The game takes awhile to play through both online and offline but rewards the player with both a sense of progression as the ages unlock and the technology advances.  Also the game has multiple ways to win and even if you feel your in the lead in science,  a friend can come out of nowhere and hit you with a culture vicotry so you have to not only be productive towards your victory goal but also monitoring all the other victory types to make sure no other civilization completes it before you.  I would highly recommend buying the complete pack when it's on sale, so you dont have to worry about dlc issues and not having a civilization that an opposing player wants to play as.  The game requires all active players to have the dlc in order to play against eachother and use a dlc civilization so be aware of this if you debating between the base game and it's expansions or the complete pack with all dlc.  Hope you enjoy Civilization as my as I do and can't wait for Civilization: Beyond Earth to come out :)...","July 13, 2014","true","255.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The payoff however, more than makes up for it.  The feeling of carrying your army across the continent to royally screw over your friend who you were suppossedly 'allied' with is like none other, as is launching a nuke at every neighbouring country and bribing Chengis Khan to mount an attack at the Vatican. Rounds may take a few hours, but you'll be talking about them for the next week.\n\nFans of the previous Civ games may however be a little disappointed with this edition as it seems a few majorly awesome mechanics have been removed (along with with a whole bunch of not so awesome mechanics.) Even religions are nowhere to be found within Vanilla but thankfully both Brave New World and Gods and Kings restore all that was missing to make Civ V as great as its predecessors.\n\nBetween some fantastic DLC and Steam Workshop functionality (YOU CAN PLAY AS CTHULU IN THE WORLD OF TAMRIEL AND FOUND PASTAFASTARIANISM) Civ may not be a 'perfect' game to please all but it's certainly as close as it gets in terms of Civilisation.","December 1, 2013","true","78.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

Instead you have to plan ahead with artillery (ranged) units in the back, infantry in the front and cavalry on the sides.\n\nThis one is definatly worth getting.

Gaming™","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062368291/","127 products in account","Comparing Civilization V to contemporary strategy games is entirely pointless. Imagine if Modern Warfare had come out alongside Quake II. There is simply nothing comparable out there, not least because the strategy genre has become the province of indie developers and niche publishers. Civ V is a towering, AAA release with millions of dollars worth of polish in an era where questionably localized Russian titles are all that strategy gamers have to tide them over for months at a time. It's also a delightfully fresh take on a formula that has been slowly iterated on for more than two decades.\n\nThe heart of the Civilization fantasy is unchanged. You still manage cities, developing them from rude collections of mud huts into gleaming modern metropolises. Vast armies and armadas are again at your command, waging global war for conquest, defense, or resources with everything from spears to nukes. The land must still be worked, the primordial wilderness tamed through your people’s sweat and blood. Your ultimate goal is yours to choose: Diplomatically unite the people of the world under your benign leadership, launch a viable colony ship into outer space, conquer the globe through force of arms, or create a glorious utopia through enlightened civility.\n\nCiv V's genius lies in the way that Firaxis has aggressively chopped the number of decisions that a player has to make during the course of a game while taking away almost none of the meaningful ones. As a hardcore Civ player, I appreciate some of these ancillary aspects of the design, but the removal of all the fat is unquestionably Civ V's greatest accomplishment.","February 7, 2015","true","118.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

To some that is the make-your-own-rules sandbox RPG, to others it is the strategy game where all playthroughs are similar yet unique. In the latter category the championship title holder has always been Civilization. The original design is so strong yet adaptable that it has been able to sustain an entire series that continues its triumphant march through history with V.\n\nFrom one settler and one warrior begins global conquest. So it has been and so shall it be but the ways to supremacy have never been as varied or as satisfying as they are here. Brave New World finally made the cultural strategy fun and the introduction of city-states in the base game did the same for diplomacy. Victory through science has changed the least and while the same could be said for the military victory it does not apply to actual combat itself. Stack of Doom, the most bizarre design oversight in the franchise, has been done away with. In its place is a mechanic similar to other hex-based strategy games but while it does not break new ground as such it fits in here perfectly and makes annexing the pacifists quite entertaining to do. Unfortunately the vassalization from IV is not possible here. Warmongering also brings very serious diplomatic penalties, more serious than ever before, and bullies will find themselves completely isolated from the diplomatic stage.\n\nThe cultural system introduced in the previous Civilization has been refined and is my personal favorite aspect of V. Accumulating culture expands the city limits which the workers can work on but also allows you to pick social policies that give empire-wide bonuses. It is of course best to plan the way to victory as early as possible and build social structure accordingly but there is also something of a role-playing feel to it as well. Whether warlord, plutocrat or tolerant diplomat, all feels satisfying to be. Another way of tailoring your empire to your liking is religion. As your cities accumulate faith you advance in religion, at first choosing a basic Pantheon belief ("God-King", et al), then having a Great Prophet found a religion and picking your boons from the ones still available and so on. Religion is not mandatory for victory but can make it much easier. For example an aggressive leader could use faith points to purchase holy warriors, then use religion to finance the resultant army upkeep through tithes and finally pick a belief that gives a combat bonus around enemy cities that your missionaries have converted beforehand. Brave New World also added a caravan system which is the best way to make money by far, perhaps "too best", but still an interesting addition to the tried and true.\n\nMaking the role-playing aspects even more deeper are the various civilizations themselves. All get an unique ability and a pair of unique units and/or buildings. The list is by far the most expansive in any Civ yet and includes debutants like Poland or Brazil. To my amazement all cultures feel logically designed and balanced to play as. Sometimes the abilites are much more particular than in other cases meaning that some cultures are easier to triumph as but that only adds to meaningful challenge. The Mayans have an especially amusing ability called The Long Count that gives them a free Great Person every 394 years, at the end of their calendar cycle.\n\nMenus and lists are universally clear and all necessary information is easy to find. You can also activate the DLCs you want, put in mods from the Workshop and customize many other things as well, from the map to AI personalities. Something Civilization has always had that no fantasy or sci-fi game can never surpass is the richness of lore, or in this case, actual human history. No amount of imagination can come up with anything stranger or more interesting and it makes the game more welcoming in ways too many to count. A special recognition of achievement goes to the in-game Civilopedia that is so clearly and informatively written that sometimes it is relaxing to take a break from empire-building and read about history, from pottery to Napoleon to a technology called The Internet.\n\nCivilization V is so rich and deep that writing about it always glosses some things over and stresses others too much which is fitting since the same applies to actual civilization as well. The complete game is indeed the most perfect Civ yet made and one of the finest eternal games in existence. Whether one wants to spend a night or two or all of them playing, Civ V will provide mental stimulation as long as it is needed.","March 6, 2014","true","232.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I really liked the addition of city-states, the hex grid map, and the removal of the stack of doom. The combat's more fun and strategic on this one and the game as a whole is easier to get into.

To some that is the make-your-own-rules sandbox RPG, to others it is the strategy game where all playthroughs are similar yet unique. In the latter category the championship title holder has always been Civilization. The original design is so strong yet adaptable that it has been able to sustain an entire series that continues its triumphant march through history with V.\n\nFrom one settler and one warrior begins global conquest. So it has been and so shall it be but the ways to supremacy have never been as varied or as satisfying as they are here. Brave New World finally made the cultural strategy fun and the introduction of city-states in the base game did the same for diplomacy. Victory through science has changed the least and while the same could be said for the military victory it does not apply to actual combat itself. Stack of Doom, the most bizarre design oversight in the franchise, has been done away with. In its place is a mechanic similar to other hex-based strategy games but while it does not break new ground as such it fits in here perfectly and makes annexing the pacifists quite entertaining to do. Unfortunately the vassalization from IV is not possible here. Warmongering also brings very serious diplomatic penalties, more serious than ever before, and bullies will find themselves completely isolated from the diplomatic stage.\n\nThe cultural system introduced in the previous Civilization has been refined and is my personal favorite aspect of V. Accumulating culture expands the city limits which the workers can work on but also allows you to pick social policies that give empire-wide bonuses. It is of course best to plan the way to victory as early as possible and build social structure accordingly but there is also something of a role-playing feel to it as well. Whether warlord, plutocrat or tolerant diplomat, all feels satisfying to be. Another way of tailoring your empire to your liking is religion. As your cities accumulate faith you advance in religion, at first choosing a basic Pantheon belief ("God-King", et al), then having a Great Prophet found a religion and picking your boons from the ones still available and so on. Religion is not mandatory for victory but can make it much easier. For example an aggressive leader could use faith points to purchase holy warriors, then use religion to finance the resultant army upkeep through tithes and finally pick a belief that gives a combat bonus around enemy cities that your missionaries have converted beforehand. Brave New World also added a caravan system which is the best way to make money by far, perhaps "too best", but still an interesting addition to the tried and true.\n\nMaking the role-playing aspects even more deeper are the various civilizations themselves. All get an unique ability and a pair of unique units and/or buildings. The list is by far the most expansive in any Civ yet and includes debutants like Poland or Brazil. To my amazement all cultures feel logically designed and balanced to play as. Sometimes the abilites are much more particular than in other cases meaning that some cultures are easier to triumph as but that only adds to meaningful challenge. The Mayans have an especially amusing ability called The Long Count that gives them a free Great Person every 394 years, at the end of their calendar cycle.\n\nMenus and lists are universally clear and all necessary information is easy to find. You can also activate the DLCs you want, put in mods from the Workshop and customize many other things as well, from the map to AI personalities. Something Civilization has always had that no fantasy or sci-fi game can never surpass is the richness of lore, or in this case, actual human history. No amount of imagination can come up with anything stranger or more interesting and it makes the game more welcoming in ways too many to count. A special recognition of achievement goes to the in-game Civilopedia that is so clearly and informatively written that sometimes it is relaxing to take a break from empire-building and read about history, from pottery to Napoleon to a technology called The Internet.\n\nCivilization V is so rich and deep that writing about it always glosses some things over and stresses others too much which is fitting since the same applies to actual civilization as well. The complete game is indeed the most perfect Civ yet made and one of the finest eternal games in existence. Whether one wants to spend a night or two or all of them playing, Civ V will provide mental stimulation as long as it is needed.","March 6, 2014","true","232.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I started trading away EVERYTHING i had to every one to keep from starting wars but then it happened....\n\nEveryone went to war agaisnt one another and they all asked me for help. But i a simple super power with only aircraft and enough ships to protect myself but not invade was asked to fight everyong else by everyone. I had to decline and they all got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at me. So i knew the end was coming but i wasnt going to go down like a city state.\n\nI Started to invest in ground troops had Enough Death robots and Tanks and men to start invasions once they sent theirs at me and lost them due to my over whelming navy. I sent my troops to other parts of the world and one by one i captured and razed cities to the ground ignoring the capitales so they would still be around.\n\nIn the end everyone was back to just their starter city i freeded 6 nations and they were permantly my ally and friend. They never asked of me or hated me. Everything was back to normal people forgot the wars and built up empires and started to push out only this time they were friendly and nice.. Then it happened i got sneak attacked by another nation with nuclear arms and a hidden invasion force.\n\nI lost half my civ and my capital but it didnt end. My 6 allies that i freed from the grave came to my defense and took out the invaders and helped me reclaim my land even giving my back my captured cities. I was a Super Power for over 10k years 'in game' and was reduced to a common city state level of influence. I started to rebuild and reexpand but a friend stole my land...

If Oporto is under siege it's logical that the happiness of Oporto drops and than that deteriorates it's growth, commerce and productivity but why should Lisboa which is very far away from the warfront be upset about it? Let's be real, every city has it's own problems, should there be factors that deteriorate the happiness of ALL cities? YES, like nuclear war, declaring war against civilizations with the same idiology or religion but happiness should not be only global, the fact that you build a circus in Oporto does not make Lisboa any better, it makes no sense. If Lisboa is overpopulated let Lisboa be upset and unhappy about it but it's madness that because one overpopulated city the whole productivity of your empire drops.\n\nSaid that, this game is good stuff, good graphics, good combat system (even better that Civilization IV), decent diplomacy, no bugs at all, very nice multiplayer, all civilizations are good but England and France.","July 5, 2014","true","201.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

Get this instead of the garbage that is Beyond Earth.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with this series, you pick a great civilization from history (Rome, China, Aztecs, England, ETC) and start with a single city. From there you will be playing for hours and hours (as games take a very long time, and it's fun as hell) exploring, making allies and enemies with the other civilizations, going to war, making more cities, managing resources to fuel your conquest, and racing against the other players in an attempt to win the game. Winning the game can be complex, as there are several ways to win. You can win by destroying the other civs through war, win scientifically by making it into space, culturally with social policies, or diplomatically with the united nations.\n\nThe game is very dynamic, not a single playthrough is at all similiar with another, leading to great fun that never tires.\n\nThe pros? Too many to list. The game is beautifully structured and well thought out.\n\nThe cons?

Get this instead of the garbage that is Beyond Earth.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with this series, you pick a great civilization from history (Rome, China, Aztecs, England, ETC) and start with a single city. From there you will be playing for hours and hours (as games take a very long time, and it's fun as hell) exploring, making allies and enemies with the other civilizations, going to war, making more cities, managing resources to fuel your conquest, and racing against the other players in an attempt to win the game. Winning the game can be complex, as there are several ways to win. You can win by destroying the other civs through war, win scientifically by making it into space, culturally with social policies, or diplomatically with the united nations.\n\nThe game is very dynamic, not a single playthrough is at all similiar with another, leading to great fun that never tires.\n\nThe pros? Too many to list. The game is beautifully structured and well thought out.\n\nThe cons? Buggy AI, but not really an issue.\n\nPoint is, rather reading this wordy review you should be buying this game, with all the expansion packs.

The game is too heavily slanted towards other victory acheivements; it is too difficult to conquer cities and happiness makes a global conquest strategy through military might nigh impossible because eventually your armies will simply be spread too thin and enemies will too easily be able to reinforce their positions on large maps. I still recommend it though for 4K people, but coming from a Command & Conquer/Starcraft/Warcraft background, I can't get out of the conquest mindset and the other strategies aren't to my taste. If you enjoy the longer, slower-paced games which involve meticulously building up a civilization, this is one of the best games out there for that.","June 29, 2014","true","123.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I've invested a lot of time into the game and I have to say its by far my favorite strategy game of all-time.  Though the AI is stupid and conducts repetitive actions majority of the time and the difficultly doesnt change anything (at least for me, whatever difficulty I play on, I am always in the lead a few Era's.)\n\nThe only downside to the game, is the diplomatic functions and the missing ability to ask the AI's for support the same way they can.  Fortunately there is mods for both of these downsides but sadly it disables achivements which for me at least, is a moderately big part of the experience for me.\n\nThe game looks stunning and the colors pop.  Gameplay is smooth and enjoyable.  I recommend this game to any one who loves simulation, strategy, history, and action.  You can kill a good 5 hours playing a quick match so if you are ever needing to kill time at an airport or at your boring grandmothers house but you only brought your laptop with you, Civ is the game for you.","September 2, 2015","true","110.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","4"

That said, i think there's still room for improvement on additional options you might have in terms of policy choosing, etc.\n\nThe economy system is also a bit different from previous installments, a bit richer, and i think the military aspect of the game improved a lot in terms of tactics. Granted, still room for improvement there, but much less 'cheesy' tactics like stacking 20 units in a tile, for instance. You now really need to know where to position your units, and use choke points, etc. to your advantage. Much more 'chess-like' than 'win-by-more-numbers'.\n\nSome of the different win conditions have also gained more depth, especially the diplomatic / cultural victory.\n\nThe mods from the steam workshop are also insanely rich, giving you even more customization / replay value to the game.\n\nLastly, the graphics have obviously also improved a lot, with a lot more detail, even though, at least for me, that's the least concerning aspect of a game such as this.\n\nIts downsides (as usual) mostly revolve around the need to have a sufficiently good pc to handle the burden of loading times, etc., as it is quite heavy on your pc.\nMost games also tend to have a mid-game era which is quite stale, where pretty much nothing happens regardless of whether you're far ahead, far behind or even with the majority of the other civs.\nAI is also something that still hasn't improved as much as i would have liked. It is either too aggressive or too passive, but not really playing intelligently, regardless of difficulty level, but rather as usual, gaining more bonuses to make up fo the lack of actual Intelligence on the Artificial Intelligence part.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nPros:\n- Even more tech / social options, richer interaction with city-states;\n- Religion now plays a big role in the game;\n- More depth in cultural / diplomatic win conditions;\n- Improved combat / tactical aspect of the game;\n- Improved mod / customization in steam workshop;\n- Lots of replay value;\n- Better graphics.\n\nCons:\n- Game can be quite the resource-hog on your pc, regardless of having or not a good one.\n- Some games can turn out to be stale for quite some time, depending on specific spawn points, etc.\n- Could still have improved social policy choosing, despite the huge improvements on that aspect.\n- AI's actual intelligence part hasn't really improved, in my opinion.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nA solid 8.5 out of 10, whether you're new to the franchise, or have played them all since the very first pixelated Civilization 1, like myself. Would honestly give it more, if the loading times were faster. I don't mind putting in the hours playing the game, it's just a bit bothersome knowing that a somewhat significant part of those hours are spent waiting, rather than playing.","June 26, 2014","true","161.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/plasticdisc/recommended/8930/","plasticdisc","Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/plasticdisc/","264 products in account","Strategy fanatics have lost hundreds of hours of their lives to Sid Meier's beguiling creations over the years, and they should prepare to lose hundreds more. Civilization V is yet another glistening example of turn-based bliss that will keep you up long past your bedtime. It exercises its power over your mind using many of the tricks the series has long been known for: varied ways of accomplishing your goal of world domination, the thrill of expanding a paltry city into a bustling empire, and the suspense of venturing into unknown territory. The latest Civilization game takes those basics and layers onto them new features that make moment-to-moment gameplay feel more dynamic than in the past. Most noticeably, the square grids of previous Civilization games have been jettisoned in favor of hexagons that nicely accommodate the other most consequential transformations: Military units can no longer be stacked, and ranged units can fire from multiple tiles away. The tactical combat that rises from these modifications is a lot of fun and makes warfare a lot more exciting than in Civ games of yore. AI quirks and a few other minor issues become apparent the more you play, but these are wholly forgivable foibles in an attractive and sophisticated game that constantly begs you to remain at your keyboard for just one more turn.\n\nFirst, here is a quick primer for newcomers. Civilization V, like previous games in the series, is about leading a nation through the eras of history, starting with a single city and expanding across the map. At the outset of any given game, you select a leader (in this case, one of 18, or 19 if you purchased the special edition from Steam), each of whom possesses a particular benefit that disposes his or her civilization to a particular style of play. Americans get a range of sight bonus; the Siamese get diplomatic bonuses with miniature nations new to the series called city-states; the English get naval perks; and so forth. From here, you collect resources; make deals with other civilizations; manage your economy; and go to war and attack the cities of your enemies when the time is right. There are four main ways to win a typically lengthy game of Civilization V. You could dominate through military means and defeat every civilization's capital city. You could be the first to gun through the technology tree and build the parts necessary for a spaceship that whisks you away to Alpha Centauri. You could ally with nations and city-states across the globe and win a diplomatic victory via a vote at the United Nations. Or you might become the cultural envy of the world by developing a large number of government policies and researching a mysterious undertaking known as the Utopia Project. There is also a fifth victory condition: possess the highest score when the turn limit has been reached.\n\nWhether Civ is new to you or not, it's easy to appreciate the newest game's user-friendly interface, which makes figuring out what to do next a breeze, meaning more of your time is spent strategizing and less of it is spent fumbling around. The organized nested menus are intuitive and easy to get used to, and Civ V does a good job of only displaying vital information on the screen while making other information easily available with just a few clicks. A single action button leads you through every aspect of your turn. If a unit is waiting for orders, the button says so, and clicking it takes you to the unit in question. If it's time to research a new technology, you click the button and it opens the research menu. There are a few aspects of the interface that could have been cleaned up. Switching between a city's production menu and the production queue is needlessly clunky, and the diplomatic overview doesn't label the tiny icons indicating what luxury resources other civilizations are producing. But most of the time, you always have the information you need when you need it, and neophytes should never feel in the dark.\n\nA few of Civilization IV's features have been eliminated--most notably, religion and espionage--though many players aren't likely to miss them. However, longtime aspects of the series have returned. Your advisors are there if you need a bit of direction, though unit automation and little icons representing each advisor's suggestion in the production menus mean you won't often need to pay them a visit. The exhaustive Civilopedia is only a click away and offers a wealth of information on every aspect of every feature. You still build wonders like the Egyptian pyramids, the hanging gardens, and the Great Wall, which generate the culture resource and provide other tangible benefits, without coming with the turn-by-turn maintenance cost of standard structures. The culture you gain is spent on social policies, which have replaced the governments of Civilization IV. Each time you reach the cultural resource benchmark, you select from the policy list, which is split into multiple policy types, each of which has its own sub-tree. The benefits you reap are cumulative, and while there are certain balancing restrictions in place, you still get a lot of freedom in how you want to progress. The mid- and late-game flexibility make it an excellent addition to the franchise. The first change you'll notice, however, has even more impact on Civilization V: The map is divided into hexagons rather than squares.\n\nThe move to hexagons sets the stage for Civilization V's tactical combat. In the past, you could stack units into one army of doom (or a few armies) that rolled across the map. Now, with the exception of special units (the great general, for example) and workers, units cannot occupy the same space. As a result, you must be extremely conscious of each unit's weaknesses and strengths; a unit's position in regards to both its enemies and other friendly units; and whether or not any terrain bonuses apply. There is a rock-paper-scissors relationship among units that further deepens as units level up and you progress through the eras. When units level up, you choose one of several upgrades for them, such as an attack bonus when attacking from flat terrain. As they level up further, the possibilities expand, which means healing bonuses for the unit, as well as neighboring units, or greater degrees of the same enhancements. Helpfully, you can also choose to fully heal the unit when it levels at the expense of choosing another bonus, which is a mighty handy ability that can save a veteran unit from the jaws of defeat. This excellent new system layers tactical combat onto the strategic map, making battles much tenser--and much less abstract. It also encourages you to keep your veteran units alive. And while it costs you a bit of gold, you can also upgrade units into more powerful iterations (a trebuchet into a cannon, for example) when your research path allows it.\n\nMultiplayer games are also a possibility for the most patient players. You can set a turn timer to limit how long players get to consider their next move, but even so, the pace is at the whim of those involved, so matches can get bogged down in the early hours. Luckily, most of the customization options available to you in single-player games are available in multiplayer games as well, so you can keep things moving with the right options activated. Gone are hotseat and e-mail play options, with online and local network play as the only ways to play with others. By nature, Civilization V is a game you enjoy most with friends instead of random strangers, though the simple interface makes it easy to find and join available Internet games.","April 12, 2014","true","95.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The AI is improved, key game concepts have been buffed and nerfed, as needed. And there is welcome, but not critical, DLC.\n\nWhat I love about this version: hex-based game board for more natural movement. No more stacks of doom. Global happiness. No tech trading. Drastically improved AI relations. Improved event notification system means you never miss a beat.\n\nWhat I dislike: The tech tree has been significantly flattened from Civ 4. Tech and Culture victories are terribly boring to achieve: hunker down, press "next turn", repeat 200 times. Overreliance on gold farming to buy off all problems.\n\nOverall - a successful attempt to streamline gameplay without removing core elements. Civ 5 is a success, and I welcome the coming expansion(s).","March 20, 2012","true","179.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, I do reccomend it to any MMO Board game fans or Strategy players out there.

This game also has great tool-tips and UI. I mastered the game without the need of tutuorial but there areadvisor-in-game diologues that explain everything. (These can be disabled.)

I appreciate the genre, I grew up on board games like risk so this is nothing new to me.\n\nAll that being said, I now love Civ. It may have taken 5 games to get there, but I am hooked.

And the fact that it's modable just makes it so much better. I might be new to Civ but if you love Strategy, get this game. It's worth every cent. Although if you want (cuz it's pretty expensive with the expansion packs) then wait until there is a sale. Then you can buy the Gold edition. Having an expansion pack adds so much to the gameplay. Either wait or buy now, but once you do buy it, well, ENJOY!","December 4, 2013","true","150.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its 'Just one more turn!' brilliance is down to lots of brilliant options to customise your game and an abudance of great mods to add  for further customization, no playthrough is ever the same. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in history, geography, or just strategy games in general; its realism is sufficient yet not so much as to be boring. First-rate game in my opinion.\n\nI would recommend that you buy the gold/complete edition if you are serious about playing the game.

You could easily spend 48 hours straight on this game.  Workshop support is fun, though not all of the mods really work that well.  Also, seems to have optimization issues, can run on almost any comp within the last few years on low, but high seems to have trouble on even dedicated gaming comps.  Also the more turns have passed, the more time it takes for the cpus to take their turn.  Like I would get over a minuite sometimes.\n\nAlso, the game isn't quite complete without the dlc sadly.  The dlc adds a great number of features, fixes, ect, but should have been a free update.  You can however get it pretty cheap if you check the steam sales.","June 7, 2013","true","158.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The AI is improved, key game concepts have been buffed and nerfed, as needed. And there is welcome, but not critical, DLC.\n\nWhat I love about this version: hex-based game board for more natural movement. No more stacks of doom. Global happiness. No tech trading. Drastically improved AI relations. Improved event notification system means you never miss a beat.\n\nWhat I dislike: The tech tree has been significantly flattened from Civ 4. Tech and Culture victories are terribly boring to achieve: hunker down, press "next turn", repeat 200 times. Overreliance on gold farming to buy off all problems.\n\nOverall - a successful attempt to streamline gameplay without removing core elements. Civ 5 is a success, and I welcome the coming expansion(s).","March 20, 2012","true","179.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
