Well, first off it's pretty much Faster Than Light without the ships, and that's not just a generalization it literally feels just like FTL but with walking.\n\nEvents happen constantly which is pretty swell in my opinion. Graphics are what you get from the screenshots and videos, they're fine. Sounds are good, combat is great, and the story is pretty wonderful to boot.\n\nIf you have the cash to pick up a copy please do, if you don't well wishlist this beast because it's the most fun I've had from an Indie game in quite some time.","April 20","true","1.2"," 67 of 97 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","67","97","7","10"

It can be pretty difficult at times trying to manage your group members and your resources but I think that's what makes it so enjoyable for me. A lot of games can tend to hold your hand and this was a nice change.\n\nThe combat seems a little slow at first but the further you travel the enemies get pretty difficult and having to manage 4-5 people can get pretty chaotic and tense despite being able to pause and plan out your movements / actions. It can either be really fast-paced or really strategic depending on how people decide to play.\n\nYou come across encounters pretty frequently, and there is a decent variety between all of them. Some can be pretty serious while others can give you a laugh which helps with the games pacing.  I would love to see some mod support and mods for the game later on.\n","April 20","true","14.5"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","40","53","0","0"

The world is nicely presented through the writing, allthough, in not too long you will start to see events play out that you've experienced before and it starts to feel a bit dry. I also love that there's contextual use for certain items and skillsets for the other survivors should you happen to have the appropriate ones with you.\n\nOn the other hand, it's easy to grow tired of the unceasing slaps that the game doles out to you when  the dice do not fall in your favour, and yes there seems to be quite a bit of dice rolling behind the scenes in this game. At one point I had two survivors who were both starting to feel the wear of travelling and needed to rest. When you're in a city you can search for a safe space to rest in, which sounded like a good idea at first. The catch is that when you search for a place like this you run the risk of running into zombies, but I thought little of it as I had only met zombies rarely while doing this.\n\nFirst attempt I ran into seven zombies. With two survivors and little ammo left I decided that it wasn't really worth the trouble and fled. The game decided that doing this was to be punished by losing my other survivor. Even though the zombies only appeared from one side of the screen. You can never flee an encounter without risking loosing one of your partymembers or loose gear. Aside from the events where the game asks you if you want to approach something, it is never an option to refrain from combat with the undead without some kind of repercussion, which I find forced and ridiculous.\n\nSearching for a second time led my main guy into a gaggle of five more zombies, which at that point I HAD to flee, which lost me my best weapon. Searching for a place to rest a third time ALSO led me into a group of undead, but at this point my main guy was so tired of trying to find a place to rest he simply died of fatigue on the spot.\n\nAside from that I've had survivors instantaneously die from hunger right after travelling because the health meter takes a hit immediately if you allow the hunger meter to fill up, instead of gradually taking damage after it's filled, which would avoid those annoying events alltogether.\n\nOr the events where you roll the dice and either things go well or you get to nominate one of your party to either take a slight hit or get fatally wounded. An example of this is an event where you come across a point where a road has been blocked by a fallen tree and loads of cars. You get three choices in this event; Navigate between the cars, climb over the fallen tree or skip the whole issue alltogether and go through the woods.\n\nHaving played a good few zombie games and seen a rather large number of zombie movies I figured moving in between the cars would be bad as there would most likely be undead still strapped in the car, and climbing over the tree sounded like an event where one of the survivors would fall off. So I headed into the forest to go around. No dice, it was full of undead. So I decided the tree was the least dangerous of the two remaining options. The survivors I sent up and over promptly fell off the tree and hurt himself. In a second game I came across the same situation and decided to go for the cars. And Lo and Behold, there was a zombie hidden among the cars who grabbed my survivor and bit him in the foot, incidentially the same guy who fell off the tree in the previous example, so maybe he was just a plain unlucky guy.\n\nI wouldn't mind these outcomes so much if there was a hint towards how successful either of these actions would be in the text, but no such luck. The game throws the dice behind the scenes and either saves you or dooms you in the process.\n\nLuckily, the survivors, aside from the few paragraphs you get about them when you initally meet them, turned out to be pretty faceless up and until where I've played so far. This meant that everyone in the party aside from the main character, served as risk sponges, item mules and a means for safety in numbers. I'd have loved for there to be little snippets about the characters in your party and how you get along with them, the partymembers weighing in when something happens, ANYTHING just to have some kind of impact when the random dice decide that someone needs to die.\n\nIn short, if you like the idea of a decently written, bit style zombie survival game where you travel from point to point like in FTL, with arguably somewhat shallow mechanics and random numbers deciding 'yes' or 'no' outcomes, you will probably like this game.\n\nI on the other hand found the game not quite my cup of tea for the reasons described above.","April 29","false","2.5"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","35","47","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099294955/recommended/458000/","76561198099294955","$teamy Ray Vaughan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099294955/","54 products in account","I really, really wanted to like March of the Living. I really did. I absolutely adore FTL, and considering this game has 'inspired by FTL' and 'FTL meets Walking Dead' all over it, I was pretty eager to give it a try. Sweet holy god was I let down. The only thing in this game that's even remotely akin to FTL is the map screen, and even that is a cluttered mess compared to FTL's. So many of the events are buggy (or perhaps just outright stupid) I honestly thought the game was still in Early Access; I had to come back and check the page to see if it was in full release. One example: there's a random encounter where the game will steal something from you, and there's not a single thing you can do to stop nor avoid it, it's based entirely on the RNG. As if this wasn't bad enough, one of the items that can be stolen is the active weapon your character currently has equipped and is HOLDING IN THEIR HANDS, yet they "won't notice it's missing until the thief is long out of sight". I understand it's random chance since this game is a "roguelike" (no, it isn't, but that's an entirely other kettle of fish), but how exactly am I supposed to play the game when the very first event I get involves my revolver being stolen OUT OF MY OWN HANDS, and me apparently not noticing it until it's too late? FTL and actual roguelikes will always give you a choice, that's part of what made them playable.  If you don't think you'll survive against a ship in FTL, you have the choice to jump away and survive; if you don't want to risk your crew fighting giant alien spiders, you can leave the colony to its fate.  March of the Living gives you some choices, but a lot of its events are just a random coin toss you have absolutely zero control over. Did the RNG dictate you run into the thief? Then you'll lose something the second you get to that square. That's the game in a nutshell.\n\nThat's not even getting into the basic gameplay. Your character will find random events on the roads and forests of the world, and go into the cities to scavenge and restock. There is absolutely no way to scavenge anywhere outside cities, so you're relying even more on pure luck to get by if you don't go to the special city icons on the map. Scavenging anything worthwhile will bring a horde of zombies to you nine times out of ten, which is semi-understandable...except for the fact the scavenging system is incredibly stupid. If you bring the attention of zombies onto you, the game does NOT tell you the results of your scavenging until AFTER all the zombies are killed. So if you spend 60 minutes (the maximum time, and always has a roughly 60% chance of bringing zombies) scavenging a hospital, and zombies show up, the game not only doesn't give you what you scavenged, it doesn't even TELL you if you successfully found anything or not. You can waste precious bullets killing off the 8 zombies your searching brought in, only to find that - WHOOPS! You didn't actually find anything. Likewise, if you try to flee from the zombies, you get absolutely nothing from scavenging. The stuff scavenged becomes a 'reward' for beating the zombies, and if you don't beat them, you don't get a damn thing.\n\nSpeaking of fleeing, fleeing will bring on an entire host of issues that almost always makes fighting the zombies preferable, even in the worst, dumbest of circumstances. Fleeing will make you randomly lose something, which can be something fairly minor, such as a few bullets or rations, something fairly major, like an actual inventory item, including weapons, or it can be something absurd, like an ENTIRE PARTY MEMBER. I fled from three zombies on a forest road, to conserve my and my companion's ammo. The result of fleeing? My companion (Barry was his name) 'was no where to be seen'. He was just gone, with zero explanation; not dying to the zombies, not actually trying to steal my stuff, just ♥♥♥♥ing gone. The game is FULL of random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that, not to mention things that are still buggy. My final death? My character literally just stood there being eaten to death by a single zombie. He refused to flee, he refused to shoot or reload his gun, he didn't swing his melee weapon, and he didn't do the 'push back' move you can use to shove away zombies that have grabbed you. He literally just stood there being eaten to death from 9 HP down to 0.  Considering combat is unbelievably dull and simple (especially compared to how dynamic FTL, this game's 'inspiration' is with its combat), it's almost unbelievable that they would have problems with it.\n\nThis is a long, rambling review (and I actually have even more to say, frankly), but I just can't get over how incredibly bad and almost unfinished this game is. It honestly seems like it's still in Early Access just because of how utterly nonsensical or outright buggy it is. For god's sake, the options for choices during random events have numbers, yet another thing they took from FTL, but the numbers on your keyboard don't even activate those choices, forcing you to do it via mouse. I don't understand how the game can compare itself to FTL so much while being so bad. It's a relatively simple concept, and compared to the depth and strategies involved in FTL, which AGAIN, this game claims to have been so inspired by, it's a bog simple time sink of a game...and they still manage to fill it with the most random, unfair ♥♥♥♥. Whether it's purposeful or accidental, the choices the developers made in making this game are incredibly stupid. This game could actually be good, and I sincerely hope it is someday, but it requires an absolute buttload of polish before it's there, let alone before it comes even remotely close to being as good as FTL. If actual choices and strategic, intense combat are what you're looking for, just go play FTL again. If you're super serious about playing a post-apocalyptic survival game, then go pick up Neo Scavenger. It's a million times better than this, in terms of combat, choices, story, survival aspects, and depth. Just don't play this game, not until the developers actually give a damn about making it worthwhile instead of just cashing in on claims of "FTL meets the Walking Dead!" which this absolutely is NOT.","May 15","false","2.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Personally, I haven't been bitten (teehee) by the zombie bug: they're boring whether they're shambling, running, walking; they're boring whether they're stupid, learning, or ending John Leguizamo's career. “OOOO, METAPHORS! WE'RE THE REAL WALKING DEAD -” Shut the ♥♥♥♥ up. It's tired. It's old hat.\n\nBut I really dig this game. REALLY dig it.\n\nMarch of the Living is a “you're ♥♥♥♥ed” simulator: whichever character you choose, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You're given an objective and you have to set out on a randomly generated spider-webbed path, dealing with zamboozles and the living, all while juggling items and your own well-being. With each kilometer traversed your character (or party) will become fatigued and hungry, meaning you'll have to take less-than-opportune snack, potty, and nap breaks along the way. Since it's zombie country now there's a helpful gauge indicating how close the zombie growling is to you and, if it gets close enough, you'll be thrust into that weird FTL pause command strategy gameplay. You'll encounter sometimes as many as six zimbompos, and when you have a party of your own things can get crowded real quick. It's hard to tell pixels apart in the mosh pit but you can select actions outside of the fray using little character profiles on the top right.\n\nAs you travel you'll hit cities (distinguishable on the map because they look like skylines), and you can scavenge for more supplies... they're like reliable oasises. You'll grab health, ammo, items to trade with barterers, and weapons.\n\nThis is a procedurally generated, RNG-y affair so it comes with the usual pros and cons.\n\nPros: every journey is going to  be a little different.\n\nCon: ♥♥♥♥ you, did you think you were going to find a crab apple or something to eat? Enjoy a long, agonizing, drawn out death.\n\nThe writing is compelling in that FTL way... lots of encounters and scenarios, lots of characters to meet and unlock, lots of deaths to die. And it's not about the destination,  it's about the journey. You're going to die an AWFUL lot, and sometimes it's just going to be straight-up NOT FAIR... but you'll persevere, in the end. You'll come back to this one because it's exciting to see how long you can hold it together, how different situations can be defused (or ignited), etc. Biggest gripe I have is the fatigue/hunger bar drops SUPER quick... but that's just me. There's also a flee mechanic in case you decide you want to cut and run from an intimidating fight... if you're alone you're liable to lose some ammo or food or an item, but if you have a party member or two you can pretty much say buh-bye to them. Of the five or six times I've fled with a party member in tow they ended up lost except ONCE, never to be seen or heard from again. Maybe that's just my RNG, I don't know.\n\nWhat I do know is this is a fun one if you're looking to fill in that Organ/Oregon Trail/FTL void in your heart.\n\nAnd that cover art? Brilliant. There's a zambly with maggots writhing in the sinews of his torn corpse and it is radical.","April 20","true","2.9"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","38","57","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatOneLys/recommended/458000/","ThatOneLys","Lys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatOneLys/","442 products in account","NOTE: I have to say that I played a sizeable role as one of the game's event designers. As such, this review may contain elements of bias, but I will try to be as honest as I can, from my perspective as a gamer. I played more hours than you can see through various dev builds pre-Steam, so I'd like to say I've seen much of what the game has to offer.\n\nMarch of the Living has some similarities to FTL: Faster Than Light, an excellent game which was openly admitted to be a large influence. As one of four playable survivors, your main goal is to pass through three zones, each gradually increasing in difficulty, and reach the end sector, picking up other survivors and supplies along the way while dealing with situations and quests as they arise in each sector. All this is done while managing your supplies of ammunition, food and items, whilst balancing health, hunger and fatigue. It's a fairly simple concept that, for the most part, works pretty solidly. At least during my playthroughs, I tended to find a considerable amount of supplies as I was rather thorough with scouring the map, but you'd be surprised how fast that can go when you have several party members.\n\nThe combat isn't the most complex model out there, but it works well enough. You can control up to six party members in real time, with a pause option for sorting through each character's actions. This makes sure it doesn't get too overwhelming. There are four main weapon types, which are melee, pistols, shotguns and rifles respectively. Each character has their own preferred weapon type/s, though they aren't restricted by said preferences, so characters aren't completely useless when using gear they aren't skilled with. You'd be well advised to keep one melee weapon on hand, but with the limited inventory space... eh.\n\nYou'll find both human and zombie enemies, which do have some subtle differences in colour palette and attacks. The former tend to be infinitely more dangerous however, so be wary. Rushing into a fight with a trio of bandits isn't wise if you're going solo, after all. Playing smart and knowing when to flee will come in handy. I personally found using the pistol's uncanny ability to headshot fairly often at short range to be a workable strategy throughout, though that may be changed. In a prolonged fight, you may cause enough noise to attract other zombies. This is most likely to happen in cities, but can happen out on the roads too. It'll eat through your ammo if you let it.\n\nIt's... not really a good idea for me to judge the quality of the writing, given the circumstances, but I do find that it is more than adequate for the purposes. There's much which could be done with the setting, but hopefully it can be expanded upon with mods or with future intervention from the devs themselves. I will say though that it's easy to add in custom events by following the simple structure shown in the games .XML event files. Notepad++ and a bit of practice/study of the given files makes it a breeze.\n\nIt's not the most visually spectacular game out there, but that's a by-product of the art style more than anything else. It works fine, and can be edited/added to easily enough. I found the music to be a nice touch, suiting the atmosphere of the game. It might get grating after a while, but that might also be because of the amount of time I spent listening to it pre-release during game testing... Of course, this is all replaceable, or will be in due time.\n\nIf I had any complaints, it'd probably be with the map's random generator, but the settings for that can be changed fairly easily. That's a running theme with the game, incidentally. Everything can quite easily be changed if you look through the files and edit some variables. Tailoring the experience isn't too difficult at all.\n\nOverall, I find the game to be rather entertaining. It's not perfect by any means, but it's defintely competent in all the right places. It's a simple enough concept that pretty much anyone will grasp the main gameplay mechanics within a few minutes at most. The game as it stands is reasonable on its own, but it also functions works well as a base for expansion by enterprising players. I can't wait to see where the modding community takes it in the future.","April 20","true","6.7"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/recommended/458000/","Borba","Borba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/","1717 products in account","TL:DR at the end, scored 10 / 10 as of 20th April 2016\nBorba Recommends\nBorba likes:Genre - A 2D roguelike-like such as FTL and Convoy, this time in a zombie postapocalypse. It manages to capture the desperation of such event through excellent writing and a well balanced challenge, as players need to guide their survivors on a journey in a search for a safe haven while trying to prevent them from starving to death, becoming infected or getting killed by either zombies or humans.\n\nReplayability - As one would expect from this genre, it provides plenty of depth to be replayed over and over again, providing all sorts of random events and a random map to boot with. Even if players get the same events on different playthroughs, the outcomes may change, making most decisions be taken according to the current situation other than being premeditated by the knowledge of previous playthroughs. Other characters may be unlocked to be picked at the start of the game, and hopefully this will be expanded upon.\n\nNarrative - There’s plenty of story and lore to pass around, as both the characters’ personal stories are interesting and the random events are well written and immersive. It really adds to the mood and keeps every playthrough interesting.\n\nGameplay - As gameplay stands, there’s the travelling, event interaction and combat. Players travel the map by choosing nodes that are connected to their current node, through a map, and each node may contain either an event or a city ( these have their own icon ). Interaction comes through a series of menus, in which we equip our characters or select what option to take during an event. While traveling or as an outcome for an event, combat is inevitable, and is done in real time with full control by the player, allowing for pausing to time actions or plan accordingly. It feels right for the game to have this familiar sort of control scheme, as it’s similar to others in the same genre.\n\nInterface - The interface is well thought of, providing info for supplies and character statuses on screen, as well as buttons that allow for the most common actions, such as scavenging, eating or resting. To switch weapons however, players need to open a menu to equip their characters, and as this is done the characters become deselected if previously selected in combat, which Borba didn’t find very intuitive. Toggleable melee and ranged weapons on a small icon besides the character portraits might’ve been a better way to do this, but it’s still just a minor annoyance.\n\nGraphics - The 2D graphics are very detailed with some amazing background settings, as far as pixel art goes, and the characters are well animated. There are weather effects for rain of different intensities, and working flashlights to assist in fighting during night time.\n\nMusic - The music, either in and out of combat, makes it so that the ominous setting of the game feels almost palpable. It’s well designed and fitting, showing no signs of becoming repetitive over time.\n\nSound - Despite having little variety, it provides enough sound effects for combat, ambient noises for rain and night time, and let's not forget about the groans that will haunt survivors during their trip.\n\nDesign - Taking into consideration that the game was inspired on the likes of FTL, Borba had high expectations for the game, and thankfully they were met. March of the Living is very challenging, without feeling impossible, and every mechanic that provides means of being successful without depending too much on the luck factor ( RNG ), such as trading, being able to select scavenging longevity or to rest in safe areas, is a welcome addition. Hopefuly the developer will expand on more mechanics and events in the future.\n\nPolish - Borba had a few small issues, such as getting the characters deselected when changing weapons or the game inconsistently pausing before combat, otherwise there was no major bug during several ( unsuccessful ) playthroughs.\nBorba dislikes:Nothing!\nBorba feels likepurchasing March of the Living is a no-brainer for fans of the roguelike-like genre, meaning anyone who enjoyed FTL and similar titles. It’s price, at the time of this review, is fair for a game that can provide several dozens of hours due to its high replay value and challenge.\n\n10 / 10","April 20","true","14.1"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","23","36","0","0"

The look of the game reminds me of the original Police Quest and Kings Quest games, with the 8-bit, blocky look and the quality writing instead of voicework. If you like FTL or Oregon Trail i would suggest getting this game asap, you should have a good amount of fun with it. The theme and setting is also very "Walking Dead'ish" also.\n\nYou will die alot, fail early on,etc.. things will not be easy for you and any companions you find along the way, make you're decisions wisely though, they can have big impact on things.\n\nYou pretty much go from each area/city and go scavenge, shoot zombies and make tough decisions when you come across someone or something.

It was a bit confusing at first, died many times but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy imo. I wasnt going to review the game until I finished it but honestly I am enjoying every second of it. I have to be honest, I did buy it so I can recieve free stuff from another game, but it was so worth it. The graphics can get annoying at times but overall not that bad. Download and install was very quick and easy. Gameplay smooth and obviously not graphics heavy, but it doesnt matter because I knew what this game was going to be like before buying it. Overall I would give this game a 9/10, I think its a bit too pricey for a FTL like game. Other than that it would be 10/10 if it was cheaper. I am kind of curious/excited if the makers are going to implement more guns and a co-op option, because it would be so much more fun with friends playing. But all in all great game and love the story line.","April 21","true","6.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

I've got 72 pistol bullets, 124 shotgun shells, and 36 rifle bullets. I'm throwing away first aid packs and old rifles. Juno is running around like Michonne decapitating zombies from behind with a machette while they chase around the other guys. Of course, I'm a little short on food, so we'll probably all starve to death. But, hey, it's always something.\n\nHaving played for two nights I can say this:\n\n- The combat interface is good. It could be improved with some tweaks, but a few people are claiming it's unplayable or something, which is stupid.\n\n- The combat is more tactically complicated than a lot of people are giving it credit for, especially if you want to conserve ammunition.\n\n- I definately did get to the point where I was "I just want to get to the next city and loot it" while at the same time I was getting tired and worried about making a mistake and killing everyone. The key to a turn-based game is that "just one more turn" feeling. If I want just one more turn, it's good.\n\n=====\n\nEDIT 4/21:\n\nI'd note that I did end up playing the game until about 2:00 last night. I still can't give it 10/10 becuase there are some clunky things about combat. The main one is that you have to go into inventory to switch weapons. There should be a click button to cycle them, or something like that. But, the game was interesting enough that I played through that minor frustration. Given combat is over half of the playtime, that is pretty good.\n\nI ran into repeat events, but not often enough that it felt tired and I'm pretty sure they weren't duplicates in one playthrough. The game did stop responding once and I had to kill it from the task manager. But, the "continue" button got me back to the same place and the game didn't become unstable after that.\n\nIt doesn't presently have the diversity of FTL. But, FTL didn't have all of the features it has now when it was first introduced. Also, a lot of what kept FTL fresh were updates and mods, which this game seems like it could also accept pretty easily.\n\n=====\n\nAll the elements deliver. The game requires a lot of strategic thinking, resource management, and tactics. There are about 12 significant variables (it depends on if you think of inventory and weapons as one consideration or one per character), all of them are intuitive, and they are all recursively intertwined. No two elements (hunger and fatigue, for example) can be managed separately.\n\nLike most games of this type, it has a steep learning curve and you're going to die. Probably, it's going to be after slow resource attrition leading to a TPK encounter nowhere in particular. I suppose that is theme appropriate.\n\nAlthough it is roguelike, it doesn't feel like FTL. This is more the equivalent of "The Oregon Trail" with zombies.\n\nIf the type of game and the theme are your taste, it's better than it looks. It's worth $20.","April 20","true","14.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Not here.\n\nThe map system:\nIn FTL, plotting out your course is interesting.  Sometimes you'll have to make comprimises to avoid dangerous zones, or dive through multiple tough zones to get to a quest.\n\nIn Marh of the Living, you open the map, plot the course that hits the most cities and fewest other dots before hitting your goal.  Cities are your primary source of all resources, so there's no reason why you'd ever skip one, and every other point on the map seems to have similar difficulty.   Nothing changes your plan or strategy, so it became boring to me by the time I got halfway through the first map. (3 maps per game)\n\nThe combat system:\nIn FTL, there's a wide range of weapons that do vastly different effects.  You have subsystem targeting.  You have crew damage,  You have boarding parties.  You have drones.  You have hull breaches,  You have fires!  You can upgrade any of a number of systems to cater the way your ship fights.  If your ship gets a strange set of gear, you can find yourself tackling fights in completely unique ways.  Stuck with ion blasters and a teleporter?  Maybe you'll have to try disabling their weapons while your boarders knock out their O2 generators.  Maybe the next fight puts you up against a Drone ship, so that won't work, and you'll have to come up with another new strategy.\n\nIn March of the Living, you set your pistol to headshot mode, unless an enemy is so low that they can be killed by a regular shot.  Shotguns only get used in the normal damage mode, unless you have a huge surplus of ammo.  Rifles use the same strategy as pistols.  Pistols > Rifles > Shotguns.  Switch to melee to clean up the last few zombies so you don't run out of ammo.  Even when different zombie types start showing up, there's nothing that makes me change how I play, so it gets repetative very quickly.\n\n\n\nI love FTL and I love zombies, but in spite of that I can't seem to enjoy this game. : /\n\n\nP.S.\nMinor gripe about the writing for some encounters.  Let me give a specific example:\n\n\nSpoiler Warning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nOne event has you come across two men arguing.  Person A says that Person B stole their backpack with all their supplies.\n\nB says that he has a daughter who needs the supplies, and also that A murdered someone to get the bag in the first place.\n\nA says that B is lieing, and doesn't even have a daughter.\n\n\nI sided with A, because it looked to me like B was lieing and robbing him. (if A was really a murderer, then he probably would just kill B, instead of trying to convince him to give the bag back)\n\n\nIf you side with A, B puts down the bag, goes over to a tree, retrieves his daughter from hiding, and then leaves.  A picks up his bag, and leaves.  No reward, you picked wrong.\n\n\nThat makes no sense!  As soon as B steps over and retrieves his daughter, I would see that A is lieing, which would change what I do!  At the very least, give me an option to fight A for the supplies.\n\n\nThere's plenty of ways that scene could be written to make sense, but instead it just seems sloppy.  Instead of making me feel bad for picking the wrong choice and screwing over the guy and his kid, I just felt angry at having bothered to read the text at all.","April 24","false","1.6"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","21","37","3","5"

You're given an objective and you have to set out on a randomly generated spider-webbed path, dealing with zamboozles and the living, all while juggling items and your own well-being. With each kilometer traversed your character (or party) will become fatigued and hungry, meaning you'll have to take less-than-opportune snack, potty, and nap breaks along the way. Since it's zombie country now there's a helpful gauge indicating how close the zombie growling is to you and, if it gets close enough, you'll be thrust into that weird FTL pause command strategy gameplay. You'll encounter sometimes as many as six zimbompos, and when you have a party of your own things can get crowded real quick.

It's nice that ammo and food just stack without taking up space, and I like that people barter and that some people "collect" otherwise crappy loot, making you actually think twice about throwing away glasses and bobbleheads. I like the map system and that the random encounters are frequent, varied, and that they can have different outcomes.\n\nI don't like the combat. If all you have to do to avoid getting wrecked is to move, why can't there be some AI for your buddies to move out of the way once in awhile? Having to control them just as much as your main guy just makes it that much harder to keep him alive. I also don't like the difficulty "curve." I was having a very successful run until I got into one fight in the second zone where suddenly I had no reaction time to move my guys out of zombie range. My main guy died before I realized he was even in danger, and he had a Semi-Automatic Pistol, so shouldn't he be attacking at least as fast as the zombie?\n\nAreas where improvement would be nice include smaller map "zones," since the random generation just makes for weird routes and like fifty places per zone that you just ignore. Another thing would be an "empty clip" option in the management screen. If you find a better weapon than the one you have, your precious bullets are stuck in the worse gun. Some variation in barter values would also be cool. A guy on the road with 5 handgun bullets to his name wouldn't part with them as easily as the defined trading post that has 30 of them. Finally, I got a car. I had to have a certain character in my group and had to fight off a group zombies, but getting the car fixed up did absolutely nothing, so far as I could tell. It doesn't even appear on the side of the road when you stop or anything. Are you planning to update that, or what? I should at least be able to move across two points on the map at a time or get trunk space for items. What was the point?\n\nOverall, I like the game and would have recommended it if it weren't so frustrating.","April 28","false","3.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I thought I wouldn't put  a lot time into it but it turns out I kinda played more than I thought I would. The RNG aspect is nice and for a few tries you'll feel the novelty of the game. The story and survival aspect are nice as it simulates an apocalypse and the random events are interesting when they appear. They hunger and fatigue system add into the survival aspects as resources besides ammunition and food that you have to monitor.\n\nWhat are the cons?\nWell the combat system is pretty poor and repetitive. Having no direct control other than a random threshold probability that you're survivors might hit a target is frustrating and old after a while. Also you're characters can dodge movements and run through herds of zombies without getting hit, so its just a kite game after a certain point. The combat aspect is probably the biggest issue by far.\nThe fact that there is no incentive to explore other regions of the map because its a point a to b kind of movement so going to a city on the bottom of the map yields no benefit when you can just keep moving to the next area with a seemingly identical city.\nThat there isn't much use to misc. items beyond the certain events they correspond to. Like a rope, blanket, matches, etc. can be used for so many things but they are only useable through set random events.\n\n\nOverall review?\n6.75/10 on this game.\n\nNot a bad game, the story and survival sim. is kind of what you're buying it here for which compensates for a semi-decent combat system and lack of freedom. There are defintely worse games you can buy. If they just fixed or completely changed the combat system and provided incentive to explore (for example markers that symbolize like a military checkpoint, farm, gun store, gas station, etc. rather than just cities only) this game would be improved dramatically. So should you get it? I would if you like story driven zombie survival and don't care too much on the combat. Overall content as well such as more useable items like more firearms, different types of foods,armor, different types of clothing to protect from weather i.e rain, etc. More ways to develop characters such as experience from using firearms such as the rifle after using it to kill a certain amount of zombies will increase their proficiency for that weapon type or treating medical wounds would increase experience in healing which would allow for more effective use of medical supplies. There are many other improvements that can be made but these are just a certain few stood out the most.","April 22","true","23.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You are a survivor trying to get to this so called safe haven that has been rumored about. It is supposed to be a safe place for survivors to stay in from getting bitten by zombies and for people to heal up there. The game mixes Roguelike elements with a survival horror but in a 8-bit styled graphic. Most of the games events use RNG (Random Number Generator) in order to make the game different every time that you play it. The game holds a nice story as you progress, finding what remains as you travel throughout cities and towns hoping to find supplies that are essential to survive.\n\nGameplayThis game consists of a lot of elements that relate to the roguelike genre, such as fatigue, hunger, and limited bullets. It all ties together to create quite a difficult game. Depending on how fatigued you are will depend on how the game will penalize you and make the game harder overall. The game will put a penalty on your hit chance, melee damage and your speed. This could ultimately mess up your run as you will be forced to rest and hope that no zombies will find you whilst you are doing so As you travel throughout the world map you will notice one key feature that links this game with FTL which is the world map. Every time you are able to get to the end of the road or a village you will be able to choose where you want to travel to next. You might get certain missions to go to certain places to progress the storyline further, but these are completely optional which is nice that you aren’t forced into it. Your goal is to get to the end of the world map, which is indicated by the yellow mark on your map, as well as the blue marks which show what areas you have already explored.\n\nAs you travel throughout the open roads, destroyed villages, and cities, you will more than likely come across people who will want to trade with you. You can sell pretty much anything from your inventory, from your flashlight that you use at night, from your bullets that you use to shoot these zombies. Everything that you find or have you will have realise is precious throughout the game, there will be a few times that you may have a chance of finding a tool box or something with items inside but it’s not a very high chance. Progressing through the game you will find some situations that you will have to choose what to do. These choices could be either good, maybe you will find some food or bullets, and other time you won’t be so lucky and might get bitten by a rat or get wounded from someone shooting you. The game really comes down to RNG at the end of the day.\n\nOne of the main mechanics of the game is scavenging when you are in a town in order to hopefully find something that will help you through your journey to the safe haven. Unfortunately, this is again lead to chance that you will either get ambushed by zombies through your search or not. The game seems to take into consideration that the longer you stay the more likely you will get caught as a percentage chance. What I don’t quite understand is why the percentages are a bit random. For example, searching for 20 minutes has a 28% chance of being ambushed, 40 minutes has a 46% chance but 60 minutes has a 65% chance. I am unsure why they went out of order with the 60 minutes percentage of getting ambushed, but it’s only really a small complaint about the game.\n\nAlthough the game is basically a roguelike that is supposed to be a difficult type of game it does feel that sometimes the game screws you over in the most horrible way. I think that there is too much RNG involved throughout the game, throughout each action that you take it feels like the game is left up to RNG which isn’t good because this can lead to some play throughs ending fast.\n\nThe game does operate on a day and night cycle, as it gets night there is a higher chance that you will get ambushed by zombies and will have to fight them or run away from them. The battle system isn’t really all that interesting or faced paced for a game like this. The way that the combat works is that you have a certain percentage chance of hitting the enemy depending on the distance between you and them. Again, this leaves the game up to chance if you are going to hit the enemy a lot.\n\nWith the graphics of the game being the sort of retro 8-bit styled, it seemed to be really well presented and seems to fit the game rather well. Every area of the game seems to be well made, making everything have this sort of retro 8-bit feel to the game, from the road that you walk across to the cities that you scavenge around, all have the same consistent styled graphic. The animations for the characters are fairly restricted, by that I mean that there really isn’t much to the enemies or the survivors that you play as is animations. I feel like there could’ve been more done with this than what it is right now.\n\nThe music and sounds really more depth to the game as you play it. It seemingly adds more layers to the game and really sets the mood and atmosphere of the game all together. Throughout the duration of the gameplay you will encounter a few music tracks that will set the tone to be either fairly fast paced or set the mood when you are just walking along the streets. The music and sounds is definitely the strong point of this game overall.\n\nPros\n+ Very nice roguelike game overall\n+ Lots of elements that counter how difficult the game is\n+ Randomly generated maps make every playthrough different\n+ Consists of choice based situations that could lead to a good or bad outcome\n+ Music and sounds really add a lot of depth to the game\n\nCons\n- The games stop button when walking doesn’t really serve much of a purpose other than resting or eating food. Perhaps have a secret in the background where you click on it and explore a new place or something\n- Too much RNG throughout the game makes the game sometimes feel like it’s all mashed together with RNG features\nSmall things like the percentages of certain scavenges goes out of order and doesn’t really make sense why it would\n\nIn conclusion, I feel like this game fits what it is trying to be genre wise. It posses all the elements that a roguelike should own, with permadeath, random events etc. I do feel like the game goes over the top with the RNG though, and sometimes the game feels like it is evolved around only RNG meaning no skill is really required. All in all I would still recommend March of the living.\n\nScoring\nGameplay - 7\nGraphics - 7\nAudio - 8\nOverall - 7.5\n\nFor more in-depth game reviews for indie and AAA games, be sure to check out the Feed Me Pixels[feedmepixels.com] website.","May 15","true","8.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It is just not as engaging as FTL.\n\nItems and choices for those items are limited. Occasionally you do get to use the items you picked up but most of the time you don't.

The party members need a sort of AI.  Managing 4 party members on a small battle screen with 7 zombies coming at you is frustrating, not only do they sometimes ignore the command you give them, they will not move when a zombie is near, and stand there getting munched on while you are managing another party member.

But to compare it to the likes of FTL is a misrepresentation.  The tl;dr is that this game is slow, it's uneventful, and it's unusually unfair.  Look at Nethack, Stone Soup, or even FTL.  Players who learn those games can have very successful runs almost no matter what is thrown at them.  I have spent a lot of time save scumming this game to learn how it works, and it doesn't.  It exists to screw the player, with very little in the way of player skill or knowledge involved.  If this game was $5, it might be worth it, but as it stands now I would say wait for some updates or changes.\n\nIn most good rogue-likes, you weigh your resources against the risks involved, walking a tightly balanced line.  In FTL, for example, you can avoid most encounters with nothing lost but fuel, but eventually when your fuel runs low you need to start taking risks.  In Darkest Dungeon, you can overly prepare before every mission and have an easy time, but may not come out with enough profit to make a meaningful difference.  In Nethack, you have to decide all the time to risk using that unidentified corpse/weapon/potion, or wait until later when you can guarantee your safety.  In all these games, you CAN make meaningful choices that impact the game.  In March of the Living, the choices are not nearly as complex or interesting.\n\nMost events in March of the Living screw you.  There are a good ~60 unique items in the game that can give you an auto success in events, but in this game that rarely means something good happens, and usually means nothing happens.  If you don't have the item, it is almost universally a "something bad happens" situation.  This would be OK, except there's 0 ways to guarantee specific items, and even worse, there's no way to increase the odds of encountering the events that call for any items you do have.  This isn't a "burn 10 common resource to avoid the encounter," this is a "did you happen to RNG luck into this one item, have available inventory space, then RNG luck into the corresponding event to call for it?"  And that feels really ♥♥♥♥♥♥, especially when every character only has 6 inventory.  And when you factor in a weapon (if you're feeling confident, you only need a gun) and a flashlight (or else you're pretty much just dead in any nighttime encounters), each character is only down to 4 inventory slots.  And when there are roughly ~60 items, I rarely ever had a corresponding item for an event.  And as I said previously, not having an item is bad.  It's auto damage (no counterplay), a resource loss (usually no counterplay, rarely there is), or, rarely, a null event where you can get away with nothing lost but time.\n\nAnd then there's combat.  Combat is stupidly simple, and kind of broken.  Enemies telegraph their attacks by placing targets over a character when they are about to deal damage, which gives the player enough time to move said character out of damage range.  So while this is a good idea, this devolves combat into something you pause every 2-3 seconds, especially if you are trying to conserve ammo and use melee.  And as only one zombie type is actually faster than your characters, this is something you'll be doing over, and over, and over again, because combat is not varied at all.  But the targeting is not the only reason to pause combat every 2-3 seconds.  I don't know if it's a bug with the game or a "feature" or what, but my gun toting characters will usually stop auto targetting after killing 2 or # zombies.  They will just sit there, guns loaded, as zombies descend on them, even with auto targeting enabled. So, once again, the player needs to pause the game, select the gun characters, and manually target another zombie.  Kind of tedious, really should not be this way.  This is not a refined, elegant, interesting combat system by any stretch.\n\nAnd the area with the most potential, the city searching aspect of the game, is equally disappointing, but for another reason.  In cities you can search different locations for more specific resource types, such as police stations for guns and ammo, and the grocery store for food and some general supplies.  "Failure" means you get into a zombie fight, which should you not flee, will still net you some rewards.  The good part about this is that it's the closest thing to a rogue-like in terms of resource balance, as you trade bullets and hp (if you screw up and get damaged) for potential loot.  The bad part is that, should you choose to run from any battle (anywhere, not just in cities), the game hands you a random penalty.  The designers don't appear to see loss of in game time, hunger, and fatigue is enough.  Sometimes it'll be light, and you'll lose nothing, or a handful of bullets.  Sometimes one of your characters will randomly die.  Yep, that's right, fleeing from battle can (and will often, from my testing, if your party is 3+ members) randomly kill one of your party members.","April 29","false","3.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The idea of it is actually pretty cool, the game is lengthy and took me 2.6 hours to get to the final area before dying. I'd say Zombies might tend to be a little over powered because of the fact that when you get into later areas, 5-6 spawn infront of you, and 3-4 spawn directly behind you.... 2 feet away....\n\nThe game has some well thought our strats you'll need to advance further into it and it gives you the overall choice of taking a risk for the better of your group, or risking it all just to make the struggle of surviving harder. The idea of cities and traders is nice, although I wish the city had a little more detail to it on the lines of just what to do in it besides scavenge.\n\nThe graphics clearly aren't impressive, but a game doesn't need nice graphics to be fun. If you disagree with that, this game isn't for you.\n\nIf you also aren't fond of games that require planning, risk taking, and well thought out decisions with a primarily "click an event" play style, this game isn't for you.\n\nBut whilst playing it, I can say the game was developed decently enough to make me keep playing it until i died at the docks. Not too shabby at all. But i'd still recommend to most of asking around others of what they think, before spending your money first, because I can't say everyone will enjoy it like it's the next indie game block buster.\n\nI hope my review helped, over all i'll give it a decently positive review, in hopes that it gets any updates it requires to improve it's game play. I'll think about making a second run if that happens.","April 21","true","2.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

And if you decide to not trade with him because you wanted to see how much ammo you had, then you won't be able to trade/barter with him at all because the option isn't there. I mean, when you are trading with anyone else, the barter option always shows up, except for the farmer.\n\n\nThis last one isn't a bug, but the scavenging percentages in towns seem very skewed. There was an instance where I had only 11% chance to proc a zed attack, so I thought I'd be safe. Nope, got hit with zeds. The next scavenge trip was 10% to proc a zed attack -- got hit there to. Then my last attempt before I said "F--k this," it was also an 11% to proc a zed attack, and what do you know, I proc'd it. Not sure if the numbers are lying and are actually higher than what they seem to be, but it seems unreasonable to get hit 3 times at only 11%.\n\n\nAnd now I have a few questions for the game: Sometimes certain decisions result in a Smiley-Face or a Frown-Face. Is that supposed to keep track of you notoriety? I understand that  once you reach Willington (I think that's what it's called), that people will judge you on your decisions, but how do they know? Were they there to see you make a bad decision? I don't understand what the point of it is, really, because at the same time, if you don't play selfishly, then the NPC's will try to kill you, f--k you over, steal from you, etc. So why implement a thing where it's nearly impossible to survive without being judged with a morale system?\n\n","April 21","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The more I play, the more I discover how in depth the game is.\n-Replay value is great. You will experience the game differently each time.\n\nCons:\n-Pregenerated characters. No character customization.\n-Can be very challenging at first until you learn what your doing.\n\nAll in all, the pros difinitely outweigh the cons. I found myself enjoying this game more than I thought I would. It's actually a pretty great game. Having grown up in the early 90's, I also enjoy the graphics. It's a great game with a very affordable price. I would definitely recommend this if your looking for a good zombie game to play.","April 21","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've died twice and reached the end once, where I got a bad ending because of a lousy decision I made. This game does hammer in that this is a cold, harsh world, and you are simply trying to scrape by. You will meet a grisly demise repeatedly in this game, and with every death, you will rise stronger.\n\nThis zombie apocalypse game requires both skill, preparation and luck in order to reach your destination. The map randomises on every playthrough, keeping each session fresh. The map screen is pretty basic though, and it would have been nice to have a background like you're looking at a roadmap, but as it stands, it still works.\n\nRandom encounters can change depending on your choice, or who or what you have with you at the time. One decision you made one time might not be the same the second time around. Over time, these encounters will start to repeat themselves, but that's to be expected. Bear in mind, this game keeps track of the choices you make, so walking the easy route - stealing, hurting, abandoning, etc. - may come back to bite you in the end.\n\nA lot of this game is spent watching your group as they travel from place to place. The 'growl' bar at the top does a good job of keeping that tension as you watch it rise or fall or go haywire, and hope you can reach your next destination before it fills up and more of them unwanted zombies show up. Except for a few rare moments, you never feel truly safe as you traverse this world.\n\nCombat is okay, which still falls within the realm of skill, preparation and luck. However, it can become difficult when zombies clump together, making it hard to select individual targets. Your survivors can only hold one weapon at a time, so in the event that you wish to switch from ranged to melee to finish off that last rotter with only a few hit point left - which is incredibly likely - you need to do it manually, and this can get tedious over time. Also, every time you change a weapon, the style of attack always defaults to the basic attack, which, for guns at least, are generally less useful than powerful attacks that take longer to charge. Sometimes, they'll attack enemies automatically, and sometimes they'll stand around, humming briskly to themselves as a zombie chews away at their facial features.\n\nYou have to do everything for your group. The hotkeys to quickly selecting your guys work in the gameplay, but not in the menu, meaning you need to select individual survivors if you want to organise their equipment. They also can't reload their weapons by themselves, althought this does give you a lot more control over how they use ammo. You'll be kicking yourself when you forget to switch your guys back from melee to ranged, and then realise you forget to reload as well. However, that's the name of the game. You've got to be focused and organised if you want to survive. Laziness will only make your next demise hurt even more.\n\nTrading is realistic, as money has no worth in this game. Credit earned from one trader can't be used with another, so basically, trade what items you've got with what items they've got based on value, right there and then. This encourages you to take whatever you can, and whatever will fetch the highest price should you happen upon one of these people.\n\nEver since I started playing, many kinks have been ironed out. The bug fixes and the introduction of difficulty settings shows that the developers care about this game. I did experience one freeze during my first couple of hours, but thankfully, the autosave feature is generous, so very little progress was lost.\n\nOverall, I quite like this game, despite its flaws, and am eager to play through as a second character, and hopefully achieve a better ending.\n\n","May 6","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Still, it's is somewhat satisfying (assuming you are not frustrated by the requirement of frequent pauses in order to issue commands to your squad of desperate survivors). In addition, the ever present threat of infection will throw tension your way when the slobbering zombies get within arms reach of your characters, as nobody wants to have to continuously heal people who's health degrades with each passing day.\n\nA good option for those who love zombies (obviously), and would like to partake in long, event driven adventures through a blood & zombie soaked land, where Karma can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ for those who must make dismal decisions if they wish to survive. Completing the game with specific characters will unlock additional ones, all with their own individual story to tell and missions to complete, forcing a decision between trying to maintain and feed a large group who can fight hordes effectively and carry more items, at the risk of noise generation and higher food consumption, or sticking to a small squad that needs less to eat, but may lack the fire-power or carrying capacity needed to survive later.\n\nHaving completed it with the starting character, I will wait a while before booting it up one random day to play the rest, as it is a good filler game for those days you're unsure what to play. It is not the type you want to purchase if you're looking for something to last you extended periods of time. Despite a few minor quibbles, there's no way I can say it wasn't worth the purchase, or that I won't happily revisit the game in the future.","April 30","true","27.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Each playthrough, map configurations and encounters/events are randomized. RNG is a big factor in this game, but your fate is still in your own hands. The main skill needed to succeed in this game is being able to assess your situation and deciding of whether to play it safe or take a risk. Taking the long way may be the safe option, but you risk depleting your supplies or exhasuting your character. But sometimes, a final desperate push for survival may be worth the risk.\n\nOn a side note. It is refreshing to see an indie zombie survival title not come out in early access. The game's content feels complete. There is room for more, but the game is perfectly playable and finishable as it is now. It also helps that the devs' main post-release priority is to patch bugs and add features to make playing the game more streamlined.","April 25","true","11.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I think I'd give this 2.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend it, but with serious reservations. You absolutely have to REALLY like these types of games to enjoy this. The writing is good, the events fairly interesting, and the music decent. Graphics are exactly as advertised. The gameplay is only OK, though. There's not a lot of strategy involved, it's almost entirely RNG. And the RNG is freaking brutal. Honestly, I'm not convinced you actually have the chances it claims you have. For example, when looting a city, you have 5 places you can loot. In my last playthrough I looted 2 cities, choosing the time option that gave me a 28% - 35% chance of having a zombie encounter. I was attacked 10 out of 10 times. You are constantly fatigued because safe places to rest are beyond rare, and supplies, especially bullets, are almost non-exsistant. But if you flee because you don't have the bullets to fight, you are very likely to lose companions and supplies. Overall, it's an interesting idea, but the gameplay is so brutal and dependent on luck, I can only recommend it to people who really like games that punish you pretty much constantly.","April 22","true","18.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaismafia/recommended/458000/","mafiaismafia","mafia is mafia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaismafia/","19 products in account","Having a great time with this game but there are some problems.\nIn my opinion, it is a good game. But it isn't worth the price. Yet.\n\nThere are parts of the game that just don't seem to make much sense and seem to be added while in good faith, aren't full realized.\n\nFor example, when traveling, you get to see your characters walking to the destination. What is the point of this? You can stop at any time but the only times I've stopped is to either rest of eat food. I feel like this was a wasted opportunity. Perhaps as you are traveling you spot something in the background and you can stop traveling and investigate it? Perhaps instead of zombies only attacking when you are "being attacked" zombies can just lumber about as you are traveling?\nAlso the game never relays to you that the positioning of your survivors is VERY important as when you are attacked, your survivors stay in the same place as you last left them. But sometimes, their positions get randomly reset and you have to move them manually again.\n\nWhen fighting zeds with a decent sized crew (4), it’s also confusing who is shooting who. You have to click each survivor to see who their target is and can't see them all at once. Then while you are "charging" up your attack, if you change targets or if your target dies, all the time spent charging is reset. And if your target is killed by another survivor due to overlapping targets then one of your survivors will not auto target something else. Along with this, auto targeting is buggy and survivors will often not target the closest zeds. Especially noticeable when there are zombies from both sides.\n\nAnd the travel map. What is the travel map? From when you first open it up, you just see a bunch of nodes connected to each other with some occasional cities scattered about. There are no drawings or "special" nodes. Why not? So much more could be done here with perhaps lakes, or forests or suburban areas. And then the surroundings could impact the events that happen at the individual nodes. Perhaps some nodes are special? Like "DISTRESS" at this node or so on. When deciding which node to travel to, rather than having to make a choice, its more or less breaks down into "What is the shortest route"\n\nAnd the combat? Combat is fun and evolves as does your arsenal and crew. Instead of having more people simply being better, it means you can combine various weapons to create a great team while balancing your food supply. For example, I have 1 shotgun in the front and the back of the team to stun zombies. Then have 2 rifles in the middle to pick off zombies. then have a pistol in the middle to help out when zombies get close. It’s fun creating these kind of combos and adapting to your ammo reserves and crew but needs MORE weapons that allow this kind of rationale. I'd say the weapon concepts are great though! Each type of weapon serves a very specific role and one cannot just judge weapons as DAM>EVERYTHING.\n\nSo what is this game? It is a FTL inspired zombie survivor game. Like FTL, there are text based events intertwined with combat involving strategy depending on events that have happened. Everything other reviewers have said. But what most people miss is the potential this game has. People are already investigating ways to mod this game and with more polish on the current innovations in the game, MotL could become something awesome.\n\nPS: Strongly believe that this game is in good hands.\n","May 2","true","8.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I honestly had a lot of fun playing MotL. I personally havent played a game like it, so it was quite a refreshing experience. The amount of strategy required to view all the different story events makes you rethink whether or not you need that extra shotgun or bandage, but its worth it to see new situations unfold from risky decision making. Bartering has a sense of realism to it, by which i mean there is no endless supply of items to choose from, and the selection is different everytime. Inventory is sparce as well, which makes grouping with fellow survivors a grave necessity. The visuals, although simple, are actually pretty well layered, and pleasing to the eyes. Gameplay and combat are very simple to understand, but at the same time can require planning and quick action to make it out with your group intact and unscathed. After looking back on MotL, i'd definitely recommend digging into your steam wallet for a worthy purchase like this.","April 20","true","3.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Though not a bad game by any means, it needs a lot more polish and more fluff.  Perhaps after some more time this game will become good but at this time I am giving this is a cautious recommendation.\n\nThough there are many negatives to this game, I feel like they can all be easily fixed or done differently.\n\nOnly 4 starting characters - 3 of which needs to be unlocked.  The problem with this becomes replayability.  Why is there so little choices in a game that is meant to be played over and over again.\n\nThe map is just a bunch of dots and points.  I'm not sure why there is no topography or anything that makes you feel like there is a world.  Traveling from one point to another almost just feels like an means to an end (which it is) however it doesn't feel very fun.  Why didn't they just make it a big city or something and have it to where we are traveling street to street or something?\n\nInventory management.  I'm not sure why you can only hold 6 items but I can carry a lot of different types of bullets.  After a while the ammo themselves are currency which I'm not sure if that was a design decision or not but that does mean that you would try not to equip one of the 3 types of guns so that you can always have some "money" to spend. Which in turn limits the variety to weapon selections.\n\nNot enough background story immersion.  Characters jump in and out of your lineup and there is no sense of who they are after meeting up with them.  Other than your main character's story, there is no real connection to any new characters picked up whatsoever. No new dialogues (that I have encountered) at all. They just become viewed as "meat shields" and "mules" which allows you to carry more items which may be useful later on.\n\nForaging in cities becomes too vital.  Since trading is very few and far in between, foraging in cities becomes an absolute must.  In fact it is recommended to try to visit every city on each zone before getting to the end of the questline.  I truly believe that they should have spread this out over the map.  I'm not sure why in the city you get all 5 of the same zones to try to forage through.  Why not put the police station at one point and then a grocery store in the next map point instead?  That way there would be a better sense of progression.\n\nThe combat though isn't horrible, isn't very spectacular either.  It truthfully boils down to kiting zombies and shooting any humans shooting at you.  However having the ability to choose between 2 different shots is nice but without enough weapon variations, the combat does become mundane after a while.\n\nHere's a video of my gameplay review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fNuBUD11QV0\n\n\nThe best thing about this game is that the gameplay feels very unique and different from all of the rest of the games I have tried.  Being that it was inspired by FTL, it does a fairly good job of recreating the fun that we all had from that game.  Given time, I'm hoping that I will be able to change this negative recommendation to a good one as this more or less ranks in the midway point (5/10).","April 23","false","9.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

(I played the beta) It's pretty atmospheric and the FTL-style random encounters are good and funny at times.

And by playthrough I mean my first run.\n\nThe game plays just like the description says, FTL style. You choose a location dot on a connect-the-dots style map and attempt to travel to that location. The physical walk between each destination point presents the oppurtunity for combat. The arrival at said point triggers a text based random event. I enjoyed each and every one of these events and many of them had me questioning if I had made the right choices, which is great in terms of replay value.\n\nYou're starting character does have a story behind them with a simple quest to get to a certain point on the map. So you don't feel like you are aimlessly moving east. There were other characters available to start the journey, but they were locked. I would imagine they, too, have there own agendas. People will join your party during your travels through various means, which is how your party expands. Your choices in certain events will sometimes result in addtional party members. So you'll want read carefully and think about your choices.\n\nAlong your journey you will have to manage fatigue, hunger and of course HP for all of your party members. You eliminate fatigue by resting. Setting up camp in an unsafe location presents risks. You can assign one survivor as watchman while the others sleep, but that survivor won't get any shut eye. Hunger is remedied by food rations and HP is regained by various medical components such health kits, bandages, various drugs, etc. Also, ammo is not plentiful in this world. Knowing when to use your guns adds another layer of strategy to combat. Resource management is an integral part of March of the Living, so sacrifices will be made constantly.\n\nCertain points on the map are cities (marked with a special icon), which present awesome oppurtunities for good loot, but not without risk. Cities have their own meta game structures for scavenging and resting. Other points offer a place to barter, where you will have to make some tough decisions on what you can get rid of in exchange for what you desperately need. Every item in the game has a CR value and bartering is based on that. Barter locations also offer sanctuary for sleep without worrying about getting your face chewed off.\n\nYou will encounter numerous types of post apacolyptic survivors, which I don't care to spoil as they are quite entertaining to come across for the first time. Some will make you laugh. Others will make you think your journey is about to come to an end. They may even request a particular item you may have been lucky enough to come across in your travels and decided to keep. In all of these events my decisions felt like they played a major role in leading to the outcome.\n\nCombat is your standard FTL stuff complete with pause for when you need a moment to figure out how in the ♥♥♥♥ you're going to get yourself out of the situation at hand.\n\nGraphically, you get what you see on the store page. Pixel graphics junkies will appreciate the visuals. The audio is great as well and helps to set the game worlds mood and tone. Not to mention, the UI is clean, simple and intuitive. You shouldn't have any issues learning to navigate it and manage inventory within minutes.\n\nAll and all, I thouroughly enjoy playing this game and plan on diving back into it from time to time. I lasted seven days on my first run (Oh, the irony!) A small group of walkers proved to much for my party of two, who had run out of ammo and did not posess any particular skills in melee combat. The end of your journey is treated with an end-of-the-movie-credits style presentation. But instead of reading credits, you will see short summaries for each of your days events, ultimately leading to your final day. I found this recap to be a nice finishing touch.\n\nThis short journey gave me over an hour of gameplay and I still had an entire sector plus one more to get through. So the asking price is fair.\n\nTDLR\n\nFTL + Oregon Trail + The Walking Dead = March of The Living\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED for those into these types of games and love all things zombies.","April 23","true","11.5"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","0"

Its especially frustrating when you realize all the random events have a scripted outcome with a "correct answer." The ending is criminal in this respect when you have to go through a series of "choose the right answer," which is essentially a guessing game that is statistically unlikely to beat. So you just spent 2 hours finally making it to the end? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, roll some dice, or have the correct pattern memorized from previous failures or die... No reward for you. Its incredibly cheap and it leaves you feeling cheated. Shame on you game.\n\nTo further convince you this game isn't worth your money. Look at a friend with both this game and FTL. Compare the hours played. Even look at those with Positive reviews of this game. What's the average? 2 hours? Almost none with more than 10. This game HAS potientially 100s of hours of gameplay in it, but no one seems to bother.

It has dark events, followed by lighthearted nonsense, two factions that are seemingly at war with eachother amidst the zeds, health, starvation and exhaustion, companions who turn on you each with their own talents, unexpected quests, three sprawling maps to explore, RNG and a difficulty-spike of cruel proportions on the very last stop before the finish where all your hopes and dreams will be crushed.\n\nDon't let the pixel-art fool you, this game is Organ Trail; Dark Souls edition. It will crush your soul.\n\nKill to get ahead, scavenge to get ahead and betray to get ahead, while the world is trying to do the same to you, while you march to the east. Always to the east.\n\nThe mechanics are simple, yet allow for great freedom during battles with the zeds. Resource-management is important too. All that matters is to survive the foot-march to salvation from the undead menace.\n\nI was very impressed with this game and enjoyed the way it all comes together and how much attention to detail that there is in this game.\n\nBut if there's one thing that I call steercrap on, it is a sudden difficulty-spike that throws out all established rules, introduces a kind of zed not encountered before, that's faster than all other zeds and two-shots everybody in your party if you're even lucky enough to have a party, right before the game would be won.\n\nI still enjoy the game and I don't regret my purchase and will surely play again, but because of this developer FU to the player I don't recommend this game unless you can get it for extremely cheap. It's high quality pixelart game otherwise, with great mechanics and good replayability.

Even now I can say the game is fun but currently i would say it is possible to lose the game off bad luck alone starved because even at 15% chance of getting caught i lost all my food in a single event so at the moment i would say either i have the most terrible luck or some things need to be leveled better as to not make the game impossible to beat without getting the combat system down perfectly.

I know they exist, but I simply didn't care enough to try one. Well, with this one I knew about the development process a little and I followed it's progress as best as I could while it was being finished. I voted yes on greenlight the moment I saw it was finally on there, and continued to follow news about it. Finally, a release date was revealed. While the price made me cringe a little (I typically buy on sale) I knew it would be worth it simply to support the developer and of course, the publishing studio Creaky Corpse (The folks responsible for the Dead Frontier MMO, which I've put a considerable amount of time and enough cash to buy a used car or two into over the last 3+ years).\n\nSo, when I logged on Steam on the release date and bought this game I felt proud of myself, that something I had helped to succeed in my own limited way had made the first steps towards making the big bucks and hopefully launching a career for the developer. I downloaded, opened the game and... put that ♥♥♥♥♥ on idle for 2 hours so I could claim my free bonus gift on Dead Frontier for buying it. Now, don't be too hasty in your judgement. I was genuinely excited to try this game, but simply wasn't feeling it yesterday. I felt like it today, so after getting home from work I started it up and actually played. And it's fun. It reminds me of my childhood, when I would play the handful of games I had access to using my Super Nintendo. The way it looks reminds me of those earlier times, where no one gave a ♥♥♥♥ about graphics or appealing to entitled kids who need everything spoonfed to them. The way you have to play does too.\n\nIn March of the Living, you figure things out on your own or die trying. And even when you have figured things out, prepare to die some more. You follow the story, powered by random events that will alter the outcome based on the way you play. Now, with a limited amount of options you're not usually going to do the things you as a person would do in that situation. That's okay, because no dev team could put in options to suit everyone. Even the folks that work on the more recent fallout games can't do it, and they must have huge teams and even larger budgets. The combat is another frustrating mechanic, until you realize that you can pause, plan your attack, then resume the game without a problem. After learning that, small herds are easy targets provided you haven't run out of ammo or been hit too much to risk melee combat.\n\nThis is what some will view as "too difficult" and that blows my mind. Once you figure things out, it's all smooth sailing until you get screwed by the RNG. However, the RNG is also the games strong point. Any story, no matter how good will get boring after enough repetitions. With March of the Living, your chances of things playing out the exact same are ridiculously slim. And with about 150 events (I saw maybe 12 in the time I actually played, which is likely 40-45 minutes) it will likely take a lot of tries to see them all. Oh, I should mention that if you die then you have to restart as there's no way to save progress (at least, not that I've discovered). That's the one thing that genuinely annoys me about March of the Living.\n\nTL:DR - If you're not an entitled brat, and don't care about graphics and all that crap, and don't mind a bit of frustration then this is probably a solid choice for you. Final approval rating: 8/10.","April 21","true","2.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Imagine FTL on a zombie post apocalyptic world. Don't be fooled by the bit art style, the game gets hard once you're done with the first stages.\n\nYou have to manage your squad's hunger, fatigue and health. That's the interesting part, you will have to balance between the risk in scavenging and the urgency of supplies. The combat is sort of turn based, there's no real turns but you can pause whenever you feel like and issue orders to your different squad members. Weapons variate between hammers, baseball bats, crowbars, rifles, shotguns, revolvers all with different stats and skills. Yes skills, in combat you can perform different kinds of attacks for each situation you see fit.\n\nHere's some gameplay if you wish to see it in action.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuVsrxUUgf4&index=1&list=PLBqXrq67D6oqyY-cV1fu3elAZgRQhgFq5","April 20","true","8.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The combat is by far the most difficult part.  I actually found my first playthrough MUCH easier then subsequent ones due to the combat and having multiple survivors.  My first playthrough had the initial survivor, and it was good.  The next few were a different story.  I picked up a few survivors and tried the combat out with 3 active participants....and let me tell you, it was difficult.  Having to micro manage every survivor every 1-2 seconds to tell them to move is a pain.  The zombies will immediatly try to grapple you once in melee and having 3 survivors is an excercise in tedium.  You have to tell each one what to do when this happens so it is VERY stressful.\n\nI don't think this game is worth $15 and that is why I'm just barely recommending it.  The story is decent but after a few playthrough's you begin to see the same story arc's at each nav point.  The music is also very good and adds to the ominous atmosphere of the world.  If the graphics weren't pixels I'd definatly say this is worth the $15.  If you were a hardcore FTL fan then pick this up.  Just be prepared to hate the melee combat mechanics when using more than 1 person.","April 20","true","9.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I get that this game is 2D but it breaks the immersion when I would never see anybody decide to sleep in the middle of the road during an apocalypse since its just bloody dangerous.\n\nDespite all my nitpicky problems with the game, in no way do I think its a bad game, the randomization of the map makes the game feel different everytime and the added consequences by getting more survivors and getting further from safety the more you progess gives you more and more weight on your shoulders that makes the game all the more dramatic and suspenseful.

So I thought I'd feature it in my 'Check It Out!' series on YouTube where I... Well... Check out games.\n\nYou can watch the video here.\n\nMaybe it is unfair to compare this game to the hugely sucessful FTL, but what I experienced was a game none too disimilar from it. Saying this, however, instantly I couldn't feel the same connection to the characters in this game as I would've preferred to have created my own character. But I do see that the set characters follow the story lines that develop as you play the game, so it makes sense.\n\nI can see this game being very enjoyable to a lot of people, but for me, I found myself wanting more. Again, comparing with FTL, there doesn't feel like there's much on the line here. I was trying to make a character survive that I wasn't really invested in; which for me is a flaw in the survival aspect from the starting point.\n\nWhen I picked up FTL I couldn't put the game down, I quickly found that 4 hours had passed by and I had encountered many runs. With this game I was constantly wanting more, wondering when I'd be hooked, but it never came. Hence why I decided to stop playing after 30 minutes.\n\nShould I have given it more time? Maybe. Did I feel engaged enough to give it more time? No.\n\nDespite these negative aspects for me. I can see the potential in this game. There are a lot of possible scenarios to explore and the map directions are vast. Perhaps it takes more time to become fully immersed with your character, and if you begin to feel that, I can see this game being very addictive. I wanted to find out what happened, but I simply wasnt invested enough in my character to help them survive along the way.\n\nNot for me, but I would recommend you try it out for yourself!\n\n6/10\n\n\n","April 20","true","0.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

However issues cropped up slowly, driving me to question how much fun I was really having. So long story short it just tragicly falls short of being a really good game.\n\nThe map is far too big for the difficulty it boasts, specially when you get a quest at the very end of a sector only for it to be 3 inches from the start of that same sector, meaning you have to backtrack ALL the way back to the start, with now no means to resupply on the way there and then back again.\n\nCombat is fairly broken as well, on both sides that it's too easy to win, and too easy to lose. You can wipe out 6 zombies with 2 shotgun shells if you herd them together. Or you can use the old faithful beat, retreat, repeat, with a hammer. However noting that the second you get grabbed, you may as well save yourself time and quit the game, look at the clock, see how much time you wasted, and question if you actually had any fun. The game has no real way of dealing with being grabbed, and for some reason, if you have a gun equipt, you have no way of firing the gun either. All you can then do at this point is watch as a single zombie slowly kills you, with no means of fighting back, or breaking free.\n\nThe same can apply if you get infected and somehow live. every day you lose a single HP, with no means of a cure, which makes me question; why is this mechanic in the game at all? why not instantly kill you and save you time and false hope.\n\nSpeaking of false hope, why is it that i can have 2 companions, yet the second my starting character dies, its a game over? What happens to them? Do they instantly die from a rampaging plot device?

The combat is clunky and the game drags on far much longer than FTL's runs which makes failed runs seem more of a waste of time than anything. The events seem more predictable than FTL and looks to have much more 90/10% chance events than FTL had.\n\nWhile it wears it's inspriation on its shoulder I would still say that's not a good thing. Dying in FTL was at least flashy and left you with a sense of "well I could do better next time" where as in March of the Living you just feel like it was inedviable and leaving you wishing runs weren't so long to begin with. (Which might be what they were going for, but I can say it doesn't inspire me to keep at it quite as much as in FTL).\n\nI would try this if you are a fan of both FTL and the zombie genre but I wouldn't recomend it for anyone else.\n\nThis is more of an inital impression as I haven't beaten the game yet, maybe I will change my mind, but I plan on moving on from this game for quite a bit.","April 24","false","4.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

It's an easy to learn and challenging game with multiple outcomes and ways to get through it based on the choices you make. It can be difficult to get into at the beginning but would like to share a few things to help you out a little more when you start off, as not to be completely screwed.\n\n1st, try to use your hammer to start off with, this will save your ammo till you need it and help you grasp the fighting a little better (You can press space bar to pause to plan your moves) I find it best to attack one and run back after your first hit before going in for a second.\n2nd, rather than making it your goal to get to the quests as quickly as you can, try to hit as many areas on the map as you can on your way to the quests, each stop you get a text box come up and sometimes these can help you get supplies.\n3rd, DO NOT FLEE. Try and kill every zombie that comes for you using the method above, if you flee, you risk chance of loosing something you may need later on.\n4th, If someone wants to come with you, allow them. You can use these to either help you fight zombies, or you can use them as a distraction so they get eaten whilst you pick off the zombies.\nLastly, when you're scavenging, always hit the 60 minute search, If you're heard by the Rotters and you kill them off, you can still potentially find items.\n\nDoing this I've managed to get as far as Day 13, through to the second map area. Getting out of the Grapple is a bit difficult at times, but other than that, you should be good.\n\nHope this helps you to enjoy the game and progress a little Further :)\n","April 21","true","11.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The combat is clunky and the game drags on far much longer than FTL's runs which makes failed runs seem more of a waste of time than anything. The events seem more predictable than FTL and looks to have much more 90/10% chance events than FTL had.\n\nWhile it wears it's inspriation on its shoulder I would still say that's not a good thing. Dying in FTL was at least flashy and left you with a sense of "well I could do better next time" where as in March of the Living you just feel like it was inedviable and leaving you wishing runs weren't so long to begin with. (Which might be what they were going for, but I can say it doesn't inspire me to keep at it quite as much as in FTL).\n\nI would try this if you are a fan of both FTL and the zombie genre but I wouldn't recomend it for anyone else.\n\nThis is more of an inital impression as I haven't beaten the game yet, maybe I will change my mind, but I plan on moving on from this game for quite a bit.","April 24","false","4.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I've always loved the retro type games, they usually have a good plot and this one is by far has one of the best plots I've played. I got use to the controls pretty easily and find my heart racing when the zombies get a hold of me. I haven't played more than 2 characters at once yet, but so far I find it pretty easy to manuver between them simply because you can pause the game and set each movement. At first I was bummed out about starting over when dying, but I quickly got over that when I realized it's almost like a new journey every time you start over. I had a feeling this game was going to be good, but didn't think it would be THIS good. I had a few minor issues along with the game crashing 2 times on me, but it doesn't happen that often and it's to be expected with a new game as I'm sure it will get fixed. Overall, I'm impressed with it and find it very addicting! The developers did an excellent job!

I will be updating it as patches are released.----\n\nOne of the biggest qualms I have about this game is the combat. The combat is atrocious as you have to manage every character in a small window of time. Characters don't auto aim or reload or move out of the god damn way, so you have to control every aspect of that and gets incredibly annoying. Not to mention right off the bat you are only armed with 20 bullets, a pistol and a hammer and are expected to fend of 5 zombies every so often (5 zombies don't sound like much, but take into account that you can miss a shot, fleeing can result in losing items AND members, and resorting to melee can increase your chances of getting bit and INFECTED, causing you to lose 1 health per day. As far as I know, being infected is a permanent debuff). This is especially annoying when you're scavenging a city and a group of zombies just happen to pop up on every scavenging attempt. You lose ammo and supplies faster than you can find them.\n\nAnother problem is with the hunger and fatigue bar. The hunger bar increases WAY TOO FAST compared to the fatigue bar. Paired with the amount of food you find, it almost makes it incredibly difficult to make it through the game with a full party. You might as well solo the game or bring at max 1 person if you want to maintain your food storage.\n\nAdditionally, losing health in this game is ridiculous. Finding health packs are hard as it is and don't help when they only heal you 1-2 and occasionally 4 hp at the most. This game wears you down, and many random events can screw you over if they choose to. For example, you can choose to search a cabin and then a zombie pops out of nowhere and infects you. There goes -2hp and another -1 hp every day. Want to avoid the crow swarm? Then duck. Oh wait - there goes -1 hp. Calling the bluff on that crazy guy at Chloe's house? Well darn I guess the gun was loaded after all: -3hp.\n\nLastly, there is just a lack of... "stuff"? There is a lot of writing in this game, which is good, but the scenery and art is minimal. Just the same pixelated forests and city landscapes over and over and over. There are very few items in the game which you actually need. You only should carry ammo, health items, food, a melee item, and that's it - everything else you sell to buy those items. No crafting or making armor or anything - and in the case there is an event where an npc does need a junk item, well guess what? He gives you one of the four important items or a stupid crossword book.\n\nThis game is incredibly unforgiving. Not in a Dark Souls "you-need-skill-to-play" kind of way but more like a "wow- developers-was-this-really-necessary" kind of way. It's okay and has a lot of potential, but the developers really need to ask and give the community what they want in terms of balancing and content and implement them in future patches.\n\nI'd give this game an overall score of 6/10 but would not recommend.","April 21","false","7.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","1"

Apparently there is this all seeing eye that judges your every action throughout the game, and if you make seemingly negative decisions, (e.g shooting someone cold blooded, even though you knew from previous playthroughs that they are bad) you get this bad ending. Basically the bad ending is a bunch of social justice warriors lynch mobbing you because of those actions. Left a bad taste in my mouth after struggling so hard to get my group of 6 to the end alive.\n\n- The game length is painfully long. Compared to FTL where you can power through a run pretty quick, this game takes ages. You have to stop and scavenge, rest and eat, and the combat is just generally slow. In order to get an efficient run where you stand the most chance, you'll be grinding through the early zones using lots of melee to save ammo, and scavenging most cities. This is a fundamental issue with the pacing of the game which is unlikely to ever be fixed.\n\n- Some bad design choices I noticed were: When you get to the end of the game and take the default path, it gave you (at least) 3 encounters back to back to back. The game never gave you a chance to eat or even reload your weapons between these encounters. This lead to me clearing the first encounter, (which was easy, just rotters) clearing the second encounter (biters and grapplers) then going into the 3rd with all my guns empty. I even hit reload before the second encounter was over, and it started the 3rd with my guys reloading their guns. Both my riflemen got rushed by 2 screamers from behind, and my shotgun and pistol man couldn't hold the 3 screamers from the front. I died, and this made me feel cheated, since I'm certain If both my riflemen got their shots off asap on the 2 rear screamers, 90% hit chance. I could have kited the remaining, and picked them off with the rifles.\n\n- There was a lack of different endings to the game. If your starting character were to die, but you had other survivors remaining, the game would just end. Black screen, then back to the main menu. Same with if you got to your son, but you or your son died, game over. This feels like a missed opportunity to add in some additional story. Technically the game should go on, your group should be able to arrive at the end with or without you. It would obviously still be considered a failed attempt.","April 21","false","13.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","3"

The kind of game where letting a child starve to death ends up having the same emotional weight as offing your best buddy when they start to get The Hunger.\n\nWelcome to the March of the Living\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe inevitable offspring of 8-bit gamers seeking a nostalgia trip;  MotL provides a side-scrolling adventure laden with amoral decision making while saddling the player with resource management and tactical  pause n' go combat. MotL quickly ends up feeling like a refreshing companion to legit indie zombie titles such as Organ Trail or Project Zomboid.\n\nFans of FTL will see some of the established themes in place such as effective course plotting, resource management, and multiple options during dialogue events (these can similarly be enhanced by characters with special skill sets). I'm finding that someone with mechanical knowhow is worth their weight in MREs early on in the game. Keep these folks alive as they can fix up broken down cars which will help out as some of the balancing for fatigue is a bit off in my opinion (as of patch version v.1.1.1, May 4th, 2016).\n\nYour character has, at present, a set plot and motivation when you start out but successful completion of certain objectives will unlock characters with different backstories, skills, and starting equipment. I'm currently finding the process for unlocking them a bit brutal but I haz totes started another run based on the newly released patch which includes difficulty levels. I'm rolling deep on easy but we'll see if that gets me any unlocks (though the hardcore in me hopes it doesn't).\n\nCharacter creation, thus, is not really an option at present so you will be relegated to the those you've already unlocked. It would be nice to see a custom character in the future with a point system of sorts that can be allocated to various areas to suit different players but, for the moment, I have to assume that most styles are out there amongst the pre-set characters you choose from.\n\nCombat is relatively simply and easy to grasp. Like titles such as Mass Effect or FTL, an in-game pause during combat allows you to select your character as well as what to attack with, who, and the level of skill you will use i.e. going for a headshot on an enemy with your pistol will require more time to pull off. A character's skill with different weapons will affect their hit percentage and time required. Some gripes I haz so far have to do with a disappointingly ineffective shotgun and an off-the-chain deadly rifle which is in need of some serious nerftitude.\n\nThough it's been improved, I'm still finding selecting enemies to attack with various people can be a bit clunky. This is because your foes tend to come at you in quantifiably sized clusterf@#k of a horde (appropriately). The difficulty lies in the fact that they lack any distinguishing features aside from type so you may find yourself hovering over multiple enemies trying to find the enemy you had targeted earlier but lost because of an erant click.\n\nAdd to this the tedium of selecting between people, reloading and changing weapons in the menu, and the enemies themselves and the sheer tedium of it all will really start to wear away at your desire to keep on marching. I'm hoping a quick-menu of sorts will make itself known since the momentum and intensity of the game can really take a dive once you realize how often you are stopping combat to switch out your empty revolver for a baseball bat. The auto-targeting system has received some attention but even after the most recent updates, I still catch my characters standing around like total turd burgers even when there's a flesh gobbling horde up in their grill.\n\nCHECK OUT THE FULL REVIEW AT ETHNOGRAPHIX:\nhttps://ethnographix.squarespace.com/blog/2016/5/17/shodeez-march-of-the-living","May 21","true","5.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The map is randomly generated with each new game so you won't get the same scripted event most times.\n\nVery minor bugs, clicking on your character in your party can be difficult on the fly but that can be compensated by pausing and laying down your battle plan.\nThe big bug I came across was where I found the little girl and her dog Rex, and escorted her back to a cottage, Chloe's Apartment for Greg's story never showed up, which resulted in me having to suicide and start a new game.\n\nBut all in all, it feels great and it's a nice change from the usual zombie games popping up nowadays, sound and scripts for events are very well done with a few bugs that can be tweaked, graphics are pretty sweet and brings back the feel of old retro games but it's not for everyone.

To the reviewers that are complaining that the game is to hard, you suck! I'm sorry if the designer isn't going to give you a hand holding experience like most modern games do and let you win with no challenge or frustration to yourself. It is really nice to see that someone is still willing to make a game that is difficult and isn't going to hold your hand from start to finish and let you feel cool because you bought it and beat it the same day. Personally if the game was beatable within a day or so I'd feel like I wasted my money as I got a day or two of play from it.\n\nHowever it really is a fun game and will make you work for every inch of progress, the game as I've seen it so far is about trial and error and the consequences for making the wrong choices. This game has tons of re play value as it has so many different options and so many different conversation paths and yeah paths/roads to take in general, every new game the map will be different/randomized from the time before making each new game a whole new challenge.\n\nSo if you want an Oregon trail/FTL/walking dead inspired game to challenge you, put on your big boy pants and give this a try, the game is easily worth the asking price if you like a game that isn't going to let you win simply because you bought it.\n\n","April 21","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Food is not plentiful enough to sustain large groups.\n\nCombat: You simply do not loot enough bullets to use guns consistently, which does seem concerning because of how clunky the combat systems can get with melee. Having to simultaneously control up to 6 characters in a live melee situation feels clunky when using more than 1-2 characters (micromanaging attacks, grapple countering, etc.). A time-based turn system like in the Monster's Den series would be better suited for combat in my opinion.\n\nI also feel that combat is rather repetitive, with such high chances to get into encounters while searching, and since combat is rather clunky, it does detract from the experience.\n\nInventory seems a bit small, but with more characters and more playthroughs, I guess we as players can know which items are useful and which are useless.\n\nThere are parts that I do like, such as not being able to go back to a previous save in the same playthrough (although I do wish we got a save slot for each of the characters!), which truly puts weight on your decisions.\n\nDo not get me wrong, the game is good, but I feel as if these issues hamper it from delivering the optimal gameplay experience.\n\nAn "easy mode" (which would probably be the regular mode, with how it is now being the "hardcore mode") as suggested with all of these improvements seems like the solution.\n\n\n\n","April 21","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely nowhere near the range of FTL's weapon selection, or in-depth damage system.\n\nThe difficulty is a long shot away from FTL levels, being far easier, and more forgiving of mistakes - you can take that as a good thing, or a bad thing.\n\nYou're not under any active time pressure from an ongoing hunt, or anything like that. Backtracking is A-OK.\n\nThe random events are enjoyable, but the encounters are on the boring side. Move, shoot, move shoot, repeat.\n\nIt's a good title, but I wouldn't recommend it as an "FTL but with Zombies" game. It's a lot more like a good sprawling story/exploration title. Fans of the rogue-lite genre may find it too easy.","April 21","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Eagerly downloaded and hopped in, confident my first run would be a decent one as I'd seen some gameplay already. Things started out great, or so I thought, then I got killed on Day 2.\n\nLoaded up a second run, and made it to day 8 and the second area in what was easily one of the funnest, most tense, interesting hour and a half of game I've had in a while. The ups and downs had me on the edge of my seat, and I was forced to make tough decisions the whole way through. Finally met my doom on a pitch black night facing a rotter the likes of which I'd yet to encounter.\n\nWhile people will and have compared this to a certain highly popular rogue-like, I think the game stands very well on it's own. The inspiration is surely there, but in my limited time with the game I feel like I will enjoy WotL a lot more than the excellent but story 'dry' FTL. Combat in the former is far more robust and polished, and can be a bit fiddly in WotL, but as a whole I do really enjoy March of the Living. My hope for future additions is really no more than more encounters. While in my two first runs I only saw one, maybe two repeats, I have been so interested in them and the risk/reward/ambiguity inherent in each to simply want more.\n\nThis is an excellent indie, and I feel that if it interests you at all, you cannot go wrong for the price.

Even with simple pixel graphics this game achieves a good amount of intensity and stress-inducing moments, as any good survival horror game should. I would even go so far as to say those simple graphics manage to set quite a dire mood themselves. The BGM is awesome and the sounds are sufficiently gruesome. The splat of my first survivor dying...\nThe game play is great; as more zombies begin showing up the ability to quickly and easily pause to direct multiple survivors, reload and make offensive/defensive choices is very handy. The massive amount of choices you are given grants the game tons of replay value (a single play-through isn't "short" by any means either). I've seen others say they struggled with the controls but i found it quite easy to get the hang of.\nMy favorite part is the random event feature, where you are given multiple options that not only determine the moment, but the entire progress in the game going forward in that every decision counts. That one point of damage or ration of food can make all the difference. Being kind to the right person or shooting another right off the bat can have great or terrible consequences.\nI haven't run into any glitches, and only two extremely minor combat functionality complaints. Great game right out of the gate. It's a bit early to rate it maybe, but at this time i give it a 9/10 score.

One instance you have plenty of food ammo and meds, in the next you looking at the death screen with your lifes summary passing before your eyes as you ponder what the hell happened.\n\nI will be playing this game for quite some time to come.\n\n","April 21","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even with simple pixel graphics this game achieves a good amount of intensity and stress-inducing moments, as any good survival horror game should. I would even go so far as to say those simple graphics manage to set quite a dire mood themselves. The BGM is awesome and the sounds are sufficiently gruesome. The splat of my first survivor dying...\nThe game play is great; as more zombies begin showing up the ability to quickly and easily pause to direct multiple survivors, reload and make offensive/defensive choices is very handy. The massive amount of choices you are given grants the game tons of replay value (a single play-through isn't "short" by any means either). I've seen others say they struggled with the controls but i found it quite easy to get the hang of.\nMy favorite part is the random event feature, where you are given multiple options that not only determine the moment, but the entire progress in the game going forward in that every decision counts. That one point of damage or ration of food can make all the difference. Being kind to the right person or shooting another right off the bat can have great or terrible consequences.\nI haven't run into any glitches, and only two extremely minor combat functionality complaints. Great game right out of the gate. It's a bit early to rate it maybe, but at this time i give it a 9/10 score. I look forward to discovering where this well written story goes next!","April 21","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I tried.\n\nSo what does March Of The Living do well?\n\n-Random events, and these really are quite 'random' I saw the same scenario twice, so I thought "I know how this ends" and did the same thing I did last time, and BAM! Something different happened, and it TOTALLY changed the outcome, and I'm talking it was a percentage thing, or my choice that effected it, although your choice4s affects things to. Speaking of which.\n\n-There are decisions to be made, some will help you, some are scumbag like, or merciful, there are a lot of opportunities to test the world and really see what scenario you're in, on-top of this, you rarely find yourself in a situation wanting to pick an option that is not listed, and after playing loads of games such as Mass Effect, I've seen just how much this kind of thing can occur, and how irritating it is.\n\n-There is strategy to it. Some may not see it, but it is DEFINATELY there, the difference between choosing which targets to shoot first (or stab) and deciding what path around the map to take, these decisions are detrimental to the events that happen in the game. After giving directions for combat, you can press space to pause the game, and check out your actions, threats and other things, such as fatigue, hunger, health, ammo and time.\n\n-It's not too complicated. But it's a nice balance in-between, it keeps you thinking, while not stressing too much.\n\n-The game has progression, and lots of it. I got to the point in the game where I thought "Yeah m8. I can take on anything" and alas; my niavety got the better of me, and the first combat scenario I got in zone two, killed me, and my squad off. COMPLETELY.\n\n-The game is not all that rage inducing, if you know what to do, you can easily make your game back.\n\nSo what's bad about the game?\n\n-The map, took me a second to figure, and althoug not all that complicated, it's pretty ugly, but it works. It's just bland is all, which can be easily fixed.\n\n-The graphics are dark and green, not much else to it. But it's not too problematic, after all. It is an apocalypse.\n\n-The game can be too cruel, as a result of the random event mechanic.\n\n-It's nearly £11, which is steep for a game like this, but at the end of the day, it has replayability.\n\nOverall it's not a bad buy, and if you liked games like FTL, you may enjoy this, I personally have enjoyed my time, and WILL be putting more into it, to experiment, and discover what it has to offer.","April 23","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also several soundtracks depending on the sectors and areas, also during combat.

The combat isn't really that great or anything and most of the game is all about choices, however, those choices in the game don't change and are pretty much set so playing through the game once and then going again a second or third time, there's a high chance that you'll end up in that same scenario and already knowing one or more outcomes so it kinda lessens the experience every time. Overall, I don't highly recommend this game...but I still give it a bit of a positive rating.
