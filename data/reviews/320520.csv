Problems begin to arise once that sensation fades away, every level is very similar and the routines are repetitive. The same can be said about level design, it's dull and uninspired, changing the colour of the background every five levels does not make it feel like a whole new experience. Besides, the studio behind the game tries to imitate concepts seen in games like Limbo, Super Meat Boy and other platforming classics. The ending result? Not good.\n\nIn addition, the character design is also very poor. Oscura as a character has no soul, we see him die multiple times and I can assure you that you will not feel any empathy towards him. The supposed "story" behind the game is abysmal so if you have read that this game has an interesting story, I am sorry but they are trying to fool you, believe me.\n\nI cannot recommend this game even to platforming fans, the overall sentiment after playing it is very bad.","May 25, 2015","false","4.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The theme of dark and creepiness defintly makes it stand out. The game has a pretty good story aswell from what i have played of it so far.\n\nEach level is around 5-10 mins long with some fairly original level designs and as i said new machanics get thrown in all the time so no level is the same.\n\nCharacter design is really spooky and generally makes you want to run away from the enimies. The character you play as actually looks far more powerless compared to the rest of the characters.\n\nNo video setting or audio setting inside the game sadly,  you get a launcher that lets you change graphics, resolution and the keyboard buttons. The game is fairly easy to run as it has pretty simple graphics but still it would be nice to have some more graphical options. Also this reminds me the game's characters are in all 3D which looks pretty cool in my opinion!\n\nIf you want to watch me play the game and review it please click here! :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFcHgGQeaLY","February 24, 2015","true","4.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

The game runs smooth and solid, and the platforming is intense and keeps\nyou attention throughout the game.  The controls are basic, though I would have\nappreciated having the option to rebind the special powers keys, as it would\nhave made my gameplay more efficient.  This did not, however, take away from my\nenjoyment of the game.\n\nYou play as an apprentice lightkeeper that accidentally plunges the land\ninto darkness, and are out on a quest to recover the lighshards and bring the\nlight back.  The story is enough to keep you interested, but not so much that\nit takes away from the platforming elements.  The game has a par time\ngoal, which\nadds to the replayability, though I would have liked to see a leaderboard, as\nit would have been beneficial to the competitive aspect of the game.\n\nThe platforming is well done and very well fleshed out.  The game is\ngreat for moderate to experienced platformers, though it never felt\nunfair.  There\nwere some challenging areas and some tricky parts, but the checkpoints are\nbalanced and set at decent intervals.  The game knows that you are going to die,\nbut it doesn't punish you for it by sending you back large distances.  The\nmechanics and level design are constantly remixed and consistantly add new\nchallenges that keep you in the environment.\n\nThe atmosphere is beautiful, the platforming is challenging, and I\nnever felt like the game was wasting my time.

Every platformer of the past few years has claimed that it either has a unique art style, or a unique play concept. Oscura has neither of these, and neither do any of those other platformers. One of the few redeeming qualities of Oscura is that it is incredibly easy to achieve 100% compeltion on, so if you're big on achievements, this could be something for you. I would strongly advise against paying the full $6.99 for this game, as it won't last you very long (much of the time I spent was just running the game in the background for the trading cards), and as such you should only buy it if it is at an extreme discount or part of a bundle.","June 2","false","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s now up to Oscura to find the shards of the stone and restore light to the Driftlands before the creatures of the dark can destroy it. Fortunately, the accident has fused Oscura’s hand with glowing fire, enabling him to wield powers altering anything the light touches. Each level challenges your puzzle-solving skills and reactions in this modern adventure built upon the time-honoured mechanics of classic platformers.\nFeatures\nMaster the Light: Along your dark journey you’ll find four different powers, each designed to help you through the Driftlands. Destruction, Construction, Gravity and Time are yours to command. Master each unique light power in your dark journey through the Driftlands.\n\nDiscover the origin of our accidental hero: Oscura wasn’t always the Driftland’s trusty lighthouse keeper. And he didn’t always have his flaming hand. Taking place before the previous Oscura games, Lost Light reveals where our hero’s journey began and the fate of the original light house keeper.\n\nOld school platformer meets new school design: Taking inspiration from classic platformers such as Super Mario Bros, Oscura Lost Light combines these elements with a modern design aesthetic.\n\nUse your wits: The Driftlands aren’t for the feint hearted and Oscura’s not a fighter. You’ll need to out-think and outwit creatures such as the Lost Ones, Shagrims, Bewinged, Grymfus, Cursed Skulls and more. Just as challenging are the puzzles you must solve if you wish to survive.\n\nConfront Evil: Just when you think you’ve succeeded by collecting the shards of the Aurora Stone, you’ll need to face the ultimate challenge and restore the Lost Light … but beware … Mavro the Lord of Shadows awaits.

It has a lot of mechanics that'll alternate and combine from chapter to chapter.\n\nThere are 4 crystals; Creation - for creating platforms in specfic areas, Destruction - for destroying weaker walls, Reverse Gravity - to run on the ceiling and lift heavy objects upward, and Slow Time - to slow the timescale of an object within the light of the crystal. All of which allow for a wide variety of puzzles and gameplay moments.\n\nSometimes, the physics lead to some odd collisions, and puzzles can become extremely frustrating because of this. Yes, it's a challenging and fair game, but because of those difficult puzzles and wonky physics, it can sneak outside the realm of "fair" now and again. On the plus side, it's not just puzzles. There's many times your reflexes will come into play. Running from monsters, landing crazy timed jumps, avoiding giant saw blades that want to chop off your face.\n\nOscura doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or anything, but it doesn't do too much to stand out and be innovative. The crystals are nice, but it's nothing groundbreaking.\n\nOverall, it's a very solid game, and I enjoyed it. There's plenty of chapters and worlds to keep you busy, and for its price, it more than delivers.\n\nYou can see it in action here (YouTube)","March 1, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game's platforming gameplay mixed with powers is pretty well done, as mastery of certain powers such as the gravity power can fling you to new parts and get past hazards that you'd never expect. Sound design could use some improvement, and while the story takes a backseat for the action, the action does do well in keeping you entertained for the first several hours. Be aware that there will be frustration due to the weird checkpointing system, as you repeatedly die on a section where you wonder why no checkpoint was added, but overall you get a game that's reasonable in execution despite having polish problems around the edge.

At that point it seems more about luck than skill and I was just hoping that I would make it to the next checkpoint before some  moving circular saw chopped my head off, again. You also die as soon as your character touches some water.

It has elements of Glare, Giana Sisters, Teslagrad and Limbo in it and it is especially satisfying when you manage to pull off a good double power combination. The powers are responsive and can be used interchangeably even when mid air. The only flaw of the game is the jump mechanic which is not nearly as responsive as it should be. Nevertheless, this tame has a great aesthetic and overall good mechanics. The game is relatively short - it took me 2 hours to beat, but the experience feels complete and unrushed. On balance, I would say that Oscura is a relatively easy platformer, for those used to games such as blood of the werewolf, super meat boy or giana sisters, but it is a fun experience and as such i would definitely recommend.","May 31, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, in several places I've had to replay the same checkpoint dozens of times purely because of bad luck, which is worse. Also, one of these involved dodging something with absolutely no warning right before a checkpoint, effectively doubling the amount of tries it took to get through the area.","July 6, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't feel it's worth the full asking price.\n\nWhich is a shame. It's similar to Limbo but with a bit more colour and some sort of power ups that you need to use to solve varoius puzzles. However, the game is very short (which may or may not matter to you) and it doesn't have that same dark, oppressive feel that Limbo has. It doesn't have a thick atmosphere to draw you in, which is something these kind of games need.\n\nIt's a relatively enjoyable puzzle platformer to play through and finish in an afternoon.

Still, it's not too annoying once you get used to it, although it did result in more deaths than needed.\n\nFinished in 3h, relatively short but still entertaining.\n\n6/10","April 21","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
