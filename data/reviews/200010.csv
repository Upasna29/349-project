Close the page :(\n\nPros: visuals and such: stunning design, not bad graphics, nice atmosphere and jokes, John de Lancie as Professor Quadwrangle, original story, price\nCons: actual gameplay: pretty short (there are some DLCs out there though), not many good puzzles, requires more jumping skills than thinking ones, freaking tons of blur\n\nThe long way:\nI love this game. Yeah, that simple, just as simple as the game is. It has nice design, good 3d-cartoon-like graphics and jokes which are really good (well, sometimes they aren't, but nothing is perfect in this world). The main problems are the puzzles and length of the game itself - I've run through it in ~6 hours, but I haven't got 100% completion though. Now about the puzzles. They are simple as well, but that's not good this time. You won't find any really hard-brainsmashing-cool-etc puzzles in this game - all of them are considerably easy.

The first dimension is 'fluffy' dimension, which makes objects lighter allowing you to carry them and place them on switches. The second, is heavy dimension, which makes objects heavier, the third is slow time and the fourth is reverse gravity. You can only be in one dimension at a time.\n\n+ The game offers a mix of puzzles and platforming. Some areas are strictly related to one or the other while other areas combine the two.  It provides a nice change in pace as you are not strictly doing one thing over and over again.\n\n+The most important part of a puzzle game is the balance between fun and challenging. This game does a great job of finding the right balance. Solving puzzles offers a satisfactory feeling and feels very rewarding.  The puzzles were not super easy nor were they impossible to solve, with careful thinking and planning you should have no problem with the game.\n\n+The game offers a nice art style that compliments the game\n\n+Every puzzle offers a time and shift goal offering a lot of replay ability if your into that sort of thing.\n\nThe Average:\n\n-The game takes place in your uncles mansion while he provides witty banter to you throughout your journey. The problem is the dialogue isn't very funny or witty and the voice acting annoyed me.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-The ending is very lackluster\n\n-Despite the great puzzle design there will always be frustrating moments in a game like this. Too many times I wanted to jump off a platform and the game didn't register my jump, a problem with most 1st person platforming games\n\n-Though I loved the main game puzzle design the DLC levels are frustrating. I said there is a balance between fun and challenging and most of the DLC levels go way too far in the challenging category to the point where I was more frustrated than having fun.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game and if you are looking for a solid puzzle game then this is worth checking out.\n","October 18, 2014","true","23.2"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","30","34","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/200010/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4251 products in account","In theory this is a game I should like. In fact, I WANTED to like it. John "Q/News Anchor from Crank" DeLancie as narration, time/space manipulation in a 3D puzzle environment, a distinct visual style, etc.\n\nHere is the problem, and to elaborate, I'm going to have to compare this game to Portal, which a lot of people did on its release due to one of Portal 1's designers (Kim Swift) leaving Valve to work on this title, which is a similar genre, let's be frank. Portal 1 worked because it was brief. It'd do a few things with a tool, then move on to something else, occasionally mashing all your obstacles up for a challenge room/test of what you'd learned. Part of what worked to keep this from getting stale was that you had hints and taunts from your omnipresent narrator/torturer, and part of it came down to the puzzles being tested to a good balance of "solvable but not instantly".\n\nQuantum Conundrum has most of these attributes, but in sort of a "they came back wrong" variety. John DeLancie is playing the same role of narrator/reason for being in this mess, but a lot of his hints are either weirdly couched in ways that you're not going to get them (and you will hear them 5 times as you try to figure them out, too), or just outright irritating. Between stages in the loading bridge areas you'll hear him spout what is basically monkey-cheese randomness about "his" predicament, but there's not much reason to care because he's the dude what trapped you in Deathtrap Manor by accident where he decided to design really, really overzealous laser beams everywhere. (I'm not entirely convinced the lasers work as intended: stuff that's just supposed to destroy items had a tendency to fire right through into my skull more than once, ending my run at a puzzle.) The puzzles are indeed short rooms to solve and then move on to the next "chamber", but there's not much chance at learning them and a few are just straight up blind luck. One in particular springs to mind as it has you choosing two or three different branch points on a conveyer belt and while it IS possible to backtrack on it, it's a real bear and a lot of them lead around corners or to paths you cannot immediately see are dead ends/death.\n\nThe other big Portal gripe I'm gonna throw out: in Portal, you get the gun, you get a few rooms of training, and then YOU HAVE THE GUN FULLY OPEN FOREVER. Quantum Conundrum gives you 4 seperate powers, which are clearly controller-mapped given how they show up on a keyboard, and then gives them to you and takes them away randomly from room to room, so that just as you earn something it's out the door for two stages, then you need to find the object in the level to swap it out with the other power, then... The juggling really makes the game more tedious than interesting, when I just want to play around with all these weird reality warping buttons instead of learn about DeLancie's fuzzy multidimensional friend who hid a bunch of barking robots all around the house*.\n\nI did not finish this game. I'm sure some people will bash me for that, but I'll be honest: I got halfway? Most of the way? through the second of four hubs, and when the puzzle was repeating the same "make object light, toss, turn on slow-mo to catch it" gameplay for a third room running, but this time with instadeath pits and sloppy wooden platforms to bounce between... I stopped. I realized that absolutely nothing in this game had any sort of charm or fun factor to keep me going. It wasn't even a CHALLENGING game, so long as you realize "Okay I have two powers what can they do" and "how to avoid lasers".\n\nThis has potential, and I'm sure that the writing isn't going to be a turn-off for some, because comedy's amazingly subjective, yadda yadda. I'M going to tell you "this game is a hot mess, avoid", but if you're remotely curious, it drops to like... $4 with all DLC constantly. Why not, it's your money.\n\n* Not a joke.","September 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 125 of 196 people (64%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","64","125","196","16","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/200010/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","First half of the game: Thumbs up\nSecond half of the game: Thumbs down\n\nWelp I quit. I really liked this game when it first started, because I really enjoy first person puzzlers, and in a lot of ways this game is a great one, but it also kinda shoots itself in the face. The different "dimensions" (light, heavy, slow, reverse gravity) make for some really great puzzles and there a lot of puzzle chambers that were genuinely fun to solve and exactly what I expected when I purchased this game. These were the puzzle chambers where you had to use the four dimensions to maneuver blocks in the environment to press buttons, trip lasers, avoid lasers, drop a ball into a net, and other types of things. I remember really enjoying a particular puzzle chamber with a bunch of conveyers, and the trick to it was that you had to use reverse gravity to utilize the UNDER side of the conveyers as well as the top side. That was a fun discovery, and it was fun to execute on when I realized it.\n\nBut here is where the game is possibly going to ♥♥♥♥ you off and possibly make you quit. It is not ENOUGH in quantum conundrum to just solve the puzzle, because this is not just a puzzle game. The further you get into the game, the more the game becomes about physics, timing, and platforming---and in the most annoying way. We're talking about a situation, for just one example, where you have to position three blocks in such a way that they fall onto three conveyors at the same time, and those conveyors (hopefully) drop them onto a fourth conveyor in a (hopefully) straight line, so that they move into position under a gap where you can use reverse gravity to elevate them into a bridge position across the gap, then quickly use slow-time to hold them in position so you can use them as a series of platforms to jump across. BUT WAIT. The opposite side of the gap is blocked by a door that has to be opened with a button, but there is a 3 second delay between the time you press the button and the time the door opens, and the door will ONLY open if slow time is on at the EXACT MOMENT the door would open. So you have to try and figure out the exact timing to press the button, press reverse gravity, then press slow time. Or is it press reverse gravity, THEN press the button, THEN slow time? How much of a pause do I leave between each one? Who knows? Good look setting up the solution 50 times until you trial-and-error work it out. And then when you finally DO figure out the timing, the game's physics dropped the safes onto the conveyor all sloppy so they're not lined up well, so when you try to execute some crappy first-person-platforming (let's face it: FPS platforming is always kinda crappy) across them, you miss the third safe and have to set it all up AGAIN. And again. And again. This all gets very f***ing tedious and sometimes even feels like there is an element of luck to it (i.e. how the physics works out), which is not a good situation.\n\nAlso, the professor or whoever talking to you over the intercom talks way too much, and it's sort of painful to listen to how much he tries to be funny but just isn't really. (Sorry, writers.) And his constant blabbering sort of ruins the atmosphere. For a dramatic improvement to atmosphere and experience, do yourself a favor. OPTIONS -> AUDIO SETTINGS -> DIALOGUE VOLUME -> turn it all the way down to zero to shut him up forever.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a really great puzzle game that could have been a real classic, but its annoying habit of ruining its puzzles with physics that are beyond your control, first-person platforming too demanding for a puzzle game (FPS platforming is rarely a good idea as it is), and requiring a series of actions to be executed in a specific sequence with incredibly specific timing----it all just increasingly ruins the puzzles as each new chamber ratchets up the demands on the player in these areas. It wouldn't be so irritating if you didn't have to go fetch and reposition a bunch of blocks into catapults and conveyors and springs etc every time you failed one of the requirements (i.e. failed timing, or failed a jump, or else the physics just f***ed you over), but when you get into the later puzzle chambers, you're going to waste a lot of minutes of your life just "reloading" the puzzle chamber setup over and over again. As I said before, this all gets very f***ing tedious.\n\nIt's a shame, because this is a really well-made game and there is a lot here to like. I just really wish they wouldn't have pushed so hard on the physics/timing/platforming demands for a game that sells itself on puzzling. In my opinion, they took those aspects overboard and thereby undermined the enjoyment of the puzzling.","April 12, 2015","false","8.4"," 54 of 79 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","54","79","3","0"

Despite this increase of difficulty (reliance of speed, timing, and LOTS of patience are needed), the game is hilarious and  beautiful with a semi-cell-shaded, cartoon feel.

Often I was doing a puzzle over 10 times and failing every time because I didn't quite make the jump or I wasn't quite standing in the right place.  I knew what to do.  I had solved the puzzle part.  But I couldn't pull of the platforming aspect.  If you like platformers and puzzles but really go for the platforming aspect than this really is a good game.

It had a charming art style and relaxing music. As the game was from the designer of Portal, I assumed the it would be just as solid and dependable. Sadly, I was disappointed by inconsistent physics and weird behaviour such as any spring jump's momentum being instantly cancelled by pushing a direction on the stick (WSAD). This totally arbitrary restriction meant that getting a handle of that aspect of the game play was highly frustrating. I see no reason physics or otherwise for it to occur. It made the game incredibly irritating and it never recovered from it. With this knowledge, perhaps you will enjoy the game as I didn't. However, with inconsistent platforming mechanics and frequently irritating level design which unduly punishes platforming slip-ups, I'd have to say, play Portal again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xetrinttc/recommended/200010/","xetrinttc","Heropon Riki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xetrinttc/","110 products in account","Quantum Conundrum is an interesting game. It was developed Kim Swift, who was the lead designer of Portal, and it shows. The game takes the interesting idea of switching between four dimensions to solve puzzles. The first dimension is the Fluffy dimension, which makes heavy objects like safes and couches so light that you can pick them up and throw them. The second dimension is the Heavy dimension, which makes cardboard boxes weigh like a ton of lead. The third dimension is the Slow dimension, which slows down everything but the player. The final dimension is the Reverse Gravity dimension, which reverses the gravity of all interactable objects. Throughout the game, the player switches between these four dimensions to travel from room to room. Some rooms only allow one dimension, while other may allow all four, so it does change it up every so often.\n\nThe story isn't much to look into. The protagonist, a young chap, goes to visit his uncle, Professor Fitz Quadrangle, in his mansion. When he arrives, the Professor gets sent to a pocket dimension because the project he was working on went ary; however, he is able to talk to the player as he travels through the mansion. The mansion, because of the Professor's failed expirament, is on lock-down, and the player needs to travel to three generators and turn them on. The ending is rather unsatisfying, so don't go to this game for the story.\n\nThe graphics looks nice and clean. There's not much detail within the rooms, much like Portal, but it is still pleasing to the eye. The one problem I have with the graphics is the default setting for bloom effects. Whenever in the Fluffy dimension, the bloom can be really bright and hurts the eyes. I had it turned off for the entire game, and there were still times when it was super bright.\n\nThe tracks that play in the background, while not abundant, are pretty good. They don't get stuck in your head, but it's still nice to listen to while racking your brain on a puzzle. The voice acting in this game is wonderful. The Professor is played by John de Lancie, the actor behind Q from Star Trek. His voice fits the role really well. The dialogue, for the most part, is entertaining and chuckle-worthy, though there are times when he gets annoying, mainly when he repeats dialogue after you failed an attempt.\n\nWhile Quantum Conundrum isn't perfect, it does a fine job in delivering an interesting puzzle platformer.

Everything from the fluffy-iness of the fluffy dimension to the roughness of the heavy dimension is rendered beautifully. The Uncle's mansion is such an incredibly unique style. Even the only NPC you ever actually interact with looks like something straight out of a Disney or Pixar film. Gameplay is obviously inspired by Portal, but it takes the concept from that game and changes it into something completely different and incredibly similar at the same time. Three dimensions, light and soft; normal; heavy and hard, govern the elements of the puzzles you'll find in your Uncle's mansion. Along with the intriguing gameplay, are tons of hidden collectables. This makes the game a treasure trove for completionists.\n\nOn the other hand, this Quantum Conundrum is plagued by a badly voiced Uncle and a story that leaves much to be desired. The Uncle drones on while you play through each level. Either giving you hints to certain puzzles or just fumbling around seemingly holding you back by mistakes or errors comitted on his part. The voice acting is sadly bland. To be frank, there was a lack of anything. The Uncle sounded as though a preset voice created by a computer. Perhaps, that was what the game's story was implying, but I can never be to sure because there was almost a complete lack of a story. The underlying goal of the game was for me to finally meet up with my uncle, but other than that there wasn't much of a plot. The ending is equally as frustrating. Nothing is even remote resolved or answered. The ending implied a continuation of the game in a sequel, but after two years I haven't heard of anything.\n\nInstead of implementing a half-baked story with an Uncle and his estranged nephew, I would've much rather have the game just focused on the puzzles. Trying to recreate the Portal experience of having a robot entity taunt you throughout the game just wasn't a good idea and detracted from what was otherwise a wonderful game.\n\nI give this game a 7/10. The puzzles are definitely worth the price tag of $9, just don't expect a story-telling masterpiece.\n\nPros:\nUnique Artstyle\nInteresting Gameplay\nAddicting Collectables\n\nCons:\nPoor Story\nVoice Acting Leaves Much To Be Desired","October 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","2"

The only complant about graphics/how it plays is that instead of using loading screens, Quantum Conundrum uses long hallways, so you get some REALLY bad frame drop inbetween levels, and some hallways are just WAY too long. I would give the graphics and how it plays a 5/5\n\n- Level Disign: The levels are very well created and have a mix between science lab and mansion/victorian feel. Sometimes though it is hard to tell what the objective in a level is, I would have liked like a big red "Exit" sign at the exit door so I could see it. I would rate the level disign a 4/5.\n\n- Music and Audio: All I can say is the music in this game is just astounding, even though this game does not look to be that popular, so much work has gone into the music I HIGHLY recomend buying the Soundtrack while buying the game. Some sound effects are a bit obnoxios, but most sound fine and work well with the feel of the game. I would give the sounds and music a 5/5.\n\n- Controls and Menu: The menu is sometimes confusing but may I just say THERE IS NO EXIT BUTTON ON THE MAIN MENU, you have to go into "Start Game" to exit the game I mean how counter intuative can you get. Also the mouse sensativity settings in the menu had like 3 different levels, not just a slider and I would have liked to see more than 1 audio slider. The controls where great out of the box, everything you would expect, exept jump. Jump was space BUT unlike in some games when you jumped, if you weren't EXACTLY on the ground you woulden't jump and in some situations in the game, that ment life or death. I would give the controls and menu a 2/5.\n\nOverall this game is a great game with a very easy story to follow and challenging levels. I would DEFFENENTLY recommend buying the DLCs because the game is about a 4 hour playthrough so if you are still thursty for some demention switching I would recommend the DLCs.\n\nI would give this game a overall rating of 4/5 and would DEFFENENTALY recommend it.","December 26, 2014","true","6.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The game has a professor character that tries to spice up the puzzles with commentary, but they're just not that interesting a character.\nEstranged-Uncle-Genius-That-Loves-Grandchild-But-Treats-Them-Like-Dirt has surprisingly been done before several times, and this one doen't really stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe puzzles are fine - they fluctuate between boring and interesting, but, honestly, it just feels like there are too many of them (or at least too many that feel the same).\n\nFurther in, the game has an odd paradigm shift where it focuses more on accurate platforming than solving a particular problem. The main gripe I have here is that the jump doesn't allow for much mid-air adjustment. So, once you jump, you  better hope you did it right or you're going to fall.\nAlso, there's a weird physics quirk where, if you're moving through the air and collide with anything you just stop dead and fall straight down - which feels off if I'm in a dimension where everything weighs next to nothing and should just bounce off me.\n\nI don't think the Portal comparison is unfair, either. The reason why Portal just feels better as a physics puzzler even though this game has similar puzzles is that in Portal, if you need to make an adjustment, its instant. Just aim and make a new portal.\nIn this game, the dimensions mechanic is all about the spawned in items the game gives you to solve the puzzles. Meaning, if you mess up, you have to go back to the spawn tube to fetch the items and start over. Respawning the items resets all of them, so even if some are already in a spot you want them, if you drop one down a hole or get a bad bounce into a laser, you have to start all over.\nWhich just makes a tedious game feel like it drags on more than it already does.\n\nOkay game. Get it if you really like physics puzzlers, otherwise skip it.","February 5","false","1.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","0"

The graphics are cool, nice and cartoony, great design, the concept of the gameplay is nice, and the jokes are hilarious.\n\nHowever, as everything in this world, it's not perfect.\n\nThis game requires more skill than brain power. If your here for a good puzzle, hoping it will frizzle (yes, frizzle) your brain, you will be dissapointed. There are too many moments in the game where you stand and think, like "how the hell can I do this", and the your uncle just says "like this". He just points out what you were trying to get, and it makes you feel - stupid. Instead of the legendary "Ah ha!" moment that's all over Portal and was in the core design of Portal, there's your uncle, looking A LOT smarter than you, pointing the whole point (bum ta tzz) out. Sometimes, you just want to scream SHUT UP at him.\n\nI guess I put you off, didn't I? Not to worry, you'll be on in a moment.\n\nHowever, this game is far from a bad game. The graphics are very original, with a smush of cartoon here and there. The props are designed very well. It gives the whole house a friendly, homely feel. You can see that the game was designed for kids however, but I liked it.\n\nThe colour palette is well handled, and the graphics change depending in which dimension you are in. It's fun looking at how the things look like in different dimensions. For example, a cube (which is actually a safe), looks like a safe in the normal dimension, in the heavy dimension it looks like a super heavy duty super heavy metal crate. It would look good on a heavy metal concert. In the light, or fluffy in the game lingo, dimension, the safe looks like a woolen toy say for kids from your grandma. The two other dimensions only add image effects to the game, so I want be talking (*writing) about those, and I don't want to be a spoiler.\n\nThe puzzles, as I said, are not very hard (usually), and require more skill, but the maps are perfectly designed and contain quite fun elements, and you will fly on safes quite a lot.\n\nYour uncle, who is ~not~ pleased to have you there, has quite baddass humor (I'll never forget the "Everyday I'm shovellin'" joke), but he starts liking you more throughout the game. He talks a lot - read: all the time - but thankfully you can put your  headphones off and turn on the captions when you're fed up.\n\nThe music is nice, was humming it for a week after, and I got the soundtrack too (which I don't know what idiot set to Windows only). It's profesionally done, and it's not out of the place, it belongs to the game.\n\n\nSo that's that. If your thinking the game is for kids, just return to those kid days (not for real damnit, only in your mind), and get this game as soon as possible. Worth every penny, although I bought it with €uros which have cents.\n\nAnd when someone calls you a kid for playing this, just say "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?" (I'm sorry, had to put that somewhere)\n\nGo and enjoy every moment of this great puzzle platformer game.\n\n\nI want a fluffy Ike.","August 4, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not even sure why because I was really excited to play it. So I pre-ordered it back then, and when it was finally available I played it for 2 hours and then... stopped.

Switching between them while solving these puzzles can actually be very rewarding. It's a great feeling.

(That's the actor who played Q on ST:TNG, if you're a fan of the show.)  The game suits him well, charming with a unique brand of wit and humour sprinkled throughout each puzzle.  It's a delight to play and, while many of the solutions are somewhat rigid, more than a few allow the player enough freedom to come up with their own answers to each obstacle.\n\nUnfortunately, since Mr. de Lancie's commentary, as the professor, greatly establishes the mood and tempo of the game, I cannot recommend the DLC.  Ike-Aramba! and The Desmond Debacle fall flat due to their monotony and most of the puzzles in them are less puzzles and more sequences of specific timing where the slightest error--in a belligerently linear solution--will have you pulling out your hair as you try and try again.  At least the checkpoints are frequent enough that you never have to start a puzzle from the very beginning.\n\nThe short version:  Buy the game--it's really fun, and spring for the DLC if it's on sale.

And while it does share a few similarities with Portal (1st person puzzle solving, an omnipresent narrator), QC is a distinctly unique experience. Instead of Portals, the tools at your disposal are 4 "dimensions" (fluffy, heavy, slow-mo and reverse-grav), which you can swap between at will. Just like in Portal, each dimension, and the various techniques needed to solve puzzles using them, are introduced gradually. Each of the 3 main levels start out easy, but end up requiring ever-more mind-bending uses of the various dimension shifts to solve. I never found the game to be particularly hard, but you will definitely have to think hard about some of the solutions. All in all, it's very satisfying as a puzzle game.

Unlike Portal though it relies HEAVILY on first person platforming. About halfway through the game it shifts from being ridiculously easy to frustratingly difficult. Not the good kind of difficult either. Several puzzles I knew exactly what the game wanted me to do, but couldn't physically do it. Platform jumping in first person just doesn't work. Also the game gives and takes away the four powers you have constantly so it's hard to remember in the heat of the moment which button does what. It doesn't test your puzzle solving skills as much as your mastery of awkard controls and awful platforming. I really wanted to finish this game but it got to the point where it wasn't fun. I googled the stage I was on to see how many stages were left. Sixteen. Not worth it.

While I was at first drawn in by its Portal-esque humor and gameplay, this game can become quite infuriating It relies heavily on physics puzzles and first-person platforming. The former is difficult to do well, and Quantum Conundrum makes a valiant effort, but certain puzzles are simply broken and rely much on repeated tries before the game deems you worthy to work properly. First-person platforming, however, is impossible to do well. QC is no exception; oftentimes you will know exactly how to finish a puzzle but keep falling off the platform you're on. That's not difficulty - that's just infuriating. All in all, if you like Portal and etc., you may indeed like Quantum Conundrum. And I do like it, but it is a flawed game.","July 30, 2012","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Probably 3rd person perspective would work better.\n\nIf you try to limit the number of dimension shifts, you need smarts and sometimes patience, so it's good, but I sadly don't see myself getting the time constraints achievement.\n\nAlso, seems like if you want real closure, you'll have to buy the upcoming DLCs.

It's visually attractive and John de Lancie's voicework provides a lot of character. The puzzles were also sufficiently challenging; most of them had me scratching my head and wandering around the track for many minutes until I finally figured it out. That final "Aha!" moment is what makes puzzle games interesting to keep playing, and Quantum Conundrum definitely had that.\nWhat I didn't like about this game, however, was that it was trying too much to be like Portal. Kim Swift, the director of Quantum Conundrum, was also part of the development team for Valve's critically acclaimed sci-fi puzzler, and it really shows in Quantum Conundrum's story. However, it falls short of being anything interesting. The story, which is mostly told through your uncle's voice through the mansion' intercom system, is pretty bland and painfully unfunny. The final climax at the end of the game is barely a puzzle, and I remember finishing it and saying out loud, "Was that it?"\nLong story short, it's a tight, visually appealing, clever puzzler with some narrative problems that make it feel like a loosely tied together test track from Aperture Labs.","July 1, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As everyone by now knows, Kim Swift was one of the key contributors to Portal and it's spiritual predecessor, Narbacular Drop. And you can't help wonder if Narbacular Drop would have turned out a little more like Quantum Conundrum if Valve hadn't turned it into Portal.\nBut her time at Valve has certainly rubbed off. You have a first person perspective, the classic Valve learning curve, a silent protagonist, a guiding voice, Team Fortress-style graphics, and no annoying cutscenes whatsoever.\nAlthough it never reaches Valve's high quality-bar, QC is funny, charming, inventive and has just enough variety of puzzles to keep you going. It suffers from being just a little too easy (and I don't think I'm being immodest!), and from a very basic plot which only offers any true feeling of peril in it's closing minutes.\nWhat QC does well is to remind you that fun and originality don't have to be confined to indie titles.

It's unfortunate that Quantum is compared to Portal because it by no means compares favorably.  There are some good elements, for sure, and there's some good humor, but it's mostly just a dull grind.  There are only a few really tricky puzzle elements, and even then they're reused so many times that the meaning is lost.  There are just too many puzzle rooms for the amount of actual puzzle in the game, unfortunately, but even then Quantum was just a short game.\n\nSo it was stretched out and still too short.  Interesting eh?\n\nAnother major issue I had was that the different quantum states were handed out so infrequently.  You just don't get enough time with the later ones, and you use the early ones for far too long.  Bad pacing, that.\n\nHell, a lot of the puzzles don't have you use all four anyway.  Beyond that, a bunch are just straight up locked half the time, or you'll unlock them after having completed a small part of the puzzle.  I just didn't care for the level design.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, you should definitely play this game if only to get a better idea of puzzle and level design.  Play Portal, then play this.  If nothing else, Quantum Conundrum serves as a good teaching device for how not to go about puzzle/level design and pacing.\n\nOh, and percision platforming from first person view sucks ♥♥♥♥.  Those parts of the game sucked, and they're a lot of them.  The physics engine is unreliable at best, so sometimes you just repeat the same thing a bunch of times hoping that, this time, everything acts in the way you need it to in order to finish.  I'm not kidding.\n\nFinal note?  I did quite enjoy the comedy of the game.  Good stuff.

The dialog and humor are on key, very reminiscent of the type of science-based comedy found in the Portal games. Each puzzle is fairly well put together based around the few puzzle aspects.

Aside from the dimensions, puzzles are mostly button pressing and platforming based. A few points are rather buggy or difficult, but otherwise a fun game.

One of the creators of Portal is also behind this game so there are some similarities. But where Portal was ingenious and funny, Quantum Conundrum is not. The main difference as I see it between the games is that in Portal working out the solution to the puzzle can be a bit hard but once you do the execution of said solution is fairly easy. In Quantum Conundrum it is the exact opposite. The solutions are easy to figure out but the executions can be complex and frustrating. Needless to say, I prefer the Portal-way of doing puzzles.\n\nIn Quantum Conundrum you often have to time several jumps on the row which can make it frustrating when you  miss the last jump and have to start over again. On the upside, the checkpoint-system is very generous so you dont have to redo a puzzle from the beginning but you usually continue at exactley the platform-puzzle where you failed.\n\nI found the game easy and it took me about 3 - 4 hours to complete it. The problem is that it seems that they have opted for Quantity instead of Quality when it comes to the puzzle. If you play the game for an extended period of time (over 30 minutes) you get a bit bored by the fact that every puzzle bare some resembles to the one before it which makes it feel that you are essentially solving variations of the same puzzle multiple times. It works to play it in short spurts but over 30 minutes of gametime isn't recommended.\n\nAt this point it costs about €9 and I would recommend it when it drops down to $5 and if you have a real craving for a first person puzzle-game. If you haven't played Portal 1 and 2 I would recommend you to do that instead.\n\nEdit: Also, I didn't find the game funny...at all. The portal games are laugh out loud funny to me but this game fell completely flat. I found the narration to be more annoying than anything else.","February 26, 2014","false","6.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

QC has a rather funny and cartoon-y art style, which definitely fits the overall theme of the game.\n\nOn the downside, the level design is kinda repetitive and the devs seemed to use the copypaste function more than they should.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't seem to offer that much replay value, so unless you're a completionist, you're probably done in about 6-7 hours. For a fun and polished game like QC, that's still a pretty good deal, though. And with the DLCs already being announced, there's enough reason to boot up the game again and try the new puzzles.\n\nSo, if you're into first person puzzling, make sure to check QC out!","July 27, 2012","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Thankfully, the gameplay is fun and the puzzles are a decent challenge, because it lacks in several other areas. Boring visuals, laggy moments between levels, and a lackluster story which didn't make much sense to me, plus the narrator berating me every 2 minutes didn't make me feel very welcome. Couch surfing was definitely the highlight for me.

Don't listen to what the critics say : Listen to the gamers! Quantum Conundrum is at least as good as P1 and P2. It is different; you don't work with portals, but with dimensions. 4 different dimensions to be precise. The game has a playtime of  6 - 8 hours. The puzzles are not THAT hard, but you'll find yourself taking more time to figure them out, than you initially thought you would. I also like the humor very very much. As I said, it's different from Portal but it's funny nonetheless. If you found P1 and/or P2 at least interesting then you HAVE to buy Quantum Conundrum. BEWARE THOUGH : Do NOT pay a cent for the DLC. Both are a waste of time and money! Even if you find youself craving more levels to beat. DO NOT BUY THEM.

So, it is quite entertaining. The timed jumps can be frustrating though, mainly due to the first person view. Sometimes, it's difficult to see how far you can go in order to jump - especially under the pressure of time - and you end up wondering if you're doing what is necessary to solve the puzzle or just failing at jumping properly. So it leads to a lot of trial and error where you keep dying. But overall, that's a good game, with interesting puzzles/concepts. This game has a lot of potential; if it had the Steam Workshop feature enabled where players could submit their puzzles, it would become exponentially richer and famous.

The ones that anyone can actually enjoy, at any age, with or without kids of their own. And then there's "kid's movies", the ones that only young kids can really sit through and enjoy. Sadly, this is the kind of game that falls into that later category. The humor is obvious, boring, and at times it feels ripped straight from the internet. It's aesthetic is the kind that you can tell is trying really hard to be cute, but I certainly don't think it really succeeded. Cartoony, sure, but hardly cute. The puzzles are eazy to figure out, but often frustating and stressful to actually carry out.\n\nThis is all really sad, because the mechanics themselves are ridiculously good. With some slight tweaking, a bit more testing, and some slight redesigning, and maybe someone taking a new approach to the script, this could have been a really fun, compelling game. But you're just much better off looking for some other puzzle game, one that won't frustrate you with annoying acrobatics, some wonky game design, and the occasional cringe inducing one liner (there's only one character, ALL the dialogue is one liners).\n\nMaybe, just maybe, if it's on a really good sale, pick it up. Kid's will love it, I'm sure. If it's just for you, though, I can't say I'd recommend spending more than $3 on this. Some good ideas, not the best execution, nothing too memorable about it. 5/10","July 20, 2014","false","7.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

You get to experiment with physics in different dimensions and try to reach the exits. But when you replay it to try and beat the challenges [speed runs, finding collectibles, using fewest shifts], you realise that the physics engine isn't really very good. Frequently the "dollis" will spit out cubes in such an inconsistent way that it becomes very hard to speedrun. You'll find that cubes landing on bots sometimes randomly move about, which can screw up a run. It's less of a physics engine and more a sort of functionally-scripted environment.

The rooms are challenging, ok, but there is nothing like the intellectual room design you find in portal. same goes for the 'crazy professor' voice. He is always speaking and trying to make you smile, but it is more like a 'meh?' smile, not even close to the perfection of GLADOS humour (note: Kim Swift is behind the idea). Well, not bad for 5 euros, but definitely not 15 euros. Got fed up with it very soon.

Not only do you NOT get to see the professor (outside of pictures throughout the house that is), when you get to the end - and start to free him, the game abruptly ENDS! Thats right - the game stops, a cartoon cut scene explaining that you and him ended up swaping places. Then the credits roll. FAIL\n\nOK, that said. this game is FKN AMAZING! First off, do not play it right after you finish the PORTAL series. You'll be greatly disappointed, as you will spend a lot of your time comparing the two.  PORTAL is more of LOGIC based puzzles and QC is more PHYSICS based.\n\nYou have four dimension, you are introduced to one at a time, and are in control of throughout the game. Each one is used to help solve each room you traverse through, as yo make your way down to save your uncle (who, at the beginning got stuck in a different dimension)\n\nFLUFFY: makes things light, allowing you to pick up just about any item not nailed down\n\nSLOW: More like slo-motion on crack! Its REALLY slow. helps slow things down\n\nHEAVY: makes things extreamly heavy - mostly used to solve puzzles that need excessive weight - like switches(these require weirght that the safes cannot produce)\n\nREVERSE GRAVITY: reverses gravity - here you really learn about physics..\n\nMusic is very nice. and does a good job as background music, as it does not distract your attention. John De Lance was amazing as the voice of the profesor which his cutting sarcasm that makes think throughout the game - what is his real motive.\n\nOne nice thing I thought was great, is the Proessor would alway give crptic clues on how to solve the room. But the first play through I did (of many) I just took them at face value and mindless patter. silly me\n\nLike PORTAL, every where you go makes sense, and the "puzzle" feel is NOT there, so you more or less feel like you are traveling to get your uncle, and these rooms are just in your way.\n\n\n\nEven with the horrid ending, I would still highly recommend this game just for the sheer puzzles alone.","May 4, 2014","true","55.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept is quite original and does require heavy thinking, especially when the game throws you a puzzle that requires all 4 dimensions to complete the puzzle.\n\nJohn de Lancie is great in this game too, he voices your uncle who is a scientist who makes wonderful gadgets and gismos, especially the glove you wear all the way through your journey. (not really a spoiler since it's told in the trailers and start of the game)\n\nThe music isn't half bad either! Worth picking up in my opinion.\n\nHowever, nothing is perfect... let's get to the downsides, and this is a spoiler on the ending... in a spoiler free way though, I'll just say the ending sucks.\nAll you get is a 30 second clip telling you that your character has been sent to a pocket dimension that your uncle was trapped in this entire time, while your uncle then gets out and tries to fix a problem that he helped you cause because he lost his memory and this problem is going to effect the entire planet. Then it rolls the credits.\n\nYou may think that sounds awesome but it's explained in 30 seconds, and if you think that's enough for an awesome cutscene explaining that, you're wrong since the cutscenes in this game are set up exactly like the main menus, so you just see a drawing of the house fall into the ocean in an innocent cartoon-y fashion and then it shows the whole planet change colour repeatedly. That's it. No awesome looking climax like in Portal and Half-Life 2.\n\nIt's a real shame this game had no better cutscene since the game was building the ending to be a nice sparkly bow to a great game, but it didn't which is a real shame since the game is worth it at full price but the ending made me feel like I wasted my time and that everything I did in the game was really for nothing. If the game was designed to be a series of tests that didn't have a narrative or story, then I wouldn't mind it but because it was building up this story, the ending felt very lazy and tacked on to make you interested into buying a sequel that we may never get (and unlikely will get).\n\nTo wrap it up: The game is worth the full price, but the ending didn't make the game feel worth the journey (even though it is worth playing) and doesn't make me feel interested in buying the DLC. Oh, and the collectible items are really well hidden.","May 17, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The concept is there. But...\n\nSweet f*cking Jesus, this game is fun at first, but then it shows it's true nature: desperately trying to make the janky physics work over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over and over and over and over again! Especially with the power cores: if you want your game to have mechanics based on physics, which require you to get the core from point A to point B by manipulating said physics, why in the F*CK is the godd*mn core shaped like a 12-sided dice?! Especially when the corners keep scraping single pixels and making you start over again!\n\nAnd the DLC's are even worse! In Desmond's Debacle, the developers thought it was a good idea to add invisible walls for the cores to keep go in the right direction. The problem is that the because of those walls, the cores keep randomly switching direction and COMPLETELY messing up everything you do!\n\nAnd the more you play the game, the more you see the unpolished mechanics. Exactly why do I lose ALL of my momentum when I step off from any object you can ride (as in stand on)? Example: you're riding a safe to get to a platform on a wall above a pit. The safe is flying at the speed of around 30km/h. As the platform is coming up, you jump off the safe to land on the platform. Too f*cking bad, you have now lost all of the momentum, as if you were just spawned there and you'll fall in to the pit to your death. Why? Because f*ck actual physics and f*ck you!\n\nI'm sorry, but this game is much, MUCH more frustrating than it is fun.

Seriously?\n- The end credits song was unbearable. Just terrible.\n\nThat being said; I loved the clever book titles and neat paintings.

Figuring out the puzzles is easy.  Pulling off the complex timing and repetitive reflex manuvers needed to solve them is maddening.  Being forced to restart from the beginning of a puzzle because of one mistake is the work of the devil.\n\nThe art assests and level design are the very definition off cookie-cutter layouts, and the music is as bland as it is forgettable.  John De Lancie phones this one in, but he can't take all the blame as the writing is as witless and dry as he portrays it to be.\n\nI've actualy encountered game halting bugs while playing, where the game fails to keep track of objects being destroyed through the various dimensional shifts causing me to have to reload certain sections of the game in order to retry them.\n\nI can't even recommend this game for kids as death is a constant factor in the game, which is handled poorly with one-liner throw-aways telling you of how bland and stale life is.  Add to the fact that some zones that appear to be safe are infact instant death only makes this situation worse.  In one area you can walk on metal plating and in another area it will kill you without rhyme nor reason.\n\nIf there was one word to describe this game, it would be "Bland."  What made this game so annoying was that I was actually trying to enjoy it, but at almost every turn the crappy gameplay would just get in the way and punish me with death for a mis-step or force me to start an entire room over for a single mis-click.\n\nI will attest to being a masocist for challenging games, but there was no hint of a reward that would make me want to pursue playing this game further.  I can easily forgive bad gameplay if there was good writing, music or art to back it up  But this game has none of those things going for it.\n\nOne afterword:  This game was designed for consoles in mind and it shows.  If that bothers you, well that's even more of a reason NOT to play it.","March 1, 2013","false","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Some experiment has of course gone wrong, and with help from your uncle you run around the house trying to set things right.\n\nEach new set of rooms is a puzzle that you need to go through. To help you solve the puzzle you have an “IDS-device”, a glove that you can use to shift dimensions. For example, the first dimension you will be able to shift to is the fluffy dimension, where everything becomes super-light. Safes becomes nothing more than big pillows that you can juggle with ease.\n\nWith time you get more dimensions to switch between and the puzzles becomes more difficult. It’s childishly fun to play around with the different dimensions and the game is filled with jokes and funhouse esthetics.\n\nIf you have played Portal you will feel at home in Quantum Conundrum. You go through a room, you have a number of obstacles, you carry a device that will help you. However, I find that Portal is more about figuring out the solution while QC is more of getting the timing and jumps just right. The puzzles are less complex and the solutions are not as clean as in Portal.\n\nWithout comparing it to Portal however, QC is a good puzzle game. It’s simple and fun entertainment for basically all ages. The dialogue makes you smile and the rooms look cool. Changing dimensions makes the room change appereance as well, and sometimes I find myself just looking at paintings while changing dimensions to giggle at the differences it does.\n\nThere are some downsides to QC. One thing that keeps irritating me is the physics engine. Many of the puzzles depend on you jumping or throwing objects. This can quickly become frustrating as objects don’t always fall in the same way. For example; in one of the puzzles you let three safes fall in order to jump on to them later. The safes fall and tumble differently each time which meant I had to redo the same procedure several times until I the safes fell as I expected them to.\n\nI can also imagine that some of the jumping/timing sequences can be quite difficult for gamers that are young or not that experienced.\n\nAnother downside is that Quantum Conundrum has a tendency to hold your hand a bit too much. In more than one level I hadn’t more than stepped into the room before my uncle started pointing me in the right direction, saying what I should do. I like to puzzle out my own solutions and having someone just giving me the answer takes away from the fun.\n\nStill, if you haven’t tried Quantum Conundrum it’s really worth a playthrough!\n\n8/10 awkward noise generators","December 30, 2014","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I want to like it more than I do, it's full of charm, but the puzzles just aren't that interesting as I'd like. There is less variety than I would like, and as other reviewers have stated, instead of having all the powers at your fingertips all of the time, the game gives you only what you need.\n\nWhile this can be good to make it easier, it also causes it to be a bit of hand holding, not letting people try to solve the puzzles with everything at their disposal. It's also takes more skill than actual puzzle solving ability. Sometimes I'm just freakin' lost because I have to time things just right to work, and it's harder than it looks.\n\nThe narrator, John de Lancie (Plays Q in Star Trek: The Next Generation) does a great job with a lot of humorous commentary.\n\nI do recommend this game.

Worth the 5$ I spent? Absolutely. Worth more? Maybe. You decide.\n\nThe one issue it really faced was the lack of puzzle variety. Launch this here. Jump there. But now do it with lighter objects! And then with objects that fall up! If there were more dimensions that really felt different, interacted more often, and allowed more freedom of puzzling, the game would have hit me much harder.\n\nOther issues being that there's little room to just futz with the dimensions, and that there aren't really enough of them. Sure they could've limited you to 4 at a time still, but they could've put in more than 4. As is, heavy and light honestly felt like two sides to the same coin, so it was really just 3 dimensions.\n\nOn top of that, if the dimensions weren't prescribed to levels, or if the developers didn't try to shoot down any varying solutions to the problems (either by making dimensions unavailable or by silly placements of walls) then the game would have felt more like a puzzle game instead of an execution game. I don't mean a game kills you, but you usually instantly know what you need to do with what you have, and you just have to do it to beat the level. It was like how Portal 2 felt after playing Portal 1. The game was enjoyable, but the exploration was gone. All the white walls were replaced by shiny paneled walls with a white panels obviously sticking out in one area.\n\nAnd to add to the Portal analogy, the story didn't carry me through as strongly as the Portal 2 story did. And the game's aesthetic wasn't as pretty either. Not to bash on a small company, but the same idea has been done better by other people for cheaper cost to the consumer.\n\nThe Uncle was a fun character, but the puns can get sigh worthy, the "surprise" in the story is foreseen by the end of the first chapter, and basically the game's feel relied more on quick chuckles than anything else.\n\nI think to sum it up, this game felt like it was made for 8 year olds. Fantastic for them, but sadly not advertised to them. Worth a look if you want a casual puzzle experience and find it on sale, but don't expect too much out of it.","May 31, 2013","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love physics based sandbox stuff, and the wacky presentation also appealed to me. However, a physics based game needs to have good physics to begin with, which Quantum Conundrum certainly doesn't - player occassionally gets stuck on flat surfaces, objects behave weirdly, etc. Then, you need tight controls if the puzzles are not only cerebral but require some skill - failed again.\nI liked the basic idea with the four special dimensions, the visuals are nice, and the narration is mostly funny. However, even if the puzzle design was perfect, the issues with the controls and the physics would make the game very difficult (or impossible) to enjoy. And, unfortunately, 30-40% of the puzzles are just repetitive drivel - while the rest contain a few touches of genius. After three hours of playing, I can't recommend this game - I may go forward with it for a while, but I wouldn't buy it again.

The dimensions come from a glove you wear in the game, and are activated on-cue through keyboard bindings. The four dimensions are:\n\n1. "Fluffy" - Makes it so you can lift and throw what would normally be too heavy to handle items.\n2. "Heavy" - Makes items that would be considered "light" to instead have their mass increased (weigh more in non-scientific terms)\n3. "Slow" - Basically slow-mo.\n4. "Reverse Gravity" - As it says, items float to the ceiling when activated.\n\nThe main story revolves around you, portrayed as a young nephew, trying to find his Uncle who is in an unknown location and needs help rescuing. How is it in comparison to a game like Portal?\n\nQuantum is missing the "charm" that Portal (specifically 2) has. The characters are not as unique or likeable. For example, isntead of Wheatley and GLaDOs, you get a furry animal named Ike and your "crazy scientist" uncle. There are no companion cubes, instead they are replaced with cartoon-like safes. The setting is bland; a mansion. And while you go through the puzzles, your uncle keeps chiming in with one-liners you would hear from a high school math teacher.\n\nDon't get me wrong. It may sound like I hate Quantum-quite the opposite. It is a very solid game with good mechanics and physics-based puzzles. However, the magic of the game just is not there. Many of the puzzles rely on timing and reflexes rather than thought and careful design. The story is not a life-or-death scenario, but more of a child-friendly adventure.\n\nThis is a game that I would solidly recommend you pick up on sale, particularly in the 50-75% off range.

I'll be more specific.  This is a game where you actively figure out the puzzle scenario placed in front of you using the tools you have.  Your left hand will be busy (combining and alternating dimensions) compared to Portal's right-hand activity (of making portals).  Timing is important, but split-second timing is not; planning is much more significant.  The sense of humor tends to mad-science whimsy; John De Lancie brings his Star-Trek "Q" personality to the player's uncle narrator.  The game's plenty challenging in its short length (I spent about 6 hours with multiple quick retries in several sections).

On the other hand, don't be fooled, this ain't a puzzle game. Only the minority of the situations requires you to stop and think about what to do. You'll probably quickly figure out what to do and spend more time actually trying to do it. The dimensions, while employed in interesting ways, could be more varied than "Allow you to pick this object" or "Triggers that pressure plate". The Slow-Motion dimension, though, has some very peculiar uses. It's a game that will test your timing and your plataforming more than it will test your wits. Plus, while the characters(or character, seeing as the Professor is the only character who expresses himself in any significant way) are fun, the ending left a bitter taste on my mouth.

Honestly, there's a lot more into play than in Portal 1 and almost as much as Portal 2, and if you liked those two games, there's a lot of content to entertain you for a while in this game.\n\nHowever, I believe this game has a major flaw: its ending. No spoilers will be given here, but honestly, there is a great, inmensely great build-up while progressing through the final stages of the game. I was genuinely curious as to what was going to happen in the very last puzzle, and started imagining what it could be; but... Nothing. A rather abrupt ending, virtually no final puzzle, and... in retrospect, the puzzles right before the ending weren't even that much of a challenge either. I would have expected their difficulty/completxity to be something much greater, but... meh. I was really disappointed.

Naturally you can only use one at a time but require multiple in order to solve the puzzles before you. Transporting large objects, for example, requires that you make it light (fluffy), throw it, slow down time, run round obstacles, switch back to fluffy and catch it again. The ways the game has you using these different dimensions in unison may not be initially intuitive, but they certainly arent illogical.\n\nIts got that same wonder and feel to it that the original Portal did. I dont think the gameplay elements are strictly original, but the way it handles and presents them (much like its pseudo-ancestor) provides much satisfaction that it makes a rather hard thing to dislike. It perhaps skirts a little heavy on Portals tailcoat, but it'd be a wholly different thing if it didnt.\n\nYou won't feel bad for playing it, but you may feel a little guilty for giggling at the portraits in the games when viewed from different dimensions.","August 7, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously, this was just terrible writing. Only slightly better than complete silence.\n3. You're required to do some platforming at some parts.

The main mechanic is that you can switch to 4 special "dimensions" to alter the physics, e.g. you can make all objects lighter so you can pick them up. In many levels you have to put a heavy object on a button to open a door. There is also a lot of timing and precise platforming, especially later on.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are clever, but not super difficult. After figuring out what's going on in a level, you still need to make a plan and execute that plan, which is what takes the most time.\nThe narration of the crazy professor (which seems to be aimed at 8 year olds), humanoid robots that make weird faces and the professor's pet give the game a very unserious feel.\nThere is not much of a story.\nThe collectibles are nice.\nYou can replay individual levels and try to finish in a given time, without using the checkpoints and within a limited number of dimension shifts. These goals are pretty difficult and require a lot of attempts.\n12 levels are sold separarely as two DLCs.\nOverall, it's an enjoyable game if you like physics/platforming/timing and don't mind the childishness.","July 19, 2015","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay consists of picking up and moving or throwing objects along with changing physics through 4 different dimensions. Along the way are various contraptions that are used in combination with each dimension and platforming elements. Most levels have simple puzzles and platforming, but there are some tricky ones to give a challenge now and then. The story is simple, but features Professor Quadwrangle, a strange and funny scientist voiced by John de Lancie, and his nephew. He provides humor and hints in the game along with some ancedotes and storytelling. The game is cartoony, with big open spaces and giant sized objects perfect for platforming. This fits the style of gameplay right and explains the strangeness of some inventions easily. The music compliments the eccentricity of the manor's set of rooms.

Unfortunately, that is an extremely narrow point of view and completely negates many of the inventive pieces that are brought into a game like Quantum Conundrum. While its fairly obvious that QC is influenced by Portal (should that really be any surprise considering the individuals behind both games), you are forced into solving puzzles and performing FPS platforming in a way that was never introduced into the Portal series. This creates a unique game experience which has you thinking the whole way through. Admittedly, puzzles aren't as challenging as one might expect, but there is enough quality levels in the base game to keep you occupied for several hours. At a budget price, it's a pretty easy sell and with the prospect of new levels and support coming down the pipe, this looks to be a fun series to help support.","July 12, 2012","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain.\n\nSome of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment.\n\nThe story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face.\n\nGood stuff.","January 21, 2013","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dimensions come from a glove you wear in the game, and are activated on-cue through keyboard bindings. The four dimensions are:\n\n1. "Fluffy" - Makes it so you can lift and throw what would normally be too heavy to handle items.\n2. "Heavy" - Makes items that would be considered "light" to instead have their mass increased (weigh more in non-scientific terms)\n3. "Slow" - Basically slow-mo.\n4. "Reverse Gravity" - As it says, items float to the ceiling when activated.\n\nThe main story revolves around you, portrayed as a young nephew, trying to find his Uncle who is in an unknown location and needs help rescuing. How is it in comparison to a game like Portal?\n\nQuantum is missing the "charm" that Portal (specifically 2) has. The characters are not as unique or likeable. For example, isntead of Wheatley and GLaDOs, you get a furry animal named Ike and your "crazy scientist" uncle. There are no companion cubes, instead they are replaced with cartoon-like safes. The setting is bland; a mansion. And while you go through the puzzles, your uncle keeps chiming in with one-liners you would hear from a high school math teacher.\n\nDon't get me wrong. It may sound like I hate Quantum-quite the opposite. It is a very solid game with good mechanics and physics-based puzzles. However, the magic of the game just is not there. Many of the puzzles rely on timing and reflexes rather than thought and careful design. The story is not a life-or-death scenario, but more of a child-friendly adventure.\n\nThis is a game that I would solidly recommend you pick up on sale, particularly in the 50-75% off range. If you enjoyed Portal 1+2, you will enjoy this, just not nearly as much.","July 1, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay consists of picking up and moving or throwing objects along with changing physics through 4 different dimensions. Along the way are various contraptions that are used in combination with each dimension and platforming elements. Most levels have simple puzzles and platforming, but there are some tricky ones to give a challenge now and then. The story is simple, but features Professor Quadwrangle, a strange and funny scientist voiced by John de Lancie, and his nephew. He provides humor and hints in the game along with some ancedotes and storytelling. The game is cartoony, with big open spaces and giant sized objects perfect for platforming. This fits the style of gameplay right and explains the strangeness of some inventions easily. The music compliments the eccentricity of the manor's set of rooms. For its quirkyness and humor, Quantum Conundrum is a fun and funny first person puzzle game.","July 16, 2012","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","8"

Instead of saying "Oh THAT was cool!" you're more likely to say "Well thank christ that's over".

For example: you can make objects lighter to transport them/throw them, make them heavier to break through glass or indestructible.\n\nI recommend it simply for the puzzles and the satisfaction it gives to complete a section when you've discovered an entirely new mechanic a dimension proposes, just by yourself. Honestly, there's a lot more into play than in Portal 1 and almost as much as Portal 2, and if you liked those two games, there's a lot of content to entertain you for a while in this game.\n\nHowever, I believe this game has a major flaw: its ending. No spoilers will be given here, but honestly, there is a great, inmensely great build-up while progressing through the final stages of the game. I was genuinely curious as to what was going to happen in the very last puzzle, and started imagining what it could be; but... Nothing. A rather abrupt ending, virtually no final puzzle, and... in retrospect, the puzzles right before the ending weren't even that much of a challenge either. I would have expected their difficulty/completxity to be something much greater, but... meh. I was really disappointed. And I mean, really, disappointed.\n\nNonetheless, it's still a good game, and I really recommend it for those who want to enjoy the challenge and the gimmicks that this game can offer.","June 25, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is this a bad thing?  Hellz no!  The alternate dimensions and some of the puzzle qualities that you can do with them (IE have all four dimensions available, but can only hold two at a time) make you have to do some serious thinking and planning to work out well.  This is much better than Portal, because your hand isn't held nearly as much through the game - if you are taking too long to complete it though, you will get audio with a subtle hint, which is nice.\n\nMuch like QUBE though, there are some wonky physics in it.  One puzzles was especially frustrating because of it, but nothing in this game is a dealbreaker.

Naturally you can only use one at a time but require multiple in order to solve the puzzles before you. Transporting large objects, for example, requires that you make it light (fluffy), throw it, slow down time, run round obstacles, switch back to fluffy and catch it again. The ways the game has you using these different dimensions in unison may not be initially intuitive, but they certainly arent illogical.\n\nIts got that same wonder and feel to it that the original Portal did. I dont think the gameplay elements are strictly original, but the way it handles and presents them (much like its pseudo-ancestor) provides much satisfaction that it makes a rather hard thing to dislike. It perhaps skirts a little heavy on Portals tailcoat, but it'd be a wholly different thing if it didnt.\n\nYou won't feel bad for playing it, but you may feel a little guilty for giggling at the portraits in the games when viewed from different dimensions.","August 7, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't a bad thing for a typical puzzle game but feels odd for a game which feels like it will grip you like Portal did, and never does.\n\nThe game is often compared to Portal, a better game, to Conundrum's detriment, but it has earned the comparison. It attempts a snarky, dark humored irreverent and unkind narrator.  It has both seemingly deliberate "puzzle rooms" and behind the scenes type puzzle sections, very similar to what Portal offered. The lead designer was one of the original Portal creators and I'm assuming she figured the formula was flawless. Well... It's not flawless but it is pretty darn good.

And you must repeat, repeat, repeat.\nPlus poor level environment: just sofas, tables and cabinets with books in ALL levels.\nIf you can deal with above, you can get  fun, because this still decent game and anyway it worth a try.\nAlso recommend "Flip a Switch" song from QC Soundtrack.","March 27, 2013","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The reasons I bought and finished this game are all repeated ad-infinitum, and never expanded.   the "lens flare" effect in some of the dimensions is awful, sometimes leading me to not be able to see a thing, and I have my contrast set pretty low.  The ending is thoroughly disappointing.\n\nthe biggest complaint though is that this game tries so hard to be Portal, rather than just being itself.  the last 10% of the game especially.  nearly every single moment took me back to "yea but Portal did this better"  and a game shouldn't be like that, it shouldn't constantly remind me of something else that I played, it just feels like a cheap rip-off, and makes me think the writers/developers lack any creativity, which they clearly didn't for the first 25% of the game!  it felt like "well that was a fun conclusion to that game, lets do it too!" rather than "this is who our villain is, this is who our mentor is, and this is who our player character is, what would they do, and how would they interact in our story"\n\nIn conclusion; the game had its own [good] things going, but someone decided that Portal was a huge hit, so lets just borrow the end of that game and call it our own, who cares about the awesome characters we developed, who cares if it makes the narorator/mentor sound bi-polar, who cares... they liked portal!","May 23, 2015","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your left hand will be busy (combining and alternating dimensions) compared to Portal's right-hand activity (of making portals).  Timing is important, but split-second timing is not; planning is much more significant.

I love physics based sandbox stuff, and the wacky presentation also appealed to me. However, a physics based game needs to have good physics to begin with, which Quantum Conundrum certainly doesn't - player occassionally gets stuck on flat surfaces, objects behave weirdly, etc. Then, you need tight controls if the puzzles are not only cerebral but require some skill - failed again.\nI liked the basic idea with the four special dimensions, the visuals are nice, and the narration is mostly funny. However, even if the puzzle design was perfect, the issues with the controls and the physics would make the game very difficult (or impossible) to enjoy. And, unfortunately, 30-40% of the puzzles are just repetitive drivel - while the rest contain a few touches of genius. After three hours of playing, I can't recommend this game - I may go forward with it for a while, but I wouldn't buy it again.

If you liked Portal, then you will definitely like this game!  The graphics are also well done and gives the whole game a fun, "cartoony" atmosphere.\n\nCons:  The talking will drive you insane.  The writers clearly wanted to create the same witty, "punny" sort of one-liners as in Portal, but its not funny at all, and the only voice actor in the game completely messes up the delivery.  Moreover, this game will BABY you through every level.  "Look up there!"  "You're gonna want a battery here!"  "Maybe you should like heights, hint, hint" and yes they literally say "hint, hint."  This gives you almost no sense of accomplishment after completing a level, and it made me feel like the developers thought I, as the player, had the intellect of a 1st grader.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shivren/recommended/200010/","shivren","Catsuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shivren/","270 products in account","Quantum Conundrum - a game that sit somewhere in shadows of its more popular puzzle game brother - Portal. And while both of those video games are 3D puzzle games with platforming elements, the similarity really ends here. The concepts of the two franchises are different and I wish people would stop comparing them or claming that Portal will always be a better game without even playing Quantum Conundrum. If you're a fan of the genre, you will enjoy Quantum Conundrum even though it might be a bit too easy after playing other, similar titles.\n\nBut, enough of that. It might be already clear, but I did enjoy Quantum Conundrum A LOT. And I probably enjoyed it a lot more than Portal 2. Yes, the story is pretty much a filler, it doesn't go anywhere and the ending is a set up for the sequel (which hopefully will happen although I doubt it...). Yes, the puzzles are mostly pretty easy and after getting tricky they still can be solved in under 30 minutes, But I still enjoyed my time with Quantum Conundrum...\n\nIts concept is interesting. The game gives the player the control over the enviroment instead of one particular thing (as with Portal and QUBE). It plays with physics letting you make elements weight more or less, slow the flow of time or even the entire gravity of the room. And it does so in unexpected ways such as makes you throw boxes so you can basically fly through the level using the gravity or lets you bounce on the platforms using a couch that you can make heavier and then lighter to fling yourself upwards. Those little mechanics that make the player say 'yeah, that clever' and then use those mechanics and mix them up in another level of the game. A concept of dimensions gives a bunch of possibilities for those mechanics and (again, hoping for it) there are a lot of paths that a sequel might take.\n\nThe puzzles are never too hard. Something I dislike about puzzle games is the difficulty curve that gets really high after a while without letting the player understand what he should be doing. Quantum Conundrum teaches the player its mechanics and does a good job at it also bringing back things introduced in previous chapters in the later ones. The player never gets stuck for good or frustrated that he can't figure out a solution. The levels go by pretty fast and it gives the player the feeling of progress which, of course, pushes him forward through the game. I never felt like the game is too easy. It gave me a good challenge showing me what I can do and then mixing it up and making me do it. I never felt mad at the game for having some riddiculus solution for a puzzle. It wasn't complicated. It was always a simple concept.\n\nAs for the story, well... I didn't really care too much for it and I don't think it is a bad thing either. The story was just there as a filler, the narration was okay and I see people really liking the professor. It just wasn't my thing, but it also didn't overshadow the gameplay. Everything is presented in a really lighthearted way, the graphics are bright and colorful and the overall game has a lot of character.\n\nSo what about the negatives? There are negatives. As I've mentioned previously - the story is just a filler, it doesn't go anywhere and since the checkpoints bring you back to a set spot, you often have to listen to the same voice clip over and over again. The puzzles are simple, but not too simple and Portal veterans might breeze through the game. There are also corridors between levels that act as hidden loading screens and a "story time" kind of deal. Those get repeated pretty fast and they're mildly annoying. The fact that they are in fact just a window of time for the game to load the next map, also might result in a bit of a frame drop from time to time. Also, I should probably mention that Quantum Conundrum loves platforming a lot more than other 3D puzzle games. Something you should probably have in mind.\n\nOverall, I had a fantastic time with the game. It wasn't anything amazing, but it has a lot of potential and character to it and I wish we see a sequel one of these days.","October 3, 2013","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reasons I bought and finished this game are all repeated ad-infinitum, and never expanded.   the "lens flare" effect in some of the dimensions is awful, sometimes leading me to not be able to see a thing, and I have my contrast set pretty low.  The ending is thoroughly disappointing.\n\nthe biggest complaint though is that this game tries so hard to be Portal, rather than just being itself.  the last 10% of the game especially.  nearly every single moment took me back to "yea but Portal did this better"  and a game shouldn't be like that, it shouldn't constantly remind me of something else that I played, it just feels like a cheap rip-off, and makes me think the writers/developers lack any creativity, which they clearly didn't for the first 25% of the game!  it felt like "well that was a fun conclusion to that game, lets do it too!" rather than "this is who our villain is, this is who our mentor is, and this is who our player character is, what would they do, and how would they interact in our story"\n\nIn conclusion; the game had its own [good] things going, but someone decided that Portal was a huge hit, so lets just borrow the end of that game and call it our own, who cares about the awesome characters we developed, who cares if it makes the narorator/mentor sound bi-polar, who cares... they liked portal!","May 23, 2015","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, that is an extremely narrow point of view and completely negates many of the inventive pieces that are brought into a game like Quantum Conundrum. While its fairly obvious that QC is influenced by Portal (should that really be any surprise considering the individuals behind both games), you are forced into solving puzzles and performing FPS platforming in a way that was never introduced into the Portal series. This creates a unique game experience which has you thinking the whole way through. Admittedly, puzzles aren't as challenging as one might expect, but there is enough quality levels in the base game to keep you occupied for several hours. At a budget price, it's a pretty easy sell and with the prospect of new levels and support coming down the pipe, this looks to be a fun series to help support.","July 12, 2012","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since people are bound to compare to the portal games I'll lay some stuff out.\n\n1. The main mechanic is shifting between 4 different dimensions to solve puzzles. This was almost as fun as thinking with portals.\n2. In the game, your uncle talks while you solve puzzles. Big drawback: he's not very entertaining. At all. Seriously, this was just terrible writing. Only slightly better than complete silence.\n3. You're required to do some platforming at some parts. I've read about some people getting aneurysms over this, and while I never had too much trouble making jumps, I can see why people would gripe.\n\nOther things:\n+ I really did like the cartoony art style.\n+ The barfing cloning devices and cat that follows you around were always welcome sights.\n\n- Level design was just lazy. When going between rooms, you'll pass clones of the same corridors over and over.\n- In the last third of the game, there were maybe 2 or 3 areas that I'm sure plenty of people will get annoyed over. Not because they're hard to figure out, but tough to execute.\n\nThis game will exercise your brain with puzzles that are not too challenging but definitely fun. It's not the perfection that Portal 2 is, but it'll help scratch that puzzle itch.\n8.5/10","June 22, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sound familiar? Well it should if you've played Portal, the heavy inspiration is very clear. But Quantum Conundrum is more lighthearted and has a much larger focus on platforming. The graphics aren't the greatest, but are decent enough. The story is pretty weak to be honest, but the narrator is good for a chuckle here and there.

I'm surprised at least the idea has not turned into another game. A little glimpse into what f-stop was in portal 2 (maybe). All around a good game. The only thing it is missing is a little bit of a storyline. I mean, I get that I am an 8 year old, who was visiting his grandfather... or something like that, but I think that if it had some engaging plots, it would feel a lot less repetitive (and i guess it also felt a little like you had to grind certain levels, similar to RPG games).

It ends abruptly when it looks like some action is about to happen and proceeds with a lame "haha you're dead... just kidding" joke that feels anticlimactic as all hell. Not to mention the fact that it doesn't explain anything about what happens next. Not even a proper cutscene with Professor Fitz and the kid. If you hadn't written an ending at all, it would have looked just the same.\n\nOverall, the game was fun and enjoyable, although it starts getting a bit repetitive after a while. Ike is a very silent but charming character and the dialogues were amusing enough. The whole dimension switching concept was promising, yet the execution not so much. Also, the second part of the game feels less like a puzzle game and more like a platformer game, which is ridiculous. I could easily forgive these mistakes, but it's just... The ending just tore apart all the good vibes the game had been giving me throughout the entire thing. I simply cannot shake the feeling of dissatisfaction.\n\nI hardly ever write reviews, and it's quite upsetting that I'm doing it for a Kim Swift game. It's a shame that I feel compelled to say I cannot recommend this game.","May 25, 2015","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a kid going to his uncle's (who is a slightly narcisist scientist) when something happens causing a lock-down on the house. Your uncle has a mild loss of short term memory, and can't figure out where he is so he asks you to go restore power to remove the lock-down. In the process you get access to the IDS device that he was working on that allows you to shift between dimensions (More on that soon).\n\nThe story isn't complicated, but it gets the job done and gets you going where you need to be. The dialogue along the way is cheesy, but in a good way (Though if you are not a fan of cheesy humor, I would suggest muting the voices).\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite interesting. You gradually unlock 4 (well, 5 if you count the base dimension) dimensions that allow you to modify physics. These are Fluffy (Or, light weight), Heavy (Heavy weight), Slow down (Everything moves at a near crawl, even lasers), and Reverse Gravity. You, personally never are altered (The idea is despite the fact you are going through the rifts, you personally remain physical to your dimension). Now, these mechanics lead to some interesting relationships between objects: A steel Safe becomes able to be carried while in fluffy, You can toss a table in fluffy then quickly change to Slow and hop onto the platform (That normally would be going fast) as a platform across a gap. A cardboard box can be used as a heavy weight using Heavy. Or with Reverse you can have something utilize the bottom of a conveyor belt to be carried along (or quickly switch to keep it floating). It's not as though you just unlock them all as you go along: Each room has certain dimensions availble (though they can be changed via what batteries you find in the puzzle), so they give you a general direction on how to solve it, and leave it to you to figure out how to use your tools to reach the exit.\n\nIt is worth noting this concept shines in one level in particular: You choose one and only one of the 4 and have to solve the room from there, and based on which one you start with changes the entire solution.\n\nThat said, the puzzle aspect partially comes from how well you can execute it as well (You can only "Table Surf" if you are good enough, after all) so if you are looking for a pure puzzle game, you aren't getting that. That does not make this a fun title though.\n\nThere are also a lot of neat little features, such as how paintings and such change based on the dimension (Example is a painting of a grandmother where in fluffy her hair is insane, where in slow there is a grim reaper standing behind her). Another is that during death or loading screens you get some hilarious dialogue (Things you will never experience because you died #93487: The Zombie Apocalypse (Though this may be for the best)). There are also little knick-knacks in each level that you can hunt for, given a neat sense of exploration, even if all it does is add little dolls in the main lobby.\n\n\nThat all said, there are a few issues. One annoying one is the give-away hints. Your uncle will give you a hint on how to beat the chamber after a while of being in. It's a neat idea, help stumped players get through, but often times he says it after what seems 1 failed attempt (not counting deaths), which means if you don't get a puzzle right first try (whether or not you get the solution) he's gonna chime in and basically become Navi (There is one puzzle where you clearly have to go up, and he constantly goes "You need to get higher.") If the hints were so dead give-away (Almost shouting "HERE IS THE SOLUTION") or he didn't just tell you within moments of entering the room this wouldn't be an issue, but together it can be a bit annoying.\n\nAnother is some questionable hit detection. Numerous times I've been standing on a ledge where suddenly I just get booted off, or I hit a ceiling that still appears numerous feet away. It can cause some annoying and at times frustrating deaths.\n\nThe game itself is also rather short, unfortunately. Though it could be positive because that also means it doesn't over stay it's welcome.\n\n\n\nOn a side note I have seen this game compared to Portal. While it has a Portal feel to it, it's not going to quite get rid of that itch, though it will help satisfy it.\n\n\nOverall, a really fun puzzle game and definitely worth getting if you are looking for an enjoyable game.","August 10, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles themselves are challenging but not frustratingly so. They are physics based and it can take a few tries to get them to behave the way you want them to. There are also plenty of hidden collectables throughout the game, so you completionists out there can get your fix.

I bought Quantum Conundrum after suffering from Portal withdrawal, and I was so happy when I found it! I am a lover of puzzle games with great stories and characters, and Q.C. excels in all those things! In Q.C. you play as the grandson of an inventor who has been working on a secret project that no one knows about. One day when you go to visit him, you notice he is missing and being the annoying nosy kid you are, you go searching for him through his gigantic mansion. Eventually he contacts you from another dimension in the same house. He informs you of his secret invention seeing as that its the only way for you to save him. A glove that can allow you to switch between dimensions in order to save him. This game is fun and quirky, with cute characters and a fun simple story line. Its really hard though! I got stuck on levels for weeks trying different ways to complete them, but the game does a great job of motivating you to proceed forward. You will be frustrated, you will want to break a whole in you computer but eventually you will see the solution and get through it! 9/10 for any fan of  great puzzle games similer to my favorite game Portal. The only reason it didnt get 10/10 is because I thought the mansion could have been a little more detailed and instead the rooms were kinda repetitive in design, but that doesnt really effect the impact of the story on the player at all.","January 30","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dialogue is funny, the story is interesting, and the gameplay is fun. The puzzles are very simple, but you may still have a little trouble getting some on your first try - the game doesn't try very much to focus on the puzzle aspect, and is more interested in testing your timing skills (which I personally am not a fan of, but found interesting anyway). Even so, the game is well balanced and the pacing is good, so I find it to be an enjoyable experience all the way through.\n\nThe DLC on the other hand is HORRIBLE. The levels are WAY too difficult, and once (if) you figure out what you need to do, it's usually very tedious or frustrating because you will keep dying. It is NOT fun at all.

This too is a first-person puzzle game with a touch of humor and the use of crazy and original mechanics to move around and solve each "room". It too has an eloquent and at times hilarious narrator following your actions and guiding you. It too has tons of little humoristic details spread throughout the environment that you can choose to ignore or you can choose to tirelessly search for and explore.\nYou may say that's a bad thing, for a game to piggy ride on the very effective premise that Portal pioneered.

Lots of people are saying that if you like Portal you'll like this game but that was not the case for me. After a few hours of gameplay I figured out the reason I didn't like this game is because it relies too much on platforming and it floaty. For example I would die 20 times trying to land on a safe in the fluff dimension because my characters momentum would continue long after I left of the forward key.\n\nThe dimension's were a very cool idea, but the game is poorly implamented.

The dialogue is funny, the story is interesting, and the gameplay is fun. The puzzles are very simple, but you may still have a little trouble getting some on your first try - the game doesn't try very much to focus on the puzzle aspect, and is more interested in testing your timing skills (which I personally am not a fan of, but found interesting anyway). Even so, the game is well balanced and the pacing is good, so I find it to be an enjoyable experience all the way through.\n\nThe DLC on the other hand is HORRIBLE. The levels are WAY too difficult, and once (if) you figure out what you need to do, it's usually very tedious or frustrating because you will keep dying. It is NOT fun at all. Do NOT buy the DLC unless you want to torment a friend. I finished The Desmond Debacle and got half way through IKE-aramba before giving up on a timing puzzle that required inhuman precision.\n\nFor more in-depth commentary and spoilers, you can watch my full playthrough here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCsoffCh90rL5X-rLpD9_vheq-uTCGt-","December 1, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked Portal, then you will definitely like this game!  The graphics are also well done and gives the whole game a fun, "cartoony" atmosphere.\n\nCons:  The talking will drive you insane.  The writers clearly wanted to create the same witty, "punny" sort of one-liners as in Portal, but its not funny at all, and the only voice actor in the game completely messes up the delivery.  Moreover, this game will BABY you through every level.  "Look up there!"  "You're gonna want a battery here!"  "Maybe you should like heights, hint, hint" and yes they literally say "hint, hint."  This gives you almost no sense of accomplishment after completing a level, and it made me feel like the developers thought I, as the player, had the intellect of a 1st grader.  Also the ending is a huge buzzkill, big build up to nothing...

The ending is thoroughly disappointing.\n\nthe biggest complaint though is that this game tries so hard to be Portal, rather than just being itself.  the last 10% of the game especially.  nearly every single moment took me back to "yea but Portal did this better"  and a game shouldn't be like that, it shouldn't constantly remind me of something else that I played, it just feels like a cheap rip-off, and makes me think the writers/developers lack any creativity, which they clearly didn't for the first 25% of the game!  it felt like "well that was a fun conclusion to that game, lets do it too!" rather than "this is who our villain is, this is who our mentor is, and this is who our player character is, what would they do, and how would they interact in our story"\n\nIn conclusion; the game had its own [good] things going, but someone decided that Portal was a huge hit, so lets just borrow the end of that game and call it our own, who cares about the awesome characters we developed, who cares if it makes the narorator/mentor sound bi-polar, who cares... they liked portal!","May 23, 2015","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of a portal gun, though, the player hops between different dimensions, which results in slowing time, making things heavier or lighter, and reverse gravity to solve puzzles.\n\nAnd though the puzzles themselves are masterfully made, creating situations that are intellectually satisfying while remaining simple enough to avoid frustration and utilizing each of the dimensions, the mark that QC missed, mainly, is atmosphere: the uncle (voiced by John de Lancie) is utterly unlikeable (it feels as though they wanted him to be both endearingly eccentric and abrasively intellectual that they missed the mark on both counts) and that the levels, after a while, became very same-y.  I got the feeling that the game was made by an engineer, with a token world built around the levels.\n\nAll in all, I'd give it a B\n\nIf you like physics puzzles (they really are very good) and first person platforming, but can make concessions for world- and story-building, and have already played Portal, then this is a game for you.","July 13, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought Quantum Conundrum after suffering from Portal withdrawal, and I was so happy when I found it! I am a lover of puzzle games with great stories and characters, and Q.C. excels in all those things! In Q.C. you play as the grandson of an inventor who has been working on a secret project that no one knows about. One day when you go to visit him, you notice he is missing and being the annoying nosy kid you are, you go searching for him through his gigantic mansion. Eventually he contacts you from another dimension in the same house. He informs you of his secret invention seeing as that its the only way for you to save him. A glove that can allow you to switch between dimensions in order to save him. This game is fun and quirky, with cute characters and a fun simple story line. Its really hard though! I got stuck on levels for weeks trying different ways to complete them, but the game does a great job of motivating you to proceed forward. You will be frustrated, you will want to break a whole in you computer but eventually you will see the solution and get through it! 9/10 for any fan of  great puzzle games similer to my favorite game Portal. The only reason it didnt get 10/10 is because I thought the mansion could have been a little more detailed and instead the rooms were kinda repetitive in design, but that doesnt really effect the impact of the story on the player at all.","January 30","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun puzzle/platformer with a similar feel to Portal. It's not all that difficult but it also isn't too easy. The DLC is where the real challenging levels where for me. It has great physics, which is really important, because all the puzzles are physics based.

Very similar feel to Portal; well produced, tight controls, nice and clean aesthetics, medium difficulty puzzles, but the story is what is missing here. There's really not much to the story at all and the game does seem a bit empty because of it, but there is still a great deal of fun to be had in the levels themselves. Well worth the price.","May 5","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But when you get to the second half it's quite ok. The game reminds of Portal. For example  (Minor spoiler) : you use your abilities to transport an object to a switch, which can only then be pressed to open the door for you to get into the next room. Or you slow down time to ride on fast moving objects and hopping from one to another.\n\n6 hours play-through time.\n\nOnly recommended for people who would like to play an easy version of Portal.","May 21","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game introduces new dimensions and concepts at a nice pace and will take roughly 6hrs to complete. The game is very relaxed as the puzzles are not too difficult so you'll always progress at a nice pace, and the game has an excellent art style and direction. The games option menu is very good, different volume sliders, gfx options and fully rebindable keys which is excellent. It certainly feels like a very polished game.\nIf you love games like Portal and Q.U.B.E then you're going to love this game. Thoroughly enjoyable experience and well worth the money.","May 17","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The same silent protagonist, radio instructions, concealed mentor, one room – one puzzle rule and so on. But unlike Portal where you had to coordinate just two portals in one dimension, Quantum conundrum offers you four different dimensions. And in my opinion it doesn’t make the game better. It’s not enough just to plan your further actions, you have to use 3 (or sometimes even 4) dimension with extremely precise timing or you will fail. So it’s not the puzzle complexity that pisses you off, it’s the necessity to play some traps over and over again. You may say it is a game for you spinal cord rather than your brain. The other weak spots are the plot and physics engine that doesn’t handle all the dimensions correctly from time to time.\n\nBut it’s still a nice game with humor (put closer attention to the pictures on walls) to amuse yourself for a couple of evenings. 7/10. Gonna check out the Talos Principle now :-)","March 28, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
