Basically a "light" "point and click" adventure game characterized by hidden object scenes where you must find objects from a list.\n\nGrim Legends: The Forsaken Bride, the newest title of theirs I've played so far, represents striking production values.\n\nForsaken Bride hits upon all the key points that HOG players look for - pleasing art, a reasonably engaging story, astutely  placed items in hidden item scenes, a mix of not too difficult puzzles, ample handholding for those that need it - and takes it even further:\n\nAnimation\nThis title is highly animated compared to typical HOGs. Most scenes have moving/wiggling elements - people, vegetation, weather, etc. This makes the game feel much more "alive", rather than just a slideshow.\n\nThe numerous cutscenes are also quite well made.\n\nLittle Helper\nIn addition to using items from your inventory to solve puzzles and progress, sometimes you need assistance from... a kitten.\n\nYep, that's right. A kitten.\n\nReally, it's quite a cheap trick to put a cute kitten into the game, but, of course, it works. Who can argue with a kitten?\n\nMost of the time, the kitten sits quietly in the corner of your interface, but, sometimes, you can "use" the kitten like an inventory object to solve a particular situation. Sometimes the kitten starts meowing as a hint that he can be of assistance.\n\nEvery time this happens, you are treated to an animation of the kitten interacting with the scene.\n\nElusive Objects\nThis title has a feature I hadn't seen before. In addition to the more common trope of looking for a type of object (in this case, faeries) across all scenes (in this case, "regular", not HO scenes), you can also optionally find "elusive objects".\n\nElusive objects are basically objects that... do not quite belong. They also are not constantly present, instead appearing and disappearing at intervals.\n\nThis makes for a welcome change from the typical kind of object hunting. The visual challenge here is distinct - look for something that does not belong/was not there before.\n\nThis proves a quite difficult challenge, but the game helps you by indicating when a scene contains an elusive object.\n\nThese elusive objects, when found, fit into the illustrations of pages of an optional storybook. When you find all 3 objects on a page, you are treated with a small cutscene.\n\nThese pages also serve as another hint for what you are looking for - you can see the outline of the object in the illustration.\n\nWrinkles\nIn an effort to be balanced, I'll mention a few things that were perhaps not as good as they could be:\n\n* The character art is at times a bit awkward (but the voice acting is quite good). Faces especially sometimes come off as unintentionally "creepy".\n* A few puzzles are unintuitive and not as well indicated as they could be (e.g. having to construct a water sprayer to put out a lantern), but this is not unusual for games of this type and is a very minor complaint.\n\nArtifex Mundi\nArtifex Mundi develops and publishes high quality HOGs. I've yet to be disappointed by one of their titles, so this recommendation can basically be taken to extend to the rest of their titles - I won't bother writing a review for each one.\n\nFor achievement hunters, these titles tend to take about 10-15 hours to 100% without a walkthrough, usually(?) requiring two playthroughs.","April 5, 2015","true","15.3"," 75 of 76 people (99%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","99","75","76","2","14"

We know what we are getting ourselves into after this point. An amazing artwork, an engaging story and an exceedingly well gameplay for the HOG genre. But here I am, smiling peculiarly, thanks to the fact that Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride embraces my favorite setting and concept to tell a tale ever: folktales.\n\nIn a nameless forest of Middle Eastern Europe, a young nameless girl clad in a simple hood runs - alone and frustrated - in a dreary rain. As she runs desperately, she asks out loud, as if expecting a possible answer: "Why did you leave me? How could you do it?" She runs towards a gruesome tree, sitting atop a jagged cliff. She keeps on with her soliloquy as she keeps climbing towards the top, looking over the bottomless chasm: "All your professions of love! All your promises..." As she reaches the top of the tree, she removes a beautiful emerald ring from her slender finger as she sheds one more tear. "They were all lies!"...and she throws the ring to the chasm with all her broken might, as she utters a final damnation for the one who broke her innocent heart: "Curse you and your heartless kin!"\n\n25 years after the fateful event, we take the role of a young woman in a journey towards the village of Haugwitz with her father in a silent evening. Our twin sister Lilly will be marrying to a handsome young man soon, and we are trying to arrive in time for the wedding. As me manage to reach after bit of a trouble and hope for Lilly's smiling face, the warmth of an inn and maybe getting to know the groom a bit better - not necessarily in that order - a dire bear attacks the village and kidnaps our sister before our very eyes! With the young groom who seems eager to play the hero, we venture out into the forest to get out sister back safe and sound. What dreadful business is this? Who is a friend, and who is a foe? More importantly, who is our family?\n\nOkay, I'm not usually in the habit of telling the introduction scene of HOGs this elaborately in my reviews, but for one reason or the other, this story and its opening scene really got me. It is desperate, reckless and dangerous - gothic in a romantic way; and maybe just the right amount of eerie to make out a wondrous folktale! Artifex Mundi goes forward to craft a beautiful game worthy of its reputation: gorgeous artwork, enchanting color palette and authentic cultural anecdotes combined into a wonderful setting for this first instalment of Grim Legends series. Every single scene is wallpaper quality, I tell you! Added decent enough voice acting and sorrowful soundtrack, the game presents high quality atmosphere for a HOG.\n\nHidden object scenes are various and quite enjoyable with a domino gameplay alternative if you get bored. Puzzles are interesting, yet not really challenging. Interactive map is there, but you won't be needing it a lot since the backtracking is little to none. Gameplay is really story oriented in this one, so you keep moving according the plot anyhow. You'll be needing at least 2 playthroughs to collect all achievements - one for HOG scenes, one for domino completions - and over all, the game presents you 6-8 hours of play time - including a bonus chapter for your enjoyment.\n\nYou can grab Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride with peace of mind to experience a beautiful and simple adventure. It's nothing complicated and the ending isn't anything miraculous, but I strongly recommend this one if you enjoy the genre or would like to try just for the sake of beautiful artworks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/284850/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Reviewing hidden object games (henceforth referred to as HOGs for convenience’s sake), especially those by prolific developer Artifex Mundi, has become a bigger and bigger challenge for me the more I play through. It’s a genre that doesn’t really need to differ dramatically from game to game (most people come to HOGs for a very specific sort of game, after all), but due to this similarity it’s hard to know what is really worth talking about as one review can typically serve as a blanket recommendation for a particular developer.\n\nAnd yet I continue to review Artifex Mundi’s games because time and again I’ve been surprised at how they’ve managed to diversify their portfolio with HOGs which feel distinct from one another. Each of their games has also managed to incrementally build upon the previous one, creating a sense of continual improvement without being required to introduce any radical changes to a formula that is clearly working (if my count is correct this makes my fifth review of an Artifex Mundi game).\n\nWith this in mind, Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride is a bit of an odd one out. It’s perhaps the most forgettable Artifex Mundi game I’ve yet played (being barely edged out by the first Nightmares of the Deep), but also one of the most ambitious. The narrative for instance is the most layered and complex of any of Artifex Mundi’s games, taking place over a large timeline and even managing to catch me off guard with a few of its twists. That doesn’t make the plot any good, in fact it has largely fallen apart by the end in through a last-ditch effort to justify some of the symbolism seen throughout the game, but I can still appreciate Artifex Mundi attempting to provide a greater substance to their cliché ridden narratives and perhaps with a few more attempts will get closer to something legitimately compelling.\n\nGrim Legends other notable contribution is your kitten companion you meet early on. Aside from being absolutely adorable she acts as a helper for certain puzzles in the game, which is a nice change from having to jury-rig random items together all the time. I was disappointed however with how rarely my feline friend actually got to do anything, typically being required to sit and be cute in the corner of the screen even when it would make sense for her to help out. I legitimately forgot numerous times she was even usable for puzzle solving because it was so infrequent a solution utilizing her actually worked. Hopefully animal companions (or whatever fits for a specific game) is a returning feature for Artifex Mundi games going forward and will be given a larger part that actually justifies their inclusion.\n\nOne of the weirdest things about Grim Legends is how it can look incredible during normal gameplay, but every cutscene is a horrendously compressed mess of muddy textures. Perhaps the difference was just closer before, but I can’t recall any of Artifex Mundi’s previous games having such jarring transitions and they became a continual blight on an otherwise extremely pretty game. On the plus side character models have almost made it out of the uncanny valley, though voice acting is still all over the place, unaided by a few grammatical errors which made it into both the spoken and written script.\n\nI say it every time it seems as if I’m heavily criticizing an Artifex Mundi game, but it’s worth noting again that whatever my disappointment with a specific game may be, I’ve still yet to actually dislike anything they’ve put out. I can certainly point to my favorites, but unless you’re predisposed to dislike HOGs you really can’t go wrong with any of their games, Grim Legends included. I suppose then my reviews or their work is less general buying advice and more a quick rundown of where a particular game fits on the arbitrary leaderboard inside my head. In that sense this isn’t very high on the list, but what it tries and fails to do is encouraging enough to make it a worthwhile stepping stone to better things to come.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","July 6, 2015","true","5.6"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

How could you do it?! All your professions of love! All your promises...! They were all lies. Curse you and your heartless kin!"\n\nAnd so goes the dramatic intro scene of Grim legends: the forsaken bride. Not knowing what I was getting myself into, I bought the game at a discounted price after seeing a very good friend play it. I remember looking at the store page and ridiculing it at first, thinking it was a 'stupid, little game'. Well in essence, it actually is that ... But it is so much fun that I told myself to review it right after completing the game. Now that I did, it is time to talk about what this game has to offer.\n\nFirst, I'd like to mention that this game probably won't be for everyone. Just like certain puzzle and point & click games, this game is played by a fairly limited amount of people. Not because it is bad, but because it is a very specific genre (that not everyone will like) that is targeted at a certain audience. So please keep that in mind.\n\nThis game is specified as a HOG (hidden object game) and as its name implies, you play through the game finding hidden objects so that you can advance your adventure. You play through several scenes (or environments) and have to find objects that you can then use for certain actions, puzzles, hidden object scenes ... This pretty much sums up the gameplay and may not sound very exciting, but it's actually very satisfying. Even little and simple actions and puzzles are fun to do and solve.\n\nThe great and calm soundtrack that I hear in the background really makes it a very soothing experience. The story kept me motivated to complete the game, even though it may not have been a unique one. I just loved playing this game inbetween my more 'serious' games and I am grateful that I discovered Artifex Mundi, the creater of amazing HOG's.\n\nI like\n\n+ A story that is not really unique, but still very enjoyable\n+ Ok voice acting\n+ Great, relaxing soundtrack\n+ Really satisfying gameplay\n+ Difficulty is just about right\n+ Attention to detail\n+ Decent length\n+ Extra little chapter!\n+ Overall fun and engaging experience\n\nI don't like\n\n- /\nThere's nothing I can think of right now. Maybe that's because this is my first HOG, or maybe that's because AM are amazing developers.\n\nConclusion\n\nI recommend this to all HOG lovers for 100% and 99% to other people who never played a HOG before. You may end up liking it a lot like I did (and let's be honest, this game is pretty cheap, especially on a sale). I'm looking forward to playing other AM games for sure, hoping they are an experience as amazing as this one (or even better)!","September 2, 2015","true","11.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","6"

Everything about this game is magic: the story, the setting, the design and the music.\n\nBut what I liked the most about this game was the addition of a very cute companion that follows you throughout story. It is something different from the Hint system, its sole purpose being to help you solve some of the puzzles.\n\nApart from the hidden object scenes (which you can alternate with a game of dominoes) there are a lot of other hidden collectibles that appear in the point-and-click scenes; collecting all these will unlock new surprises in the end.\n\nI highly recommend this wonderful game, not only to all the HoG fans out there, but also to anyone that wants to spend 4-5 hours chilling with a casual point-and-click adventure.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","December 8, 2014","true","11.1"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

The game is a mystery plot where the story is driven forwards by object puzzles.

All dialogue is voice acted, and I have no complaints about any of the voice actors.\n\nWhat makes Grim Legends stand out from other HO games are two things: first, the developer has made it so that every puzzle can be bypassed: either by using the hint/skip button, or by solving a domino slide puzzle instead of the object searching.\nSecondly, during the main story you get a cat companion that helps you solve the puzzles.

The travel between scenes is not too frequent as to be annoying, although the directions and scenes are not terribly distinct, but the overall ability to navigate the environ is fair. The drawbacks are focused primarily on the weak puzzles in the game; not only weak, but frequently exceptionally trivial, arbirtrary, or simplistic.

Compared to other Artifex Mundi titles, I would rate it on par with "Nightmares of the Deep: The Cursed Heart."\n\nThe artwork for both the backgrounds and the puzzles is beautiful, as is expected for an AM game, but some of the character designs and cutscenes were a bit of a letdown.  ("I'm going to go change into my wedding dress, that looks just like my normal dress, that looks exactly the same as a third dress hanging in my room...")\n\nThe gameplay combines several types of puzzles including:\n1. Traditional hidden object screens (clearly denoted by shiny sparkles in casual mode).\n2. "I Spy"-style fairy finding.  These special sprites appear on almost every close-up location detail screen.\n3.  Elusive disappearing-reappearing images.  These objects blend into the larger location backgrounds and slowly fade in and out of view.  Collecting them gives you additional plot background, but they can be tricksome to locate.\n4. Classic adventure gaming puzzles.  (i.e. Find objects, use/combine with other objects, backtrack everywhere)\n5. Recipes.  AM loves their crafting worktables.\n6. Mini-games.  Incredibly easy time-wasters and brainteasers such as interlocking puzzles, tile-swapping, rotating pieces, matching symbols, and general pattern recognition.\n\nThey also threw in a cat companion who counts as a special use item, which I found to be a fun little gimmick.\n\nI started on Expert mode, and only got stuck twice (figuring out what to do with the ladder, and figuring out how to light the torch.)  Everything else was pretty straightforward.  If you are a veteran of the genre, you will most likely be playing on auto-pilot.\n\nMy biggest complaint was actually the pacing.  They tried to build in a learning curve for new players, but it just makes the start of the game feel very slow and tedious, and the end of the game feel like a flash-round, mini-game gauntlet.  This becomes an added issue when some of the achievements are not only time-challenges (like 1-minute dominoes), but can only be earned in story mode.  If you miss those achievements on the first playthrough, have fun slogging through tutorial mode all over again, or replaying the bonus level ad nauseum, just to get to an applicable puzzle.  (It doesn't help that you are already required to fully play through the game twice over if you want to earn all of the achievements.)\n\nI will say that for once with an AM game, I found the bonus level gameplay more enjoyable than the main story.

The music is beautifully atmospheric and I found myself surprised that a point and click hidden object game had better music than some AAA titles.\nGraphics: This game looks stunning for what it is. Everything is vividly coloured and the scenes are a pleasure to take in. Yeah, the graphics aren't fantastic, but it's a point and click game, and it makes an extra effort to look pretty.\nStoryline: The storyline picks up fast and features a short interactive sequence after the first cutscene to get to grips with how everything works, there's no faffing around getting in to the plot. I will also shamelessly admit that a couple of scenes had me getting a bit teary-eyed, so I can't complain a jot about the story-telling (however I'm a hormonal mess at the best of times, so just bare that in mind :D).\nDifficulty settings: The game features three different difficulty modes with varying downsides, a bonus if you like a bit of punishment in the brain department.\nMap travel: Like other Artifex Mundi games, you can quick travel using the map, which saves you a hell of a lot of time. On easier difficulty modes you can also see which areas have actions available which is a good help when you've been scouring every inch of every screen for a while!\nAchievements: The game features a good amount of achievements which are relatively easy to accomplish (most coming from the natural progression of the storyline), making this game a good buy for people who like to 100% things.\nExtra game: You get access to an extra, short game called The Abyss following the completion of the main story. What it lacks in duration it more than makes up for in content and boasts a couple extra achievements for those interested.\nCons\nGame interface: The UI can get a bit irritating at times, namely the massive bar that pops up at the top of the screen when you interact with things. When on the hidden object parts, clicking an interactive object before you have the corresponding piece will block off a chunk of the top of the screen. It can also feel a bit cluttered at times because of this. Not a massive issue, though when going for the timed achievements (such as getting x number of hidden objects within x seconds) it can be a bit of a hinderance.\nFootsteps: This was the single most annoying thing in the entire game for me, which is silly in hindsight because it's such a small issue. Basically, whenever you move from scene to scene, you hear your character's footsteps. When you consider moving from room to room fairly quickly it grates - though this could just be me.\nButtons: This is again to do with the UI, but a different issue. There's a few buttons at the bottom of the screen that let you click to see how many bonus hidden objects you've found (in this game it's fairies and out of place items, in a few Artifex Mundi games it's been seahorses and the like), however it's right next to the map button, which means you can accidentally hit the wrong button. Again, this is more of a pet peeve for me, especially when I did it four times in a row (lel).\nVoice and text: Unfortunately there are a few typos in the game, mainly missed words as opposed to spelling errors. There are some discrepancies between what is written and what the characters say. While it's a small error it's one I feel diminishes just how well made this game is.\nMinor issues/mentions\nThe voice acting can be a bit wonky at times, I remember a couple of scenes where it sounded like the voice actor had never heard a particular word they were saying. However the majority of the game features great voice acting.\nSome interactive areas were a little too big, meaning you'd end up clicking the same place again thinking it was somewhere different due to the distance from the object on the screen.\nThe little kitty follower you get early on is definitely a major highlight of the game, I never tired of seeing it drag it's cute little butt over the UI to help me out.\nI also swore blind one of the voice actors was the guy who played Randy in Trailer Park Boys, certainly made those scenes more enjoyable.\n\nOverall I loved this game, it's of a length that you can replay it without taking too much time out of your day. It's easy to get into and even when you've left the game for a while you can easily pick it back up.\nI'd recommend it to anyone, especially when you consider the price tag.","March 31, 2015","true","11.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Helped by her fiancé, you're going to save her... But who is really saving who? And who is really your family?\n\nArtifex Mundi is trying to deliver a sad and creepy fairy tale, though creepy isn't really the right word for it. The plot is well-written and full of twists. As usual, they managed to get you captived. And you really want to know the last word of the story.\n\nThe gameplay is not innovative as it's always find items, clear hidden objects scenes, solve puzzles, find beyond objects BUT everything is well polished. Everything is well polished. The puzzles are quite easy and the hidden objects scenes are clear. There is also the hunt for the spirits (fairies) and beyond objects (changing appearances), which is adding some spice to the game.\n\nThe reason why Grim Legends is one of my favorite series from AM are the graphics and the soundtrack. Indeed, given the fact that they're mastering the mysterious and dark side, Grim Legends is at the same time colorful and surrounded by an aura of lurking evil, as you're playing mainly during the night, that you're also visiting places tied to that kind of ambiance (forest, witch's cabin, castle, etc.). What is nice too is also the fact that you're discovering the tale as a bonus too. The soundtrack is as usual well fit.\n\nBesides, I've noticed something: I've rarely saw the main protagonist as being male. For the games released on Steam, you're always a woman, that has brains and can survive by herself despite the era or the world. I mean by that that here, in Grim Legends, you're not the damsel in distress even if it's another woman - though your twin sister is as strong as you.\n\nAnyway, if anything, Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride is one of the HO you must have and you must try.

The puzzles and hidden objects scenes are equally reparted.\n\nThe game features an inventory where you can store items to combine with the environment to go deeper in the story. Earlier in the game you also find a very useful fellow who will help you many times through your adventure.\n\nThe game have several difficulties and have a guest feature : all the family can play the game and resume it where they left. There is also a map which is useful to fast travel through the different places and that can have some hints if you play in a easier mode. Also you can use the Hint/Skip hourglass whenever you want and wait until its refill to use it again. But be warned that you may not skip or use a hint in any puzzle or hidden objects scene if you wish to have some achievements.\n\nThere is a wide choice of puzzles and there are two kind of Hidden objects scenes. The first Hidden objects scene features the name of the objects to find some are found easily (normal one) and some others need you to interact with the enviroment or to combine two items to found them. The second Hidden objects scene let you find the shape of the objects in the scene and sometimes ask you to use them in order to obtain the others.\n\n(*) :\nThe game has some achievements that can be missed even some story related achievements and also some challenging achievements including finishing the game on hardmode. There is a guide on steam that will help you to not miss any of these achievements. The challenging achievements require you to finish a puzzle or an hidden objects scene or a domino game under a minute. And two achievements require you to find 3 objects in 3 seconds or find all objects without any misclick in the hidden object scenes.\n\n(#):\nAs I said in the key features, you need two playthrough to finish the game. One to finish the game with all the puzzles and hidden objects scenes perfected and another one playing the domino game instead of the hidden objects scenes. The good thing is you can skip all the cutscenes and puzzles in your second playthrough if you succeeded your first one. The domino game consist in placing domino tiles on every bear tiles of the level, there are one joker the blank icon that allow you to place any icon next to it.","April 9","true","8.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Jump map, little backtracking, adjustable difficulty.  On casual difficulty, hints recharge very quickly.\n\nHidden object scenes are very seldom straightforward. Usually there's a fun twist or two to them, but if you find them tiresome or frustrating, you can choose to play dominos instead.\n\nPuzzles are varied and as far as I can remember never repeated.  (If any WERE repeated, this was so inoffensive that it didn't stick in my memory.)\n\nArt, cut scenes and animations are of high quality for this genre and release year.  Voice acting is appropriate and never sounds amateurish (a common pitfall in these games).  Cute animal companion is present and accounted for (a kitten), but thankfully not over-used.\n\nExtras include soundtrack (that you can save to your Documents folder with a click), wallpapers, replayable hidden object scenes and the traditional extra chapter.  During the main game, there are 30 colllectable fairies ('spirits') and 28 morphing objects to find as optional objectives.\n\nEasily worth full price ($7.99 CDN at time of writing).

I would say this is one of the best, if not THE best, game of this genre that I've played (and I have played many, both on mobile and PC, over the years).\n\nPuzzles were adequately challenging, hidden object scenes actually took some effort to complete, voice acting was better than the average HO game (meaning not horrific and in some places excellent).  Best of all, items in the HO scenes FIT in the scenes; there are no modern anachronisms mixed conspicuously into this medieval fairy tale setting.  This is maybe just a weird thing with me, but I always find it jarring when I'm playing a game set in a certain sort of time period but the items I'm forced to find are things like astronaut helmets and modern telephones.

It also wasn't a brutally short game like some HO/adventure types.

Like just about all their others, it's got reasonable graphics, mostly tolerable voice acting, adequate story, and a forced second run-through because of mutually exclusive Achievements and lack of saves.  In this case, though, the story seems to have more of a "female" slant (revolving more around a relationship, dealing with marriage, and even 1) one puzzle with lingerie and bouquets and 2) one involving makeup).  Not a big thing, but noticeable.  Also, the "Bonus" chapter is not really optional:  you can't get all the Achievements without going through it on both runs.  Additionally, the puzzles seem just a tad more difficult to do than in the previous AM games I've played.  And, finally, this game is a bit longer than usual.  Overall, to get 100% Achievements, it took me 14.1 hours:  8.5 hours for the first run-through of the main game, 1.3 hours for the Bonus chapter, and an additional 4.3 hours for the second run-through (on Expert and doing the Domino games).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/recommended/284850/","Smiledozer","*IC* Smiledozer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/","484 products in account","Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride is another incredible Hidden Object Game from the phoenominal Artifex Mundi. This is the first game in a trilogy of tales based in the fashion of the Brothers Grimm. With this particular Artifex Mundi game, you cannot go wrong. It's a game that all ages can enjoy for its puzzles and hidden-object mini-games, but also one that holds a strong storyline which would interest all age groups. Grim Legends is like playing a fairy tale as if they were reading a book.\n\nStory\nGrim Legends focuses around a woman who's sister is kidnapped on the day of her wedding by a strange bear. There's definately something strange about the bear and the whole situation. The protagonist decides to go off on her own and rescue her sister. In the process of recovering her, the player stumbles upon a long forgotten curse that only a mysterious old hermi women knows of.\n\nClassic Artifex Engine and Style\nArtifex Mundi always combines their beautiful artwork with puzzles and hidden object games to pull together a great story. This creates a great formula which leaves you wanting more. This particular game is the first, and one of the best Artifex games that I've played to date.\n\nIf you're new to the Artifex universe, I highly recommend that this be the first AM game you play.\n\nPros:\n- Grim Legends holds AM's best artwork. The locations you will visit are enchanting.\n- Fantastic storyline that drives the player to play more\n- Great for kids and adults alike\n- Various difficulties (as in all AM games)\n- Various styles of hint systems with adjusting difficulty\n- Just an all around solid, great game\n\nCons:\n- A Short game, even combined with the Bonus content. If you like Artifex Mundi games, you already know that many of them are short games. AM is changing this with their newer releases such as Grim Legends 2 or Nightmares of the Deep 3.\n- Some of the voice work, while nice and clear, are a bit overplayed or cheesy, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the game or the story line. This is also a feature that is currently being vastly improved with newer Artifex games.\n\nVerdict? - 8/10\nGrim Legends is probably one of Artifex's best titles. It is family friendly and is fun for all ages. This is just a fantastic game for anyone who enjoys hidden object games, puzzles, or just great adventure/fairy tale stories. I can very confidently say that I am ecstatic that I found this game, otherwise I would not have found Artifex Mundi. A high recommendation.\n\nIf you're curious about any other Artifex Mundi games, I have and will continue to do many reviews on their great titles. If you liked the Grim Legends title, Grim Legends 2 is currently available on Steam as well. Please read my review for it if you are interested.","January 11, 2015","true","11.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Most of the Artifex Mundi games on Steam are hidden object games, and all of the ones I've played have been of very high quality. But when I started playing The Forsaken Bride, I knew it was something special.\n\nFirst, lets talk about the gameplay. The hidden object scenes and puzzles are basically the same as any other Artifex Mundi game. Items are collected or created through hidden object scenes, and are also collected through exploration of the world. You explore and interact with the world using items you collect, and some of these items are used in various puzzle games. Many puzzle games are similar to those found in other Artifex Mundi games, but I found the ones in The Forsaken Bride to be more refined, varied and challenging.\n\nI've always found the atmosphere and music to be phenomenal when it comes to Artifex Mundi games, and The Forsaken Bride is no exception. In addition, I found the artwork to be hauntingly beautiful.\n\nWhat stood out to me most was the story. The execution was nearly flawless, and there was a depth and subtle intricacy that I had not found in previous Artifex Mundi games. That's not to say that the stories in other Artifex Mundi games are bad (they're actually quite good), but the story in The Forsaken Bride is truly a step above the rest.\n\nThe Forsaken Bride is the best hidden object game I've yet played, and may very well be the best Artifex Mundi game to date.","December 19, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of the solutions don't make a lot of sense (nor do some of the hidden objects you have to find), but if you ever get stuck, you can fall back on the hint system to make regular progress.\n\nWhile it can be absorbing to seek solutions hidden within the beautiful images, it bothers me that there is only one solution to every puzzle. Sometimes the “correct” solution makes less sense than something I came up with on my own. Also bothersome is the protagonist's tendency to leave behind useful items like a knife or a rope, only to search for new ones in the next puzzle. I'd like Artifex Mundi games more if they had flexibile puzzle solutions (like the Deus Ex games), encouraging creativity and improving replay value.\n\nAs long as Artifex Mundi sticks to their formula, they are unlikely to make a game better than Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride. I can't complain too much, though; simple, bite-sized games like this can be very satisfying to play once in a while, especially in an environment populated by so many long games.\n\n(Rating: 7.5/10 “Good”)","January 6, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are unique and the actions you have to do for advance in history DOES make sense, and this is beautiful.\n\nFor example: if you have to catch a key inside a well and you have a rope in your inventory, you can logically drop the rope down in the well and get the key. If you have an axe, it will cut some trees for you. It's logical, unlike a lot of others point-and-click games that you have to figure out a sequence of illogical actions in order to proceed.\n\nThe only imperfection in this game is that you can't complete the achievements by playing the puzzles separately in the extra section.

I have played a ton of these HOG games. I was a little disapointed in this game. The game map and direction are very confusing and I had to use the hint button just to find out where I was supposed to go next. I played most of this confused and lost as to what I was to do and how to do it. The game does have a map that tells you their is something to do at this spot. However I was so lost I didnt have any idea what to do or how to do it. Very disapointing in a good looking game like this. My other issue is with the Hidden object puzzles themselves the use a lot of trickery in them. Such as only having 10% of the piece showing so its ultra hard to see many puzzle pieces you need to click on.\n\nThe domino game I was confused by it and frankly it just didnt appeal to me. The game does have a collectable section and it offers 2 different ones. The first is little pixie fairies that you click on to collect those are easy to find. The second one is very tedious to find and sometimes requires you to wait for it to cycle its animation to collect and I didnt collect very many of these as they are almost impossible to find without help. I supose some will like to find these almost impossible to see collectables. I enjoyed the pixies, I did not enjoy pixel hunting for the others.\n\nThe puzzles I  hated almost all of them. Boring, confusing, tedious. TEDIOUS. I hate to say it but a lot the puzzles in this game felt phoned in and were just not that much fun to complete or try to complete. Ugh.\n\nI did like some parts of this game. The kitten you rescue is a great idea and the animation for the cat and the sounds are great. I wish they would have used the cat more in the game. The graphics and sound are excellent. So that brings me around to the story. I found it to be another mixed bag and I was again confused by it  almost till the very end. Also this game has a ton of backtracking and again adds to the confusion of where the player is supposed to go and why. Not the greatest this publisher has ever made in my opinion.  Good game but not great.","August 8, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not terribly difficult, but there were a few parts where I got stuck for a while -- all of which were due to my own lack of observational powers, and not because of bad design.\n\nThe storyline involves witchcraft and evil spirits, but I don't think it would unduly frighten small children. Adults who enjoy hidden-object games will also have a good time with it. (What is it about HOGs that are just so relaxing and satisfying to play?)\n\nFinishing the base game unlocks a bonus chapter that lasts about an hour. The base game also has a couple of extra "meta" quests within it, which require you to look for hidden fairies and incongruous objects buried throughout the game. This is entirely optional and doesn't affect the plot (other than revealing some backstory), but it does add another layer of challenge and replay-ability to the game.\n\nIn short, it's a high-quality HOG that I would recommend to all fans of the genre.","March 1","true","10.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The quality of the visuals, music and voice acting are both superb for the genre (I was especially amazed by the smooth, but still painted-looking animations.) The game brings all the features of modern HO games, map, hints, selectable difficulty level, easy puzzles, lots of achievements and collectables and an alternative for HO scenes (in this game it's domino).\n\nThe plot is good too for the genre, not too blatantly obvious, though not that surprising either. I liked how it's not about a guy saving a love interest, but a woman trying to save her sister. And I loved the ending a lot! The focus was different than most HO games I've played.\n\nIn the first half of the game instead of word-list HO scenes, the player has to combine items based on images. I haven't met with this type of HO scene before, it was refreshing after the endless word-lists of other games.\n\nThe only thing I kinda missed is the feature they had in 'SEASON OF MYSTERY: The Cherry Blossom Murders' where if you click on an object in a HO scene, it shows the item's silhouette.\n\nThere were some genre-typical ridiculous elements, like having to light up a torch with a ray of focused light in a multi-step puzzle, next to a field of dozens of candles. Also having to be basically a cleptomaniac and steal quite a few things from your innocent neighbours. (I had to steal a candle, a crochet needle, a fan and a teacup from the same windowsill throughout the game + even had to cut off a piece of their curtain ^^;; )\n\nPS: That kitten helper is the cutest thing ever :D","December 30, 2014","true","12.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Sometimes it is nice to move away from all the violence, fast paced war whcih of course, we all enjoy so much, and come back down to earth with a somewhat slower, more simple game that still has an intresting story, but doesn't require too much effort.\n\nThis game is really nice, i will not give any of the story line away, but it is very magical, much like most games mae by this company. The game is well made, and though relatively shrot i do not regret buying it. I am satisfied with the story, and i really anjoyed playing through it. There is enough to do inside the game so that you don't feel like you are lost for activity's, though i must confess i do get tired of the Hidden Object scenes sometimes. Other than that, the graphics are nice in this game, and i really like the setting and the story.\n\nI can't really fault it, it is short and sweet, and on sale i would reccomend it to anyone that is up for it. It is a suitable game for most audiences, with different difficulty settings and such. Maybe full price, 6 British Pounds, is a bit too much for some, but i don't begrudge it. Nonetheless, for the time you get out of it, a sale price is more suitable.\n\nAll in all 10/10 i really like this game, and i hope you will too, if you have not yet played it.","December 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Second the puzzles are very creative and fun though some are a little to vague on what they expect you to do and it can get a little frustrating as you have to figure the whole process out before you can even start working out the puzzle itself. Its nice that you have some choices in the game should you get stuck, not in the mood for a hidden puzzle? Play dominos instead. That puzzle got you stumped? Just skip it.\n\nI found the story a bit shallow but nicely delivered and it was a fun challenge trying to find all the elusive objects and sprites. Its surprising there's no achievement for that as they can be… well elusive but all I can say is keep your eyes pealed cause you could be looking right at one and still miss it. Naturally some might find this kind of game boring because it works on a more relaxed pace that forces you to slow down and use your brain to work out the problem but I liked being able to take my time and enjoy the atmosphere rather then speed though it guns blazing. It’s a nice change from shooting monsters and beating up bad guys.\n\nIts not for everyone though so if your impatient or prefer more action in your games I'd avoid this one, it will ether drive you insane or put you to sleep. But if you’re the type that likes the challenge of a good puzzle then give this one a try, just don't expect to be shocked at the story twist.","January 23, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh, and of course, likes cats...you get a cute kitten that helps you reach annoyingly out-of-reach objects.\n\nThe story promises a lot of mystery, magic and romance (although take heed gents - not much romance until the end scenes and a couple of love letters you find along the way). Initially what drew me to this game was the beautiful art-style, which did not disappoint. The voice acting was pretty lacklustre however, which was disappointing because it almost completely ruined the mysterious and intriguing atmosphere that the beautifully composed soundtrack combined with the art-style had created.\n\nThe story itself was interesting but cliche, making it somewhat predictable. Puzzles weren't too challenging, and I did get a bit tired of playing dominos to unlock necessary objects (dominos being the easier option than some other puzzle). "It's ok. I'm just in a hurry to save my sister. I've got time for more dominos." The final chapter had a LOT of puzzles, which I thought was a little over the top but was probably also serving to build suspense.\n\nThe link between some of the objects and objectives took a bit to figure out - who knew that you could use a diamond earring to cut an opening into a glass window? I didn't!  The amount of times I could have used my jewelry to break into my own house when I'd forgotten my keys will haunt me forever more...Thankfully the hint button refreshes quickly (on casual mode).\n\nArtifex Mundi have created a beautiful-looking game, and it was the combination of the art, music, story and puzzles that was enough to keep me playing until the end of the dark abyss.","April 26, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh, and of course, likes cats...you get a cute kitten that helps you reach annoyingly out-of-reach objects.\n\nThe story promises a lot of mystery, magic and romance (although take heed gents - not much romance until the end scenes and a couple of love letters you find along the way). Initially what drew me to this game was the beautiful art-style, which did not disappoint. The voice acting was pretty lacklustre however, which was disappointing because it almost completely ruined the mysterious and intriguing atmosphere that the beautifully composed soundtrack combined with the art-style had created.\n\nThe story itself was interesting but cliche, making it somewhat predictable. Puzzles weren't too challenging, and I did get a bit tired of playing dominos to unlock necessary objects (dominos being the easier option than some other puzzle). "It's ok. I'm just in a hurry to save my sister. I've got time for more dominos." The final chapter had a LOT of puzzles, which I thought was a little over the top but was probably also serving to build suspense.\n\nThe link between some of the objects and objectives took a bit to figure out - who knew that you could use a diamond earring to cut an opening into a glass window? I didn't!  The amount of times I could have used my jewelry to break into my own house when I'd forgotten my keys will haunt me forever more...Thankfully the hint button refreshes quickly (on casual mode).\n\nArtifex Mundi have created a beautiful-looking game, and it was the combination of the art, music, story and puzzles that was enough to keep me playing until the end of the dark abyss.","April 26, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles vary in difficulty from extremely easy to 'wtf am I doing' with most of them being on the easier side. The logic in item usage and gathering is mostly solid, I rarely thought some conclusions were too farfetched.\n\nThe story follows a young lady trying to save her sister from evil forces. Imo the story was the worst part of the game, perhaps because I feel the whole  human turned into a bear theme has been overused. I mean. Brother Bear, Brave, the classic folk tail White-Bear-King-Valemon. Why did it have to be a bear, whyyy. I choose to believe they are paying homage to the classic folk tails. Also the whole twin thing. Instantly upon learning the character is the sister's twin "welp, for sure they will switch places at some point or other." Yessir The character is a decent 'strong independant young woman' with a few exceptions, like 'my sister's life may be in danger but NO WAY I'm touching this item that I absolutely need to get to her because it has some ants next to it and that's totes ewww.'\n\nBonus points for extremely cute kitten helper.\n\nThe animation in cutscenes in this game seemed better than the last AM games I've played, though the characters still make some creepy faces once in a while.

The puzzles are not very challenging to an adult, however, the game does offer three different difficulty modes to choose from so if you want more of a challenge go for it!

This game has beautiful animations, especially for a hidden object game.  The characters are engaging and interesting, even when the animation reaches uncanny valley levels, and the story is interesting.\n\nThe game is not overly difficult, but it does give a lot of freedom - you can tackle puzzles on your own, or you can ask for a lot of hand holding via the skip and hint features it employs.  The same, despite being a HOG, alos gives you the option of skipping most of the actual HOG elements by supplying a domino game that you can play instead.\n\nDefinately two thumbs up from me.","September 26, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The staging is nice, good music, not in any way challenging puzzles (but that's expected) and a reasonable story.\n\nThis time there is a twist on the hidden object parts - if you don't fancy them you can play with dominoes instead (and you can actually flip between modes - for example using dominoes to pick up a few items you can't find or switching back to hidden object mode to find items you aren't going to be able to reach with your dominoes.\n\nIt's worth noting that the achievements include the bonus chapter in things like completing all hidden object puzzles without hints so don't expect them to pop at the end of the story. You'll also need at least two playthroughs to get the dominoes and HO achievements (as that's an either or choice). If you mix between them while you play and keep track, the game also does so you can fill in the blanks on your next playthrough. Or if you're me, completely forget and end up playing through three times.\n\nThe game did start to run decidedly slowly with big pauses by the time I hit the third run through.\n\nAs for the girly elements. Well you gain a ridiculously cute kitten as a sidekick. I mean really just insanely adorable. Would like to have seen it used more. *shifty look*  It's also definitely a romance. You will also have to solve such puzzles as  reassembling jewelry, applying makeup, flower arranging, ironing - not to mention the obligatory moments where during your life or death adventure your heroine suddenly refuses to do something because ...eww cobwebs/bugs/vermin. Such moments always make me want to kick the heroine. Luckily for the most part she remains reasonably resourceful and not overly whiny.\n\nAll in all a great example of this genre.

Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the sound, ambiance music really sets a mood. The most important thing is of course the puzzles, which offers a good variety, Personally, this is more of a Adventure/Puzzle game than a hidden object game. If you're looking for a "real" hidden object game, like the early Big Fish titles, then you might be dissapointed, because this offers a lot more than that. For me though, it was a delight with variety. The story was ok, even if the voice cast was... not so great. But it doesn't matter for me, I played it for the puzzles and I was not dissapointed. The whole map system is great, in which you can travel back to previous scenes. They even mark then map with a "!" if there is anything interacive to do in a specific location, which eliminates one of the more frustrating moment these game usually have, running around to look if there is something to do.

The boulder and cannon screens were the best :D","January 5","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the latter.   The thing, in my opinion, that makes this such an awesome game are the items hidden around the game you can find.  I love collectibles, and it really immerses you into a game when you start searching for them.  You get to look at the beautiful art more and see how cleaver the devs are in how they hide them!.  A+ for this game, I have only 3 unowned artifex games and this one reminds me why.","January 21","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Based on the overall positive reviews I downloaded it in hopes that it would be good for a couple hours of fun. I was quite surprised by the graphics and the story-line. This is the first HOG that I've purchased by Artifex Mundi and I'll certainly be checking out more games from this developer based on the experience we had. I was impressed with the quality of the graphics, the story-line, and even the characters. My step-daughter loved the little kitty helper. The puzzles are not very challenging to an adult, however, the game does offer three different difficulty modes to choose from so if you want more of a challenge go for it! Also, there is enough animation and engaging objects in each scene to inspire you to move forward to see what happens next. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys HOG style games.","July 12, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
