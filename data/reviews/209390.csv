IF SOMEBODY GIVES YOU A COPY, IT STILL ISN'T WORTH IT!\nThe main problem with this game is that it is a multi-player only game with dead servers. Which means that people paid money to sit in a lobby waiting for somebody to show up. They never do. Save your money and buy Blood Bowl instead, a game with a solid single-player mode AND a healthy multiplayer community.\nAdd into the mix how many teams have been cut out just so they can be sold back to you at a stupid rate, and you have the worst purchase ever on Steam\nEDIT: This review was written before the "Knockout" edition came out "too little, too late"\nI haven't seen the new version because the DRM only allows limited downloads, and since I replaced my PC I've not been able to activate it.

Hey, better late than never right?\nAnd all the DLC is now included for free. What more could you ask for?

I will admit I am glad they got rid of the outrageous dlc and added some ai, but the has changed very little.  The single player is shallow with only allowing the player to choose pre-selected teams with no team custimization of any kind.  The multiplayer online for all intensive purposes is still dead, and the online ai teams kinda break the whole purpose of online multiplayer.

Purchasing it I was initially impressed with the game play but frustrated with the difficulties in finding an opponent.  I made teams to match my tabletop ones which won consistently but here this was not the case.  I pressed on assuming that I did not have the skill and it took me time to get used to the interface.  I eventually realized that my gameplay had little to do with it: the rules were subtlety different and at times broken, such as game duration limit and no blitzing off a teleport.  The final blow for me was the Dwarven Deathroller which in my opinion is so broken that I have caught myself swearing at my monitor at least forty times.  All other "big guys" have a detriment skill like take root, really dumb, etc. but not this beast.  I calculated that teams I played against that did not have a Deathroller, I won >65% of games while if they did have one, I would win less than 20% of the time.\n\nWhy not make a team with a Deathroller, Trou?  My answer: why not make a game that is at least reasonably balanced?\n\nI am able to look passed a lot of this game's flaws that are stated here in these accurate reviews but combined together with this diarrhea on top, I would not recommend this game even if you love the table top version like I do.\n\nJepumk said it best: it is a poorly realized version of the table top game.","May 1, 2014","false","120.8"," 61 of 72 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","61","72","0","1"

Which it is not.\n\nthis is a complete crap for many reasons.\n\n1) It's an online-only game, no single player or AI of any sort, there's not even a tutorial, nothing. you sit in the lobby waiting for a player to show up for hours, and when it does, the connection is bugged and the challenge system doesn't work.\n\n2) the game itself is just bloodbowl with walls. good? nope. because the nice and functional free camera that worked as a charm in bloodbowl, here is cramped and unfunctional. you will not understand a ♥♥♥♥ of what is going on in the match, because there will always be a wall in your way.\n\n3) the game comes with a super-♥♥♥♥♥♥ third-party DRM which gives you a total of 3 activations. this means that if you uninstall this game 3 times, the 4th time you can just throw it in the toilet, because it won't work.\n\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS ♥♥♥♥.

The short version and all that you probably care about is the fact that... it SUCKS!!!  Ok, with that said you can stop reading or continue if you want details.  First off, this game is online, LAN, or hotseat only.  No singleplayer.  Yep, Multiplayer only.  Also the interface is terrible, the sound is underwhelming, and the dungeon creator is abhorrent.  The only redeeming factor seems to be that the character models are interesting.  I am a fan of Cyanide and enjoy Games Workshop, but this game is crap.  The only thing keeping me from being disappointed in this game is the fact that I got it as part of a Bundlestar deal where I paid less than $1.00 USD for it.","March 26, 2014","false","0.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"
