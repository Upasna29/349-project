The campaign is very short, the card mechanics are too reliant on sacrificing cards to boost your creatures, no deck building and the scenarios are always stacked against you.  That second item (saccing cards) really ruined the game for me.  I have no problem with playing cards to give you bonuses but what you are doing here is not casting a spell.  You just discard it and your creature gets a bonus.  Many, many battles are won by who can sacrifice the most.  Not fun at all.  With some tweaking this could have been a good game but it falls short.  You are better off spending your time and money elsewhere in my opinion.","December 14, 2013","false","24.1"," 71 of 79 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","71","79","0","0"

Each stage in this game drags out for what it seems like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eternity, models and animations are plain ugly, the outcome of battles is overly dependant on the luck of the draw and thus AI tends to gain unfair advantage here and there, all resulting in a really frustrating and daunting gameplay. Zero strategy, no deck builder, not fun. No multiplayer, no replay value, no involvement with the story either (was there even one?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/90500/","strategikal","Strategikal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/","1935 products in account","Guardians of Graxia is an innovative strategy card game that offers a detailed tactical challenge on a battle map, combined with the random element of card draws. The strategy is quite deep and not immediately obvious. You can't expect to jump in and play it well without first learning how the game works. Once you understand the mechanics though, it's easy enough to play, but not so easy to win! This is a hard game, which might put some people off, but for those that love a hard challenge, it can be very rewarding.\n\nI must admit, when I read the other reviews, I was shocked to see so many negative comments, which is why I felt compelled to add this review of my own. Looking at those reviews, I noticed that many of them were by people who haven't put many hours into the game. Since it takes quite a while to master, I suspect that a lot of the negativity came from not playing it long enough to figure out the best strategies.\n\nI'd like to address some of the points made in other reviews:\n\nOverly complicated - Yes, it seems that way at first, there is a bit of a learning curve involved, but it's not that hard once you get used to it. The in-game help tells you all you need to know, you just need to take the trouble to read it. As for "ridiculously complicated" units with many different abilities, that's a good thing. It creates a lot of variety in the game, making the strategy more complex and interesting.\n\nTrouble Man said that the game doesn't explain the number crunching, but it does. When in battle, there's a small arrow underneath Projected Health. Click this and it shows you the Damage Calculations. All the modifiers are listed to help you understand exactly what's going on in the battle.\n\nLuck not Strategy - Not true! Sure, there's a lot of luck in which cards you draw, but hey, it's a card game, that's kind of the whole point! But once you've drawn your cards, what you do with them is pure strategy. There's nothing random in the combat calculations, it depends entirely on which cards are played. Of course, you don't know what cards the computer will play during the battles, but that's not luck, it's making strategic choices based on the cards it has available.\n\nJust as the computer can ruin your attack by playing a powerful card, you can do exactly the same if you have one. Choosing which cards to play and which to save until later is a big part of the strategy. Tip: make feint attacks with unimportant units to force the computer to waste valuable cards, then make your important attacks with your best cards later, once the computer is out of good cards to defend with.\n\nAnother important aspect of the strategy are terrain effects and unit special abilities. Place units on tiles they gain an advantage on, not on ones that give them a disadvantage. Surround enemy units to gain support advantages. Capture many tiles quickly to increase your mana generation. There's loads of strategic possibilities on the battlefield.\n\nHard AI, scenarios stacked against you - This is true. It's not an easy game, but if it were then it wouldn't be much of a challenge. It's a pity there aren't more easy scenarios or different difficulty levels to make it easier for new players, but that's just the way it is. It may seem daunting at first, but it gets easier once you figure out the best strategies. People often criticise the AI for being too easy in many games, so it makes a nice change that this AI offers a hard challenge. If that scares you, then don't buy it, but if you love a hard strategical challenge, this may be for you.\n\nTurn limits - Some people don't like this, but again, it's all part of the challenge. If you had unlimited turns it would make the game too easy. You'd just grab most of the tiles, get most of the mana and simply out-produce the AI. Besides, many people complain about the slow turns, so do you really want the game to go on for even longer?\n\nSlow Turns - True, this can be annoying. I wish there were a way of speeding them up. But it's not the end of the world. You can always watch TV or do something else while the AI is taking its turn, or check your Facebook page, or whatever...\n\nStory? What story? This is a strategy game! Who cares about story! :-)\n\nSome reviewers compared the game to Magic the Gathering. Why? Because it's a fantasy game and it has cards? As I see it, this game is nothing like MtG, the game mechanics are completely different. IMO, this is more of a turn based strategy game than a card game. If MtG is what you are expecting, think again.\n\nSaint Killjoy said "don't ignore the bad reviews, they were given for a reason" - That sounds fair enough, but I suspect that the two main reasons for the bad reviews are:\n\n1. Having the wrong expectations about the game - perhaps thinking it will be like MtG, or thinking it will be easy because it's a card game. Don't buy it based on what you think or hope it will be like, buy it based on what it is. Check out some YouTube videos first.\n\n2. Not playing it for long enough to figure out the best strategies. Yes it's hard, but you shouldn't give up too easily or pass judgement too soon. Good strategy games often take a long time to master.\n\nMy advice would be this: Make up your own mind about this game based on the kind of games that YOU like to play, not on the opinions of others who often have different tastes in games.\n\nI'm not saying that everyone should like and buy this game. I'm sure that there are many people who would hate it. But for those that enjoy challenging turn based strategy against a hard AI, with some card based randomness thrown in, I highly recommend it. Just be sure that you know what you're letting yourself in for.\n\nFor the current sale price, it's a no brainer IMO. And even if you don't like it, you won't have lost much. But if you do buy it, make sure to buy both DLCs as well. There are only 9 maps in the base game. The DLCs add another 16 maps (some of which generate random terrain) and two more guardians, providing a lot more replayability.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nPROS:\nChallenging and deep turn based strategy.\nHuge variety of special abilities.\nCard based randomness ensures that every game is different.\nBattles are quite hard.\n\nCONS:\nGameplay seems a bit complex at first.\nIt takes a while to figure out the best strategies.\nSlow AI turns.\nBattles are quite hard.","January 9, 2014","true","17.7"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","2"

I get the basic mechanics but the details are not available in an explanation anywhere, such as what does a portal do and how do I use it?\n\nI've done my years playing trading card games and I get they can be very complicated. So big fail on getting the player up to speed on the details of the mechanics, but I don't mind learning by experimenting if I have to, if the reward is a fun game.\n\nThen drops the other shoe\n\nThe problem with experimenting to learn the mechanics is that the game moves so slow for every little thing. Then, the UI works, but interacting with it is painful. Like if you click the wrong card, does ESC back you out or right click? Because one works in one situation and doesn't in another.  Overall it just becomes frustrating.\n\nThen I get to the 2nd scenario and the huge giant just pummels my guys from afar with boulders (8 wounds jeeze) and 2 of the units they gave me, at the opposite end of the board no less, are dead within the first 2 turns. I still don’t know how to use portals, and it seems it would be useful here but it doesn’t work.\n\nThis is when I realize:\n\n1) After 2 rounds and 2 hours, I don't know how to play this game well enough to compete even with a bad AI.\n\n2) Trying to fight with bad UI, lack of any kind of decent instructions and the punishingly slow game progress is simply a waste of my time.\n\n3) This game was probably a waste of money.\n\nI say probably, because the strategic board game/TCG hybrid is interesting to me and is in my niche. It is conceivable that if I knew how to play it, I could get past all the bad (though the bad is terrible), and get some of my money's worth out of the game.\n\nI hated Blood Bowl when I first played but, after watching some experts play through it, I got it and I ended up enjoying the game. Maybe this game could be that, but there is no such walkthrough to watch, no wiki to read, nothing.\n\nSkip this game or trade it instead of activating it on Steam.","February 28, 2014","false","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Maybe more appealing to the older gamers from the generation that played this type of game out of a box rather than the young 'uns.\n\nSome bad reviews have been posted about this game criticising it's lack of deck building and difficulty. This is a bit unfair as it's not a deck building game it's a board game. It may not be perfect and, to be honest, it is quite difficult to get the hang of it and win but that's not to say it's a bad game though especially for the £1.50 sale price. Gameplay does feel agonisingly slow if you haven't got a good deal of patience and maps can take a while to get through. The odds always seem to favour the other side with their seemingly huge mana pools but once you figure out how to play it I found there was fun to be had there and actualy enjoy it.\n\nA lack of tutorials is one cause for complaint but if you take the time to look at the unit cards, terrain bonus stats/penalty modifiers and battle stats it soon makes more sense. Almost (if not) all the icons can be moused over to get a description of what they mean. Adjacent units give you a support bonus, mana is generated by the squares you control (some generate more than others) and this pays for your spells and units. Difficulty arises because mana is generated at the end of your turn and if you blow it all countering battles in your opponents turn you have none left for your own fights or to activate some unit's special abilities. Sometimes it's worth taking a bit of pain so you've got the resources to dish it out on your turn.\nThe biggest missed opportunity is the lack of multiplayer. This game is crying out for a head to head mode which would've made it a more balanced and fun experience as well as adding to it's replay value.\n\nAll in all it may be an aquired taste appealing to a certain type of gamer but it's not as bad as a lot of the negative reviews would have you believe.","July 11, 2011","true","25.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The player takes cards from their deck, plays them onto a 3-D map and uses other cards in hand to cast spells etc. Combat is resolved using melee, ranged and spell attacks, where unwanted cards can be sacrificed for power. The two phases of play that constitute one turn is hard for a n00b to get their head around since the tutorial is rubbish. At the end of the day, the game is just not that much fun to play (for me at least). There is only 5 campaign missions and a few skirmish maps to play.

While I'm not a card based game fan, I am a strategy fan. Not having to build my own deck was actually a good thing for me as I'm not into that sort of thing.\nThe campaign is pretty hard getting guardian victories, but it's possible. It took me several hours for each campaign and quite a few hours for the whole campaign. For a completionist like me it was a very stupid thing decided by the designers to make an impossible to complete guardian victory on the last level, and not because of the difficulty, but because of the mechanics.\nAnd of course the odds are stacked against you at every pace, this is a strategy game. In every command and conquer game the odds are stacked against you.\nOverall, I liked the game and I would recommend it. It involves playing your cards right, keeping the important ones and sacrificing the ones that are actually meant to be sacrificed. And even to this day I'm not entirely sure the card drawing is randomized. To me it seemed fixed or at least following a certain pattern, always leaving you room for a win.","January 9, 2014","true","56.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This was more of an in-joke for my friends. So here's a proper review:\n\nGuardians of Graxia is a single player turn-based deck combat game undone by three things: (1) clunkiness, (2) a lack of polish or support (last patch was in 2010), and (3) you don't get to build or edit the decks. Which means you have no control over the decks.\n\nAs you can see by my hours played, I was getting pretty into this. It's sort of like Magic: The Gathering but you can actually see representations of the units and terrain on a tactical board! That's a cool idea, right? It's a decent reason to buy the game, and at first it was enough despite the overral generic-ness and low-res models and textures.\n\nThe campaign is simple: Fight a scenario with the deck the designers have given you. There's no option to peek at the deck the designers gave you ahead of time. Instead, as you play you will find out what is in the deck (hope you like surprises). You will also find out your opponent has (opponent generally has a stronger deck and will smash your face in). Most likely, you will fail the scenario the first 3 or so times. After you beat it, you will get moved to a tougher and more elaborate scenario. Repeat, presumably, until the end of the game. I was mainly enjoying the challenge because the scenarios are hard. The AI isn't necessarily smart, but it starts with a board position advantage, a better deck, and more units in play. That was what kept me playing. I like hard games and was enjoying the challenge. It didn't feel too unfair to me to be unenjoyable.\n\nHowever, things started to get *too* complicated, and this is where the clunkiness and lack of polish start to become problems. By, I think, the third level (forgive me, it's been years) it was apparent that most animations are stilted and take a long time to finish, and you can't skip them or speed them up. There are a lot of animations, and you will be watching them over and over. (Remember, unless you are a gaming demigod expect most levels to take multiple attempts while you learn the deck and wait for a lucky starting draw.) The camera is equally to blame for gameplay being interrupted with slow, unskippable moments. It slowly pans over to whatever unit the AI is currently moving, then you wait for it to move the unit (and maybe the unit casts some spells... which also have slow animations), then the camera pans back, then it pans to the next unit, repeat. Once you start talking upwards of 20 enemy units, each enemy turn takes a while.\n\nThe next level added even more enemy units. Now we're talking 40 or so at the start. And it had an intro sequence with those same slow animations that took over a minute to finish. If you lose the level, which you probably will, you'll have to watch it again. And it also introduced another feature: Random crashes to desktop.\n\nI did eventually beat that level to be rewarded with more of the same: A longer, even more elaborate intro sequence (at least 2+ minutes), even more enemy units, new equally slow animations, an increasing number of random crashes to desktop, and a new guaranteed crash to desktop. The latter was a game killing bug for me, and I was unable to beat the level because of it. It's a repeatable sequence which the AI will always do sooner or later, that will always crash the game. It's possibly related to Nvidia graphics drivers or a corrupted install. I don't think it's related to my graphics card because I've tried it with the 3 cards I've had since then and it's the same problem--those cards being an 8800 GT, a GTX 460, and a GTX 670). The game has received no patches in the 4-5 years since I last played it in 2011, and still crashes for me at that spot. I literally cannot progress. Note that the final v1.5 patch from 2010 claims it fixes this problem. It's still an issue for me, sadly, but you may have better luck.\n\nOther thoughts:\nGuardians of Graxia appears to be made by a small studio in Eastern Europe, and I feel bad for not being able to recommend it more unreservedly. With a little more bug testing and polish, this could have been a fine game. As it is, I can only give a "buyer beware" recommendation. If you really like turn-based fantasy games, like CCG experiences sort of like Magic but don't care about deck building, have a lot of time and patience to burn, and are willing to take a chance on a game killing bug stopping your progression, this is the game for you.\n\nAlso, there's a lot of DLC. So be aware.\n\nSuggestions for alternative games:\n* If you want the turn-based fantasy battle part but not the deck part, I recommend the Age of Wonders series, the Disciples series, Heroes of Might and Magic II, Heroes of Might and Magic III, or Solium Infernum (not currently on Steam). Unlike Graxia, they all have a much less generic fantasy "feel" because they have actual world building their own unique voice. They also have world maps, which Graxia does not.\n* If you want a similar fantasy feel but don't mind RTS, try the Warlords Battlecry series. They're all great.\n* If you want a CCG deck building game where you can see your units, try PoxNora. It's F2P, so do your research first.\n* If you don't care about seeing your units, try Magic the Gathering online (not on Steam). It has old graphics, is clunky and a money sink, but has better balance than Graxia. Most importantly, it works, and there are plenty of online opponents.\n* If you want to play an actual physical deck building card game, Fantasy Flight has made/revived some good ones over the past few years. NetRunner is my current favorite, although it's cyberpunk and not fantasy. Magic is, of course, the elephant in the room.\n\nTrivia: I believe I first started playing this during a Steam summer or Christmas sale event (2011?) where this was one of the event games, but I don't remember anymore. I had to farm potatoes for Half-Life 3 to come out faster! We can see how well that turned out. ;(","December 27, 2011","true","28.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"
