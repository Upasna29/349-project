Don't let the big red square in the top left of this review fool you into being defensive. I LOVE this game, probably more than any of you reading this review. That being said let's talk about the one, ONE problem with this perfect game.\n\nThe Problem:\nIt's dead, man.\n\nThe Good:\nFor all of you who don't know, Strike Vector is a dogfighting game as fast paced as you see in the trailers. Speaking of which, the trailers do a good job describing the game: The graphics are pretty, the action is tense, there is aesthetical customization. On combat, there are varied weapons,  passive abilites and "use once every so often" abilities like cloaking and a huge speed boost. (8 of each) The other positive reviews explain that in more detail, so I won't waste your time and regurgitate said information.\n\nThat being said, the game is HARD to learn. Basically you have to get used to the controls, master switching harrier and jet forms, get used to flying in tight corridors, and ONLY then can you hope to face others in pvp. You'll still get creamed a few times, but if you need advice, just type something in chat and they would tell you.\n\nSure it was frustrating back then when everybody was better than you, but they would be nice and try to be helpful. THE COMMUNITY WAS HELPFUL, MAN. A PvP (As in dead flipping serious, "you are not rewarded for messing around") game where the fighting is intense had a helpful community. That to me, is amazing.\n\nThe Bad:\nBut nowadays, there isn't a community. I, (and you included) could open up the game, click on the servers tab, and find for the amount of players on each server, ZERO across the board. Sure, some people will comment, "That is rediculous, just the other day I was playing and there were five servers with a moderate amount of people." I have NEVER seen that many people other than when i first got the game: 2 months ago, specifically April 12. (As you may tell, the other review are way before or around this time, so at most the main problems were bugs and there is no mention of a dead playerbase.) Even then the playerbase was shrinking and nowadays its maybe one person on a server for an hour. Just to humour those people, however, lets do the math; A server usually has 16 players max, but "a moderate amount of people" suggests it would be roughly half or 3/4 full. So lets say per server there is an average of 10 people. Times that by 5 and what do you get? A playerbase of 50 people. Ladies and gentlemen, that's not much, at all. It's certainly not fitting for a AAA game that this is. Morrowind has a bigger playerbase, Duke Nukem has a bigger playerbase, even MOTHER FLIPPING Ace of Spades has a bigger playerbase. Also please take into account that the figure is outdated by two months and nowadays its one guy on one server flying around for an hour and leaving.\n\nThe Fix:\nSo this is surprising; Usually you have a crummy, unoriginal, game that doesn't have a player base no matter HOW much advertising they do, but in this case it's the opposite. You have an awesome game that hasn't done much advertising. The only way I found out about this game was because my friend had it, and because it went on sale for like two days. Ideally, they do more advertising, people realize how cool and original this game is, the devs have a large playerbase and víola! You have a successful game.\n\nI'm no expert, but as a person who buys games, (you are one of these too), I really like Steam sales, also anything on the "Featured" page on the store catches my eye. Sure, advertising costs money, but if they do both of these things, they will have an actual playerbase, become deservingly popular, and attract more people. Haven't you ever seen the, "put a dollar in the jar and people will come trick?"People like popular things.\n\nThe Tl;Dr:\nIt's dead right now, so don't pay 12 dollars for a AAA multiplayer game with no other players.\n\nUpdate:\nSo I've done some dedicated server checking and the figures are still low. Sometimes they're in the tens, twenties, even fifties of players but this is usually right after a sale and the number drops off quite quickly. The average of the entire server population is still below ten if not absolute zero which it usually is, so I still can't delete this review.\n\n2) Contrary to popular belief, tricking people into buying a game is not the right way to increase server population. People are throwing around really cool ideas in the forums like singleplayer, better customization, co-op challenges and other neat stuff that would not only make this a fuller game but also keep people playing. The devs also make a few comments here and there. You should check it out and give the game and the forums some love.\n\nAlso, my review just happens to have magically disapeared from the store page, so I figured it was as good of a time as it could be to update the review.","June 3, 2014","false","4.5"," 791 of 929 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","791","929","0","56"

Be warned, beta is beta. Servers crash frequently, and there are frequent glitches with the menus. For instance, after being boot out of a game due to a crashed server, you must restart it to play again. But all that aside...\nTHE GAMEPLAY IS AMAZING. It plays like a dream! The ability to swap between Jet and Harrier modes on the fly is an incredible boon, and it makes dogfights fast-paced and intense, and extremely enjoyable. You have two weapon slots, and there are about a half dozen weapons to choose from, and you get to mix and match as you want. Each weapon has two slots for perks, as well. Two weapons, two perks each, and a ship perk, and a special ability, all creates excellent diversity, and it should cater to anyone's playstyle. Did I mention you have 3 loadout slots so you can save several of these combinations that you can swap from every time you die? You can even change them before you jump back in.\nVisually, it's impressive. There's not much that stands out, but I love the machinery/factory look of all the menus and screens. One minor gripe I have is that certain menu prompts are unclear. They don't stand out very much and it's easy to skip over them because they're so small. For instance, at first I didn't even realize you were able to fly on the maps solo, because the button to do that was buried in the tutorial section, and was a very, very small button along the top of the screen. The ships themselves are customizable visually, and have patterns and a full color spectrum to choose from for each main section of your ship. There's a bit of texture pop-in, and some things look a little bit muddy, and it's obvious to see a lot of stand-in art and text in places, but overall it's not bad.\nSound overall is decent. The weapons and flight sound great, very meaty where it counts. Explosions are visceral, too. Though I would love a little more feedback in some places, such as when switching between flight and harrier mode. There were some times while in a match where I was off to the side, menus open adjusting options, and the game was silent. I think it could stand to have a little more realism in its sound. Basically I mean that it should echo more; I should hear the fights going on all across the map. I don't believe there should ever be silence in a game like this. Music! There's no in-game music, and if there is, it was brief, and I didn't notice it. The title theme is pretty cool, however the menus afterward... it's monotonous and could stand to be changed or improved. I don't like it much. So aside from minor complaints, it's great where it counts!\nI could see myself playing this very much, spending a lot of my extra time here. I await the ability to host my own games in-client, or to be able to play offline against AI or over LAN, but such features do not yet exist. I'm glad I'm at least able to fly around the maps on my own without needing to connect. There's not much to do save practice flying around and shooting at nothing, but it's a nice add-in. With a plethora of unlockables, including ship parts and decals and patterns, and stuff for my pilot's profile, plus the simple matter that it's so damn fun to play, there's plenty of reason to come back to it again and again.\nTo conclude, it's fast paced, it's exciting, it's fun as hell. Lots to choose from, fun to play, lots of potential. Beta is beta, though. Gameplay gets a solid 9/10, Aesthetic and design and visuals gets an 8/10, sound gets a 6/10, lasting appeal/replay value: I-will-be-losing-so000oooOOOOoo-many-hours-to-this-beastie/10\nOverall, in its current beta state: 7.5/10, with a BADASS SEAL OF APPROVAL!","January 13, 2014","true","6.2"," 380 of 455 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","380","455","0","9"

Every time I play, there is only one active server, ever. For this reason, I cannot recommend the game, being that it is a strictly PvP title. This game is truly an amazing gem, and is insanely entertaining to play, but the developers appear to have spent approximately zero dollars on marketing, and this keeps the player base at almost extinct levels. If elbowing your way into one, solitary server to play is not a deal-breaker for you, then by all means buy this game. Save for this one game-breaking, negative point, the game is absolutely worth paying even full price for.

Because I think this game deserves more players. Let’s get started.\n\nStrike Vector is the quickest game I’ve played both in the Shooter Genre but also in Aerial Combat. It mixes Tribes and SpaceCowboys (AKA: Ace Online(AKA: AirRivals)) very well. Because of the high speed good reflexes are needed. You will often chase someone who deploys mines to get rid of you, if you’re too slow to hit Harrier Mode, more about Harrier Mode later, or activate your shield you’ll turn into a burning uncontrollable wreckage that shoots trough the sky at high speed and crash into an object. Or if you can aim carefully into another player, your killer perhaps. Hit detection is also well done in this game, when you collide with something you’re most likely death, but there are exceptions: When you collide with something in Harrier Mode (again more about harrier mode later) you most likely take some damage or no damage at all, unless you collide head on (which rarely happens). Also if you try to pick up a cool down or some health (which often floats above object or the ground) you might bump the ground, if you do this from a too steep angle you’re dead, but doing this in an angle (similar to how a plane lands or maybe even a sharper angle) you will grind over the ground (you will take damage overtime) but you’re not dead and you’ll get the repair/cooldown you aimed for. Why I’m telling you this? Well Now you know you don’t need to be exactly aligned in a straight line to the pick-ups to be able to get them and survive when the float on the ground. It also kind off shows why I think the hit registration is great. Hit registration by shooting is like any shooter that properly detects hits (looking at you CS:GO).\nEvery weapon, weapon modifications, perks and abilities are unlocked from the start.. What’s left to unlock? The Cosmetics: Decals, ship parts, thumbnails, concept arts and camouflage. This gives new players an equal start in gear and still have items to level up for.\nYour Vector has 2 modes: Striker mode and Harrier mode.\nStriker mode is the normal dogfighting mode, you fly fast and are highly manoeuvrable. Ready to fly in narrow passages to shoot rockets at your target where to knockback causes your enemy to collide into the walls and you’re being able to watch the explosion from your rear-view, just like in the movies.\nHarrier mode will instantly stop your ship and let it float around, you’re slow in this mode. But it allows you to fully stop your ship and perform more accurate shots. Harrier mode is often used as breaks to prevent head on collisions or to make a sharp turn. Try to juggle in both modes and you’ll be able to master flying in no time.\n\nThere is only 1 flaw in this game: Weapon balancing, some weapons and abilities are way to powerful. 2 shots with Swarm or Homing missiles (2 flaws in this game actually: Lock-on weapons) and you’re dead. Also the Stalker mine’s activation time is way too fast, if someone drops it in front of your nose while you chase him you’re dead for sure.\n\n\nOverall Rating: 87 out of 100.\n\nAlso did I mention the free monthly content updates they add instead of paid DLC?\nI hope this was enough to convince you to buy this game.","April 3, 2014","true","22.0"," 60 of 77 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","60","77","0","1"

From what ive seen its either Level 1-10's or level 45+'s disscourages the level 1-10's wanting to actually play this game, as a skilled player will absolutely dominate the lobbies.\n\n\nOverall this game is great, the controls are fluid, visuals are pretty, However with the current playerbase i cant recommend this game to anybody. As far as im concerned maybe if they switched to free to play, they could regain their lost playerbase. Or if durring any of the steam sales this game would go lower than half price 6$, as ive had my eye on this game for a while however it needs a good kick in the playerbase. Either an extremely low sale (2-3) dollars on steam. Or no price tag at all.\n\n(UPDATE) : I failed to mention when i originally wrote this review that being a higher level grants no unlocks or advantages over the level 1 players. Being a higher level only unlocks cosmetics.\nAlso failed to mention there are no bots just some single player training stages with things to blow up.\nThere has been an effort by a group that schedules meet up times for each region in hopes of boosting player count for that time which is nice. Its sad to see a small trend of competitive shooters like this with very low price tags that have little to no player base. ( Another example of this being Toxikk ) Since my initial review this game has dropped in price a few times to less than 5 dollars but that has only been a temporary fix. Unfortunately the number of players shows no signs of increasing anytime soon. In my opinion the only solution would be to make the game a free to play.\n\nhttp://steamcharts.com/app/246700","January 25, 2015","false","17.6"," 101 of 143 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","101","143","6","8"

Strike Vector is hands down one of the fastest shooters out there with unsurpassed freedom of movement and speed. It requires some practice to get down but it's an absolute blast once you do. Customization is handled wonderfully, with players having access to everything non-cosmetic from the beginning and acquiring cosmetic parts, paintjobs, and decals as they level up. As someone who doesn't care for progression all that much I think they've found a good balance. The maps are great too, with each one being rated on how deadly they are to traverse. Anyone can go fast, but weaving through the innards of an airborne oil refinery at full afterburn isn't something just anyone can do. There are only two complaints I have, the size of the community and the lack of lag compensation. Lack of lag compensation wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't confined to playing on a european server half the time, but that's just the thing, at best I've seen two and a half servers worth of people playing. Personally, Strike Vector is probably one of the best shooters I've played. It'd make any other fast paced competitive shooter look like a snoozefest but I have a hard time recommending it because without other players there really isn't much you can do. If you've got some friends get the four-pack, at least you'll all be able to enjoy it together.  oh and the music is ♥♥♥♥ing great.","November 1, 2014","true","32.1"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","36","42","4","0"

Strike Vector is amazing, expecially considering it's made by a team of nine people, and that it is currently in Beta.\n\nUnlike your average FPS, like Call Of Duty or Battlefield, you start the game with all gameplay elements unlocked, giving you complete freedom to do what you want straight away. This also creates an almost level playing field for all players, as the only advantage you start with is your skill level. Using this customization system, you can create a massive amount of effective classes. There are six weapons to choose from, with different advantages and disadvantages, and each can take two of four to seven perks, such as accuracy or damage. You get one overall perk for your Vector, which can give you extra speed in Jet or Harrier mode, or extra defense. You get a special ability, such as Mines, or Turbo-Boost, which can only be used every thirty seconds. This system allows for a massive amount of 'classes' to choose from. You can use a balanced combat fighter, with a Gatling Gun and Swarm Launcher (each with Damage and Fire Rate perks), Mines, and Saurian. You could also create a specialist sniper class, with Plasma Guns (with Accuracy and Fire Rate), Cloak, and Copernicus. The system is amazing.\nAt the end of each game, you get XP, which levels you up, and unlocks new cosmetic items, such as ship camos, cockpits, engines, decals, thumbnails for your playercard (you start off with a pretty rainbow), and game artwork.\n\nThere are four game modes: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Domination, and Bounty Hunter. TDM and DM are very similar to your average shooter TDMs and DMs. You get points for getting kills. Domination works similarly to the game mode of the same name within Call Of Duty. Bounty Hunter, however, is very unique. Each time you get a kill, you get money (officially called Bounty). The player with the most Bounty at the end of the game wins, obviously. Each time you are killed by an enemy player, they get most of your bounty. If you crash, your money is dropped as floating '$'s, which can be picked up by you, or another player.\n\nDuring any game mode, Drones will enter the map, which fly around and can be destroyed for one of three Bonus Crates. These Crates are also deployed randomly by fixed Dispensers on the map. To obtain the Crate, you must simply fly through it. The blue Crates (Strike Shield) make you almost invulnerable for about thirty seconds. Which can be quite effective. Enter Harrier mode while using it, and hound enemy players as they try to kill you, taking one or two points of damage at a time, for easy kills. Be careful though, as you still crash just as easily. Red Crates (Strike Damage) boost your damage. Yellow Crates massively increase the speed of your Vector, while also increasing your Fire Rate and reload speed.\n\nOf course, there are bugs in the game. Small ones (sometimes you'll be crash, but the scoreboard will say that you were killed by another player), and some very big, and annoying ones. Firstly (this isn't necessarily a bug), many are finding that the game won't start. Launching will open the Steam preperation window, the close almost straight away. This can be fixed quite easily by going to C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\StrikeVector\Binaries\Redist and opening the application there. This will install the application, which is required to play the game. When I did this, my computer restarted to do updates, and I had to do it again. After doing this, the game opens fine.\n\nThere is, however, one very annoying bug. In the first hour and a half (roughly) of playing the game, was constantly disconnected from online games, but the game worked fine in a practice session. I played through it, as I greatly enjoyed the small amounts of time I was able to play. Eventually, the I was able to play full games without being disconnected, since after that first hour and a half of mayhem, I have only been disconnected two or three times during a total of probably five hours gameplay. The wait was definitely worth it.\n\nI think this is something to do with my computer, but after about a half-hour of playing, the game freezes and I have to Ctrl-Alt-Delete out and open task manager to go to the desktop. I will have a text-box saying that the computer has run out of memory and the game must shut down. Closing and re-opening the game works fine, and the 'bug' is fine to work with.\n\nThere are very few things that the dev team could improve upon. For example, combat is VERY loud, but when far away from combat, you can't hear a thing but your engines. Not only is this aesthetically annoying, but also makes the game strategically harder to play, as you can tell where the enemy players are. Creating a slight echo of far-off fighting could improve this greatly. Secondly, there is currently no in-game soundtrack. There is menu music, but it gets repetitive. However, I am sure the dev team and Maravers, the teams hired music producer, are working on this.\n\nAgain I think this game is amazing. For a long time now, I've been looking for something likes this, an online aerial combat game, but even then, I didn't expect anything like this. The game is far above my expectations. Play this game, even just to experience something different.\n\nI'm giving this game a 9/10.","January 19, 2014","true","16.7"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","37","49","0","0"

It’s an extremely fun game. It’s fast-paced and plays like an arena shooter. The game is by no means a graphical masterpiece, but it looks and sounds great.\n\nLike I said before, this game is extremely fun. And a bit addicting, that is if you’re into flight games. I even got to play with some of the developers, and they’re extremely fun to talk to. Whether you’re into obliterating the opposition with rockets and mines, shredding the competition with Gatling guns or shotguns, or taking aim and coming out on top with the plasma gun, you’ll have fun and get your heart pumping with any play-style.\n\nWhen you think aerial combat, you might think Ace Combat or the more recent, War Thunder, but Strike Vector is more fast paced and intensely aggressive than those. It harkens back to the old days of classic arena shooters, such as Quake. As such, the learning curve is a tad high, but with time anyone can master the game.\n\nThe map design is intuitive and it can play a huge role in each match. The maps range from very compact and great for closed quarters dogfights, to vast open areas with very few places to hide. Despite the variety in size and hiding spots, each map is designed to allow for quick getaways or horrifying accidents for enemies, as well as yourself. So be careful where you turn, you never know what’s around the corner. My suggestion, quickly learn the maps and you’ll do well in most situations.\n\nHow have I not touched on customization yet, it is one of the best parts of the game. You can customize not only your arsenal, but the look of your Vector. You can pick two (left/right) weapons from 8 choices, one specialization out of 7, and one special action out of 8. And don’t forget to choose a color scheme and logo.\n\nThe controls are what you’d expect in a shooter, with minor differences. Controllability on the other hand, is fantastic and manuevering is super responsive. The ability to switch to harrier mode on the fly makes it very easy to turn on a dime and derail the competition. You can even use harrier mode to hide in a corner and wait for your unsuspecting prey or seize the opportunity to take aim with your plasma gun.\n\nThough when it comes to graphics, they’re good, but it’s nothing too special. It’s got some blurry textures up-close, but at least it looks great from a far and while blazing around the map, which is what you’re doing most of the time anyways. It also lacks graphical options, but at least I love the post-apocalyptic ambiance. Aside from the graphics, the sound effects, such as the guitar riffs played throughout the game or the sweet release of a homing missile, are awesome. Each weapon has it’s own unique look, sound and feel.\n\nIf you’re like me, you can play this game constantly just trying to hone your skills. No leaderboard has been implemented as of yet, but I could see one being added very soon. Players are given quite an array of customization to mess around with, so I can’t imagine you getting bored very quickly. Plus they’re going to release free content in the future, for anyone that somehow becomes bored.\n\nThis game is reminiscent of Quake and brings back the classic style of arena shooters, with an aerial twist. At a $25 price tag, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in some fast FPS action, or if you’re just a plain old adrenaline junkie. After all, it is a “fast brutal aerial FPS”, and don’t forget it.\n\nScore: 8.5/10","January 22, 2014","true","34.7"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","30","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeream/recommended/246700/","zeream","Zeream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeream/","160 products in account",":Strike Vector: is the funnest, most competitive, and fastest multiplayer shooter I have ever played.  Nothing tops this game's multiplayer.  It looks awesome, it looks fun, but in reality... its very, very, VERY niche.  I'm gonna tell you right now that this is probably not a game you want to play.\n\n\nIt has wonderful graphics and runs like a charm on my rig.  The game has lots of customization and weapon loadouts, and everything except cosmetic stuff is available from the start.  The weapon loadouts are endless, and of course most outperform others, but there is more than enough variety to always keep the game fresh.  Of course, its not much work to unlock the costmetic stuff either.  Skill really shows in this game, and if you are good you are rewarded for it in spades, and if you can't keep up its painfully obvious.  This game has no hand holding, everything you do in this game is via your own skill and you knowledge of the game mechanics.  Being good at this game is something to be proud of.\n\n\nBUT, this game has one glaring, stupidly big flaw.  The game is so competitive and the skillgap, even if tiny, has such a huge impact on gameplay that most people don't even stick around to play because they simply cannot keep up.  Generally, most of the newbs and unskilled players only last a few days before they get bored or permanently ragequit from getting roasted by the much fewer, yet better players.  However, most of the better players quit because there aren't many people left to shoot.  As such, the game has largely killed itself because its TOO competitive.  This is not a game for casuals in any sense of the word.  Please keep in mind that of all the 100+ thousand people who bought this game, less than a tenth of a percent of them are still playing to this day.\n\n\nReviews give the impression that this game is undesirable because it has low population, but this is misleading.  The gameplay is actually BETTER on low population servers.  Its not a typical shooter where most firefights end up relying on confusion and teamwork.  This is a very personal game, and much of the gameplay is just that; personal.  You will literally be dogfighting individual players 90% of the time you play this game.   This is what the game was designed for and where it excells.  High population servers ruin this however, namely because the combat degenrates into nothing but confusion and nobody can finish kills.  That is not to say it could benefit from more population, because it could, but the low population isn't what is killing the game, its the competitiveness of the game itself.\n\n\nOf course, the game also has other flaws.  If you don't live in East Europe or the United States, chances are your ping will be above 100 when you try to play on any of the sparsley populated servers.  Anything above 100 ping is generally unplayable as you will find enemies teleporting all over the map and you yourself rubberbanding all over the place and randomly crashing into walls.  Likewise, generally anything under 50-60 FPS is considered highly detrimental to this skill based gameplay, especially considering how fast-paced this game is.  Your rig has to be up to date for you to play this game properly.\n\n\nI highly, highly recommend you only play this game if you have played similar dogfighting games.  This is a very new experience, and it is painful to learn.  The learning curve is MASSIVE.  Its a cliff to most people.  It introduces new playstyles and is very, very fast.  But if you like competitive, fast shooters and are GOOD at them, then this will probably be the funnest multiplayer shooter you will ever play.","December 23, 2014","true","295.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toolbear/recommended/246700/","toolbear","toolbear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toolbear/","168 products in account","Update Aug 2, 2014\n\nAs an exclusively multiplayer game, Ragequit squandered their "one big chance" by releasing this game before it was ready. As predicted, months later, after patches have improved the game somewhat, few are playing the game. Not even a spot in the Humble Weekly Bundle was able to breathe new life into the community.\n\nIn my original review (below) I wrote that Strike Vector was "buggy, incomplete, and raw" and should be listed as "Early Access". I wondered if a playerbase would exist by the time the rough edges were polished. It's several months later, has the situation improved? Yes and no. Whilst some of the bugs are fixed, more than half of the ones I found in February remain. I've also discovered new ones. To me this represents an underlying lack of attention to detail and supports my view that the game is unfinished.\n\n* Under "Input Options" distinct controls (still) exist for "Move forward" and "Post-combustion"; these do the exact same thing in game. Both are bound to "W"; if you stick with WASD controls then you can ignore it, but it begs the same question as before: "why the confusing redundancy?"\n* Also under "Input Options" the controls for "Precise aim" and "Rear view" are both bound to "LeftControl". You cannot aim whilst watching your rear, so rebinding is essential if you want precision aiming functionality.\n* Whilst writing this on an early California Saturday evening, there are two servers with 6 of 12 and 3 of 12 players (by the time I finished, it was down to one server with 5 of 12 players). For comparison, I fired up old Quake 3 and found a FFA game with 9 of 16 players (human players, not bots).\n\nNew observatons:\n\n* Initially launches windowed at 800x600 instead of full-screen at native resolution. Interestingly, changing to native resolution followed by full-screen reduces the resolution below native again. So change full-screen first if you want to avoid setting the resolution twice.\n* Uses DX9 instead of DX11. For reference, DX9 and DX11 were released in 2002 and 2009 respectively.\n* binding "Enter" to chat results in chat input revealing itself and dismissing itself immediately. I can obviously infer the defect here, yet in WoW, L4D, and TF2 I can use "Enter" for chat without this problem.\n\nWhile the game has improved since February, and I'd think twice about my demand that it be labelled "Early Access", I still don't recommend this game for the vanishingly small community of players.\n\nOriginal Review Feb 5, 2014\n\nStrike Vector should be sold as Early Access. Core gameplay is nice. The rest is buggy, incomplete, and raw.\n\nAdd a mental "Early Access" tag and disclaimer when considering the asking price. Also consider whether the multiplayer community will exist a few months from now when, presumably, the game will be more polished.\n\nMyself, I didn't appreciate being duped into paying for an open beta.\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nAlthough you can search the forum for numerous bug reports and valid criticisms, here are the specific problems I encountered:\n\n* default keybinding are broken out the gate (remains as of 8/2)\n* server browser is buggy, putting you in random servers if you attempt to sort (fixed)\n* on occassion, I just get a momentary black screen and then I'm out of the game and back to the main menu (fixed)\n* all other interfaces beyond the core game engine feel like an afterthought (remains as of 8/2)\n* keybinding interface is unpolished and buggy (remains as of 8/2)\n* keybinding interface is unavailable in the hangar (fixed)\n* keybinding interface will re-launch you when dead whenever you use left-mouse button to interact with the keybinding UI. When dead, LMB immediately re-launches you. However, this should be disabled whenever I bring up the options UI. (remains as of 8/2)\n* lack of tooltips to explain what certain features are (remains as of 8/2)\n* redundant movement controls: "move forward" and "post combustion" do the same thing, but have two separate key binds (remains as of 8/2)\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nUpon reading other reviews, I learned that many of the aforementioned bugs were known during the beta. If reviewer Rhino is to be believed, Ragequit was deleting forum posts that listed bugs, presumably because the game was launching a week later. So instead of fixing bugs, or delaying the release, or labelling the product Early Access, Ragequit chose deception.","February 5, 2014","false","5.7"," 65 of 104 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","65","104","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/recommended/246700/","Lobinbe","Lob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/","301 products in account","A current trend in the gaming industry, both AAA and otherwise - is to make games try and appeal and be accessible to as large an audience as possible, partly to secure profit margins and partly under the misguided notion that the broader a game's sphere of influence, the better the game is. Strike Vector is in short, a large triumphant middle finger to that notion. Strike Vector is a niche shooter and is bloody well proud of it. Existing in the 6DoF subgenre, it is a brutally-demanding multiplayer arena shooter that subscribes to old school PC gaming multiplayer-standards as opposed to the matchmaking and progression systems of current games. All weapons and other loadout modifications are unlocked straight away, and there is only a straightforward server browser, meaning that anyone can play against anyone else, regardless of their skill level.\n\nThis coupled with the sky-high skill floor of Strike Vector are the main two aspects that make most people refuse to give this game a chance. New players tend to get their asses handed to them very quickly, and only those dedicated enough to put up with the harsh first few hours of play will get any considerable enjoyment from the game; however, those who do manage to ascend the skill floor will find themselves playing an extremely fast, fluid and visceral shooter with a great variety of loadouts, maps, gametypes and veteran players to play against. The matter of fact is that even though detractors claim that this game is dead, it really is not if you are willing to look. There is a small but dedicated community willing to keep this game alive and kicking despite all odds (at least on saturdays).\n\nOne of the reasons why this game is so great is because of what I can only describe as "game feel". The speed certainly contributes to this but it is other factors such as great sound design, visceral gunplay and the fact that the player's ship is relatively small, meaning that you can manuever through almost any gaps in the maps, resulting in some great high-speed chases. The movement is made just as fun as the shooting because of this, and it is the main reason why in my opinion, this game trumps similar games such as Strike Suit Zero, where the player's hitboxes just feel way too big relative to the geometry you should be able to manuever through.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg too, there are so many little nuances to each of the weapons that even I, who has played 100 hours feel like I still have a LOT to learn and uncover, and I still haven't tried a lot of the available loadouts and playstyles.\n\nThese nuances are not perfect though, it does have to be mentioned that Strike Vector is a flawed game in spite of all of its strengths. First and foremost, the server population is indeed low. It seems unfair to blame this on the game, but regardless it is something that can greatly detract from the enjoyment of the game, especially if you are a newer player. Secondly, the weapon balance is not exactly perfect. Most weapons are situational, and are better on some maps than others, but there are certain almost-gamebreaking combinations that can kill the flow of the gameplay, such as dual gatlings with the firerate and range perks, the area of engagement is just too large compared to more situational weapons such as the LMG and swarm missiles. Finally, there is no real means of new players to train for the onslaught they will receive in multiplayer. The in-game tutorial is very rudimentary, and the only single player modes are free flight through the maps on your own, or a few time trials mostly involving shooting near-stationary targets and flying through rings. These can train your movement and accuracy to an extent but not nearly as much as bot matches would, which could also be fun for both newcomers and veterans with the right difficulty configurations. All in all, the shortcomings are clearly prevalent but are not enough to ruin the fundamental fun and good-design at the core of the game's mechanics.\n\nDespite what you've likely been told, it is okay for games to target a niche, instead of going for mass-market appeal and Strike Vector shows that sometimes some of the best games can be made by adopting this attitude. It is true that the game is lacking in server population, and if you are at all interested in this game, you will have to prepare to receive a lot of asskickings and do a lot of reading to have fun, but if you do partake in this, it will almost be certainly worth it when you are able to play alongside veteran players.","March 20","true","103.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","4"

This is basically a Kickstarter but on the Steam store trying to convince you it's a complete game.\n\nOnce there is a full game here, once the community can make maps/mods, and if there are still people playing once all that happens then this will be a great game worth your time and money. Right now you are paying for hope.","February 10, 2014","false","9.2"," 35 of 56 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","35","56","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kt_extinction/recommended/246700/","kt_extinction","KT_Extinction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kt_extinction/","1026 products in account","Competitive Star Fox on crack.\n\nThis game is so. much. FUN. It markets itself as a "Brutal Aerial FPS" which may sound weird at first, but it really does play like a fast paced twitch shooter like Quake but in the sky. And my goodness is it fast paced!\n\nJust a tap on the W key and your diminutive "vector" will zoom forward with a quick burst of its engines, turning the landscape into a blur. It's so fast and overwhelming at first that you'll crash repeatedly the first few times you play this game. And you will most definitely crash. A LOT. This is very disheartening since the scoreboard will track your "suicides" as negative points. I understand why this is the case, it would be too easy to deny kills to your enemies by just suiciding whenever they have an edge on you. However, it does feel pretty crappy to see your team stuck at 1/25 kills needed to win, even though your teamates have made 5 kills your negative score balances it out...\n\nYou need to practice a bit with the game, and there's a solo flight mode where you can get a handle on the controls. After a couple hours you'll feel like a huge badass zipping in and out of the varied machinery ridden maps with reckless abandon, passing centimeters away from certain death. The controls are simple to understand, using only the mouse the direct your flight, and with practice you will feel like a master of the sky, barrel rolls and all. This is the most responsive flight combat game I've ever played. Your vector can engage a hover mode which is designed to let you take precision shots in a stationary position, and you'll find yourself using this mode as a "brake" to navigate difficult areas. If you've seen any gameplay footage of this game, you'll see how fast and fluid the flying looks. It just feels and plays amazing. When you get shot down by an enemy you can still maintain control over your disabled vector for a short while, allowing you to even kill your attacker by kamikazing into him. ♥♥♥♥ing great. I picked this up hoping it would tide me over until Star Citizen's dog fighting module is released, and it is doing a decent job of scratching that particular itch.\n\nEvery weapon, perk, and special ability is available from the get-go, so the only progression comes in the form of cosmetic upgrades. This allows you to specialize in whatever kind of combat you want, whether it be a long range plasma sniper or a close range shotgunner (yes, one of the weapons is a giant shotgun you mount on your airplane). You can dual wield any two weapons you want, so you can either double down and get two snipers (to get that satisfying insta-kill) or wield a gattling gun for chases coupled with swarm missiles for when the target is close. Each weapon also has a couple extra customization options, allowing you to increase damage, range, or even silence (yep, there's silencers too) them accordingly. This means that there's a huge variety of viable combinations that you can use. I personally only use two of the same weapon, however. I don't think my brain can process two different firing rates while zooming around corners at hundreds of miles an hour. Strike Vector really makes you earn your kills, and it's supremely satisfying when you manage to shoot down an enemy.\n\nThis game isn't perfect, however. The server browser is kind of wonky at the moment. When I try to join a game it'll sometimes just put me in a completely random server. The sound design sounds awesome when you're in close combat or dogfighting, but switch to hover mode far away from everything and it turns almost serenely quiet, almost creepily. There's no music at all during the gameplay. It's very jarring to see far off ships flying around blowing each other up in complete silence even though you can clearly see them. This can be remedied by creating a directional sound system so you can hear combat far away. Another problem is that the W key doesn't work when you first play. Imagine my surprise when I first booted up this game, excited to chase enemies down, but my vector just slowly "putt putts" forward no matter how many times I pressed W. Re-binding they key and changing it back seemed to fix it for me, however.\n\nThe developers promise that every single DLC will be free for owners of the game, which is pretty neat. The first content is supposed to be released on Feb. 28.\n\nIf you want "BRUTAL AERIAL COMBAT" this game most definitely delivers that. The gameplay is so addictive and fun it's easy to recommend. Like I said, STAR FOX ON CRACK.","January 29, 2014","true","6.3"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","1"

Strike Vector is an entertaining arena-shooter hailing back to the days of Quake 3 or Unreal Tournement where you duke it out in fully customisable variable geometry fighters through grimey industrial vertically stacked arenas at many fasts per second. Gameplay combines elements of Unreal Tournement arenas, Hawken-esque vehicle combat and a subtle hint of Starfox.\n\nYou'll die at first, a lot, but you'll have a smile doing it, and before long you'll be ploughing other peoples grinning faces into walls instead of being on the recieving end so try not to be put off by the cliff-like learning curve (If you won't jump off a cliff, you are going to get vertigo when you see the arenas)\n\nLike most arena shooters the game is perfect for being able to step in or out and have 10 or 20 minutes of fast-paced action with no commitments (A lost art in today's gaming with dailies and grind that punishes players for not religiously playing their one game), though persistance rewards new skins and customisation options for your ship.\n\nSadly, the community right now seems to be lacking numbers, but perhaps word of mouth might help that.\n\nIt's worth remembering how that this is a PvP arena game, if you have a PvP allergy, or just dislike the genre, then it's unlikely this game will do anything for you. But if you miss the "good old days" then this is a blast from the past","June 22, 2014","true","7.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaerock/recommended/246700/","xaerock","xaerock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaerock/","160 products in account","Strike Vector is a fusion of space combat game (Freespace, Descent etc) and FPS with a high skill ceiling. If you've played Strike Suit Zero this game is sort of similar, but more hardcore (no autoaim, faster paced, easy to crash, etc.) and designed for multiplayer.\n\nIn the game your ship has a flight mode and a hover mode. Flight mode gives you superior speed but you cannot turn quickly. Hover mode allows you to hover in place and aim like you would in an FPS, you are able to turn 180 degrees instantly if you turn fast enough.\n\nLearning to switch between the modes effectively is key to getting good with the controls, since there is no delay in changing modes since hover mode is excellent for aiming shots and stopping momentum.\n\nNavigating the maps which have a lot of complexity and various hidden paths is a skill in itself. Flying through complex paths at max speed while trying to flee enemy fire can feel very rewarding in a way I can't really remember experiencing in any other game, usually space combat or mech games don't have this complex environments. Powerup and healing items are also hidden in difficult places to encourage exploring, similarly to many old school FPS games.\n\nThe maps are well designed and really bring out the potential of the combat. For beginners the complexity can be a turnoff since it can be easy to crash into walls, but on the flipside this makes you learn the controls very quickly if you have some patience.\n\nThere are a wide variety of weapons which all have their own strengths. Though as of the current patch (1.0.4008) missiles and the LMG are pretty useless, but apart from those it feels very balanced. There are a variety of game modes that are typical for FPS games but they all work quite well with the maps.\n\nMy biggest negative point in the game is the games graphics settings, which are pretty much nonexistent ingame. It's very easy to manually set various detail settings just by editing a text file with false/true entries, but that makes it even more confusing as to why it isn't implemented ingame. With default settings the system requirements can be very high but at low settings you should be able to reach constant 60fps on a mid-tier system.\n\nA lot of people have complained about the lack of players, but at least from my experience in the european servers there are always at least 20-30 people playing which isn't bad at all unless you want to avoid expert players or tend to switch servers a lot.\n\nThe developers are releasing updates for the game every few months to polish features and add new maps/modes which is very nice to see. I think this could really be a big cult classic if they keep it up.","August 2, 2014","true","26.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

The only thing you can unlock from playing and leveling up is cosmetic parts for your ship, background decals for your profile and pieces of developer artwork.\n\nThe game has a high skill ceiling and it can be quite difficult when you start playing, since most of the weapons aren't all that easy to hit, and due to the speed of the vectors makes it pretty common to crash into walls or terrain multiple times while learning the game.\n\nThe game has a set of Tutorial missions which decently teach you the mechanics, but they aren't all that great, they do have leaderbords thought so they act more as challenge runs than being an actual tutorial.\n\nThe only downside to the game is that it has no single player, so all of the game is multiplayer, this might not be enough for some people, but I think 12 dollars is a decent price for this game, alternatively you could wait for an inevitable steam sale.\n\nAlso note that there is no music in-game, there is music in the menus, but nothing in the game, but other than that, Strike Vector is very enjoyable shooter, it's fast paced and hard, and it is so much fun.","June 19, 2014","true","6.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Yet there's next to no reason for me to talk about the game's positives simply because of one excruciating fact, the community is dead. It may be possible to find games at certain time of day or on certain days. You may be able to coordinate with other players and fans to set up a game. It's possible you may join an empty server, and wait around so other players can see the only server with a single player and join you.....yeah, that is the extent you may have to go to in order to play a round.\n\nThe contols and combat also has a steep learning curve that also turns off potential new players. I'm not sure if it is bad persay, but I definitely suck at it and it didn't help when the jet slightly veers off your aim, or when your target is in a awkward location in the map (that damn 4 tutorial map). The game prides itself for not being F2P, but sadly, this game may need F2P with transactions just to make it cost back (if it hasn't already).\n\nFrom my minor first impression, Strike Vector has a great base game that is made mostly pointless due to being multiplayer only with no players available. You can mess around in training/challenge missions if you so desire, but at best you will have stationary targets to shoot. I will probably launch it a few more times to see if there are players and to get my card drops. But Strike Vector is a definite no to purchase, unless you can verify that there are other players to play with.\n\nIf the gameplay mechanics interest you, I'd recommend taking a look at Strike Suit Zero and Strike Suit Infinity. I haven't played enough to make a review, but it has the same flight transformation combat.","October 5, 2014","false","3.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

The flying in this game in all honesty is the biggest seller for me, it's fluid, smooth, and reactive, I really enjoy ducking and weaving through tight spaces while people are chasing you, and it's incredibly satisfying to juke someone out, and have them slam into a wall and explode. The learning curve for this game is quite steep, and the servers aren't always the most stable, however if you are patient, and eager to invest some time (it only took me like a 2 hour session, maybe less to learn to fly, and fight deciently) it is definitly a blast to play! Customization in this game is also fairly deep, and is made available to you right off the bat, no weapon unlocks, and you can build your ship anywhich way you want! which adds to better team play, and situational presets, depending on the map you're in! all in all this game is fantastic as long as it's on sale, I highly recommend it","June 26, 2014","true","33.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The movement mechanics are very satisfying, with the spacebar used to switch between a fast movement mode and a slow movement mode, critical for turning on a dime and navigating through the maps. These maps are varied and full of objects to fly between and crash into, and the settings, such as a space shrine surrounded by spinning debris, are very appealing. The community seems small, but the game is excellent and the developer looks to still be actively improving it even half a year after release.

What kind am i refering to you might wonder?\n\nWell, steep learning curves, solid and true pvp, and no holds bard glorious pvp action that gets your blood pumping even when losing, there is just something about bieng completely outnumbered, that pushes you beyond your capabilities, forces you to pull deadly death defying lunatic manouvers around these elaborate well thought out complexes. they have thrown in plenty of small gaps for you to brave in the middle of a dogfight, every single game i find myself ninja through one at least once. And the real kick to the teeth, I SUCCEED!\n\nPeople say the controls suck, i completely and utterly disagree, if i am capable of these insane, near impossible to pull off manouvers less than 10 hours into playing the game, How by the life and death of all that is genetic, the controls bad?\n\nWith the simple flick of the mouse you can preform a true barrol roll, immelmen, immelmen turn, all of it and it doesnt even stop there. they truly capture the elemement that proves, up and down are non existant and throw that into the gameplay that allows for a wicked fun time. This game needs more support yes, its player base is struggling, and im enjoying it during the sale that has boosted the population.\n\nPlease people, stick with it! this game with new content will pathe the way for future games and can become so much more than it already is!\n\nyou might think with the steep learning curve that the game will be annoying, tough, and will force you to rage quit, well sure there have been plenty that have done just that, but i believe they all have one thing in common. they didnt sit down and try out the controls in a safe enviroment, they took one look, died, and quit. it doesnt take long to get to grips with the controls.\n\nJust play a challenge mode if you hate tutorials like i did, by the time you finish it, you'll be ready to at least, survive, and pull off the insane manouvers that i refer to completely by accident and succesfully!\n\nSo now you might be thinking, if these crazy and insane manouvers are possible, then surely it must be nearly impossible to kill with weaponry such as miniguns, unguided missiles, and so on. again, not true, this game offers a really cool weapons choice to fit your playstyle no matter what it may be, if you used to play Air rivals/SCO you can don the B-gear cape once again and use free fire rockets, shotguns, and point blank people, or simply directly blast them in the face, and this is so easy to do, the game becomes somewhat a joust with these weapons.\n\nthe miniguns and contact reliant weaponry, dont let the shakeyness fool you, its easy to do. you get behind an enemy, and you can follow him, any manouver he can pull, you can too, you can cut the corners of his manouvers easily, catch him and kill him. you'll be doing it in no time i assure you, this games learning curve is not as steep as you might think.\n\nFor those too lazy to read through the entire review, fair enough, lazyness is in overabundance these days.\n\nThe game is easy to learn, hard to master. it is great fun.\nYou can pull off break neck manouvers with ease and more succesfully than ever.\nYou can succesfully follow these manouvers with easy, thereby adding far more depth to pvp combat\ncounters to counters to counters.\nAiming isnt nearly as hard as you might think.\nWeapons that are similar to the amazing B-gear of Air rivals, SCO, Ace online.(same game different servers)","June 20, 2014","true","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A steep learning curve may deter some, but after a few hours of play, Strike Vector starts to click, and you'll never go slow again. Highly reccomended to people looking for a fast, fresh kind of shooter. Community is small but active, and devs are very connected with players.

One horrible choice is to have when ships crash it counts as a -1 kill for them, but none for yourself. TDM matches can go on forever even when there are over 100 kills on both sides. \\n\nYes you can dodge missles, but it is hard as ♥♥♥♥, somtimes your position will make in impossible. The seeker drones are BS and just fly around till they kill you, I would be ok with them if you could shoot them down along with other deployables.\n\nThe real fun part of the game is the flying, You have the ability to go from a flying to stationary, think of a Harrier, just at about 10 times the speed, which is awesome when you duck and spin through the smallest of gaps and turns. less so when you ♥♥♥♥ up and crash.\n\nThere is a lot of balence issues, and the lack of fun I am having is very saddening because when I heard of this game I was excited as all hell. I would say avoid for now, wait for patches to balence the game.\n\nAnd based on the other reivews, I expect this to get downvotes, but dont get me wrong, I want to love the game, I am average at it, even k/d, forgeting crashes. So yeah, bring in the dislikes without reading. I want to hit that yes button but I just can't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/longhornred/recommended/246700/","longhornred","LonghornRed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/longhornred/","109 products in account","It's a game that satisfies only a particular audience....and the size of that audience is rather small. It truly lives up to the name of the studio Rage Quit. Only play this game if dying an insane amount of times, spending over 20 hours, before you start getting good is what you really love. Strike Vector is one of those games that if you don't LOVE IT, then you will not have fun unlike other games such as Call of Duty, PAYDAY2, and HAWKEN where you don't have to be a steep, L2P fanatic.\nBrutal, Intense, Dogfighting and true skill sniping with fire-and-forget swarm missles.\nYeah, watch youtube videos FIRST. If you like merciless Aerial PVP then Stike Vector is for you.\n\nIn other words, it is that kind of game that you need to be REALLY SURE ABOUT before you buy it. This game isn't meant for casual gamers or even thoughs who are hardcore FPS lovers. You need to LOVE Aerial combat and need to be BADASS at dogfighting if you want a chance of enjoying Strike Vector.\n\nEdit: Now its $12. That's more like it.\n\nI won't pretend to like this game. I don't at all because it's not for me and MANY people will agree after they get their asses handed to them by players who LOVE this massochist L2P curve that Strike Vector presens. Do I HATE this game? No. Gameplay aside they have fantastic visuals and original maps. I tell you now the weapons don't sound to impressive while your view is INSIDE the cockpit but switch to Third-Person and they sound much better; yes, they pay attention to detail. Soundtrake is solid.\n\nUltimately, I don't reccomend this to anyone who ISN'T a hardcore fan of Aerial Combat and a STEEP, BRUTAL, L2P curve. I don't reccomend this game due to the large amount of players who WON'T like this game's merciless style. So casual gamers should stay away from this game and everyone else who doesn't like a game that favors only the strong and leaves everyone else in the dust, brutally beaten and exiting the game frustrated after spending $20.\n\nSo with that said, if you love this L2P curve then Strike Vector is for you and your money will be well spent on a game that truly sates your thirst. Have fun! :)\n\n\nEdit: Now it's $12. Well, it's a step in the right direction.","May 17, 2014","false","6.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Starting out, you will die very frequently, and usually because you flew into something and crashed.  But put in a few hours, and you'll be making hairpin turns and weaving through obstacles in no time.  Put in a few more hours, and you'll be knocking chumps out of the sky with freakish precision.  But you're going to have to take your lumps on the way.\n\nIt's very unforgiving to start with, but it has a very high skill ceiling.  On the upside, that means you will always be able to improve your skills to get that much closer to mastery, which is very satisfying -- but on the downside, it means that you will get slaughtered at the beginning by seemingly superhuman players, and you kind of have to shrug that off if you want to improve.\n\nAnother thing I recommend is that you put on some ACDC while you play - it enhances the experience considerably.  Also, increase your mouse sensitivity to at least 50% in the in-game options.  It makes a world of difference!\n\nThe community, from what I've seen, is very small, friendly, and dedicated.  If you're new and having trouble, definitely let people know, and they'll probably go easy on you and show you the ropes.","June 22, 2014","true","43.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Learning the controls is a breeze, and a wealth of customizations are instantly at your disposal.  Your ship can be customized to use different combat weapons, as well as the paint scheme and special abilities.  Finding private and public servers is extremely easy, and multiplayer mechanics are balanced.\n\nA variety of gamemodes are available, such as classic Deathmatch and Bounty Hunter.  Many maps are also available, and feature huge open areas to fly unrestricted.  This game reminds me of the older StarFox games, and the combat mechanics between the two series is very similar.\n\nThe only negative thing I noticed about Strike Vector is the lack of video settings, such as anti-aliasing and texture / shader quality.

It's really hard to get into, but after an hour of straight practice I finally got my first kill, and both me and the game got better and better since.\n\nShort version:\n++ Graphics\n++ Concept\n+   Gameplay\n+   Variation\n\n+/-   Hard to learn, fun to 'master'.\n\n-  No Team balancing\n-  Could use more players\n-- Balancing issues with some loadouts\n\n\nLong version:\nHigh-speed dogfighting in the most maneuverable fighters you've ever flown give you such an adrenaline rush that you get the feeling you need to stop playing after a while, but you never will. The fast respawns and instant-changes you can make to your fighter make it addicting and very action-packed. The minor customisation is fun but doesn't seem to give anyone an advantage which is great, it makes you try out everything the game has to offer.\n\nSome loadouts seem to be used more then others though. Like the dual Plasma-canon 'Sniper' set-up, which is just guys floating around on their own trying to shoot people from the very edge of a map and running away to the other edge with bonus-boosters the moment danger gets near. This seems rather weird for a game that is about out-manouvering your opponent rather then out-shooting them. I'd rather not see this weapon in the game as it seems cheap and forces other players to use the same tactic, turning the server in an all-around sniping-jiggle match. Which is, quite frankly, really really boring for such an exciting game.\n\nSo I guess there are some balancing issues that need to be fixed, including how one team can consist out of just lvl 50 veterans while the other team is nothing but newcomers. The game should be able to balance teams properly like any other online shooter, so that's a weird oversight imo.\n\nOh but did I mention that the graphics are gorgeous, but still keeps playing at 60fps even on old computers like mine? Beautiful! Lag might sometimes be an issue though depending on the server that you're on. The maps are beautifully crafted and they're all unique with their own style, hazards and way of traversing it. Some are very open with lots of debris flying around while others have narrow corridors and require precise control of your craft. They all bring their own challenge and variation and they have kept me perfectly curious and entertained so far.\n\nNever a dull moment!

It has diversified weapon/perk combinations, the sense of classic online shooters, great visuals, maps that actually differ from each other, multiple game modes and so on. It's got a tight learning curve, so the first few days will be bumpy rides (quite literally), but that won't be a problem if you got the stones to handle it.\n\nThe two flight modes work beautifully in unison. Switching between modes happens fast and fluently and is essential to master. Jet mode is for fast travel and dog-fighting, hover/harrier mode for aiming, fighting at close quarters, fast turns, braking and so on.\n\nI heavily recommend to anyone who's up for a good flight and a good fight.","April 24, 2014","true","20.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game is visually appealing, and feels great to play. It's incredibly fast paced, and feels fantastic to play. However, it sadly suffers from a tiny player base. The game has dedicated servers, but never enough players to fill them. If the game had bots to allow players to figure it out on their own, it would help new players get into it without being destroyed by the dedicated minority. If you have some friends do get into the game with, I'd look into giving it a shot. However, if you're going to go in solo, you may have a hard time finding games that don't have a huge skill gap.","August 16, 2015","true","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would enjoy liking this game, but they make it SO hard to even practice, it's a complete turn-off.\n\nSo it's a dogfighter like War Thunder, but you can hover. The two different "modes" of flight are just hover and boost from what I can tell, so it's not really difficult to learn that. However, boost flight is so unstable and cumbersome, and the tutorials just dump you in to figure out flight and weapons yourself. The tutorial is truly just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ campaign with no voice acting, and the only tips come up on the side. Because when I'm flying at 2000 near-deaths per second, I'm capable of reading these tips on the far side of the screen.\n\nWeapons aren't introduced in any way, and it seems pretty clear that lock-on is the way to go. Maybe there's counters to that, but it seems like slow-firing precision weapons aren't going to work well when everyone is boosting around. And then someone gets on your tail, and you can't shake them. The hover ability is kinda pointless, as everyone that has played a shooter of any kind knows, standing still is standing dead. Mobility is survival, so you need to keep agile. But other shooters with feet, ground, and gravity at least let you turn around to fire at your chaser while you both jump and dodge off walls as fast as possible.\n\nI know I didn't put much time into the game, but it was just a major turn-off. It's trying to evoke Unreal Tournament, War Thunder, or even Planetside, and it just makes me want to play those. And come on, did Quake or UT have a massive learning curve? Even Tribes was fair to pick up and play, and the worst player of the bunch could at least pick up some kills. Why even bother putting in a tutorial if it's intentionally going to be ♥♥♥♥? So many other games offer the feeling of mastery and improvement mentioned in the description, but don't do so in a manner to turn players away immediately.\n\nMaybe games were this bad and unwelcoming back in the day, but we didn't have masses of alternatives available. Simply, there are so many better games than this. Maybe it improves with dedication, but why waste $5 or more along with many hours on a game that has maybe 100 players? It's dead in under a year, for these very problems of never attracting people and turning the few interested players away.

But after spending as much time as I have in this and getting a good "grasp" on how the game works and plays, it's just not very good. It doesn't feel very solid at all, and the room for competition and skill is very narrow. There isn't as much depth as there seems, and what little there is just isn't very fun past the first few hours. I'm consistently going like 15-0 in my games but it's not very fun. Maybe someone else would like it, but it fails on a CoD pub level and it fails on a Counterstrike competitive level and it fails on a teamwork cooperation level. It's not a very satisfying game. The price is also way too high, and the server browser is even worse and more buggy than Chivalry's.","January 29, 2014","false","14.1"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

Switching quickly between the two modes will enable you to change direction very quickly; enabling you to pull off many tricks that would seem impossible in conventional dogfighting games like Ace Combat. Along with that comes the detailed and immersive world (not only graphical fidelity, but also really interesting aethestics) along with well thought out map designs. Kudos to the devs for this too. The amount of customization makes me feel at home and there's quite some freedom in it (though not unlimited).\n\nBut of course, not all games are perfect. Even the ones we love. From the reviews I read, Strike Vector (at its release) was very lacking in presentation, but the devs quickly fixed that, so it's okay now. Another point to work on is the fact that the game doesn't have a very big player base; despite the game being constantly updated. I played this game for a few hours, and I keep seeing the same names. Doesn't happen much in other online games that I play. I find it really hard to improve myselfif I keep playing with the same people over and over again, not mentioning that it becomes especially boring if they do not improve as well. And perhaps, a matchmaking system would be able to fix this along with the unbalances when more experienced players are stacked in one team.\n\nDo I recommend it? Depends.\nIf you have $6 to spend on a random game; then yes.\nIf you don't have $6 to spend or would rather buy something else with that $6 dollars; then no.\n\nBut if you're just looking for a unique and exciting dogfighting experience, you've come to the right place.\n\n8/10\n","June 28, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One other thing that would add a lot of value to the game would be more customisation options - customisation is okay but we need more weapons! more parts! and make them useful, too; they should have consqeuences on how your ship performs, and the different weapons and abilities should be unlockables, not available from the get go.\n\nOverall this game, at its core, is beautiful and plays perfectly; it's just that the infrastructure needs a LOT of work before people are going to start, and continue playing. I did say I can't recommend it, but I don't want to put this game down at all; it needs all the support and attention it can get.","June 23, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

There is no lag in controls, no delay between actions, no slow response from the vector on key press which makes it even more fast placed shooter type.\n\nAnd gameplay here!\nYou have several modes, deathmatch, team deathmath, capture the flag, bounty, which is incredibly fun with friends as vectors are quite fast, you fly thru any kind of stuff, surrounding pipes, moving platforms, chasing others, which requires form you to sharpen your skills, true and that makes it fun.\nEvery weapon is unique, from heat aiming missiles to plasma guns and machine guns etc, some weapons shoot slower or have lower range, others are fast and powerfull, but no worries you have settings even for that, you can choose to have more range on your weapon at the cost of damage or clip size or anything you prefer, you can try different combinations and strategies after every frag or fail too, if you can't score first time just change the strategy and try again, repeat in case of failure ;D, there is no locked items except customizations of your vector.\nYou have special weapons, EMP, mines which you can drop behind while being chased, additional boost with thruster and other perks beside those stuff which helps you in fights.\n\nMonotone environment and bored flying around... nope. You have a space stations moving which floats around the spaces just as they should floating while you are trying to not crash into them, if you have enough skills you can attract your opponent and get him into the most difficult areas forcing him to smack himself into some object or wall while he chases you, it is very important to know the map well.\n\nOne tip here!\nGrab emp and machine gun with long range and heat aiming missiles, just fly thru the combat area, hit the emp and then your opponents will not be able to escape from the missiles no matter what are they trying. Well it is a nice strategy but not always working as it should.\n\nThe only drawback is that strike vector has no bots or single player, it is only focused on multiplayer experience, for some luck you can host your own server with some commandline options mentioned in the forum and only people who got your ip address will play with you.\n\nGood thing about it, dlcs are free any item will be unlocked except customization ones that you unlock with gaining experience, you just need to play it.","June 30, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you want a game that you can pick up and wreck scrubs, this isn't for you. If you're willing to buckle down and get your ♥♥♥ handed to you for a few hours, you can fly around at the speed of sound and blast other ships down in real time. I honestly wasn't even frustrated when I got destroyed, I was just fascinated at the intense pace and feeling of speed in this game.\n\nSingle player mode is fun! Back in my day there wasn't a single player mode, but now it's easier than ever to practice your flying skills.\n\nThe good:\nFast pace. It feels the same as speedrunning Sonic Generations, a game into which I've dumped over 100 hours.\nIntense shooting mechanics. From chasing down enemies with gatlings to sniping a ship flying at the speed of sound with the plasma, the shooting will never get boring.\nGreat community. As expected; the only people who play this game are those patient enough to learn it. It's like the learning curve of a MOBA, without the toxic community.\n\nThe bad:\nThere is very rarely more than one game active on the server.\nIf there is an active game, it's probably in an EU server. It's not too bad since I'm in New York, but I'd like more games with sub-100 ping.\nSometimes server lag causes you to crash your ship by teleporting into the stage geometry.\nIt takes a long time to learn. 5 hours of dying to yourself before you learn to fly, followed by another 5 hours of dying to others before you learn to shoot and fly at the same time.\n\nI wish more people would play this game. ♥♥♥♥'s amazing, 10/10 would (nogame)nolife.","June 12, 2014","true","33.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That said, the effort the developers put in to the game and vector models in particular was obvious, You could see every little detail, from subtle jet engine lighting to minute air vents and piping.\n\nAs for gameplay I can't say for sure as I had a lot of lag interfering with my play sessions but it seemed pretty solid with a decent veriety of weapons and perks each with very individual effects, even a shot gun wich I though was a bit odd in a flight game. The maps I was happy to see were really well designed with lots of cramped places to tempt you to be a bit darring,\nthe variety of maps was good as well each with a unique scifi feel.\n\nOver all I was quite happy with Strike Vector,\nThough as I said because of the lag and lack of players it makes it hard\nfor me to decisively rate this game but if it developed a good following I\nwould be happy to play this game as a unique refresher from the FPS's\nI'm sure most of us play.","March 18, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While some of the weapons may seemed unbalanced, i.e. the homing missles are a bit of a rage generator, they are very well balanced. Each ship can equip any combination of 2 weapons from a high damage plasma gun to a infinite ammo low damage gattling gun. Ships also get a special module that has special trait in the range of healing your ship to giving you a little shield and more. You also have a passive ability to select such as one that allows you to enhance your zoom in sniper mode, or make you go faster.\n\nThe game is full of unique elements that make it stand out in my eyes. However, I would recommend that you play the tutorial levels first. They are a great help and can get you flying decently in no time. Unfortunately many of the servers are empty and the ones that are full might not have that great of ping.

You fly around in your Vector, which is like a plane. You can switch between two modes of flight by easily pressing one button. The two modes are Harrier where you hover in one spot and Jet where you fly super fast! You can have two weapons, right and left click. There are 8 different weapons. You can use two of the same weapon too! There are also Special weapons and Special Abilities! The game has very high quality graphics. Very well designed maps. And extremely fast-paced fun combat! There are plenty of different gamemodes, and you can customize your Vector. There are different parts, camos, and you can use ANY color! There is a leveling system which rewards you with Concept art, Thumbnails for your in-game profile, and parts for your vector! NONE of the parts actually change how good your vector is, they are just for decoration, so it isn't unfair. Personally, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes first or third person shooter, and to anyone who likes fast-paced PvP. But to be honest, evryone should play this game. It is so unique and amzing. I'll see you in Airshot City! (Yes one of the maps is named Airshot City, lol)","January 29, 2014","true","15.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Up until I found Strike Vector the only games I had for decent dogfighting were FreeSpace2 and the old Ace Combat games (the last one was terrible so I don't play it). The beauty of this thing is you can treat it like a regular fps rather than zip around all the time too. The passive and active abilities on your Vector can be combined with specialities on your weapons to cater to a specific playstyle and if you fly well enough you can play to your strengths while dampening weaknesses (if say for example you had radar jamming + cloak + silent plasma, excellent for sniping but useless in a straight-up fight - know when to relocate and zip through obstacles to stay out of harm's way).\n\nThere's a fair amount of content, but really the fights alone will keep you occupied. On the negative side - sometimes the servers can have high latency which can end up with your Vector plastered against a wall that was several hundred metres away just a few moments ago. The extremely fast and precise nature of the flying and shooting also makes it somewhat inaccessbile to gamers that don't have a lot of experience with flying in a 3D environment or fast-paced fps. I find it hard to judge how much this is the case though as I've played space sims for over a decade now. :)","February 14, 2014","true","16.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Like all flight games, all players must watch what goes above them, below them, and around them, creating a fight on 3D space that is very interesting, and deadly.\n\nNicely made maps\nThe maps are nicely made. The maps also bring good narratives to the game, for example huge ships and huge floating cities. The maps are quite detailed, and fun to fly around and shoot around. The maps have various characteristics too. Some maps are very open, allowing long range duels, like the map in outer space, but some maps have very cramped, like the map where the dogfighting occurs inside a refinery. Some maps also have combination of both. Some parts of the maps are cramped, and some are very wide. The maps, are nicely done.\n\nNo AI Bots\nFrankly, this is a weakness. With no AI bots, we will depend on the availability of the servers, and the number of existing playerbase. This will be covered later.\n\nVariety of Weapons and Customization\nThe craft that we have could be customized, starting from the look, to its weapon system, to its characteristics, and its special weapon. You could create a "long-range" craft that have homing missile, and equipped with system to allow better detection of enemies "vector" (crafts) and mines to protect your place. Or, you wanted a "melee" craft, that is equipped with carbine and gatling gun, with system to better track fleeing enemies, and ghost system to make your vector invisible for a short while. Or, you wanted a "stealth" craft that is equipped with plasma and shotgun, with system to make your vector harder to detect, and defense system to make your vector tougher. So many options. So many option. So many tactics. This is a very great thing in the game.\n\nMedals and Rewards\nYou got XP and medals for doing some things. Like 3-kill streak. Or kill somebody when you are dead. Or when using your flaming, dying craft to make a final kill. Or when you successfuly kills the person who kills you. A lot more. A great flavor to the game.\n\nEase of Playing\nA major concern here. The game is easy enough to understand. After all, it's just another flying game. But the hard part is how to apply those flying skills in combat. Not to mention that this game has lacklustre, and sub-par tutorial. In the tutorial you are told to do this and that, without even told what is the key to do that, or why we have to do that. We are told that going through booster rings makes our vector goes faster, but no tips at all, to survive PvP combat.\n\nMultiplayerThis game is fully multi-player. No bots at all. The devs made a vague promise, but that's all. The devs is working on another game, so usually this game will not be developed much. The developers still came and care for the game, for example releasing new maps, but I think they won't be releasing an AI. The devs has stated that it is difficult, and I agree with them. Sadly, there are only a few people willing to play this great game. Even after released in Humble Bundle for a cheap price, only few people are playing this game.\n\nThis game has a lot of servers around in the world, from USA to Singapore. That means all regions are covered well, and no one should have large pings, but the problem is the lack of the players. But if you are playing this game, don't worry, although most servers are empty, there should be 1-2 servers that have players there. A major gripe here is also that some people (they called themselves veterans) that are good in this game will trumps new bloods easily, thus creating an aura of elitism, and kicking new bloods out. Some veterans are good, but some are bad.\n\nGraphics and SoundsExcellent. As outlined above, the quality of the graphic is great. Not very deep into detail, but enough detail, a perfect balance between performance of the engine and the beauty of the graphic.\n\nGameplay FunGameplay DifficultyGameplay NoveltyGameplay ConceptMultiplayer               8060909060\nConclusionI recommend this game. It brings new and novel concept, which is very interesting. Just a recommendation : If you kept getting killed, learn, don't rage quit. This game is difficult, and being killed is part of the play.","January 28, 2015","true","4.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Most arieal games that Ihave played mostly focused on graphics and just powerful weapons. While this stays also true to this game it also focuses on precise skill on flying, having some of the best kind of customazation for weaponary not i just this gaming genre but of some that I have seen of all time. With having maps that do not look the same and have ech their own unqiue feel from the hot and mechanical working battlefield of Inferno to things like the beautiful but yet very dangerous skyhell map (a personal favorite) the variety is a great feautre and I have only just played the beta. The most shocking thing however is the fact that this was only made with less than 15 people! Though it sounds amazing it is not 100 percent for the faint of heart. There are multiple crashes in servers that do not save the kills or progress that you did during the match. Also the people are called Ragequit Corparation for a reason. If you think that you want to play this to have a nice easy fun exprience than you are sadly mistaken. The game will put your gaming skills to the test which I appreciate but at times can be fustrating and I dissaprove. These problems can scare off some promsing players due to the low amount of begginners friendly. With over the top moments when flying and action these problems are really low compared to the entire game. If you are not good at first person shooters or third person or possibly shooting games in general, this might not be the proper first game to play of the genre. But needless to say that this game is an amazing expirence from beta tryout and cannot wait to see how the final game will turn out to be.","January 24, 2014","true","6.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Give yourself two hours to learn how to not crash, not die at the hands of the enemy, maybe kill here and there yourself, and finally play some good music and then it'll all click. Once you get past that first hump, the addiction sets in and it grabs you. Mostly because you'll feel like the most bad-♥♥♥ player in any game out there.\n\nSome of the best looking levels on ANY multiplayer game I've played as well - and its not just fluff. Every piece of level geometry demands you fly through in a cool way, avoid crashing into, and use to your advantage to try and get people on your tail to crash. Or to hide. Some levels feature vast expanses of open sky - perfect for high speed thrusts and chases. Other levels take place on a firery-brimstone close quarters assembly line that are more home to the close calls and close quarters - flying through narrow corridors and getting up close and person with a rocket launcher. Some levels make you feel like you are on the deathstar or in an Anime. Either way every level is fun, beautful, and plays totally different. Its refreshing to see multiplayer level design done this way. It's also one of the few games where their in-game levels exceed their concept art in my opinion (and its some really good concept art).\n\nLoads of different weapon/ability/etc combonations. Part of the fun of playing this game is switching up your loadout on the fly to suite your mood or the situation.\n\nIt may seem slightly expensive, but look out for sales if you are on the fence. I think its worth the price of admission, because the devs have been updating the game constantly with free content (recently two awesome maps and a CTF mode), and plan to dole out constant free updates as time goes on. You also get everything from the get go - there is no unlocking system like you expect to see in many free to play games to date, and that is its strength.\n\nEven if you aren't the greatest fan of arena shooters or that style gameplay (I personally am not the biggest fan myself), the feel of bad-assery and the excellent level design more than makes it into something much more than that for me.","February 28, 2014","true","10.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

A few of the weapons need balancing, but the optimal loadout changes with each map and/or game mode and it shows when people fail to see that. You'll score higher than others who are actually probably better than you simply because you picked the right weapons. There's a floating retical which is awesome. So you can shoot at a target on the edge of your screen while going into sharp turns. Harrier mode is useful for slowing down and orienting yourself or laying an ambush and it's almost impossible to get into certain places without it. There's sniping also. It's so hard most of the time that the weapon is almost not worth using, but when you do make a shot, it's awesome knowing that the person you got initially has no clue what happened. Along with two weapons, you get to choose a special ability and another piece of equipment that goes on the back of your ship. Something like shields, extra thruster or mines that has a cooldown. So there are quite a few combinations available and I'm usually changing my setup with every game. My favorite mode is bounty hunter. You basically scramble to kill the person with the highest bounty on their head and try to have the highest by the end of the game. It really shows off the game's maps - which are mostly very good - because by the end of the round, everyone else is trying to kill you more than each other. So you're zipping in and out of tunnels that you're not even sure you can fit through while trying not to crash and lose the bounty you've built up. Or you can risk going after other players and getting an even bigger bounty. It's pretty great getting everyone so fixed on your trail then going down a small tunnel and leaving a bunch of mines to kill them all and double your bounty.","February 3, 2014","true","12.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has solo play, but only in the form of "challenges", i.e. timed races, obstacle courses, and shooting galleries - and all of them, frenetic and pretty short. (And, ultimately, tedious.) These challenges are in no way "missions", for this game is in no way a futuristic combat flight sim. (Although, you might think so, watching the gameplay videos.) It's more like Descent, a three-dimensional flying first-person multi-player shooter.\n\nProblem is - and it's a BIG problem, here - there is no match-making in this game, where you as a beginner could be matched with other beginners and maybe some intermediates. Here, you simply join a server, where you usually find yourself matched with a couple of intermediates and maybe another beginner, but all of you DOMINATED by 1 or 2 advanced or even veteran players.\n\nThis game demands three-dimensional spatial awareness, as well as razor-edge hand-eye coordination and reflexes. Furthermore, you need to lead your targets with your weapon fire, which is affected by the target's range, speed, and angle, and your weapon type. There are no visual cues on your HUD to aid you, like there are in combat flight sims. And some weapons have recoil, which messes with your aim. (You'd think your fighter's jets, if not its weight and mass, could compensate for that!) Oh, and all the while you're frantically trying to avoid high-speed, mid-air collisions with obstacles and buildings.\n\nEither you're a natural at it all, or you're not - and if you're not, then you need to overcome a HARSH learning curve, and you will need LOTS of practice.\n\nBut how do you learn and get that practice? The tutorials are brief and uninformative; this game has a sink-or-swim attitude. You can try out most (but not all) of the maps solo, flying around and shooting at targets and dodging obstacles and learning the layouts, but that doesn't prepare you at all for shooting at, and avoiding be shot at by, opponent players. Even the solo challenges don't really prepare you for multi-player matches.\n\nAll in all, I'd say Strike Vector is too un-accommodating for beginners and caters too much to the hardcore. Even worse, it's severely lacking in content. I say wait another six months before buying this game, to see how much more content is released and how the multi-player community develops. Because, as it is now, it's a work in-progress.","June 19, 2014","false","33.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Game.\n\nYou will not regreat it, especially during one of its many massive sales recently.\n\nThe learning curve is not as hard as people think, about as hard as the first time ever playing an FPS ever. But learning a few small tips like; Rockets x2 are a new players best friend, and to use double of the same weapon as a rule and not to mix and match (as it makes it harder to land both weapon shots simultaniously thus lowering your burst damage) will go a long way towards getting you comfortable with the game. Just keep getting used to the physics and you will get better and better. Bounty Mode is best for new players to get footing, as a lucky last minute kill can win you the whole game most of the time.\n\nConstant free updates makes getting new content painless and the stuff they have added recently has been very high quality, don't miss this on sale.\n\nOh and one last tip; If you switch to hover mode right befopre you hit a wall, no matter how fast you are going the Vector will stop and hover, avoiding the crash up to the last possible second.

I bought the game yesterday and I've already more than 10 hours logged.\n\nI will warn all potential buyers: this game takes skill. If you don't want to put in minimal effort to learn the basics of the game, you're not going to have fun because you'll be crashing into damn near everything you can find. If, however, you spend even an hour or so learning how to play the game, you'll start to be able to dodge obstacles at high speeds, outstripping and evading enemy fire; living when you should be dead. It's a rush that no other game has given me.\n\nNaysayers claim that there are not enough players on the servers, and that this game is 'dead'. Not so. The community is very much alive, if small. Of the 12 or so hours that I've played, at least 8 or 9 of them have been played in multiplayer matches. I haven't touched training after the inital 2 or 3 hours at all. And yes, there aren't many more than 2 or 3 servers being played on at one time, but I've never actually had problems with that. The community being small also means strong rivalries and friendships can easily form. But expansion is always welcome - and that's why you should play.\n\nThis game, this community, could be so much more. Please consider buying Strike Vector and playing with us.

Want a new, different, fast-paced shooter? Then THIS is what you need.\nI won't lie, this game is pretty hard, and you'll spend the first hours shouting at your computer.

You can customize your Vector, and there are enough weapons to choose the way you wanna fight (Rocket Launcher? Shotgun? Sniper?)\nThe problem is, online mode may be dead in some time if nothing is done. But you'll always find a group of players to play with anyway.\n\nSo please, if you are hesitating, don't hesitate anymore and buy this game now.

The controls are unforgiving at first but soon you will wish every video game gave you this much freedom and responsiveness. There are countless ways to fly and every weapon and ability presents a new rewarding challenge.\n\nPros:\n- One of the best flight control schemes of any game I've played (after rebinding a few buttons)\n- 14 gorgeous sci-fi levels with thousands of nooks to fly through and ridiculous detail\n- A decent pile of weapons, abilities, and powerups\n- Impressive punchy audio\n- High degree of ship customization\n- More modes and levels to come as free updates\n\nCons:\n- Mostly empty servers, there are times when there is absolutely nobody playing. This is a huge problem if you want to buy the game\n- No video tutorials. There are a ton of gameplay tutorials which try to teach by just making you fly through hoops, but they don't provide quite the info that a single good video tutorial could. I learned by playing for a few rounds then watching one of STAR_'s videos and that was all the tutorial I needed.\n\nThis game is fun from the moment you start crashing into walls; I'd recommend Strike Vector to anyone who won't back down after being torn to shreds by the competition. Every time you die you will know it was your fault (unless you have a low-end internet connection or computer).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RynexGFX/recommended/246700/","RynexGFX","Rynex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RynexGFX/","263 products in account","Strike Vector is a brutally fast "FPS" game, drawing elements from games like Quake, Forsaken and Descent. It may feel somewhat unforgiving at first, and you'll probably find yourself crashing a number of times, but it becomes a much better experience once you get to grips with how things work.  Customization of your ship comes in the form of changing the hull, chasis and jets of your ship, all of which are simply cosmetic and add no enhancement to your ship in any way. You get a series of guns, special items and perks to kit your ship out with, and all of them feel releatively balanced well.\n\nIt does feel that as of writing this review (01/28/14) that this game is still a bit rough around the edges, but the team at RageQuit have promised that all updates and DLC will be free for the game, hopefully in the form of more ships, maps and gamemodes.\n\nThe price may disaude you, but really this game is every bit worth it. Watch the trailer video and you'll get the general idea of what this game is about, and if it perks your interest like it did mine, then it's probably tingling the fps niche tastebuds of yours.\n","January 28, 2014","true","42.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't know exactly what it is that makes Strike Vector so incredibly cool. Perhaps the mind-blowing speeds? Maybe the absolutely gorgeous graphics? Maybe the extreme smoothness of movement? Or is is the destructive weaponry and its majestic sounds booming in your ears as you blow up another enemy time after time... Hell if I know.\n\nThis game just feels great. It's fast-paced, high-speed, high-action and adrenaline-inducing. It really gives me a kick every time I play it. The controls are difficult but once you play around with it a bit, it rewards all your hard work with the sensational feeling you get when you see your rockets/plasma/bullets obliterate your target, scattering around in a thousand burning pieces across the skies while you soar through it at a velocity greater than the speed of sound. What else can a gamer wish for?\n\nAs for its current state, it's kinda public beta-ish and has its bugs but nothing really harms the gameplay and the amazing experience. Even if this excitement about this game will fade (which I highly doubt!), it is well worth the money and an amazing game to play.

The learning curve ont his game is very high, but once you get through that, this game is a SKILL based shooter!  This isnt your typical TDM type game.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes fast paced shoot/flight games.  This is one of my new favorite games.  I also like that there will be free DLCs and content available and NO PAY TO WIN. With these reasons combined, I give Strike Vector a 9/10. Definately worth the $$.","February 2, 2014","true","12.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I can't wait until more things are added. Like PVE game modes with ai bots (although that may take a bit of work to make them a good challenge and not player crushing gods with perfect aim and take some time to do).\n\nI've even learned to use the controller a little bit better now that I found the correct file to edit.\n\nIf you are going for a console release any time in the future I recommend keeping strafe on the left stick  for jet mode too and not having barrel roll at all or better yet set it up as a combo button press.

Want a new, different, fast-paced shooter? Then THIS is what you need.\nI won't lie, this game is pretty hard, and you'll spend the first hours shouting at your computer. But the feeling you get when you manage to destroy an enemy Vector after a pursuit through the levels and a face-to-face duel is f***ing awesome.\nThe graphics aren't astonishing but still the game is not ugly at all, the colours and the general design make it beautiful. You can customize your Vector, and there are enough weapons to choose the way you wanna fight (Rocket Launcher? Shotgun? Sniper?)\nThe problem is, online mode may be dead in some time if nothing is done. But you'll always find a group of players to play with anyway.\n\nSo please, if you are hesitating, don't hesitate anymore and buy this game now.

The controls are unforgiving at first but soon you will wish every video game gave you this much freedom and responsiveness. There are countless ways to fly and every weapon and ability presents a new rewarding challenge.\n\nPros:\n- One of the best flight control schemes of any game I've played (after rebinding a few buttons)\n- 14 gorgeous sci-fi levels with thousands of nooks to fly through and ridiculous detail\n- A decent pile of weapons, abilities, and powerups\n- Impressive punchy audio\n- High degree of ship customization\n- More modes and levels to come as free updates\n\nCons:\n- Mostly empty servers, there are times when there is absolutely nobody playing. This is a huge problem if you want to buy the game\n- No video tutorials. There are a ton of gameplay tutorials which try to teach by just making you fly through hoops, but they don't provide quite the info that a single good video tutorial could. I learned by playing for a few rounds then watching one of STAR_'s videos and that was all the tutorial I needed.\n\nThis game is fun from the moment you start crashing into walls; I'd recommend Strike Vector to anyone who won't back down after being torn to shreds by the competition. Every time you die you will know it was your fault (unless you have a low-end internet connection or computer).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RynexGFX/recommended/246700/","RynexGFX","Rynex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RynexGFX/","263 products in account","Strike Vector is a brutally fast "FPS" game, drawing elements from games like Quake, Forsaken and Descent. It may feel somewhat unforgiving at first, and you'll probably find yourself crashing a number of times, but it becomes a much better experience once you get to grips with how things work.  Customization of your ship comes in the form of changing the hull, chasis and jets of your ship, all of which are simply cosmetic and add no enhancement to your ship in any way. You get a series of guns, special items and perks to kit your ship out with, and all of them feel releatively balanced well.\n\nIt does feel that as of writing this review (01/28/14) that this game is still a bit rough around the edges, but the team at RageQuit have promised that all updates and DLC will be free for the game, hopefully in the form of more ships, maps and gamemodes.\n\nThe price may disaude you, but really this game is every bit worth it. Watch the trailer video and you'll get the general idea of what this game is about, and if it perks your interest like it did mine, then it's probably tingling the fps niche tastebuds of yours.\n","January 28, 2014","true","42.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't know exactly what it is that makes Strike Vector so incredibly cool. Perhaps the mind-blowing speeds? Maybe the absolutely gorgeous graphics? Maybe the extreme smoothness of movement? Or is is the destructive weaponry and its majestic sounds booming in your ears as you blow up another enemy time after time... Hell if I know.\n\nThis game just feels great. It's fast-paced, high-speed, high-action and adrenaline-inducing. It really gives me a kick every time I play it. The controls are difficult but once you play around with it a bit, it rewards all your hard work with the sensational feeling you get when you see your rockets/plasma/bullets obliterate your target, scattering around in a thousand burning pieces across the skies while you soar through it at a velocity greater than the speed of sound. What else can a gamer wish for?\n\nAs for its current state, it's kinda public beta-ish and has its bugs but nothing really harms the gameplay and the amazing experience. Even if this excitement about this game will fade (which I highly doubt!), it is well worth the money and an amazing game to play. I recommend this to everyone who wants to view third/first person shooters in a completely different way.","January 28, 2014","true","34.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowtv/recommended/246700/","snowtv","雪花牌电视机 SnowTV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowtv/","143 products in account","First I have to say that, I have played a lot of shooters. FPS, TPS, MMOS, lots of betas, also includes flight games, like world of warplanes, anyways. I am saying this just to clearify that I am a experienced shooting game players.\n\nI have to say: this game is absolutely meeting my expactation. I have been following this game for... quite a while. Unfortunately, I didn't get beta invitations. But today I can finally play it, and I feel exactly the same when I am watching all those trailers and gameplay videos on youtube.\n\nUp to now, I only played 3 matches, all TDM.\n\nBefore that, I go quickly through the tutorial, setup my ship, and go for a solo run. I feel no trouble to the control, after I getting into the game I soon get used to it, just like other fps like counter strike or unreal tournament. I have not had a chance to play quake though. It feels like natural, I just can play this. Only one thing is a bit strange: I did not feel acceleration in vector mode when holding down W.\n\nAnd in the first match, I was getting chasing on my ♥♥♥ so hard. And there is also a lvl 44 player on the other team, and our team members are leaving one by one, so I was dying all the time, chasing by like 4 to 5 players each time. Like most other guys.\n\nBut in the 2nd game that high lvl player was on my side, so I did not die a lot and have a chance to get to 2nd place at the end. 2nd place in my 2nd game.\n\nSo what I wanna say is, this is a totally fair game. If u don't do well, then u don't get good score. And that is what a game all about, just like other games. Even when u play some sports like basketball, if u dont do well, then u just lose, really simple. So I think there is really nothing to complain about. And for those who said that this game is too hard, did u really look at the trailers and the gameplays before buying it? It already looks fast-paced and hardcore in all the videos. So if u cant figure it out, that is your problem. Also btw, the team who make this game is called rage quit.\n\nSo, two things I think which is not good in this game:\n\nFirst: team balance. Team need to be balance everytime a player join or leave the game. I mean, come on, win or lose is not a really big deal in this game. U just enjoy killing and getting killed and crashed and super fast speed and all the crazy things going on. I think the victory or defeated at the end of the game is just... makes the results of the game a little bit different.\n\nSecond: Bugs. Yea I know, every game have bugs and everyone hate bugs. So, like for the boosting bug, I saw other players posted that u need to rebind the W key to make it work. So I think, at least the makers can do some hot fix, maybe just pop up a window to notice the new players that u need to re-bind the W key. Before u guys really fix that bug.\n\nThe rest about this game is all positive. I LOVE THIS GAME!\n\nAlso I wanna say some of my personal thoughts about the crash penalty.\n\nI think it is just reasonable. Because, if there is no penalty to crashes, then we will see players go suicide in every place, just because they dont wanna be killed to let other players score. Besides, u do need to control ur ship, just like in real world. Do u crash ur car onto the wall? No. And it also adds another layer of difficulty and intensity to the game. It works just right. Although some times, I get crashed by some other ships. Yea u can do it if u think that u are getting killed and just run toward that guy. But u still need skill to perform that high-five. And u still get penalty. At least I wont do that.\n\nLast few suggestions to the game, or rather to the developers:\n\nI think you awesome guys can add new game mode, such as: all plasma guns (like those sniper only maps in counter-strike), or some racing mode with racing maps. Oh yea, I really want a racing mode, drive a such high speed jet fighter in a narrow track, OMG, cant wait for that to happen!","January 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Strike Vector reminds me of classics like Quake 3: Arena and Descent but that does not make it a derivative game. The rules are simple; however, learning to control your ship and staying alive while shooting down others requires discipline that is severely missed and hardly seen in modern shooters. The developers have already confirmed that all DLC will not be extra charge so the money used to buy this game is money well spent. If any of this sounds good to you, then buy Strike Vector.","February 6, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even though they both emphasize combat in all dimensions, the SPEED and variety of ways you can move in SV is what really sets it apart from any other shooter. It appears lag-free (playing from NA), runs perfectly, and provides competitive visuals that do well to compliment the mechanics. Gameplay can be VERY fast and twitchy, with varying skill floors across the levels. Suicide (crashing) is penalized in most game modes, and the combination of level design and mobility make it very difficult to play as a camper. At the same time, there is opportunity for sniping sprees, depending on the map, provided you consistently change location to avoid being spotted out. In general though, you can expect a need to be constantly moving, and those able to navigate tight spaces at high speeds while taking shots at other fast movers results in a very high skill cap for the game.","January 28, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowtv/recommended/246700/","snowtv","雪花牌电视机 SnowTV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowtv/","143 products in account","First I have to say that, I have played a lot of shooters. FPS, TPS, MMOS, lots of betas, also includes flight games, like world of warplanes, anyways. I am saying this just to clearify that I am a experienced shooting game players.\n\nI have to say: this game is absolutely meeting my expactation. I have been following this game for... quite a while. Unfortunately, I didn't get beta invitations. But today I can finally play it, and I feel exactly the same when I am watching all those trailers and gameplay videos on youtube.\n\nUp to now, I only played 3 matches, all TDM.\n\nBefore that, I go quickly through the tutorial, setup my ship, and go for a solo run. I feel no trouble to the control, after I getting into the game I soon get used to it, just like other fps like counter strike or unreal tournament. I have not had a chance to play quake though. It feels like natural, I just can play this. Only one thing is a bit strange: I did not feel acceleration in vector mode when holding down W.\n\nAnd in the first match, I was getting chasing on my ♥♥♥ so hard. And there is also a lvl 44 player on the other team, and our team members are leaving one by one, so I was dying all the time, chasing by like 4 to 5 players each time. Like most other guys.\n\nBut in the 2nd game that high lvl player was on my side, so I did not die a lot and have a chance to get to 2nd place at the end. 2nd place in my 2nd game.\n\nSo what I wanna say is, this is a totally fair game. If u don't do well, then u don't get good score. And that is what a game all about, just like other games. Even when u play some sports like basketball, if u dont do well, then u just lose, really simple. So I think there is really nothing to complain about. And for those who said that this game is too hard, did u really look at the trailers and the gameplays before buying it? It already looks fast-paced and hardcore in all the videos. So if u cant figure it out, that is your problem. Also btw, the team who make this game is called rage quit.\n\nSo, two things I think which is not good in this game:\n\nFirst: team balance. Team need to be balance everytime a player join or leave the game. I mean, come on, win or lose is not a really big deal in this game. U just enjoy killing and getting killed and crashed and super fast speed and all the crazy things going on. I think the victory or defeated at the end of the game is just... makes the results of the game a little bit different.\n\nSecond: Bugs. Yea I know, every game have bugs and everyone hate bugs. So, like for the boosting bug, I saw other players posted that u need to rebind the W key to make it work. So I think, at least the makers can do some hot fix, maybe just pop up a window to notice the new players that u need to re-bind the W key. Before u guys really fix that bug.\n\nThe rest about this game is all positive. I LOVE THIS GAME!\n\nAlso I wanna say some of my personal thoughts about the crash penalty.\n\nI think it is just reasonable. Because, if there is no penalty to crashes, then we will see players go suicide in every place, just because they dont wanna be killed to let other players score. Besides, u do need to control ur ship, just like in real world. Do u crash ur car onto the wall? No. And it also adds another layer of difficulty and intensity to the game. It works just right. Although some times, I get crashed by some other ships. Yea u can do it if u think that u are getting killed and just run toward that guy. But u still need skill to perform that high-five. And u still get penalty. At least I wont do that.\n\nLast few suggestions to the game, or rather to the developers:\n\nI think you awesome guys can add new game mode, such as: all plasma guns (like those sniper only maps in counter-strike), or some racing mode with racing maps. Oh yea, I really want a racing mode, drive a such high speed jet fighter in a narrow track, OMG, cant wait for that to happen!","January 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Take your time learning the game as a beginner, there is a lot going on. Rebind your keys to a better format than the default and be sure to rebind AT LEAST the W key since this is REQUIRED and by default it doesn't work (bug).\n\nThis is a FPS in all three dimensions and extremely fast pasted. You must learn to utilize the hover mode and your HUD, first AND third person mode. Obstical avoidance will  become one of your biggest enemies. It took me at least 5 hours of just getting demolished by others and crashing into walls to figure out what I was doing wrong. I'm over that hump now though and thoroughly enjoying the game. I'd say ignore any of the negative reviews of this game below 5 hours at least. I hated it too at first but you just need to stick with it.\n\nThe Unreal Engine that this runs on is fantastic. At 2560x1440 I get 110fps solid on two GTX780s and it looks just wonderful. Maps are beautifully designed, both vast and intricate at the same time. Menu system is great, keybinding works, its fast and easy to find and change settings you need.

And this game has pretty friendly community if you have patience some one will guide you and try and teach you.\n\nThe spirit of the game is somewhat similar to those old-school shooters it gets compared to often like UT or Quake. It doesn't have any unlockable weapons etc (only non-gameplay related thing such as skins). It doesn't have any killstreaks or other crap. Strike Vector relies on skillful movement and aiming mechanics. This fact makes nowadays gamers not giving this game enough time and give it a chance.\n\nSo you are going to die alot in the beginning. I don't see this game hardcore in the sense that you must invest several hours a day in it or anything like that. It is hardcore in the sense that you don't get your hand held but instead you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you, if you are not careful. I have some FPS experience and I started getting kills and not being killed consistently before 10 hours of playing.\n\nThe game has great style and graphics. The most important thing in it is that flying feels awesome. Manouvering your ship around tight corners and making quick turns when being chased to grab a couple of repair items to turn around and give your opponent a couple of rockets in the face feels awesome. Many times you are going to crash to a wall when doing it but yeah, thats going to be your own fault. Who never said that flying fast in tight spaces are easy?\n\nShooting also feels great. Weapon sound effects are awesome. Weapons have variation and support various play styles. The fact that you need to lead your target depending on your weapon makes shooting not easy. You know how this effects the feeling when you get a kill? I'll tell you. It feels awesome. It is a small achievement itself. YOU made it happen, not autoaim, not your killstreak, not even luck.\n\nTo summarize:\n-Awesome game with awesome flying and shooting\n-Skill is a thing in this game (which you will get if you keep playing don't be frightened)\n-Buy this game","March 5, 2015","true","30.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is not much people playing, but that is no excuse for all these people to make negative reviews towards this game. If all the people who complain about empty servers actually stuck with the game then there wouldn't be such a problem....thus such a complaint shouldn't be made towards any other game. Its the players fault that there is so few servers to play on, nuff said. Now back to the review;\n\nPROS\n+Great graphics, The visuals and backgrounds and textures all work well together as well as the animations\n+Great HUD, has cockpit display if im correct but switching between 3rd Person and 1st Person can be useful and can be emersive!\n+Ship Customization! Once you level up you can choose from a decent variety of cockpits, wings, tailfins, engines whatever as well as choose from a nice selection of different style guns to fill up 2 slots as well as choose each weapons specialty whether you want it more penetratable, faster shot etc. As well as a supportive item like cloaking or anti tracking etc\n+great open maps!\n+Still updates and additions even after major drop in playerbase <3\n+Partial Controller supportive.....not all....but just enough!\n+All players fight with personal skill and not better weaponry since everyone has the option to choose the same parts on there ship!\n\nCONS\n-Player count. But as i said, this is the players fault\n-No Ai (could fill the empty online void people complain about if we did have Ai)\n-No Campaign, strictly online when i last checked (will update review if im wrong)\n-Someone complimented my mother!\n\nIts a fun game. There aint to many populated servers but please just pick this gem up, help with that problem and lets try and show better support and care for this game!","June 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So if you played SSI/Z, you will have quite a headstart over other players.\n\nFor thoese who have not played SSZ/I, Strike Vector offers a fast paced flying shooter, just imagine unreal tournament with jetpacks. All weapons and perks are unlocked right from the start and you can chooese your loadouts any time after a death or at the start of a match.\n\nThe game offers multiple different weapons, you can chooese to either dual weld the same, or equip any different types on your left and right side. Each weapon can equip two perks, such as faster reload, more damage, etc. Power ups can be obtained during the game itself, low on health? Grab a repair powerup. Cooldown for skill taking too long? Grab the cooldown powerup! There are also damage, defense and speed powerups which drop from drones.\n\nAll weapons have infinite ammo. Even for weapons that have an ammo count, you just need to reload and voila, back to full ammo. So you can spam with impunity. Just remember, if you can, so can your enemy.\n\nAs can be expected from a BETA, there are problems, mostly regarding server connection. Server connection can only be described as "rubberbanding" at the moment. This is mainly because some countries dont have a localised server and they have to join other countries, when someone like that joins in, the whole server lags. Another problem is that there is no reload button, making it a tad bit annoying at times.\n\nOne thing some people might not like, the game is extermely punishing to crashing and team killing. Do either of them and its a -100 and -150 exp appropriately. Doing either will also drop your number of kills by 1.\n\nIf you love progression, you might want to reconsider getting Strike vector. All weapons and perks are given right at the start, the only progression in the game is to unlock cosmectic items. This on the other hand might be a plus for some others.","January 30, 2014","true","16.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Footpussy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burnmastaflex/","32 products in account","This game is amazing technically.  It looks great, the controls are awesome, and even if you are terrible, it is a joy just to fly around.\n\nThe ability to hover and strafe is amazing too.  Overall, RageQuit have made a very impressive game that should have become super popular, even a staple for the Steam community.  However, I feel it has one fatal flaw:\n\nIt's too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed difficult.\n\nI know the game wasn't designed to appeal to everybody, or become the next Hat Simulator 2.  I know RageQuit prided themselves on creating something that elite gamers from the classic multiplayer era of shooters would appreciate.  All the same, the difficulty curve is jacked.\n\nReally, there is no difficulty curve.  It's a friggin' difficulty wall.  You'll be playing gainst people just as bad as yourself and still struggling to topfrag with 3 kills after the time limit is up.\n\nThe reason games like TF2, DOTA 2, and CS:GO developed such substantial followings is because a new person can pick it up and still somewhat try to contribute to their team, plus learn little by little along the way.  When a new player has 2 kills and 15 deaths in CS:GO, they feel like they can eventually learn and aren't discouraged.\n\nPsychologically, there aren't enough payoffs here.  You may never kill anyone.  A lot of the weapons need to be led, and both you and your opponents move not across planes like a ground-based shooter, you're floating in 360 degree space.  A lot of the hitscan/locking weapons are too weak.  It's frustrating as hell, and not because your opponant is more skilled; they might not even know they evaded your attacks as you fly into yet another wall.  In fact, you might die to crashing more than anything else.\n\nWhat's hilarious about all of this is the game gives you visual rewards for EVERYTHING, Call of Duty style.  That's a game designed for console users and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, hardly the ultimate proving ground of FPS skill that this game claims to be.\n\nI'm not a total baddie as far as FPS's go, and early 2000's is my favorite era for shooters as well.  All the same, I would rather face the best player in the world in Quake 3 than one moderately practiced player in this game.  At least I might get lucky with the railgun once in awhile.  At least Q3 had an audible hit indicator, plus not every single weapon required the precision of an industrial robot to use.\n\nI would like to see this game re-released easier to use wepons, less penality for colliding with walls, and maybe environments where everything isn't the same dingy color has your opponents.  A bot mode would have helped too.  This game could have filled a very unique niche, but as it is, I can't find anyone to play on the servers.  ANYWHERE.  No one else had the patience to weather the crazy difficulty curve,a nd those who did probably got tired of waiting around for hours to play NOBODY.\n\nLike I said, it's got potential, it's just not accessible yet.","April 4, 2015","false","8.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

There is not much people playing, but that is no excuse for all these people to make negative reviews towards this game. If all the people who complain about empty servers actually stuck with the game then there wouldn't be such a problem....thus such a complaint shouldn't be made towards any other game. Its the players fault that there is so few servers to play on, nuff said. Now back to the review;\n\nPROS\n+Great graphics, The visuals and backgrounds and textures all work well together as well as the animations\n+Great HUD, has cockpit display if im correct but switching between 3rd Person and 1st Person can be useful and can be emersive!\n+Ship Customization! Once you level up you can choose from a decent variety of cockpits, wings, tailfins, engines whatever as well as choose from a nice selection of different style guns to fill up 2 slots as well as choose each weapons specialty whether you want it more penetratable, faster shot etc. As well as a supportive item like cloaking or anti tracking etc\n+great open maps!\n+Still updates and additions even after major drop in playerbase <3\n+Partial Controller supportive.....not all....but just enough!\n+All players fight with personal skill and not better weaponry since everyone has the option to choose the same parts on there ship!\n\nCONS\n-Player count. But as i said, this is the players fault\n-No Ai (could fill the empty online void people complain about if we did have Ai)\n-No Campaign, strictly online when i last checked (will update review if im wrong)\n-Someone complimented my mother!\n\nIts a fun game. There aint to many populated servers but please just pick this gem up, help with that problem and lets try and show better support and care for this game!","June 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So if you played SSI/Z, you will have quite a headstart over other players.\n\nFor thoese who have not played SSZ/I, Strike Vector offers a fast paced flying shooter, just imagine unreal tournament with jetpacks. All weapons and perks are unlocked right from the start and you can chooese your loadouts any time after a death or at the start of a match.\n\nThe game offers multiple different weapons, you can chooese to either dual weld the same, or equip any different types on your left and right side. Each weapon can equip two perks, such as faster reload, more damage, etc. Power ups can be obtained during the game itself, low on health? Grab a repair powerup. Cooldown for skill taking too long? Grab the cooldown powerup! There are also damage, defense and speed powerups which drop from drones.\n\nAll weapons have infinite ammo. Even for weapons that have an ammo count, you just need to reload and voila, back to full ammo. So you can spam with impunity. Just remember, if you can, so can your enemy.\n\nAs can be expected from a BETA, there are problems, mostly regarding server connection. Server connection can only be described as "rubberbanding" at the moment. This is mainly because some countries dont have a localised server and they have to join other countries, when someone like that joins in, the whole server lags. Another problem is that there is no reload button, making it a tad bit annoying at times.\n\nOne thing some people might not like, the game is extermely punishing to crashing and team killing. Do either of them and its a -100 and -150 exp appropriately. Doing either will also drop your number of kills by 1.\n\nIf you love progression, you might want to reconsider getting Strike vector. All weapons and perks are given right at the start, the only progression in the game is to unlock cosmectic items. This on the other hand might be a plus for some others.","January 30, 2014","true","16.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

(did i mention, volcanic space station? seriously, how ♥♥♥♥ed up awesome is that) all of which look phenominally gorgeous.\n\ngameplay wise it is definitely the closest thing on the market right now that blends "Quake" style arena deathmatch action with dog fights. Although the game devs try and make it seem like there's this HUGE learning curve to it, it's not actually all too bad. The flying  mechanics are a little tricky at first, and so are the weapons, buuut after about 4 hours i situated myself with the combat and flying quite well. (Also the 1-player time trial mode is very fun and rewarding)\n\ncons though, the game is a bit of a ghost town at this point if you play at about 4-5am there's almost no one on, and weapon selection feels a little limited, however powerups and a few customizable perks help remedy this.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTL:DR version\n\nStrike Vector makes you feel like a badass when you play it, and sweet graphics and gameplay to boot. I recommend this to anyone who has ever had fantasies of blowing ♥♥♥♥ up in a sweet spaceship.\n\nThe game is just getting harder to find players to actually play with.\n\nSolid 8/10","October 14, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The mouse acceleration is so fidgety it makes aiming nigh impossible, even at the lowest settings.  One small movement of the mouse & the cursor is sent accross the screen.  I asked other players in the game & they said they weren't experiencing any problems with it, but I'm having such a hard time aiming it's just impossible to do anything other than die by being shot down or crashing.  After an hour of trying to figure out what was wrong  the problem still persists.  Expect lots of fiddling with the controls & having a high learning curve of getting used to them before you're even able to get one kill or be of any use to your team.\n\nThis is NOT a game you can jump in & easily play... This is one of those games where players need to spend hours at first just to even know how to aim.  Therefore, I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that it does not appeal to the casual players.  If you are a casual, stay away from this.

Everyone is constantly moving in fighter mode and equipped with homing missiles. Too many things home in on you for something being advertised as an arena shooter, so don't bother strafing in Harrier mode either. Since Harrier mode is absolutely useless, it's all about dogfighting. There are already a number of both single and multiplayer games that do dogfighting in a superior/more functional manner. The maps are cluttered mazes with vast open spaces surrounding them, leaving no functionality for Harrier mode, and more often than not I see players dying more often to suicides via crashes than actually dying to enemy players. The game description on the store page says:\n\n"you create your own class :\n\n- Fast and stealthy to capture positions and hide in massive structure to surprise your enemies.\n\n- Heavy and powerful to defend strategic points or assault enemies defenses."\n\nDefending points is simply just dogfighting in one area, and it's not like anyone in a given server actually has enough motivation to capture the point over just simply fighting the other team. Hiding in structures in Harrier mode hasn't done anyone any good because of the aforementioned problems. Customization doesn't seem relevant since you'll be looking at a silhouette of a ship with a red rhombus surrounding it and the player's name on top of it, and you can easily switch out weapons during respawn. The only mode that seems to work from a pure gameplay aspect is CTF.\n\nThe game is buggy to the point where I feel like I purchased a beta instead of a finished product. The best and most easily recreatable examples I can cite are: 1) I've been sent back to the splash screen at LEAST 4 times from mid-battle for reasons I cannot fathom and 2) The homing mine states that it homes in on the closest enemy, but it will trigger on allies as well.\n\nThe positive parts of the game I can note are that I can go fast, there are no weapons that need to be unlocked, and the maps look good enough for something built on Unreal 3.\n\nThe idea is nice but the execution has proved less than stellar. Do not recommend.","January 28, 2014","false","1.2"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

I heard "Free DLC" and "Only 20 dollars for a finished game!" I was excited. But then I tried playing it, and it's abysmal. The whole game is irritatingly disorienting, players are seemingly impossible to hit, and you will most likely end up with a negative score in every game, unless the other players are worse than you.\n\nThe game has one of those weird systems where instead of actually aiming where you move your mouse, and being accurate to your movements, it tries to make things seem "realistic" by adding an obnoxious sway when you move your mouse. It also seems like only a few of the weapons are worth using, and upon talking to other people in game, they agreed that there were only a couple of set ups worth using. And whenever I used those, I felt kinda dirty since they were all homing weapons. Like what's the point of a first person shooter if I can't actually ♥♥♥♥ing aim?\n\nFor some reason, servers will just disconnect you and no reason as to why appears on the screen, on top of the fact that the game has customization options you can't actually use. It allows you to change your colors, but as soon as you change it it just changes back.\n\nIf someone could give some major advice that would make this enjoyable AND playable, it'd be great, since the game looks really good, and I feel like I should be having fun.\n","January 31, 2014","false","1.0"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","1"

The graphics don't look much better than games released 15 years ago (Descent 2 comes to mind). I could barely even read the text for the weapons/components/etc. in the hangar. The gameplay grew boring and stagnant after about 10 minutes, and I've always been a fan of arena style fps, so it's not even that I hate the genre. There is just nothing interesting about it. The locations are all pretty generic, the weapons are neat for the first 2 minutes but don't bring anything new to the table. The controls felt like a joystick in a tub of sour cream. The sound was just as bad as the graphics.  At the end of the day, is this game worth $20? No. Not when you can get Strike Suit Zero for the same price and Strike Suit Infinity for $7, which are both MUCH better than this. Dear Ragequit: please rage quit.

Instead I'm greeted with a "Just hop into a server, and good luck." Which really doesn't work out when you have one experienced player from before release, or just a flight combat veteran dominating primarily the rest of everyone else due to inexperience.\n\nThere wasn't a moment that it felt like being outside of Jet mode served purpose to battling as much as it does to make really sharp turns around obstacles to try and shake off anyone on your tail. That really is the only thing twitchy about it. Sometimes you can go into Harrier mode from far away, and try a bit at long range combat although you're likely to have someone speed right past you with a shotgun and rocket launcher to the face as you sit somewhat idle.\n\nI was surprised to find this game still feels like it's in beta. I hate to see this game does not refresh the server listings properly with incorrect player counts, maps, and modes as I found myself many times joining a server that said it was in TDM mode with 11/12 players as a regular DM with just myself in it.\n\nUnder the menu I wasn't too surprised that there isn't many graphical options being this came from a small team. That didn't become an issue for me as I had solid performance all the way through on a GTX 760. At least you can rebind all your keys from what it seemed, but that won't help much when you're trying to get into this game.\n\nIt's just that I could of played War Thunder or Star Conflict for free and end up having a better time.\nI wouldn't pick this up unless you're a hardcore fan of flight combat because the learning curve is really high.","January 28, 2014","false","0.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The same program allows them to lie to the server(even offical ones) and have people booted to the title screen. If anyone complains or mentions what they are doing, they are usually swiftly removed. If two of the people using the program are in the same match, it's a rush to see which one can kick the other off the server first.\n\nThis is a GREAT game.

It is the Superman 64 of this generation. DO NOT BUY IT.\n\nIf someone gives it to you, do not accept it. It is garbage.\n\nThe sound fades in and out constantly which makes the seemingly simple task of flying a disorienting, often nauseating experience. Ships are near-impossible to pilot. Instead of "Strike Vector" they should've named it "fiery crash simulator." This might be due to the wonky control scheme that requires 14 fingers to work properly. As I am lacking the additional digits, my experience with this game has been mostly negative.\n\nThe levels all look like they were developed in 1999 by a novice graphic design student. The netcode is so bad that all gameplay is reduced to spray-and-pray or maining the OP weapons that just aren't fun to use. You want unlocks? You want progression? Well you might want to try your luck elswhere. Half of the 10 weapons (yes, only 10) available are useless. The crosshairs might as well not exist. What was that orange thing?

This is Quake III with Jets. And it's amazing.\nPhenomenally good twitch gameplay, tight controls, all weapons/perks/special abilities are unlocked from the start, and it looks absolutely gorgeous.\nRight then, now to what I don't like about this game.\n1: Lack of a proper tutorial. This is huge. Considering the depth of the movement system and brutally steep learning curve, this is something they had to have and they don't have it.\n2: 4 graphics options. If you have low FPS in this game, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck.\n3: Few game-modes. Hopefully things will go according to plan as Ragequit says and new game-modes will be added over time. I like the modes they have, but they'll have to come up with something new if I'm going to stay interested in playing this game other than casually.\n4: Lack of variety in maps. Every map is a large space with a massive floating platform in the middle or a small space with a large tower in the middle. INB4 OP played 1600 of TF2 and is complaining about lack of variety in maps.\nOverall, I think it's a good game and worth the buy if just for the combat. There is definitely room for a lot of improvement though.","February 2, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's fast, it's fun, it's (as they advertise) BRUTAL!  Kills are very satisfying and it is a true 360 degree kill zone experience.\n\n-For Newbs-\n\nThis is not Call of Duty.  I say this because the FPS genre has been dumbed down dramatically by that series.  Strike Vector is much more skill-oriented than CoD.  That said, if you're looking for a space-like shooter and are willing to not give up after an hour of crashing, then I suggest picking this up. Once you learn the movement system, the game is a marvel.  I can't stress enough the importance of learning the movement.  When I started playing the game, I spent a couple hours literally just crashing everywhere until I finally understood how it worked.  Now I'm just completely unstoppable :D.  If you don't learn the movement, just rename this to Crashing: The Game.\n\n\n-For High Level Players-\n\nThis is, as I originally wrote, Quake meets Descent/Star Fox/X-Wing etc...  There are even some familiar visuals which you can customize your 'Vector' with (ie: star fox and x-wing looking parts).  Most of the weapons are lead based except for the shotgun which appears to be the only hitscan weapon in the game.  Some minor weapon balancing does need to go into the game, however it is pretty balanced as it is.  There isn't anything really OP, you can pretty much dominate with everything.  The inner DMer in me has awoken.\n\n\nThe game has its typical indie hiccups (nothing dramatic or game breaking), but that said, I still recommend picking this up.\n\n(On a side note, I have a Wii Classic Controller plugged into my PC through an adapter.  This was causing some gameplay issues that were immediately fixed upon unplugging the controller from the adapter.  Could have just been my controller inputting commands as the game has controller support.)","February 1, 2014","true","32.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Very fast paced just like Unreal and Quake. Once you start playing and start learning some skill you start using other weapons aside from dual homing like a noob. Once you get some kills under your belt you really feel like you earned those kills in tense dog-fights.\n\nThere are NO mini-transactions. ALL weapons and perks/skills are unlocked from the start. As you play you unlock new art for your profile and new (visual only) parts for your Vector. This game is based on SKILL to get kills and stay alive. Most fun I've had in years.\n\nTHIS GAME IS A BLAST!!!! If you like multiplayer shooters and you're sick to death of all the CoD/MoH games and clones, Strike Vector is THE GAME for You!!!

Not many players, Controls aren't very responsive in my opinion, and lack a satisfying feel. Graphics are great, dog fighing is fun, Crashing into things is easy, but I would say in terms of how little this game has to offer, the real kick would have come from an excellent piloting experience and a ton of players..which it doesn't really have. I'm afraid to say that Hawken feels much more authentic in it's handling of a cockpit feel. That being said, it's still somewhat addicting and there's a ton of customizing to keep you interested.

In Strike Vector you play as a pilot of an air Vehicle, its not a mech its more like a jet that can transition into Vtol mode, as for appearance, the vehicles remind me a lot of something out of Macross or Robotech, crossed between Hawken. The maps and environments remind me of Hawken maps aesthetically and that coupled with the full range of movement you get out of a Vtol ship is just a pretty wonderful experience. In the garage you can customize your ship with weapons and unlocks, all weapons are unlocked from the start so all of the progression is aesthetic in nature so the game is not unbalanced, you can equip 2 weapons to your ship, an equipment and a specialty. This ability to vary equipment provides many available strategys to be used, and helps your ship feel a little bit more unique during those close quarters aerial dogfights.\n\nOverall, I could not find any real fault with the game, it does not do anything bad, the only thing worth noting is there are not very many players, and once the free weekend comes to a close I would bet the number will drop down substantially. Should you be looking for a game that falls in this same genre, I have a feeling you might have fun with Strike Vector.","August 8, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I can't put it down. The only thing I would bemoan are the somewhat low playercounts at non-peak times, but that's only because I work at night and nobody plays videogames at noon on weekdays.\n\nOverall, a good 8/10. If the promised patches and free content drops fix polish issues and add new features, gamemodes and maps, this game has the potential to climb to an easy 9.5/10, or even hit a perfect for me.

Feels sort of more like your a guy with a jetpack then a space ♥♥♥♥ as you can be a very close range flying really fast next to the enemy. or a hold back and support type of role. And if your not very good at flying it doesnt matter since when you switch fly mode more of a turret then a plane which is a nice change up.

Of course, it doesn't matter, since it has NOTHING to do with the REAL game that is multiplayer.  Of course, waiting in an empty bus station for a bus that isn't running that day is good practice for the multiplayer, since nobody is really playing.\n\nThis game could have been cool, but instead it's nearly-impenetrable in difficulty, that is, if you could find somebody to play it with at all.

I even quit, said its a horrible game, and didn't played it for months.\n\nBut I got back into it one day and began to just fly, appreciating the intricate maps(going into tight spaces and turns at high speed), Then my friends and I did it together to see who crashes first. Point being we got good at flying.\n\nLater on we added missles and guns to our friendly chases. We then noticed in public games we were faster and more accurate than most. Point being we got good at shooting.\n\nThe game isnt dying, its filtering. The harsh learning curve of dying over and over in public matches could be a turn off for newbies(it happened to me). Theres plenty of players still playing and they are the best at flying, manuevering, and gunning. So if you're up for a challange at high velocity pursuits with missles, guns, and buildings streaming pass, this is for you. Just make your own learning curve.\n\n","August 7, 2014","true","28.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You level up in Strtike vector, however I think all the unlockables are cosmetic.  If you enjoyed games like Unreal tournament/championship, extreme g 64, or just bored of the same-old military style shooter, you gotta pick up strike vector.\n\nAlso this game has the plasma gun, whihc is just like the lightning gun from the unreal series.

Of course, waiting in an empty bus station for a bus that isn't running that day is good practice for the multiplayer, since nobody is really playing.\n\nThis game could have been cool, but instead it's nearly-impenetrable in difficulty, that is, if you could find somebody to play it with at all.

In one movement mode your aircraft will decide on its own when it would like to roll, whereas in the other movement mode you can no longer yaw or strafe up/down with VTOL controls.  Sometimes there is a cooldown between when you can switch these modes- but not always.  If you enter a boost in one mode you'll get a boost, but if you enter in the other mode nothing will happen.  Your mouse inputs and facing increase to high deltas between your vehicle heading and actual mouse direction, making firing projectiles and controlling your true heading messy and counter intuitive.\n\nThe array of weapons is interesting, and the customization options are very cool.  The art is great, the game looks really nice, and the sound design is also good.  I would recommend this game, if the controls weren't such a frustrating and dissappointing mess.","February 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
