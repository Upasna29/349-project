Is it all intentional?  Yes, quite possibly.  I decided to pick this up particularly because of it's mid 90's "shareware" graphics and I was pleasantly surprised to find a halfway decent game underneath.  If you grew up playing games like Blood, Blake Stone, Shadow Warrior, Rise of the Triad, or any of those first person DOS games, you'll feel right at home.\n\nExcellent roguelike design, lots of interesting unlockables and persistence, tons of stuff to see and experience, quaint set of humor, and genre appropriate difficulty make this ruddy shooter worth the purchase and the time involved.  ...Just make sure to mute the music early.","April 24, 2014","true","4.2"," 146 of 183 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","146","183","3","5"

If you don't like old school (and I mean, Doom/Quake era) gameplay and hardcore randomization, then you shouldn't buy this game. That being said, if you enjoy either/both or are open minded, this could be right up your alley.\n\nRogue Shooter blends rogue-like elements (permadeath, random levels/items) with gunplay from the shooters of yore. It does have a couple of technical limitations (the lack of a volume slider, locked resolution, and oddball fullscreen modes), but the gameplay more than makes up for it. Weapons feel satisfying and varied, enemies are diverse, and levels (while basic) are never quite the same. Furthermore, the higher difficulties are challenging and give you a good space to grow into as you graduate from noob to veteran.\n\nIf you're a fan of modern roguelike hybrids, classic shooters, or just plain old innovative games, then Rogue Shooter is worth a shot.

It has retro-borderlands style graphics and the loot mechanics are comparable to that of your basic roguelike game.\n\nPick your background (prisoner, scientist etc., and there are a LOT!) which essentially defines what you start with in your inventory. You move up randomly generated floors and find loot and kill monsters for exp. When you level, you can unlock a perk (and there are quite a bit to choose from). You can combine materials that you find to create anything from useful items to experimental syringes that yield random buffs/debuffs.\n\nMovement is different than most first person games, whereas you cannot look up or down, but only left and right. You manage your inventory in real time (you'll be doing this quite a bit considering all the items you'll be picking up). You'll also be hacking (mouse cursor dodging mini-game) datapads in real time too so best to clear the floor of enemies before attempting this. You get a random amount of credits (possibly other rewards) for successful hacking attempts.\n\nWhen you die, you start over, but the 'intel' acquired is persistent. You acquire more and more intel as you replay the game more and more, and with more intel comes more unlockables whether that's more available perks, backgrounds and enemies.\n\nMy only gripe is that there are many dead ends, but because you move quite fast (what with the fast paced gameplay), it's negligible.\n[Edit] The music also does not loop, so if you're on a floor for some time clearing enemies or hacking datapads, then you'll notice the music will eventually cut out and you'll be left alone in silence.\n\nFor the current sale price ($4.99) this game is more than worth it. If you're a fan of roguelike games and enjoyed classic shooters like Duke Nukem and Quake, you'll definitely be getting your money's worth.","April 24, 2014","true","1.7"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","68","82","0","0"

I will gladly buy a hundred DLCs to make it better and better. The game combines the best parts of oldschool shooters like DOOM and wolfenstein with the goofiness and roguelike-ness of dungeons of dredmor (another must-buy game on steam.) It provides a very good level of challenge where it keeps you on your toes but never seems unfair. The combat is skill oriented, just like classic shooters, and there are difficult choices to make in regards to things like spending money and which items to hold on to and which to discard. The perk system is actually quite neat, not gimmicky, and all round this is a hell of a lot of fun. My only 'complaint' such as it is would be that it could use some more visual content. As in, more room textures, more types of enemies, that sort of thing. Also, resolution settings would be a huuuuge bonus.

The game had been on Steam barely any time, and they took the money and ran.\n\nSpecifically, the bug I'm mentioning is that you have to redo all the gfx settings every time you start the game. These types of games are meant to be played for 15-30 minutes then you quit and do something else. This bug makes the "natural" way of playing this game more work to start up than it's worth to play.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't too bad. I kinda like it, there's enough different classes that give varying equipment and abilites to keep it interesting for a while, I'd be playing more often if not for the bug. The movement is a floaty, but that's part of the "arcade style" of the game. A way to sell it positively would be to say combat "flows" well.\n\nThe enemy variety is good, as are the level conditions. The weapon variety as well is nice, and you'll develop favorites for different situations or enemies.\n\nI'd recommend this game if not for its total abandonment and multiple standing "minor" bugs.\nI notice it's only $4.99 so if having to reset gfx settings every time you start and having to watch not to upgrade your weapon too much don't phase you, It's fun for what it is, but...

I really wanted to like this game.  Roguelikes are one of my favorite genres and this game just looks so very entertaining.  Unfortunately...  It wasn't.\n\nThis game has been ABANDONED.\n\nThere hasn't been an update in nearly a year.  Now, if this simply meant a lack of new content that would be fine.  The problem here is that this game is broken.  Many players experience debilitating bugs, and I include myself amongst them.  For my part, there seems to be some manner of absolutely unbearable mouse input lag.  The game runs at a smooth 60fps just so long as I DON'T TOUCH THE MOUSE.  If I do, I get the worst stutter I've ever seen.  This is untenable for a first person shooter.  No matter how I tweaked options and settings, nothing I did improved the situation.\n\nSuch a disappointment.  The game is otherwise completely charming.\n\nBuy if you...\nFeel lucky, punk.  Not everyone has bugs that render the game completely unplayable.  You might be one of them.  Kind of a gamble if you ask me.\nAren't lucky, but are a glutton for punishment.  By all means, enjoy.\nDon't buy...\nIf you have anything else better to spend your money on.  I would rather buy tacos.\nIf you don't want to pay for abandonware.The Bottom Line\n\nI wish I could have played this game, but the bugs wouldn't let me do so tolerably.  Perhaps someone out there might make a fan-made patch, or perhaps the developers will come back and fix it.  Where did they go?  Were they eaten by one of their summoned hippos?  If I know anything about hippos, it's that they are hungry hungry, so this seems a likely probability.\n\nIf they emerge from the hippos digestive tract and still have enough of their fingers left to type, then I hope they will fix their game.

Don't worry, the game is completely functional (as far as I know).\n\nRS:TFR (does an acronym go within another acronym?) was one of the relatively few games I voted for on Greenlight. It looked really interesting and I was excited for it to possibly be released. And then it was Greenlit, and came out soon after! Neat! However, it seemed rather bare-bones. It didn't have controller support. It didn't have a lot of enemies. The classes weren't balanced. The game didn't even seem balanced! Surely they'd add more classes, enemies, controller support, weapons, etc. later on, right?\n\nThey didn't, and they won't. The game has had technical patches, so it works. It's just not as much as I expected it to be, going in.\n\nAs for the game itself, it plays like Duke 3D in that you're only allowed to look left and right, not up or down. The levels are randomly generated hallways (with scenery and a theme). Enemies are two-dimensional. Walls are two-dimensional. The creatures and weapons are creative, both in design and strategy. It is a true roguelike in which you go through floor and floor until you reach the 100th (which I haven't achieved). Intel, a rare drop from any enemy, accumulates to unlock more classes, more perks, and more monster bios, which detail their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI'm not so thrilled about everything being two-dimensional and being locked into horizontal aiming. Sure, it's "old-school," but it's not really fun today. Controller support would be great for this title, but I guess it's just too much for the devs to implement. Also, the game was made to run at a much smaller resolution than 1920x1080 and just won't look well if you stretch it out. You can see this with the screenshots - your Steam screenshots end up as a tiny screenshot in the upper left corner of a black canvas. Also, well, you can see it in the art assets. Two-dimensional and low-res.\n\nThe game is fun, but it needs more love from the devs in terms of controller support, content, and maybe better resolution options. Since they're indie, I doubt this game will ever see another update - they've moved on. A good price to pay for this title would be $5.","January 7, 2015","false","4.9"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","5"

It plays like a typical classic shooter akin to Doom, Marathon, Duke Nukem, ect. But one big thing seprating it is the Roguelike RPG elements that the game is based on, when starting you can pick a set of starting equipment such as the Soldier which has a fully loaded assault rifle and some decent armor to start or The Prisoner which starts barebones but can take two Perks instead of one at the start.\n\nOnce you start it's pretty self expanatory. You have 100 randomly generated floors to go through with momentary safe rooms spaced between each one that allows you to Upgrade/Repair weapons and buy ammo and health for the next set of floors. You can find a number of weapons off of Enemies that you fight which can drop on anyfloor off of any enemy ranging from a Realtivly weak Katana to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rocket Launcher.

Don't let the quirky graphics and humour fool you, this title's gameplay is deeper than you'd expect. Numerous enemy and weapon types keep you on your toes, changing your tactics constantly. Gadgets, grenades and stims provide supporting temporary solutions while unlockable perks have a more stable effect.\n\nInitially I wrote that Rogue Shooter is an enjoyable laid-back game, now I would say: Yes and No. With its style it's a perfect title for picking up for a brief relaxing shooting sprees, but it gets more and more hardcore as you press on to further levels: enemies become more numerous and tougher (as do the guns you find and buy, luckily) and you're forced to do some extremely quick thinking on your feet to come out alive.\n\nEasily recommended for the initial price of 4.99, if it's at full price you should propably check out the trailer and the demo to see if this game hits a nerve for you. After 4 hours of playing and feeling like I've only scratched the surface I would recommend it even then, but not everyone gets the nostalgia factor from this game.\n\nWhen considering purchase, it's also worth noting that some other reviews still claim there is no save function in the game. This was the case at the release, forcing you to either uninterrupted play sessions or to leave the game running in the background as you do something else.

It offers a fun challenge, and with 4 different difficulties, the game doesn't have to feel impossible to beat.\nIt has a wide array of weapons to choose from (each having a different effectiveness on the enemies you will encounter in the game), as well as several different items to help you out on your journey.\nAs a roguelike, there is a random element to it, since you won't always encounter the same items and weapons, as well as the same enemies on the same floors (save for bosses), and with environmental hazards thrown into the mix here and there, the game keep things interesting.\nAs you level up, your stats increase and you can choose perks. There are a lot of perks to pick from, and they all help out in different, but essential ways. If you can get far enough, you should end up with all of them.\nAnother great thing was the continuation of updates issued by the developers. They listened to a few common complaints the game used to have and fixed them accordingly, making the game less stale as a whole (some of the updates regarded the balancing of weapons and backgrounds (or classes, if you will), as well as the addition of some more features, and were greatly appreciated). The most important one though, was the save feature, because playing 100 levels in a row was a bit too much.\nIt's true that some people might be turned off by its graphics, or even the music, but then again, this game isn't for everyone, and people will always have different tastes in just about anything. As it currently stands though, I can't help but recommend it quite a lot. It's a fun trip to the top of Helios that I will surely be taking more than once.","May 19, 2014","true","65.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

GET OUT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ping-pong2012/","497 products in account","Edit as of 2015: The author has stopped all development on the game. The late game-breaking bug persists, some people still report a memory leak, and there's no news in sight. If the game is available for 75% off or more I might recommend it as it is interesting, but since it IS broken, I wouldn't suggest anyone try to play it and expect to finish the levels. Unlocks and the game itself still plays fine until level ~90 or so (explicitly when a weapon goes from level 50 to 51, they do no damage)\n\nPositives:\n-loot weapons, you'll probably need them when you run out of this current guns ammo\n-reasonable perk system makes you conflicted over which next upgrades to get as you level up or try different professions\n-author is updating, adding some basic niceties while fixing other things (I have only ran into one bug, very far into the game, which will probably get patched soon)\n-basic FPS behaviors DO NOT work here, game is very fast-paced at the start of a level but you get to take it slower as the level goes on\n-melee is already in, will probably have more rebalancing later\n-COSSACK MODE! KICK WITH BOTH FEET\n-two of the three "bosses" are original in mechanics, yet still fit in perfectly\n\nNegatives\n-weapons are unbalanced here and there, more complex mechanics could benefit them greatly\n-ran into a game-breaking bug, but it's far towards the end of the game and should be easy to fix\n-professions don't mean much as there's nothing inherent to the classes\n-melee is not a good choice as-is\n-levels could use a lot more diversity. if you've played Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup you'll immediately feel like all the levels are pretty mazy, but there's nothing special like a big room, or ramps with one-way drops, or even doors for that matter. If you're looking for Doom-like levels you will be disappointed\n\nOverall 8.5/10. Music, sounds, and visuals are non-grating and fit together, mechanics design is fresh with plenty of room to grow if there's patches, or better, a sequel. Single-player only for the foreseeable future, as overhauls to a lot of mechanics would be needed for a creative co-op experience. Levels get a bit grindy, but it's a roguelike for FPS adrenaline/speed junkies, deal with it. The relative amount of mechanics make it a better choice for someone who wants to try and engage and scavenge as much as possible, but the limits are double edged with unbalances and finiteness to most things. The game is NOT designed to be easy or have a final state where you're basically invincible, every level is threatening.\n\nHonorable mention: The game does not take long to fully unlock everything. After about 10 playthroughs or 10-20 hours, you should have everything and all bonuses. For an indie game, this is definitely a well polished one without any aspects that ruin it by being too easy or too difficult. Some of the information text is silly, but since you don't need to read it at all to play the game, it's a nice separation of the game from the context of the game. Information is terse, useful, and uncomplicated. Really nice to see a game which isn't lacking or overbearing.","May 19, 2014","true","21.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I cannot stress enough how much fun this game is. Each time I play it's completely fresh and the different backgrounds that you can pick when you start really allow you to experiment with playstyle. And it is tough. On hardcore mode (read, normal) I've only made it to level 7. Out of 100. On only the 2nd difficulty.

It's silly, colourful and fun. Anyone who remembers PC gaming in the early Nineties will likely approve. It's a Roguelike/Roguelite/I'm-not-going-to-be-drawn-into-an-internet-squabble-over-semantics FPS, Doom meets Rogue Legacy is the most common comparison I've been hearing, and with good reason. So far the only issue I can place on this game is the Steam Overlay is absolutely unusable, but this is patchable. I'll definitely be playing more of this when I don't need to be sociable.\n\nSide note to the devs; Having a playthrough trailer was a very smart idea; it gave me a good idea of what I was getting into and it was that which earned a sale from me. Doubly important in this day and age when any old pap is coming onto Steam. I am glad my money went to a properly good game and not the next Earth: Year 2066\n\nNow that I've played more:\n\nSome more time later I can say the initial impressions held up but there are some things that I do need to address. Firstly, at this time is is seriously buggy. The music doesn't loop and I've had mooks appear outside of the map (though thankfully close enough for me to boot to death through the wall). I've not had a game breaker so far though a good mate of mine has come across a splintered map with unattached sections. Of course if this game's been patched then ignore this paragraph.\n\nAnother is the graphics and presentation. Personally I am fine with the cheesy cartoon style as not only does it invoke a Blake Stone esque vibe but it is a welcome change from the overly pixelled sprites of similar low-resource games. Still, it's not to everyone's style and if the screenshots bug you, seeing it in action won't win you over.\n\nOnce all is said and done, I can see myself returning to this game fairly regularily and giving it a bash. The numerous classes and the randomisation definitely have lasting appeal, like other such games.","April 24, 2014","true","7.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The mood and the atmosphere, though on the lighter side, really bring it all together into a perfect nostalgic FPS package that I found to be what I was looking for, even without directly looking for it.\n\nOn top of that, it's a good game. It's cheesy. It's fun. It's simple and easy to get into. It becomes harder as you go along. There are lots of options. The enemies are never passive and you can get into some decent firefights with them. The harder the chosen difficulty, the more you'll be running and gunning in constant action.\nIt's also undemanding on resources and you could probably play this just fine on a very old or weak computer.

The randomly generated content lies primarily in the map layout, the level of weapons and armor you pick up, and which enemies you will be facing on each floor. There are some weapons with status effects, and a varity of alternative items like stims, shields, and explosives. It's just enough to allow for a bit of experimentation.\n\nAs you play more you can choose to start with different perks and items, but by floor 20, your loadout will reflect your playstyle rather than the "background" you chose to start with.\n\nThe more you play, the more intel you get, which can be spent on permanent stat upgrades, more backgrounds, and enemy strengths and data. You also unlock story logs which carry on the odd humor of the game. You can play the game fully without touching them though.\n\nBesides each floor being made entirely of corridors and rectangle rooms with texture swaps for the walls, the big flaw with this game are some odd bugs. I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs or crashing, but sometimes you will see a few enemies who have spawned outside the map that you can't shoot, or the music will stop and not start playing until you reach the next floor, and how strange the game window acts, as it if its moved away from the screen's center, strange things happen. Screenshots suck to.\n\nPlaying the demo though shows off quite a bit of what the full games provides for only a couple of the easiest floors. It should expose any bugs that there may be on your system, or if this type of gameplay is your thing.\n\nIf you are craving Chex Quest: The Roguelike. This is the game for you. Just enough content and variety at a $5 price point that allows for cheap, quick, fast-paced, tactical gameplay. What it may lack in the variety of items you may be used to from Binding of Isaac, it's quirky humor, lively enemies, and plenty of opportunity for thoughtful experimentation, it holds its own, if you keep in mind what kind of games its drawing inspiration from, classic old-school shooters.\n\nLike I said, it's pretty much Chex Quest with more corridors.","May 4, 2014","true","9.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Whether or not it is, this is still a great game, especially for the price. The cell shaded graphics are pleasant to look at, and there's a good enemy variety consisting of robots, aliens, plants, humans (I think?), etc. The "rogulike" elements come in the fact you get a random map layout for each floor everytime you play, with random enemies, and death is permanent.\n\nAs you go along you collect "intel" which is just experience, allowing you to level up your current character and provide him skill perks, but also your cumulative intel will allow you to unlock new 'backgrounds' (which determine your starting inventory and what title your character has on their memorial when you die), enemy weaknesses, recipes for crafting and upgrade points, which give you permanent increases to health, damage and inventory space.\n\nThe gameplay itself is reminiscent of DOOM or Duke Nukem 3D, with a fixed perspective and fast movement. The weapons are outrageous as well, as besides standard pistols, shotguns, machine guns, and the like, you get a Dog Launcher (no, seriously) a Shotgun Trident (just how it sounds), a Quicksand Gun (DoT to enemies who walk over it) and other crazy weapons.\n\nIs this game good? If it was more expensive I'd say it's not worth it, but at this price point, this is a very good game, and worth every dollar of your purchase.\n\nEDIT: Almost forgot one thing. The game features 50 floors (on Easycore Mode) and 100 floors on other difficulties but at this time there is no save feature, whether that be a quicksave, auto save, or even checkpoints. So keep that in mind as well when you're purchasing it.","April 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I tried it, liked it, bought it... but there was no save function.\n\nThat, however has been added in, removing the one and only real problem I had with this game.  And that's great, because I really like this one alot.\n\nThis game is exactly what the title says: A combination of an FPS and a Roguelike.   When it says "FPS", it generally means those done in the Doom/Duke3D/Wolfenstein style... older FPS games where the combat was fast, you had to actually dodge enemy projectiles (no cover systems here!), and there were maze-like levels to explore full of goodies to pick up, and a large variety of unique enemies.\n\nThis takes all of those elements, and replicates them well.  I particularly like some of the enemy design/behavior... there's some creative ones in here, in terms of what they do and how they attack (a couple can attack by hugging you and sticking to your screen.  No, really.), and I really like that some of them will actively try to dodge your attacks, leaping quickly to the side, or even firing at you a couple of times, and then running off down some random corridor, only to come at you from a different angle later.  That's pretty neat to see.\n\nThe roguelike elements are done well also.  You've got your typical permadeath, as well as the full randomization and murderous difficulty that you'd expect.  There's alot of different items and weapons to find, randomized with all sorts of different stats and special effects, with all equippable items being breakable, as they lose durability when you get hit, though you can fix them with tools once you reach a safe room.  You also have the ability to craft various things, there's alot of special items to find like grenades that triple the damage you do to the enemy after hitting them with it, or holographic decoys, and all sorts of other stuff.  There's various other mechanics to the game as well.\n\nAs in most roguelikes though you're gonna be hard-pressed to keep a good supply of stuff going.  Ammo isnt always so easy to come by, so you need to be careful, aim well, and conserve your shots to make the best of it and be efficient.\n\n\nThat being said, this game isnt for everyone.  If you dont like Doom-style games, you wont like this one.  Same for roguelikes in general.... all levels are *completely* randomized, and just like with basically all roguelikes, the game as a whole is repetetive.  Which is fine if you're used to that sort of game (seriously, most roguelikes really do get quite repetetive).  And you've gotta be able to handle the difficulty and the dying over and over.\n\nAnd if you're the sort that considers graphics and such to be important... yeah, this isnt for you.  Dont get me wrong.  I dont think this is a bad looking game.  The artstyle entertains me and I like the overall aesthetic.  But like a great many indie titles, the graphics are quite limited overall.  But this doesnt affect the gameplay one bit, so.... like it or leave it, up to you.\n\n\nOverall, yeah, I recommend this one.  I'm having a blast with it, and it's going to get alot of play time from me.  It's exactly my sort of thing.  Hopefully, it might be yours as well.","May 4, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game itself is actually very fun and can be pretty addicting. It incorporates elements of old school shooters with a few elements of modern shooters (reloading, only equipping two weapons at a time) that meld nicely together. The best part (and the selling factor to me) is how the game so successfully incorporates elements of traditional rogue-lites. Many things you'd expect from the genre is here- Permadeath with the ability of permanent stat upgrades, item randomization, stage randomization, and of course the ability to make the game unforgivingly difficult if you please, wrapped up in a first-person-shooter styling. Finish all that off with some simple yet pleasing graphics, and a large dose of humor (I couldn't help but chuckle to learn Strong Throngs long to belong and wear thongs) and you have a surprisingly fun game for such a low price.\nIf you like traditional shooters and/or roguelikes, I'd highly recommend picking this entertaining game up.","April 22","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Rogue Shooter is not without it's flaws, the graphics are pretty basic, sound effects are nothing special, and a hundred floors doesn't seem so bad until it takes you an hour to get to floor twenty, but it's fast paced gameplay, off-beat humor, and variety in weapons makes up for it. You choose a class and some perks that you get more of as you level up and start blasting your way through each floor. Weapons degrade with use, but can be repaired and even upgraded in the safe rooms every fourth floor to maximize their damage.

You're the one-man-army to kill them all. Each game of Rogue Shooter is a 100-level tour-de-force tasking you to clean at least 50% of a floor's enemies, and not get killed by them. As is custom for any game with "roguel" in the title the levels are randomly generated, and there are some light RPG mechanics in place. Your base equipment is determined by your "background training" (soldier, scientist... ninja, MUSICIAN), and as you gain experience you are able to get "perks"- small useful skills. All of this is useful because at the core there's really just a lot of speedy gunfighting against increasingly powerful and tough enemies.\n\nFor Rogue Shooter this all works really well. The levels are small enough to be cleared within a few minutes; the absolutely random grid layout quickly gets old but then again, you're not here to enjoy the scenery. While there aren't really that many different enemy types each has at least something that makes them unique. Some grab onto you, slowing you down, some throw flash grenades, some explode after death, you get the idea. The classes are a nice touch; even nicer are the perk that really allow you to buff strengths or cover weaknesses: Often out of ammo? Get a perk that makes you find more. Good at shooting already? Pick a perk to add critical hits to the mix.\n\nAs you kill enemies you also gain "intel", an odd in-game currency that unlocks more perks, backgrounds, enemy infos and crafting recipes. Clearly designed to give the player some extra incentive to play, it's also used to buy permanent upgrades- similar to Borderlands 2 you can opt to spend intel on bonus health et al that affects all future characters. It's a nice gimmick.\n\nNow, two things must be mentioned: This game is a love-letter to old shooters. As in, really old shooters. If you remember games like Wolfenstein 3D, Blake Stone and probably the first Doom, you know what I am talking about: This game is so intentially ugly that it's approaching "nice looks" from the other side. Add to that some oddly catchy 80s game tunes and you're almost there.\nAlso your tutor is, for some reason, a mime lady. Best not to ask.\n\nIf you like to just shoot at stuff a bit- with often very outlandish weapons (Puppy Launcher... it launches puppies!) - and don't mind the cheerful goofy looks this may very well be a great addition to your library. I mean that: It's charming, it's fast, it's intentionally silly and that's really a major source of it's charme. But it's also a downright decent arcade shooter.\n\nThe latest update removed my only complaint- initially there was no way to ever safe your game, so a full playthrough would have to be made in one session (100 levels, remember!). Now you can at any time "save and exit"; this keeps the risk of permadeath but allows you to take a break.\n\nAlsol, there's a good DEMO that allows you to play the tutorial and a few levels on the easiest difficulty. Due to the fully random nature of the game you'll see a lot in that demo and seriously, you need to see this in action.","April 28, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If anything, the game stretches the graphics to their limit; even with a total of 17 common enemy types, each enemy has its own unique coloration and shape, so that you can tell at a glance which one it is.\n\nThe devs included a great video of a sample playthrough, and I feel like it describes basic mechanics better than I ever could.

It's genuinely funny and well-written. I like the weapons and mechanics, and I really like the data feature which helps you get better over multiple playthroughs.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of things that tell me it's just not ready for market yet. There were four, and I'll list them below.\n\n1) Lack of save. I understand permadeath, but there are A HUNDRED floors in this game. Why not implement FTL-like saving+quitting in case I don't have time to play until death or THE HUNDREDTH floor? Unlike Binding of Isaac, the game is simply too long not to be able to save and come back to it later, and it's not like the difficulty ramps up very steeply so it can get to a point where you're just praying for death.\n\n2) Impossible maps. On my very first playthrough, maybe my third or fourth floor, I realised I was trapped in a square unconnected to the rest of the floor and isolated from the elevator up. This was annoying enough on the single-digit floors but can you imagine your white-hot rage if you were on the 60th floor when this happened? Or the 99th? Surely it would just make sense to ensure there was a route from entrance to elevator on each floor when it generated?\n\n3) Terrible slowdown. The game inexplicably slowed to a crawl on several floors and I couldn't figure out why. The graphics? The number of enemies moving around? The level generation itself? There is no reason a game this light should chug like that on my computer (it's not the best machine but it runs other, heavier games just fine).\n\n4) Music stops. This is purely aesthetic but really does affect the enjoyment of the game. I found several times that the music stopped after a while, maybe after the track finished once, and it didn't repeat. I was just running around in silence except for the meagre sound effects and it just wasn't very fun. If none of the other things I've listed were there, I probably would let this one slide. But in a game where I already have my doubts this kind of just drives home the point that the game's just not done yet.\n\nSo I'd say if you're curious and maybe want to spend a few hours messing around with a new, unique game, pick this up.\n\nBut I just can't give it a recommendation.\n","May 19, 2014","false","8.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There's no full mouselook in the game, only horizontal. enemies seem to swarm very early in the level, you can't jump or run. Worst of all, there isn't even a quit and save. Every session you have to stay glued to the computer until you die. Maybe if I played a few more times I'd like it more, but I keep feeling like I have more interesting things to do.

I can not stress this enough, because it really will inform you exactly of what you're getting.\nIt is a pretty niche game, so keep that in mind instead of criticizing it while making unfair comparisons.\n\nDo you still enjoy games like Wolfenstein 3D, Blake Stone and Corridor 7?\nYou'll probably enjoy this!\n\nIt's mostly similar to Corridor 7. Mainly because your mission is to kill all of the creatures on each level and its level design is non-vertical and maze-like. This is why didn't compare it to Doom or Duke Nukem. Vertical leveldesign really does a lot to change the experience.\nHowever, it's obviously also a rogue-like with randomized levels. It's pure pick-up-and-play goodness.\n\nOne of the best aspects of the game is probably the enemy AI and variety. They're actually pretty impressive.\nMost of them have unique abilites and strategies. Very few run straight towards you just to attack you.\n\nQuite a few interesting weapons to find.\nMost weapons are pretty standard fare, but some are actually very unique. For example: a Quicksand rifle that, well, creates quicksand holes underneath the enemies.\n\nThere are however various technical problems\nLimited resolution options. That is, very limited.\nAnd music stops looping at times.\nThere are probably something else weird going on with it but nothing I've encountered yet.\n\nThe following critique is no longer relevant.\nSaving has been implemented just the way it should be!\nAlso a limited save feature (not like quick saving or anything like that) would be appreciated.\nAs of now, there is no saving at all.\nThis is pretty annoying when you've come quite far and want to keep going until you actually die, but can't because, you know, life happens.\n\nSo in summary: It's a great coffee break game for old-school FPS fans with some technical flaws.\nWorth 9.99? It depends on how much you care about the actually quality of the game. I'd say barely. Worth 4.99? Yes!\nBUT REMEMBER: This does not mean it's a bad game. It is pretty freaking great, just a little on the meh side when it comes to music, graphics and the technicalities of the game.","April 26, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If there was more content that was being worked on, then I could understand, however, there have been no news posts in relation to ANYTHING from the developer for OVER a YEAR. How this game is remaining on Steam is beyond my comprehension. The only thing Else I could possibly tell you is DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Stay clear away from this. It is not worth it's price point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigJibblies/recommended/295770/","BigJibblies","IIIStrife","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigJibblies/","206 products in account","This is a game which is a total callback to the old 90s shooters such as Doom, Quake and even Duke Nukem 3D. The game controls exactly like Quake or Doom did, and some weapons are even seemingly inspired if not ripped from said games.\n\nIf you care about graphics more than gameplay... well first get off of this page... RIGHT NOW, but also two, this game ain't for you.\nThe graphics look like something made in MS PAint, which in my opinion only emphasizes the game's attempt at a modern-day game with an oldschool feel.\n\nAlso the game is like Rogue Legacy, is which when you die, that's it, you're dead. Then you go back to a menu to spend points on upgrading stats like health, damage or... I forgot the third option, so you can do better if you can't get better via skill maturity. The game is rather... well it doesn't do anything nobody's done before in that area.\n\nHowever the game has perks, and more importantly tons of guns, RPG-style leveling systems, classes, and even cool items called.. well... they're basically syringes with wierd fluids in them, but don't worry!\nYou can totally get a new perk added on permanently with one kind of stimpack, or you can get super speed, or the ability to see all enemies, or the ability to see secrets in the area.\n\nYeah. The game has secrets too, and they're usually very good.\n\nEverything is actually randomly generated more so than Diablo 3 could ever hope to be, as levels, enemies, secrets and even boss levels are randomly placed. You occasionally get to safe zone levels which let you sell, buy, do quests on occasion... the game is jsut simply nice to play.\n\nDon't expect anything visually or audially stunning, just expect to have a fun time :)\n\nAll in all, there's nothing about this game I dislike, so I give it a 7/10. It's pretty nice, well worth the money i spent on buying it.","July 7, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/recommended/295770/","uncleyar","UncleYar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/","2124 products in account","TLDR: TENTATIVE recommendation.\n\n\nPros:\n\nI found this game to be a very good mix between roguelike and old-school FPS. The action is basically Wolfenstein 3D with more varied enemies, but the roguelike part comes in with the big variety of weapons, gear, ammo, mysterious consumables and crafting elements you pick up.\n\nThe author also has a good sense of humor. Those two words explain it all: dog launcher.\n\nCons:\n\nI didn't experience any bug unlike other people, but I dislike the movement in this game as it's too easy to get stuck on corners while trying to strafe. As a Doom, Duke3D and Wolf3D player I don't remember having that problem with those old-school games.\n\nI think this qualifies as a complete game, and people claiming it's "abandoned" instead of "finished" are crybabies and backseat game designers. This said, you could imagine many ways to improve it. Such as bigger levels with doors, so you don't get half the enemies rushing you around your spawn area, the rest being a simpe mop-up phase. Or levers to pull to trigger stuff, and so on.\n\nLastly, an element I dislike very much (STOP IT roguelike designers) is that you accumulate Intel between runs, a currency that you can use to make future runs easier by buying more health and other stats. This is grinding built into the game, and guarantees that the balance will always be off: when you start playing deeper levels will likely be impossible because they're balanced around a player having unlocked all the stats. When you have unlocked all the stats the earlier levels are gonna be laughably easy and devoid of challenge. Unless you increase the difficulty, but then you're back to square one. Remember kids: there's a reason the best roguelite games such as Spelunky, Ziggurat and Binding of Isaac don't accumulate player power between runs.\n\n\nIn the end despite its numerous flaws I had some fun, so I do recommend to pick it up for its uniqueness. I probably won't stick with the game for long though, when I have better alternatives at hand. Do try out the demo beforehand as some people have reported incompatibility with their hardware.\n","September 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Very challenging.\n\nOn the bad side, it's really hard to go further of the third floor in hardcore mode.

The music is pretty poor, the graphics emulate 90s shooters well but half the sprites look incredibly subpar and the forced low resolution is fairly laughable. The gameplay however is surprisingly deep.\n\nLike any other rogue-like game, the point is to see how far toward the end you can reach within a set of randomly generated levels. This includes item and enemy placement, giving the game some unpredictablity. The cool thing though is the RPG and crafting elements. There's perk points, item durablity, multiple weapon types, starting "class" selection and so on. The game ALSO has a nice sense of humor and odd but childish enemy/weapon designs which helps give itself some charm.\n\nTry the demo.\n\nDevelopers: Please add sound sliders, looped music with revised songs, 360 controller support and the ability to play the game without a mouse.","April 26, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and music are deliberately shareware-tier terrible, but not outrageously so, and they compliment the obviously flippant and non-serious humor present in all the logs and item descriptions. The weapons have a fair amount of variety, the supplementary mechanics give you enough options to keep the game fair, and the core gameplay itself is a treat for fans of old DOS shooters.\n\nIf you're spoiled on modern shooters and don't care for alt-roguelikes, skip this game.

After playing to level 47, dying didn't even feel bad.\n\nAlthough the role selection at the beginning of the game allows for different starting points, it ultimately ends up being the same over-encumbered, armed-to-the-teeth gritty gun-spouting rogue, with a gun system like borderlands, though reduced in variation.\n\nOverall a fun game, but limited playtime per unit money.

Part of the reason why the old shooters, such as doom, duke, shadow warrior, rott, blake stone were so awesome, is because they had interesting map design. In this game the levels are boring corridors/straight lines.\n\nThe game is also poorly balanced / designed in some areas. One is how overpowered the certain "ration" perk is. The game comes down to preserving ammunition, avoiding from getting armor damaged (if you get armor damaged too much it will become expensive to repair). It becomes quickly boring as you cannot sell the items anywhere, like you can in some of the classic roguelikes (you only get to buy from vending machine, you don't actually interract with any "town" shopkeeper so to speak).\n\nThere are better ways to spend not only your money, but more importantly your time.\n\nEDIT: Not big fan of mouse circle strafing. Too much circle strafing here (for me). Prefer the non-mouse gameplay the older games had (without those extreme doom wads), where keyboard strafe + keyboard turning was sufficient enough to dodge stuff, and arrow turning (or "partial mouse support", as in not so accurate mouse) were workable.

If you enjoyed the likes of The Binding of Isaac, this is for you, however keep in mind, it has not the same replayability.\n\nWeapons are punchy and sometimes even funny (Dog launcher, quicksand gun), but always enjoyable. However, the ultimate goal of the game, "reach lvl 100 of the helios station" becomes tedious, or at least repedative despite the inherent replayability of randomly generated level structure. After playing to level 47, dying didn't even feel bad.\n\nAlthough the role selection at the beginning of the game allows for different starting points, it ultimately ends up being the same over-encumbered, armed-to-the-teeth gritty gun-spouting rogue, with a gun system like borderlands, though reduced in variation.\n\nOverall a fun game, but limited playtime per unit money.

Level ups and skills along with a limited inventory that features durability, crafting, and item modifiers give the game a distinctly RPG feel despite its FPS gameplay.

It runs perfectly on my PC, but won't run at all on my laptop, so try the demo first to see if it runs at all on your system. Some people have reported enemies out of bounds and the like, but I don't have those problems, so it looks like it's system-dependent.\n\nFor those of you it does run for, this game is a nice distraction for the price. The graphics and music are deliberately shareware-tier terrible, but not outrageously so, and they compliment the obviously flippant and non-serious humor present in all the logs and item descriptions. The weapons have a fair amount of variety, the supplementary mechanics give you enough options to keep the game fair, and the core gameplay itself is a treat for fans of old DOS shooters.\n\nIf you're spoiled on modern shooters and don't care for alt-roguelikes, skip this game. Otherwise, see if it'll run and catch it on sale.","April 1, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't and can't get past it then don't buy it. Second: who plays a shooter like this with a controller? No one. Third: the enemy designs, interface, controls, weapons, abilities, hidden backstory and classes are all done very well.

Fourth, the game doesn't need updates, at least for me it works just fine. Bottom line is the game is a fun, quick-paced shooter. It's not deep, but it will keep you entertained.

You feel like you run at thirty miles an hour while spraying death wildly at anything in your path, giving them a taste of Duke Nukem's Mighty Boot if they come close.   It plays like it's old, but certainly not bad.  The ultra retro vibe and its dorky self aware humor makes it more fun than it should be.  Seriously, I wish more games had the nonsencial weaponry this game does.\n\nIt is janky, don't get me wrong. It has some annoying optimization problems, and allegedly several bugs that keep it from loading or playing properly.   I sugest giving the demo a shot before taking any word of mouth seriously to see if you have any issues with the game.   My experience has been thus far flawless,  and I've been enjoying pretty much every second of Rogue Shooter as a result.\n\nWell, except the seconds I'm dead, but that kind of goes without saying.","August 15, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
