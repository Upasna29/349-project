As far as buying it to have fun with no hassles I wouldnt.  Sorry guys I really do appreciate the work thus far but the casual gamer would not forgive the glitches as of now. Walking through walls, character disappears from screen, on screen characters popping outta nowhere, lack of indicators (but I did find that eventually.)\n\n5/5 for the casual gamer (hoping that the developers keep working and releasing updates)\n7/10 for me just because\n\nP.s. To the developers feel free to reach me at testyourmetalserver@gmail.com if you need someone to go through how to videos, in case you dont have the time....","April 12","false","4.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","13","24","3","2"

People you need to talk to have no indicator. Once I finally did find where to go I went and got a gun. That alone seems like it could be cool the weapon customization but then I got into combat and it was awful haha. I blame a lot of the issues I had on the idea that they went to steam to fast. Maybe in due time things will improve, at the moment I do not recommend this unless you want to help support the developers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACytaQE6wFk&nohtml5=False","April 11","false","0.9"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","13","30","4","5"
