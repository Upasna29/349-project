But, there is no concern for things like "balance" or "gameplay".\n\nThe game has an XP system. Except you'll max our the trees-that-matter on your units in a few short missions, after which you just spend your XP on generic +1 hp upgrades. Of course, the first mission has infinitely respawning enemies and no time limit, and yes enemies give you XP per kill. So it's trivially easy to just sit on a mostly-won mission and farm up XP if you really care to.\n\nThe game has unit types. Except scouts are worthless since heavy armor shines so much in comparison to light armor. For 200-points-per-unit, you can have a heavy armor soldier who can stand in an open field and kill any enemy troop that is not also heavy armor. For 100-points-per-unit, you can hire a scout, that can die horribly when confronted by any enemy whatsoever. Oh, and if your whole squad is wiped out, all of their XP is lost and they're dead forever. Also, light troops can die to a single attack from many enemies in the game. What are the benefits to light troops you ask? None, they have no benefit other than being cheaper to resupply the squad in the field.\n\nThose are just a few examples, I could keep going, but I don't think I need to.\n\nThis game is a gigantic pile of steaming... wasted potential. It could have been a good game, if they had anyone on their team that understands "why" these other games have the mechanics they do, instead of just including them willy-nilly with no understanding of why they're adding them.","January 9, 2015","false","2.2"," 195 of 240 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","195","240","3","2"

However, the basic fundamental parts of the games control scheme and balance were rushed and are very poorly done. A lot of it is just little stuff that every other major RTS gets right, such as being able to select units and click the mini-map to get them to walk to that location, etc.\n\nThe biggest issue I ran into though was balance, on just about every mission the enemy has infinite spawns of squads that will come after you, and they just about always know where your guys are, so flanking isn't much of an option. Since you are perpetually outnumbered, your squads lose grunts, and then you have to march them back to the landing zone to replenish them. This pretty much means you have to conserve your guys and thrust from landing zone to landing zone, there's no real way to take it slow, because attrition will just wear you down too much.\n\nThey hyped up the mechs and really seemed to want them to be a great mechanic for a very powerful ally, but those are broken too. Engineers can't repair them in the field, so they also have to tromp back to the landing zone for repairs which are prohibitively expensive, all in exchange for pretty lackluster supporting fire and very little tanking ability at best.\n\nFinally, the infantry(which is your main core of units in this game) are horribly balanced. Essentially, light squads are useless, medium squads pretty much go 1 for 1 against the enemy(which are horrible ratios when you are always outnumbered by an enemy with unlimited supplies) and heavy troops are the only troops that are worth having. Your heavy troops will mow through a squad or 3, and by then they have lost enough people to be rendered combat ineffective, and have to tromp back to the landing zone themselves, which takes forever because of their heavy armor.\n\nThis just killed the flow of the game for me. There's a lot of great ideas here from other RTS's that I love, such as Dawn of War 1 and Starcraft 2, but the execution is absolutely clunky and horrible. This game hasn't been out long, maybe the developers will add some actual balance so this game isn't so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nintendo hard. The simplistic AI and poor balancing pretty much just makes this game a meatgrinder.","January 10, 2015","false","2.2"," 116 of 149 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","116","149","0","0"

The game SHOULD be cool.  It has all of the pieces there.  A compelling setting, decent artwork, cool cutscenes.  Mechs.  I mean, what could go wrong?\n\nWell, simply, a total lack of fun.  The game is only about the heavy units, all the others are a waste of time.  Part of this is terrible game balance, part of it stems from the mechanic of permanent loss of a unit and all the experience it earns when the last squad member is killed.  This is made worse by the fact that the enemy has infinite units, and if the ai doesn't register a response (like while crossing a bridge) you will also lose those units.\n\nWhat does this mean?  It means that rather than an interesting tactical game, you are in for a long slog with slow moving heavy units.  Push a position, clear it out, head back and heal.  Repeat.  Repeat A LOT.  Relatively simple missions take 3 to 4 times longer than you would expect.\n\nAnd you barely get mechs, this is a game about rocket infantry.\n\nAt some point you have to stop and ask.... is this even fun?  For me, the answer was no.","October 11, 2015","false","1.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","35","38","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mekis/recommended/273960/","Mekis","Mek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mekis/","246 products in account","While I'm a fan of both RTS and Mech centric games this title flat out fails to deliver on either front.\n\n1) The primary complaint you will see anywhere, and that I will confirm myself, is that this game is painfully slow. Even the most mundane of missions will take you much longer than it needs to as your units move at a snails pace through the board. Firefights between anything but the lightest of units are boring to watch as they just sit in one space and chip at each other's health until one drops.\n\n2) The game is a straight tactics game. While not inherently bad, the execution is poor enough that most tactics get thrown out the window in favor of brute force. On top of that unit management is clunky and awkward with only half of your commands really going through and a cover system that pathfinding will never allow you to use 100% correctly.\n\n3) My final and probably biggest but also most personal complaint in regards to this game: "Mechs & Mercs" is more 10% Mechs, 90% Mercs. You'll find that most missions refuse you access to mechs in this mech centric title, leaving you to resort to the aformentioned clunky infantry in cover to cover combat. Not only that but once you actually do get a chance to field the mechs, they control just as awkwardly sans the cover system, and when you get back to the dropship you will consistently need to replace the pilot in an individual mech because the game has this odd habit of removing them post interaction.\n\nIt's honestly very disappointing that a great concept like this went down the tube due to poor execution. The graphics, while lackluster, aren't bad for a standard rts. The unit designs are pretty basic but get the job done well, and the mechs look decent. There was a lot of potential here but the game is effectively not fun to play.","July 1, 2015","false","8.4"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","1"

Period.  It does not hold your hand or give you any inherent advantages.  You have to fight and plan like you know what you're doing because if your idea of tactics is a mob rush it's going to get VERY expensive for you very quickly.\n\nThat being said it offers a rather impressive tactical combat system involving short/long ranges for weapons, requiring the intelligent use of cover and troop designs where you can be strong or fast but rarely both.  The upgrade system has more depth than most realize at first glance as the 'generic +1 upgrades' are actually a surprisingly powerful way to make your troops more durable or specialize them to a combat role, i.e. static defenders focus on cover and long range damage, assault types utilize armor/health and close range, etc.)\n\nThe inclusion of different armor tiers is a very nice touch given the size of most of the maps, but the rocket problems (see below) force the lighter and faster troops to the wayside in favor of simple survivability.  The faction troops are another very interesting idea, but one I simply haven't had time to fully explore.\n\nThe early mechs are light weight, fast, and heavily armed... but also rather fragile so protect your pilots if you want to use those bigger more devastating machines later.\n\nThe game only actually has a couple glaring problems that unfortunately overshadow some excellent system designs.\n\nRockets are fired at a particular point, never miss and fire through cover, which combined with the AOE and extreme damage make them arguably the perfect weapon.  This is beyond a doubt the most broken part of the game.  Rockets should have a (high) chance of being blocked by cover as they're direct fire weapons as opposed to grenade launchers that would arc over said cover.  Also consider that an RPG and AT rocket are two VERY different weapon systems.  The current design of the rocket systems literally make every other weapon inferior in almost every situation.\n\nThe lack of any medical support for troops means wounded men are a liability until they die.  There are multiple ways to fix this, either through medics that heal over time out of combat (maintaining the sense of pressure intrinsic in the game) or via insta-heal when reinforcing from a Landing Pad.  The latter is easier to do as it applies the current system for mech repair to infantry.\n\nOverall it's an impressively designed game with some rather dated graphics and a couple glaring issues, though for my money it's a great purchase.  If the problems it has were fixed I think it'd be better than CoH, but that's just my opinion.","January 10, 2015","true","6.9"," 51 of 72 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","51","72","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/recommended/273960/","etherasfox","Etheras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/","325 products in account","This game is just bad.\n\nWhy is it so bad? Where to begin? Lets start... at the beginning.\n\n1. Tutorial: Game says easy mode is for "people who've never played RTS before". Well I'm quite a strategy buff, but nothing I've played is much like this game, so that is an inaccurate description on their part. Most likely if you've never played THIS GAME before, you should probably start on Easy.\n\n2. There's very little strategy. Unless you consider "walking up to enemies and shooting them while trying not to stand on a bridge" a strategy. The game touts things like crossfire and cover, and ... not standing on bridges because there are armor penalties (or bonuses). But there's no real strategy. Its mostly just blasting enemies with as many guys as you can while damaged sections run away (tediously) to healing pads. If you're looking for anything resembling real tactics... you might want to look elsewhere. Before I explain what I mean, let me define a few things...\n\nDEFINITION: Strategy\nStrategy usually means managing at a macro level (research, gathering resources to build a larger army, capturing choke points etc) for advantage. There are resource locations in this game, but they're not terribly useful excpet that they generate the money needed to heal units. Once your best units are in the field: there is nothing more to buy. More units just get in the way and distract from you trying not to get your best people killed (squad death is permanent).\n\nDEFINITION: Tactics\nTactics is about singular engagements (hitting the enemy in ways that they can't hit back, flanking, or rock-paper-scissors). What do I mean by "rock-paper-scissors"? In a hypothetical modern warfare game, it would be something like.... attacking the enemy helicopters with AA, while your helicopters attack their tanks, while your tanks attck their AA. When you maximize the number of your units specialized at killing a particular unit type, with engagements against that unit type: that is a good tactic and makes for a good game. In this game, everything early-on defers to the all powerful heavy rocket infantry, and later on to mechs. All weapons have about the same range, so there's no sense of pinning an enemy down while snipers pick them off (etc). Its just NOT THERE in this game. Everything is about having the most guns to bear at a particular time and making sure that the "last guy" in any unit isn't killed because then the unit dies.\n\n3. The unit AI is abysmal. Its really annoying and frustrating, especially in a game where you constantly have to scroll around to do things like checking that enemies haven't spawned behind you, or sending units back to healing pads. You will frequently find that you will send an order, go do something else, and then come back to find out that the order was ignored. Units get stuck on the map, ignore orders to shoot stuff (or don't return fire when they are under attack). Attacked units will not complete their order. Units tasked with entering a bunker, may or may not just stand there and jitter spasmotically, while others allow themselves to get shot up by enemies standing directly next to them, or just wanders off to die in the enemy camp. The only thing that saves you from defeat at the incompetence of your idiot soldiers is that the enemy AI is even dumber. The whole enemy strategy seems to consist of "reinforce as often as possible and send them at the player". While this seems simple, its often made tediously impossible by giving the player 1 spawn pad and the enemy AI 6 or 7 per level, then forcing the player to also manage some other tedius task like "evacuate the civilians" or "don't lose your engineers" at the same time. And speaking of that...\n\n4. Mission parameters don't make sense. Mission 1 the goal requires engineers. You can get new engineers at the drop ship pad. Despite the fact that you can get more, you "lose" the game if you lose all your engineers in the level, despite the fact that you might have more in reserve... ready to be called down at a moment's notice.\n\n5. The sound is REALLY messed up. Music is WAY too loud. I turned it off, only to find that the video cutscene sound (including voice and sound effects) are on the same audio track!\n\n6. What's with the unskippable cut scenes?\n\n7. What's with the non-standard RTS game controls?\n\n8. The story is non-existent. I wanted to know more about the game universe, but clicking around on the strategic map only tells you planet name and whether there's a mission. Ingame fiction seems to have been overlooked.\n\n9. WHAT DO UNITS DO? There is no encyclopedia that I can see. No hover hints. You pretty-much have to guess if a unit is what you want. But I suppose that makes sense, since all the units seem identical anyway. The game says units have special abilities, but I haven't seen it (other than for engineers). They appear to unlock later. So until then: enjoy your all-the-same units.\n\nSo is there anything good? Artwork seems pretty good. It has a compelling look, albiet overly-busy and maybe slightly lower quality than the game dictates. I like the abundance of fully-rendered cutscenes. This is one thing that has disappeared from games recently that I would wish to come back. And RTS for that matter: its not a dead genre. But big publishers won't make it because it doesn't port nicely to console. Its nice to see that a game company is at least TRYING to make an interesting RTS.\n\nThat's all I have for now. Thanks for reading!\n\n","January 11, 2015","false","5.0"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","28","41","2","0"

Mechs are very limited with weapon/equipement slots. No in mission save, light infantry are worthless and a few other minor issues.  The basic RTS move and fight commands are intuitive but upgrade, purchase, save etc... commands take a little trail and error to figure out.  The one thing that I do hate is having to run back to the landing pads to replace men or repair the mechs. It would seem that you should be able to call for the replacements and let them make their way from the landing site to their squad. Same with the mech, engineers should be able to at least do small amounts of repair to the mech and or be able to call in a repair vehicle that will travel to the mech to repair it in the field.   Basically it is a descent game with the potential to be a great game that is fun to play not frustrating as it can be now.

Units taking cover behind specific objects get a huge bonus. On the other hand, crossing some areas like bridges makes the units more vulnerable.\nUnits have specialized roles that access special abilities and general upgrades (armor, speed, strength).\n\nThe management part is very well done, adding an upper strategic layer to the game. New squads and mechs can be bought, as some upgrades to the mothership (these are very expensive, I have yet to see them).\nThere's also more stuff to do in all the rooms. New messages arrive after each mission explaining what's goin on.\n\nThen there are the other factions that offer side missions. I don't have any of these special units yet, but they offer some interesting abilities from what I saw in the featurettes.\n\nI hope this game gets continuously updated, as I see great potential here.","January 10, 2015","true","16.3"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","19","32","0","0"

The AI was little to write home about as well, being very generic and predictable. The visuals and audio is decent but only for an indie type game.

It is not important to have impeccable micro management, but you need to do positioning of units really well.\nIn other words: Heavy armored units counter everything.\nIn terms of balancing this game is not that great, as many other reviewers have said already.\nAnd you get to feel that first hand in the fist mission when an enemy squad of heavy units plows through your medium armored units that are standing in heavy cover while the enemy is exposed out in the open.\n\nAfter beating your way through the first level you come back to your mothership and inevitably one or more squads have leveled up.\nThe idea of having tech trees for your units is not that bad, but apart from being mostly boring "+x% on y" upgrades there is not that much to it.\nOne thing that is really annoying is as well is that single points in upgrades can not be reverted, so you either put it in the right spot or do it all over again.\nThe first time you get to customize your mech is not that bad. You have a good variety in terms of weapons and upgrades, but again the upgrades are just numbers with no visible impact.\n\nAs you can see in the video, the combat is also quite interesting to say the least: The interaction radius on enemy units sometimes doesn't let you cross bridges, which leads to them getting slaughtered.\nBy the way: All losses are permanent, but don't worry, you will get enough money to buy more squads in the black market. Another thing is that sometimes effects like "suppression" and "crossfire", which are crucial to win battles, don't trigger even though the enemy runs towards a turret or is surrounded by 3 squads.\n\nIn terms of controls there is not that much to say apart from it working pretty well. One thing I'd like to add though is that on a multimonitor setup you are better off using W,A,S&D to scroll the screen since when you go too far to the left or wherever your next monitor is, the mouse goes out of the window. Luckily the game holds on that point and remembers it's state so that when you get back into it no time has passed.\n\nSpeaking of time, the timers in this game are... aribtrary. I think that describes it pretty well. 90 time-units of wating for a dropship to be ready are not the same as 1.60 time-units of waiting for a contract to be ready.\nThe thing with the contracts also boggles my mind... you have to stay on the missions screen in order for that timer to tick down... While you are at your mothership there are some things to do, so it would be good if that timer ticked down while I am doing other stuff.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint the game most of the time is done pretty well. In terms of optimisation there seem to be some problems, because my rig, being far superior than the recommended requirements, struggles to reach 60 fps.\nI'd love to hear other peoples' reports on that, but from my standpoint it is not really well optimised.\n\nThe graphics are fairly okay though, there is not that much to complain about.\nThe soundtrack is also relatively good, but in terms of sound design I have to say that putting voiceacting and sound effects in the same category is generally not a very good idea.\nThis is especially true, when on the one hand there are sound effects that are so loud, even on the lowest settings, that they almost blew me off my chair the first time I've heard them.\nAnd on the other hand you hear things like objective updates and your units engaging in combat via voiceacting.\nThat needs to be seperated or at least adjust the sound level of the sound effects to a level that no longer endagers my ability of hearing.\n\nAt the end there is not really that much left to say for me... I could only recommend this game to the hardcore audience of the genre.\nFor everyone else I cannot give a recommendation to this game.\n\nEdit 1: Fixed wording, spelling and linebreaks.","January 10, 2015","false","2.9"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","22","42","3","0"

I adore the warhammer 40k series and XCOM which are two of my favorite series. When I saw this game I though I might enjoy it for the strategy and persistent squad aspect. However, this game from what Ive found is a zergfest. If your infantry arent moving together its easy to lose squads.\n\nThe enemies you face always seem to know where you are and have unlimited resources. With this taken into consideration if you try to move tactically and flank opponents you'll find that your units become over extended and are taken out which causes frustration.\n\nThis game could have really been something with a couple tweaks, but it falls short.\n\nWith all that taken into account, I find that this game isnt completely horrible. The cutscenes are great and the setting is awesome. Running a stranded merc company and fighting your way out inadvertantly winning back a sector for its people is a great plot. I cant really say anything about the characters, because from my experience they arent really fleshed out. This game is a fun zerg, but with the way the AI attacks it kills any strategy you could think of.\n\nI will say this, if you enjoy strategy games and this is on sale, get it, if not forget it.\n\n-Reghs","January 10, 2015","false","3.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onlycatfud/recommended/273960/","onlycatfud","Catfud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onlycatfud/","362 products in account","I have NOT played this game very much, but here is a quick review of my first session.\n\nFirst impression is it's just so so so clunky and slow.\n\nSo far it reminds me of playing through those first few missions of any RTS like starcraft or red alert stuff.  You're trying to grab helipad dropship checkpoint things to heal/resupply and little oil pumper things to earn command points to call down more of your stuff. You get your little group of infantry and go blow up things, have some floating female coordinator telling you random updates. But with only two unit types, infantry squads of 4-6 people and individual mechs. Each can have different loadouts or types.\n\nBut much crappier.\n\nThe squads are awkward to control. There is a decent cover system, stand near barrels or trees or whatever to get upgrade, stand on bridges or open areas to get defense nerfs. The units rarely work they way you want them to. Click to secure an area, they may go stand in the general area. If there are enemies involved good luck. They basically just do whatever they are going to do. Had to turn on a 'ignore enemy fire' and move option just to keep my guys from standing on bridges getting killed or engaging an enemy while they were 2 pixels away from cover. Clicking on the cover again often makes them move away from it or in other directions, not sure how the movement AI works.\n\nThe minimap is horrendous. A small red trapezoid that is roughly related to the direction you are looking. (That is, click to position the trapezoid an entire step away from what you want to view). Minimap icons are not easy to follow. You can't zoom out nearly far enough to make sense of much of the battle. Everything is just SO SLOW. It feels like lag, but it's not, it's just the awkward movement of everything.\n\nRandomly throughout any mission 'enemy airstrikes' show up. So you have to quickly click around the crappy minimap and find each of your sqauds and move them a few feet each so they are not standing in the giant target. Easier said then done. Often in a group when I would try to move them, they would all wander weird directions because I clicked them into cover or whatever. I was playing a mission to secure three checkpoints, one checkpoint my dudes were just sitting around drinking iced tea in case anyone showed up, the airstrike was coming I asked them to move north. They moved a weird way instead because of some cover and were not just moving north so I clicked for them to move north again. Half of them walked right back the other directions in the middle of the target and were killed. Red Alert in the 90s or whatever had a 'scramble' hotkey. If this game does too it hasn't bothered to mention it during the tutorial/walkthrough. Units in modern and even older RTS games were super responsive and people talk about micro and CPM and stuff. Controlling units in this game is 90% of the difficulty so far. This is terribly implemented movement.\n\nThe mechs are nice. Slow and clunky, but IN A PROPER WAY. Because they are giant multi-ton machines and they act like it. They pivot fast, shoot and kill what you want them to shoot and kill, and act very nice. That being said, they have shields/armor and just take linear damage through them until they catch on fire or whatever and eventually I assume blow up. Haven't lost one yet. Why is that? Because you can just sit them on a 'drop point' or helipad thing you get reinforcements on and spam 'heal' on them and they are magically healed. Same goes for infantry squads. Lose 5/6 of your guys in the squad? Go stand on the helipad and spam the heal button. They are resurrected instantly.\n\nAlso, countdowns and numbers are meaningless. "Dropship will be available in 100...99...98..."  98 somethings. 5-10 seconds later it has gone down a few numbers. Very slow. Then you have on the same exact screen a timer counting down for when the next civilian evacuation will take place. And it is clicking away a few times per second, until it hits 8 and all the sudden the announcement is made they are coming. The dropship countdown is super slow. I mentioned spamming repairs and resurrecting squad members on helipads, it takes so long to get a dropship in the early part of the game you have nothing better to spend your money on. Another good way to spend the cash is spam turrets or bunkers that your engineers can build. Not necessarily because you need them, but because they earn XP for building them and you have plenty of spare command points anyway.\n\nThe infantry squads have a number above them, which is how many guys in the squad are still alive (then if you click each individual dude has his own health meter, for whatever that is worth. Civ and others reconciled this just by having a 'health bar' for the whole squad and as it dropped guys died from the group. I suppose this system is technically better, because having 6 wounded dudes firing is still providing higher firepower than having 2 dead guys and 4 perfect guys like the Civ system might fail to model. But one of the big UI problems with this is each time one of your guys dies he may go violently flying off in an explosion or whatever, or multiples of your guys die, etc. But the little number disappears for a bit and then reappears with the new number. So if you have two or three squads fighting, the health indicators are constantly flickering on and off as you see guys flying away in explosions and stuff. So its hard to really tell at any given point how quickly you are loosing men or where you are at with each squad in the middle of a fight.\n\nUpgrading squads and the tree paths are nice, a feature that improves ANY game. Love that kind of stuff, but it's fairly basic in this. It is hard at this point, so early in the game for me, to decide any noticeable difference in the paths of the trees. Units 'upgrade' between battles with the trees and you keep the squads together and choose their loadouts almost like a crappier XCOM hanger system but each guy represents six little dudes on the ground.\n\nAnyway I don't know. Buy it on a Steam sale someday or try it out for yourself. It's not a great game by any means, but it's not terrible. Clicking around with a souped up mech mowing down enemy infantry squads is very enjoyable. I'm not disappointed I bought it, even at that price because I want to support the genre and it makes a very solid attempt at bringing a good RTS with mechs style game to the table. The graphics are excellent for what it is, menus and between mission planning and upgrading and stuff is very well implemented. But it has a LOT of cons that make it tough to recommend. I am giving it a thumbs up because I would hate to downvote a game in the genre before giving it a fair shot. I've yet to work with multi-mech squads or later missions or upgrade things enough to say it is definitively bad. But so far it is not looking good.\n\ntl;dr\nCrappy XCOM-meets-first-few-tutorial-levels-of-RTS-games" with frustratingly awful to control units.

Once you have captured one you can use to it summon a new squad by spending power which is the only resource in the game. You can only summon a squad once every five or so minutes and you have a limited number of times you can summon, unlike the enemy AI which has an infinite number. Which begs the question, why even bother having a power resource when you can only summon a limited number of squads anyway. It also seems like having the enemy spawning unlimited squads is a very cheap and artificial way to create difficulty.\n\nThe controls of the game aren't designed well and can be unresponsive. Sometimes commands are even ignored by troops. Both the controls and the UI are poorly designed and have some real issues both mechanically and aesthetically. The UI offers barely any feedback and icons on the screen are so small you can barely make out what they are. In fact the UI throughtout the game is dated and poorly designed, it feels like your looking at an 80's arcade screen on occasion.\n\nMy core issue with the game is that it seems like the developers set out to make an RTS but forgot to put in the core fundamentals of the genre. One of the biggest issues of the game is balance. Take your light armor troops, they are utterly worthless in every respect. They cant do enough damage to take out a unit on their own and don't have enough defence to stand up for long in any fire fight. They die so quickly that even using them as cannon fodder is pointless. In fact the game is so unbalanced that the only units worth a damn are heavies and mechs. Heavies are the only units that can hit and get hit without dying in a few seconds flat. What it seems they tried to do is have a few classes to allow you to employ different tactics in battle but due to the balance it's done the opposite and thrown tactics out of the game.\n\nAgain another major issue with the game is the fact that there's not much meat on the actual bones of combat. There's only really three main mechanics in battle, one being cover so get being cover to gain defence bonus. Two is that when crossing bridges you have a defence penalty and finally is crossfire that is simply two units attacking the same unit so the defending unit will be suppressed and receive a defence penalty. That's not exactly much to work with when your trying to create a tactics based game. Due to its slow paced nature it becomes even more of a problem because you don't have the complexity of games like company of heroes whose units for example could do a variety of things like go prone.\n\nThe enemy AI is also non existent and is frequently stupid. All the enemy seems programmed to do is either sit in wait or actively go towards you on the battlefield no matter where you are. There is no patrolling or acting like real soldiers, just defend or follow. There was one instance that if you get your distance just right you can attack an enemy and they just stand there like nothing is happening. They don't fire back as your not in range and the fact they are taking damage completely eludes them so they don't bother to attack or move. There's even several experience exploits in the game due to both the problems with the AI and the mission design itself. On many of the side missions you can just place your troops near a enemy landing pad a keep picking them off until all your units are at max level.\n\nMap design is very important in RTS games and sadly once again mechs and mercs falls short in this department. Maps are not thought out they seem to be just thrown together. I was very surprised by this as level design can create difficulty and fun experiences when done correctly especially in a RTS focusing on squads. Its like trying to combine the gameplay of dawn of war 2 with the maps on command and conquer, it doesn't work. Level design needs to reflect and complement the game mechanics not just be a poorly textured canvass for your units to step on.\n\nI could go on and on about the games flaws and problems. Needless to say is a very sub par RTS, I can imagine the developers overreached, did not understand the complexities of the genre or wrote something that sounded good on paper but in practice failed. There really isn't any kind of redeeming feature for this game, it does nothing well, it has badly designed gameplay, a bad story and its just not worth your time in my opinion. Even big fans of RTS's should steer clear as I cannot see how you would find an enjoyable experience from this. I was really hoping for a decently solid RTS, I can forgive the poor textures, UI design and lackluster story but the mechanical failings and the poor game design overall, I cannot.","February 12, 2015","false","5.1"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","9","20","2","0"

The story\nis simplistic, with most of it centering around going to different planets\nto accomplish missions.  There isn't really anything leading you through the\ngame to make you feel connected, more like separate skirmish missions\n\nYou can buy different types of units through the mech dealer and\nmercenary dealer on your ship.  The design is focused more on the mercenary\nfeel, but they sacrificed RTS elements by basing the squads on destruction\nrather than building bases and summoning troops element.\n\nYou spend anywhere from 30-60 minutes per mission.  Overall I found\nthis game to lack in balance.  It doesn't respect your time;  as a group of\nmercenaries, you are fighting against an army.  There is no save during battle,\nand after putting all this time into the battle, the continuous flood of\nenemies can turn the tide so quickly that you can go from almost winning to\ncomplete loss in seconds.  The turrets that you have to use can be\ndestroyed easily, and there is no option for repairing them.\n\nThere is no advantage to playing as a mercenary;  the enemy has\nsuperior, neverending numbers, and you are given no tactical, tecnological,\nor weapons advantage.  There is no gaining or holding ground, as you are\nconstantly having to retreat to heal up your troops.\n\nThe maps all feel the same.  The interface is sloppy, not providing\nany information to the health status of the enemy troops.  Where you have\nfour of one particular unit, the enemy will have 20, with more waiting in the\nwings.  I did not enjoy my time playing this.  I found it to be a giant\nwaste of time.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","January 13, 2015","false","5.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Take your standard small army or company sized force and move them across the map capturing resource points and drop zones.  The missions are so incredibly boring I didn't even know what they were, instead I was just trying to capture and kill everything on the map just to stay engaged long enough to see if things got better; spoiler they don't and its just a long ride on a rollercoaster that stays completely level.  The game includes a cover mechanic for your units, they recieve a bonus to damage resistance if they're in cover, they suffer if they aren't in cover/in the open.  Sounds cool, but cover never ♥♥♥♥ing works, except for the enemy, who gain super damage resistance, while my units seem to be hiding behind cardboard.\n\nI always felt outclassed, that two of my heavy units going against one medium unit would lose, and that my now veteran squads are dead forever and all the progress I made with them is gone.  Now the latter is cool, squad progression, it makes each unit important, and you just don't want to throw them away.  However the enemy is stupid, but is apparently far better than any of my units, veteran statuses be damned.  I often would have to forgoe clever unit placement, and just send waves of soldiers at my opponent because that was the only way to kill an entrenched enemy squad.\n\nThen there were the dropships, the way you gain reinforcements, the life line to your ship, and so ♥♥♥♥ing slow to have their timer reset its ridiculous. I may of called for reinforcements three times my playthrough, and often it was too little too late or the fighting was already over.  Now there are upgrades to reduce the cooldown for the dropship, if you want to spend your credits on that.  However if I capture four drop zones I should at least get more then one ♥♥♥♥ing dropship, I mean seriously I own this giant ship and all I get is one measely dropship?\n\nBasically the gameplay is boring, a little unbalanced, and kind of broken with some of the unit weapons/cover mechanics.   Story wise this game seemed to be rather interesting, playing as a mercenary, you're here to help and get paid, working alongside other factions to gain approval.  But the best part was having your own warship, it was very Starcraft II like in my opinion, which I loved.  You had your barracks, the cantina, the hangar, the engineering room, command center; all were places you could go and visit.  It was a nice little touch that I liked, made me feel like I was actually the leader of a mercenary unit that was super badass and not just in charge of some rag tag force made up of the bottom of the barrel.  There could be more added, I'd like to see some character interaction to be honest with you, but that might just be me trying to relieve my glory days playing Starcraft II.\n\nI'd give this game a 4/10, the mechanics are broken, and the gameplay is just so dull and boring, not to mention the enviroments are as bland as the gameplay.  Just stay away, you can find plenty of better RTS' out there for less than this game.","April 14, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Mechs only seem to get xp by killing other mechs. so if you have one unit in the hot zone and all the other are just staying elsewhere chewing gum and plain Poker, they don't get anything from the missions, wich in find pretty bad.

Keep that in mind.\n\nMusic is quite standard game music, butI'm alright with that and the graphics arent that bad,but I usualy dot care about that.\n\nAll and all if you like RTS's but aren't scared of some rough edges, I'd say you would enjoy this.","January 9, 2015","true","1.1"," 9 of 36 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","9","36","0","0"
