"http://steamcommunity.com/id/felipepepe/recommended/219780/","felipepepe","Felipepepe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/felipepepe/","734 products in account","Divinity 2 is a game where you can (at will) turn into a dragon, attack a flying fortress & its army of dragon riders, land on the courtyard, kill the guards with a mix of sword fighting and destructive spells, subdue the fortress’s commander and then read its mind to know his deepest secrets. All this 100% gameplay, no cutscenes involved. It has to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ best RPG ever made by man, right?\n\nSadly, not quite. Larian Studios was held back by time constrains, lack of resources and, worst of all, the focus on consoles and their limited hardware. While the game overflows with original ideas and Larian’s usual clever writing, the execution doesn’t deliver. It’s not a bad game by any measure; the gameplay is good, some quests are creative (and funny) to do, and it succeeds in giving players interesting mechanics to play with (like mind-reading). But sadly it lacks that “special something” in its execution, making the game somewhat repetitive and mediocre by the end. Still, is a great game that’s not afraid to break the mold and bring something new to the table.\n","February 12, 2014","true","22.3"," 137 of 150 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","137","150","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/recommended/219780/","Sysg3n","Sysgen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/","4617 products in account","Divinity II Ego Draconis and Divinity II Flames of Vengeance comprise Divinity II: Developer's Cut.  The former the original and the latter the expansion.   Depending on how you play the length of the entire production can easily extend past 100 hours.\n\nTo start, customization was a disappointment.  Selection is limited to a male and female model with appropriate sound samples from which to pick.  Want to sound like a noble or a soldier then Larian has made that happen.  What Larian did not make happen was allow me to choose an avatar in my chosen image.  The hair and beard and color of both can be chosen but only female or male and human at that.  The game has goblins, why can't the player be a goblin?\n\nOnce my disappointment over the customization screen had dissipated it was time to immerse my self in the world of Riverlon.  Much like Risen, the player starts as a complete non descript.  In terms of the game's systems,  the player character might as well have been just expelled from the womb.   Barely any attributes or acquired skills make up your profile and depending on your skill level as a gamer and how you allocate your initial allocation of attribute and skill points, the game can be rather unforgiving.  Some would think challenging forcing a strategic approach, others may be put off.  I thought the former and welcomed the challenge eagerly building my character for the tasks ahead.  Im that context the game starts the player much like Risen or Gothic.\n\nAs you progress in Divinity II you become more powerful and the game eventually will become easier.  Late in the base game there was a distinct lack of difficulty balancing by Larian.  While the game continued to be entertaining the lack of eventual difficultly was a serious issue.  While the game has multiple difficulty settings encompassing casual through nightmare, this wasn't enough.  An additional difficulty setting was needed or the skills needed to be toned down though the game does make you feel very powerful from a role playing perspective.\n\nMy opinion on difficulty may be more a product of playing as a pure Mage.  I cannot speak for Fighter, Ranger or playing a mixed class.  Also note that for a good portion of the base game the game was extremely challenging even on normal.  Divinity II is not on rails and you are free to explore areas outside of your capabilities.\n\nThe player is free to allocate skills to any category.  Categories are broken down by Priest, Mage, Fighter, Ranger and general category to remain unnamed.  Want to be a Battle Mage, a Ranger Priest, no problem.  The elasticity of the skill system allows for such combinations with the only limitation being that the skills are level locked.\n\nDivinity II tells the story of a budding Dragon Slayer who eventually is recruited to become a Dragon Knight and defacto a Dragon.  Morphing into a Dragon is cool and a significant divergence in game play.  Like the Dragon Knight, Dragon abilities can be allocated and strengthened through skill points.  Game-play as a Dragon will have you battling all sorts of flying beasts as well as entrenched land based weaponry.  At this point in the review if you are reading through the spoiler tag I want to point out that anyone who likes their flight controls inverted is in for a big surprise and for this Larian gets an F for failure and not caring about a portion of their fan base. Larian left out inverted flight for the dragon.  Thankfully we can send human beings into orbit and utilities exist to help correct this issue.  Using Xpadder I was able to setup a profile to control the Dragon on an Xbox 360 game controller and invert the flight controls in the process.  This meant playing the Knight with the keyboard and playing the Dragon with the game-pad.  A minor inconvenience but the PC version should of been patched as the Xbox version had inverted flight.\n\nPotions, Crafting, Botany and Gemstones all play significant roles.  Potions can be purchased though there is an alchemy system based on plants.  Potions are not limited to health and mana and include attribute based potions as well.  Potions interestingly have many level classifications with the strength of the potion increasing with the level.  Crafting is gem based and like alchemy, the ability to craft is available to every player character.   When you become a Dragon Knight you get your own Battle Tower and the tower has servants.  Servants of which you may weaponize and armor.  Servants that will collect gems and plants for you.  A welcome time saving feature implemented by Larian to keep game minutia to a minimum.\n\nDivinity II is a 2009 production and looks like it was made in 2009 though in some places the game visually shines but over all the game still looks good.  Voice acting is top notch and professional.  I was disappointed to see the re-use of npc models, a pet peeve of mine, though Larian did an adequate job covering up this sin and the issue didn't appear to be as egregious as Gothic 3.\n\nCombat was simply fun and skills utilized by the player are accessed via the standard 1 through 0 keys or can be reassigned to any key.  All game functions can be re-mapped including quick save.  Combat is as simple as swinging your weapon and using skills.  Blocking is non-existent and points can be put into the passive skills like evade.  The player can also roll out of harms way.\n\nThe Developer's Cut allows the player to start the base game and expansion as originally released or in what amounts to a debug mode.  Both versions are save game compatible.   In the debug version, the console is accessed via F11 and you are free to do as you wish.  Want to give yourself an apple ?  You can do that.  Mostly I stayed out of the debug version though I will come clean so to speak and admit to pumping 5 points into encumbrance to satisfy my pack rat tendencies and because I'm no fan of dealing with limited inventories in action rpgs.  It bears to mention that the starting inventory limit can be managed without putting any points into encumbrance.\n\nDivinity II and expansion are worthy for multiple reasons.  Divinity II comprises originality, professional voice acting, great game-play, questing and a great soundtrack (accessible via install).  A top notch action RPG.","March 20, 2015","true","149.1"," 133 of 147 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","133","147","0","7"

There is SO MUCH content, too! It's not an open world/sandbox game, but rather sets the player on a specific path with the option of doing many side quests. It's old school in that it often requires intution, guessing and puzzle solving on the part of the player. It doesn't hold your hand like some games do, but does point you in the right direction and leave you to find the secrets for yourself.\nWhat I like most about this game is that you have a completely open character build - you can put points in any tree at any time and create a hybrid class, though I find that picking a class and sticking with it is a highly effective playstyle.\nWhat sets Divinity II apart from many other games of its ilk is that you gain the ability to transform into a Dragon and fly through the game world. It is great fun to fly around the valley battling airborne foes and destroying enemy structures, then turning back into a human to enjoy the fast paced action/rpg combat.\nThe game does have a handful of bugs and glitches that were never worked out. A handful of side quests are not possible to complete and others can accidentally be restarted, but it is not game-breaking. Given how good the rest of the game is, it is a minor issue at best.\nThis is defintely an underappreciated gem and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs like Dragon Age, Mass Effect or Neverwinter Nights.","November 8, 2014","true","26.5"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","70","75","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yaoism/recommended/219780/","yaoism","janina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yaoism/","179 products in account","This RPG is seriously like a underrated diamond in the RPG genre. In my opinion as a fan of the RPG-genre, Divinity II is a title that you should have played or tried for at least once.\n\n\nStory + NPCs:\nThe story is kinda typical for a RPG with a medieval setting: Dragons, magic and war. The game itself focuses on exploring, completing quests and interacting with the huge number of NPCs.\n\nThe NPCs are really well and realistic written and each one of them shows a kind of own personality with a background - which is for me - the most interesting part of the game. The dialogues also get accompanied by a really good voice acting. It's fun to read and listen to what the NPCs are saying. The humor in this game shouldn't be ignored too.\n\nWhat to say about the quests? The missing map-marker for target places makes them some kind of difficult and sometimes you have to choose the right option to finish a quest. But this doesn't have an influence on the story-line at all. (The worst thing that could happen is that you failed the quest and won't get a reward.)\n\nSadly, the setting doesn't make you believe anything what the story is actually telling: The story-line brings you in a sunny forest at first - more like an idyll. Nothing there reminds you about the war, the dark magic and the possible end of the world. The monsters mostly appear like totally out-of-place.. After all - the story is pretty weak.\n\n\nGraphics + Technical aspect:\nI personally think: The graphics are beautiful. The animations appear fluent and everything has the right atmosphere to create that kind of feeling that brings you even more into the game. Well, the textures could have a better quality and the environment appears blurry.\n\nHowever. If you aren't the  "ULTRA-4k-1080p-I-NEED-3-NVIDIA-780TIS-TO-BE-PLEASED-WITH-THE-GRAPHICS"-type of person, you won't be bothered by it.\n\nOk, the character design could have been a little bit better like sometimes you get that feeling that all the soldiers were created in the same laboratory with the same genes (or everyone is just a product of incest).\n\nTechnically, Divinity II reminds me of a game from the early 2000s due the fact that you got no auto-save - which is awful (When you die, you have to load an older savegame and start everything from the beginning). So there is a reason why I am already over 25 hours in the game and haven't finished the first part yet. Another point is the missing map-marker. That's just soooo out-of-date.\n\n\nEnjoyment:\nWell, it's obvious that I really enjoy the game. But not only for its atmosphere or its great-written dialogues - I love it because it's actually pretty damn hard. I have never found myself dying so often or restarting a level than in any other game. It's indeed a challenge, but not frustrating. (I haven't played Dark Souls yet pssssh)\n\nI got it for like 1 buck in a steam sale and I couldn't be happier. It's more worth than that!\n\n\n\nPros:\n+ No rushing since all the monsters do not respawn\n+ Cheap (It's on sale during every big steam sale and you even get the key for like 2-5€ online due a humblebundle)\n+ High difficulty\n+ Amazingly written dialogues\n+ Interesting NPCs\n+ THE ATMOSPHERE\n+ Choose your preferred reward (exp or gold) after a completed quest\n+ Cinematic cutscenes\n\nCons:\n- No Auto-Save (and even putting the 'auto-save' on a shortcut-key didn't work for me at all)\n- Blurry graphics and low-quality textures\n- Weak story\n- No multiplayer\n\n\n\n(English is not my first language and changes will follow after I got time to finish the game.)","December 4, 2013","true","25.4"," 88 of 102 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","88","102","0","8"

The game does not fail in that regard.\n\n= Audio 9/10 =\nHave I mentioned the intro music? Because you will find yourself sitting in the menu, not having the courage to stop the flow of mesmerizing chorus. While other in-game music is engaging as well, it is not always introduced seamlessly. Voice over is quite colourful and I'm yet to notice any repetitiveness. You will be yearning for the soothing sounds of nature and waterfalls however, but only your footsteps and void are around.\n\n= Story 9/10 =\nYou better listen. Because it is very thorough, multisided and there will be a quiz... literally. This is my first divinity game, and the lore is astonishing and comparable to giants like Elder Scrolls and Witcher. The beginning does feel like continuation of a story, but you can get the whole picture from books and dialogues. Speaking of ...\n\n= Dialogues 10/10 =\nThis needs to be an example for the nowadays writers. Mischievous, profound, logical and surprising. I have not enjoyed English like that since white man was a President (i.e long time ago).\n\n= Gameplay 8/10 =\nOn insanity, you will hide behind trees and stones because someone will break your bones, you will run away like teenager from his first date, wriggle like a snake, jump as a cheetah. Most games get repetitive after couple weeks of playing, however in here, new game modes will be available, skill reset allows you to try out everything without having to start from beginning. Eventually you will get a teleport stone to access trainers and other NPCs.\n\n= Interface 9/10 =\nA game that was built for the PC. No silly checkpoints, radial menus, unnecessary limitations or vague descriptions.\n\n= Graphics 7/10 =\nIt does look like another Asian online MMOsomethingsomethingRPG. But there is a reason for that, you will have a chance to checkout everything from the birds view. Com'on, tis from year 2009.\n\n===== Tips =====\n\nSkills. Don't worry too much. You will have the ability to reset em. I do recommend invest in Lockpicking. Simply can't stand the sight of an unopened chest. Do not waste anything on backpack room.\n\nExperience. Mobs do not respawn, but you get drastically more/less depending on enemy level.\n\nSkill books. First couple locations - first map has one, the first tavern, hanging on a chain separately from other hanging weapons.\n\nSave/reload ho. Before you kill an enemy, or before you come near to a chest, you can save/reload the game to get different loot. Cheap but oddly satisfying. Not sure if otherwise I would have been able to finish the first half on Insanity.\n\nChoices. Careful what you reap. If you agree to kill or raid someone, you could loose other potential quests from that person/area.\n\nItems. Sell all non-quest or skill books after you read em. Keep a rope for one quest. Keep only items that you are going to use, or disenchant. Sell useless potions. The only resource/gem worth saving is the malachite gem, because it will be easy to get unlimited amount later on.\n\n===== Final thoughts =====\n\nDespite its shortcomings, the game is very engaging and quite refreshing. Be warned however, it is very long.","October 26, 2014","true","78.8"," 65 of 69 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","65","69","0","3"

I could describe it as Skyrim's little brother who chose a not-so-open-world but more story driven style.\nI really didn't expect much of a game that I bought for 4,99€ but was this a surprise.\n\nTL;DR version. Old visuals, mediocre 'on foot' combat, but awesome dragon combat, somewhat good storyline, lore-heavy story, and again, dragon batles. Don't buy if you hate speaking but love beating because there is a lot of speaking involved.\n\nOh and here are some numbers.            Category        Rating                Graphics        7                Gameplay        7                Story        8                Dragons        10\nFirst of all, I would like to say that the game is old and the visuals definitely show it. Somewhat washed out textures and pixelated shadows are noticable. Although, the lightning, motion blur effects and character armor models look pretty good. The dragon battle sequences is where the visuals really shine (literally).\n\nBut honestly, who cares about graphics?\n\nIf I could describe the game's genre, Journey RPG comes to mind.\nWhenever you kill some goblins, bandits or black ring soldiers, they are dead and they wont ever come back to life. In other words- the mobs in the game don't respawn (with DLC as an exception), which surprised me but it made sense as I went on. In fact, it's an important part of the game since it forces you to explore the game world. Also, as you progress through the story some areas become inaccessible which is why it's not fully open world.\n\nSpeaking of exploration, the game is begging to be explored and will punish you if you don't. Meeting npc's and questing is an essential part of the game. There are no markers or pointers which point the player straight to the direction of the objective. Most of the time questing means solving a puzzle and there are a lot, and I mean a lot, of puzzles. When exploring, the player can get gems and ores for enchanting, plants for potion making, money for bartering and most the most important skill books, which give skill points.\n\nLet's get this out of the way, you'll become a dragon, that's half the reason why people buy this game ^^.\nSadly, first ~10h of the game you'll be spending becoming a dragon, which is a good thing because it adds to the character development. Oh, and once you morph for the first time it feels amazing :).\nDragon gameplay sequences are the most fun by far. Shooting fireballs, releasing novas and just burning the living hell out of anything that opposes you is just as fun as it sounds.\n\nOn the other hand, 'on-foot' combat feels old and stiff. I've only played as a full build, classic warrior so I have no idea about archer or mage classes. Also, there are no definite classes, it is possible to make various hybrid classes as you are allowed to spend your skill points where ever you want.\n\nOne of other important things is the verticality of the game. Using the dragon form to reach different heights to access caves, dungeons, abandoned houses etc. allows the game to feel like an open world. But it's semi-open world at best due to the reason listed above.\n\nOne of most important aspects of this game is the humor. A lot of dialogue options are hilarious. The game sometimes doesn't take itself seriously and simply makes fun of itself.\n\nAll in all, I only recommend the game to patient people, who can tolerate older graphics and who don't mind spending 50% of the game interacting with NPCs and the other 50% burning and, in general, laying waste to the black ring.","August 2, 2015","true","41.9"," 64 of 72 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","64","72","5","3"

You play as a Dragon Slayer; a soldier of an order dedicated to wiping the last of the dragons off the face of the world. Early in the story, a wounded dragon mind-melds with you giving you the soul/powers of a dragon as well as a Dragon Slayer. You also learn of a much bigger threat facing the world previously only known to the dragons. Unfortunately, as a dragon you are now an enemy of your former order. With no allies you set off on an epic quest to save the world!\n\nCombat is set in third person with basic attacks coming from mouse clicks and spells/special moves triggered by the 1-8 keys. The style is similar to World of Warcraft and its ilk. Overall, it feels solid and satisfying and the animations are well executed. The other part of combat is in dragon form which plays more like a flight game. You mainly fight other flying enemies and ground anti-air defences by burning everything with fiery breath! Unfortunately, the dragon form feels much weaker than it should and could have been better.\n\nCharacter progression is your standard Diablo-style RPG; with stat points, skill trees and hundreds of pieces of randomly generated loot as well as sets and uniques. Further customization comes from enchanting, alchemy and necromancy (for your summons). There is lots to play around with and no two people will play it exactly the same.\n\nIn closing, the game is well worth your time if you enjoy this kind of RPG and it should last you 100+ hours if you like to do lots of side quests and exploring.\n","July 28, 2013","true","144.4"," 58 of 64 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","58","64","0","2"

You can't craft, yourself, but you can direct others to do so and so customize your armor and weapons and potion loadout.  Quicksave, which I don't normally use, is very convenient here.  The developers made some interesting choices to ensure that you are not an overwhelmingly powerful dragon that can easily obliterate your puny human foes.   In the main game I found that my dragon form missions were not all that difficult.  The expansion, however, made up for that with a much more challenging "escort mission" battle sequence.  Flying as a dragon was...  well, comfortable, but unrealistic.  Hovering and circle-strafing seems almost magical!  :)  There is some platforming required to complete the game, but it's minimal.

Do I love this game just as much as Original Sin? Definitely--and I love the developers for maintaining my faith in RPGs.\n\nSome plus points:\n+ Questing. Minimal hand holding, quests that were actually fun and required you to be aware of what the characters tell you. There is some freedom of choice on how you want to complete them as well.\n+ Exploration. The game rewards you for taking your time to explore the world. There are many secrets hidden around, whether on paper or in a locked cellar--to which the key you'd have to find using hints the game subtly gives you.\n+ Wonderfully written dialogues and like able NPCs. I'm someone who enjoys games with characters that can make me feel for them. This game has no companions, but the NPCs are so quirky with their own individual personalities, it more than compensates.\n+ Music and voice acting. If you played Original Sin before this game as I did, you might hear some familiar tracks. I didn't mind, they're well done and really help keep you immersed. Voice acting was a joy to listen to.\n+ Combat difficulty. Many modern RPGs I've played at normal difficulty are much too easy. I feel that Divinity 2 has done a good job at balancing. I had to make use of obstacles to avoid missile attacks, dodge and heal and not simply button mash mindlessly.\n\nSome negatives:\n- Camera angle during combat when using certain skills bugs out a little.\n- Not much character customization\n- Crafting and Enchanting are done through NPCs, oversimplified in my opinion. I loved the manual crafting system available in Original Sin. (Of course, Original Sin is newer.)\n\nSummary: Recommended for fans of story driven RPGs. Great for players who appreciate immersion and do not like too much hand-holding when it comes to questing and progression. Also great for those who love to explore and find secrets! Lastly, if you do decide to buy and play it, make sure you play the second part (Flames of Vengeance) that comes included in the Director's Cut as well!\n\nHappy Gaming :) I sure had a good time.","May 24, 2015","true","57.7"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","49","52","0","0"

Divinity 2 Dragon Knight Saga is a great and high quality RPG game which haven't nearly reached the reputation it should deserve.\n\nThe basic plot begins in a small village of Farglow. The main character is a potential freshman recruited by Dragon Slayers - a sect which primary objective is to kill remaining dragon morphing Dragon Knights who have lately  caused more destruction than usual for reason or another. However, through twists and turns protogonist receives the powers of a deadly wounded Dragon Knight thus ironically hunter becomes hunted. Following events reveal real threat who plans to destroy the whole game's world of Rivellon.\n\nGameplay in Divinity 2 is great. Along with main quest player receives experience and rewards from sidequests, loots better equipment from enemy camps and dungeons, charms weapons, etc. The world of Rivellon is filled with nasty enemies like beholders, undead and goblins and it is best to be prepared for fight. As one should be prepared to use mind as well for some areas may have hidden treasures within and can be only accessed by solving a puzzle or finding a key from near.\n\nWhile the fighting system is simple it's also addicting. Left click is primary strike and skills are used by pressing keyboard number buttons which are possible and advisable to be replaced in a right -  and thumb mouse buttons. There is no blocking - only some buffs granting bonuses in attack, defense or spellpower. In addition of buffs there is more than plenty of different active and passive talents to choose from. There is also 5 attributes like strenght and intelligence for an example. The character develeopment is "classless" so you can freely choose to build your character as warrior, archer, summoner, battlemage or something between. I recommend to pay attention for character building though because poorly set skills can cause problems later in a game. Fortunantly there is NPCs who can free already spent points for money.\n\nAs I already mentioned protogonist may become Dragon Knight and this means that he or she is able to transform a dragon, which has its own set of skills and equipment. Con is that as a Dragon movement is limited and it's not possible to burn down enemies moving on foot - only flying hostiles and buildings. In a midway the protogonist claims control of the battle tower where various allies serve with different ways like brewing potions and fetching ingredients.\n\nBy looking at the graphics it's hard to belive that the game is already over 5 years old. I found myself admiring the landscapes several times through playthrough. Voice acting including many european brogues and was mainly above moderate. I also noticed well placed gesture modeling during dialogues that made characters feel more alive.\n\nThe adding "Developer's Cut" in titles name means that the entire game can be played in developer's mode allowing player to access few tools which are mainly insignificant. However, I found free skill setting helpful to decide which skills to choose and it also allows to reset spent skillpoints without cost.\n\nIn conclusion Divinity 2 is really good RPG with really good value even if tagged with its normal price. It provides enjoyment for dozens of hours and while the main storyline threats to flatten in the end I was not dissapointed a bit. One of the best of its genre.","June 20, 2015","true","71.6"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","45","47","0","0"

It is a fantastically fun game.  It's a wonderful romp of a game.  It is not, however, a roleplaying game.  'Planescape: Torment', this is not.  Sure, it wears the moniker of "roleplaying game", but it's a lie.  This is the sum of what you'd get if you mixed 'The Legend of Zelda' with 'Diablo':  an action / adventure game with some roleplaying elements.  It's a singleplayer 'World of Warcraft'.  By roleplaying elements I mean, of course, quests, stats and loot.  "But it has character customization and skill specialization.  I can even choose how my voice sounds..." you say.  Nope.  Sorry.  Roleplaying involves playing the role of a character as though you were that character and making choices that distinguish your playing of the game from, say, your neighbor's.  The game simply doesn't do that.  In an actual roleplaying game you'd be able to express in the dialogue your distaste for Thieves and Bandits, because you're a Goody Two-Shoes Paladin.  You'd be able to grumble at Elves, because you're a racist Dwarf.  Or you'd receive a clever dialogue option due to a high Intelligence stat.  What you get here in dialogue, generally, is a "normal" response and a "funny response".  Unless you're looking to roleplay as a Comedian, I don't think this cuts it.  Intelligence has no effect on dialogue options.  In fact, outside of the status of quest objectives, nothing does.  It's all very static.\n\nDivinity II is really good at what it does.  Deep storytelling it surely isn't.  Sure, it has a backstory, in-game readables and a bit of a thin (and I mean thin), plot.  The game world itself is large enough, beautiful, and whimsical, but it rarely makes sense.  There's quite a bit of video game logic where the game world layout is concerned, particularly regarding layout and enemy encounters.  It is, sort of, free roam.  You have to be able to defeat the enemies in a given area to proceed, and if you can't, then you need to explore somewhere else for awhile.  In that sense, it's not entirely free roam - you have to have the goods to venture into new territory.  That said, due to enemy scaling, fighting higher level enemies yeilds considerably more experience.\n\nAt this point I should mention a factor in the game: mindreading.  You can read the minds of NPCs in the game during dialogue.  The benefits are sometimes great, sometimes mediocre, and sometimes there is no benefit beyond a bit of expositional text.  This is the one part of the game I absolutely hated, because mind-reading is confusing, in my opinion, and creates an experience debt.  So, say you have 3000 exp, for arguments sake, your next level up is at 6000 exp, and you just mindread someone for an experience debt of 1000 exp; you have to fulfill that experience debt of 1000 exp before you can proceed to gain experience towards the next level.  With that said, it's pretty vital to completing the game that you DO mindreads.  In fact, progress in some parts of the game can't be gained without it.  I've read of people who have mindread everyone in the game and been selective in other playthroughs and the comparative ends were negligible.  Take that for what you will.  In my own playthrough, I referred to a walkthrough/faq online whenever I encountered someone in the game.  I used the walkthrough only for the mindreads, because, as I said, I found the whole concept confusing and I didn't wanna fudge my game.\n\nEvery character in this game is voiced.  Every dialogue in the game is spoken.  In fact, many parts of it includes narration, like when you're looking at objects or reading readables.  I think this is, not only uncommon, but also extremely well done here.  You will never hear dialogue spoken in the game and think, "oh, that sounds awful, or cheesy, like they couldn't afford real actors".  The voice-acting here is top-notch and there is so much dialogue in the game that it makes it all the more impressive, in my opinion.\n\nThe game is hilarious.  It truly has a sense of humor.  Sure, it's facade is of this epic adventure, but there is so much humor in this game it's almost unbelievable.  There are parts that are just laugh-out-loud funny.  The humor is easily one of the motivators for my own determination to play it through to the end.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful.  I had no complaints in the visual department.  They obviously built the world very carefully and put alot of thought into it's design.  I only found a handful or so of geographical errors, which is pretty impressive given the scope of the game world.  Running around and exploring the game's world was always fun and rewarding.   The enemies are varied and plentiful.  The items to be found are also varied and plentiful.\n\nHere I should mention how much this game follows the Diablo vein of item-finding.  Most items found in most chest/barrels/whatever.... are randomized.  You can save/reload for a different find.  The same holds true for the quest and boss fight rewards.  It's to a very large degree randomized.  Always saving and reloading looking for better loot would certainly make for a considerably longer game though.  There are certain specific chests and rewards that are always going to yeild the same result, but it's mostly a dice roll.\n\nLike Diablo II the game has prefixed items and it also has set items.  On top of that some items come with enchantments and can also have charms placed on them.  So items will have varying numbers of enchantments and charms (between 0-3 of either) as well as static statistics.  So you might get a bow that does 21-43 damage, 2-5 magic damage and health regeneration of .023, as static statistics, but have an empty charm slot and two enchantments (say, additional 100 damage, +5 spirit).  Charm slots can only be filled once.  Item enchantment slots can be disenchanted and re-enchanted as often as is possible or needed.\n\nThe game has no sense of morality.  You can rob good people blind.  There's even a chapter in the game where you get to choose who out of 4 of 8 people will live and serve you.  The other 4 die.  Why do they have to die?  Excellent question!  The game doesn't provide an answer.  In one of the more extreme examples there is a quest given to execute a man being held.  There is evidence to suggest he's innocent, but freeing him and aiding his escape yeilds no reward whatsoever, but executing him provides considerable reward.  In another, more comical situation, you come across vegetables that talk.  They were all people polymorphed by a witch.  You can restore them to their proper selves, or....  you can eat them.  Remember, you're supposed to be the "hero".\n\nThe game has mucky controls.  It's clearly a game better suited for a gamepad, which isn't supported on PC.  The game is so much an action-oriented console-style "rpg" that it even has platforming tropes.  I kid you not.  There are several instances in the game where you have to be on your "A" game in order to succeed in a platforming task.  To make matters worse, the keyboard controls are not the most responsive.  So, prepare to be frustrated.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a great game that will definitely entertain.  It will also frustrate on occasion.  You might encounter a few bugs, as I did, that will test your patience and resolve (just try again or come back to it later), but I can definitely say this game is worth the time and the money.  It's not a game I'd be much interested in playing a second time through, but that's just me (I'm more of an RPG purist) and it's so worth playing at least once.","October 15, 2014","true","84.0"," 71 of 91 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","71","91","0","7"

Divinity II broke that rule. Although the story itself it's not the best, (It's a normal story for this kind of games) it got a couple of interesting plot twists that make it even more interesting.\nLet's admit it, it's a game rather "old" by now. (Let's keep in mind that Ego Draconis went out in, I think, 2009). But, even if the graphics were upgraded with Dragon Knight Saga, (Yes, if you had "Dragon Knight Saga", the game upgraded itself to the "Developer's Cut"*) there are some textures that could be better and some minor bugs. I mean, I don't want to be disrespectful at all. I feel nothing but respect to Larian Studios. They proved that it doesn't take a worldwide company to make an awesome and unforgetable game.\nOne thing that I think the game lacked is better character customization. There're just a couple of options in hair and face. Nothing deep at all. And, other thing, (And, this is just personal) I'm, let's say, an achievement hunter. I find both entertaining and challenging to try to earn every single achievement every time I play a game. So, the lack of Steam achievements is one of my cons. (Still, it has in-game achievements. But, I don't know. I like to have them in Steam)\nBut, I have to admit that the dialogues were hilarious. The game if filled with amazing NPC's and, each one, has a very funny personality. (Take, for instance, Bellegar. I love the way he talks)\nOverall, I have to say that I recommend this game without any doubt. It's everything that a RPG should be and, sadly, a very underrated game. The amount of different skills is incredible and you can chose whatever you want. Battlemage? Sure! Rogue with a big giant hammer? Why not?\nThere are a lot of great armor sets and legendary weapons to find all over Rivellon and tons of funny quests. Even if you're flying as a fierce dragon, spitting fire all over the Oroba's Fjords or just chilling in the Battle Tower, you'll have a great time.\n\n*The developer's tool it's pretty cool, if you want to play the game by your own rules. I would recommend to try it, at least, once. You'll see, it's very fun.","February 24, 2014","true","115.5"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

Larian clearly puts a lot of thought and effort into their games, and it is most welcome.\n\nFor this game specifically, if you're a dragon lover like me, just buy it.  Do it, you won't regret it.  It is an incredible amount of fun to fly free and burn everything that dares approach in the skies, but it retains challenge enough that if you get careless, flying demons and corrupted dragons can easily bring your flight to an abrupt halt.\n\nIn human form, there is an enormous amount of skills and spells that are ideal in differing circumstances.    The variety of enemies is significant.  Many of them fall into categories that make them similar to others, but they're certainly not identical.  Attack patterns are often similar, but even so, don't count on never getting hit, especially with numerous attacks with limited homing capacities or that hit instantly on being released.  As such, there is still a great deal of value to changing strategies against different opponents.  The bosses, however, are where the real challenge shows up.  Even if you've had no trouble up to the boss in question, be prepared to use everything at your disposal, from potions to underhanded tricks such as abusing the terrain, to win.  When you have to fight tooth and claw to get there, though, it just makes victory all the sweeter.\n\nThe story is quite interesting, though I highly recommend reading up on what happened before the game begins first.  The Divinity Wiki has a story article that gives the background to Ego Draconis, which is the first and main part of the game.\n\nThe graphics certainly aren't amazing by modern standards, but honestly they're not that bad.  They may not be pure cinematic beauty like something like The Witcher 3, but they're hardly an eyesore either.  The music and voice acting are quite impressive as well.\n\nAlso, unlike so many mass-marketed open-world RPGs, Divinity II offers actual reasons to explore, in the form of unique equipment, hidden treasure troves and interesting quests.  Poking around in odd corners is likely to turn up something special that was hand-placed there, rather than just another chest of randomly generated equipment that is worse than what you could buy or make.  And even if it does turn out to be random loot, it's likely at least as good as most merchants carry.\n\nUnlike Skyrim, with its unlimited supply of boring fetch quests, Divinity II has quests both in towns and in odd corners of the world that have some story and challenge to solving them.  You also won't see a huge floating arrow saying "quest target is right here!", instead you will have to use the information given to you by the quest giver and your journal to locate the target.  Don't worry, it won't be that hard to find if you pay attention, and it makes the game significantly more interesting and immersive.\n\nI could go on and on, but I'll cut it here with one final comment:  Easily one of the most addicting games I've come across in a very long time.  The others that prevent me from putting this alone at the very top?  Same developer.  That says a lot, I think.","March 14","true","195.9"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

If you want to be a DRAGON this is for you!! The number of references to mothy python and other oddly humorous movies makes the game flow even faster, and the plot takes you places you haven't been expecting.\n\nThe skill system makes combat varied, as it is possible to get skills from each class as you choose to. Unfortunately the enemies don't scale very well in levels. The combat is really hard in the start, which is really interesting, but as the game progresses the enemies don't get harder.

It has a beautifully realized fantasy universe, excellent writing with snappy dialogue, engaging characters, and a genre identity that seamlessly blends serious epic fantasy with satire and humor.\n\nDespite these wonderful marks in its favor, however, the game itself is rife with flaws. Divinity II is a hard game, but not in the satisfying or rewarding way that many other RPGs claim to be. The gameplay is typically uninteresting at best and painfully difficult at worst, thanks to many random and often nonsensical difficulty spikes. The story, while incredibly well-told, is still typical fantasy tripe involving the monster-hunter becoming the monster, an evil megalomaniacal sorceror, plot-twisting betrayals that can be seen from a mile away, and more McGuffins than you can shake a stick at.\n\nTransitioning between Dragon form and Human form is perhaps the worst offense that the game commits. While you can transform at will at almost any time, your enemies are tracked separately. Having trouble with a particularly tough pack of necromancers? Turn into a dragon and burn them to a crisp from above, you might say! Well, because of the way the game works, you can't. Those necromancers suddenly disappear along with every other enemy when you become a dragon, magically reappearing right in the same spot the moment you switch back to human form. This creates all sorts of other problems as well, like using dragon form to reach an otherwise impossible floating platform, only to be eviscerated by the sudden appearance of enemies as soon as you land. And don't get me started on how aggro is handled...\n\nDespite its flaws, I couldn't help but enjoy Divinity. I enjoyed creating my character out of every skill imaginable. This wasn't just a fireball-spewing demon-summoning plate-armored dual-wielding berserker, it was MY fireball-spewing demon-summoning plate-armored dual-wielding berserker. As painful as the transformation process was, I couldn't help but get a gleam in my eye and a smirk on my face as I soared through the skies in dragon mode while epic fantasy music blasted in the background.\n\nDivinity is a game that really wants you to like it. To be fair, it does fix most of its big issues by the second half of the game, Flames of Vengeance, but the first half of this 30 hour adventure can feel like a bitter ordeal up till then. The writing and charm, however, keep the game alive. It is truly a beautiful game, and one I did enjoy, personally, but it's not one that I could recommend in good faith. It is definitely a game that is worth borrowing or picking up in a sale, but unless the charm infects you, and it just "clicks" for you, there are definitely better options out there for you.","November 25, 2013","false","35.6"," 220 of 354 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","220","354","0","6"

Still an RPG with interactive conversations, puzzles, and Quests, Divinity 2 allows you to make choices which affect the events in the game. This is a key ingredient in an immersive RPG. Divinity 2 looks appealing, and allows you to tailor craft your character similar to the way Divine Divinity did, but without the need for a specific starting class. The game offers crafting options, as you would typically find in more modern RPG's, such as; Alchemy, and Enchanting, but also offers Necromancy, to control and customize an undead pet. This game looks and feels like a really fun RPG and the DLC is supposed to be even better, so I can't wait to dive into that. If you enjoy RPG's, I think this is one you shouldn't miss. You won't be disappointed.","June 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

As far as what i like about inside the game, for example: the puzzles and tricks you have to solve are pretty challenging but not too hard. as in some main quests require you to find an item like a book inside a verry messy library... yea. its more like exploring is the quest.

I like the skill tree and that if you decide you don't like the skill you can reset your points and change it. In most games I usually play as a ranger or thief. I of course chose to be a ranger and use a bow, and I like the ranger skills, though the stun arrow is good, but with each point put into it, it only increases the stun duration by 1 second. With combat I follow a pattern, fire a skill and strafe to dodge whatever the enemies fire at me, I hardly ever get hit.\n\nAnd you can't just rush in, I did every side quest possible in Broken Valley before even attempting to do the main quest. Not recomended for those who don't wish to explore, take their time or read.\n\nBut it also took over 20 hours before I could become a dragon and also get my battle tower, the main base which you store your items, it was annoying lugging around all that stuff and having to sell things I didn't want to as  I was running out of room.\n\nIt's awesome that you can become a dragon and fly around, but also limited to aerial combat as enemies on the ground will disapear and will only reappear when in human form. And you can't fly too freely as you get invisible walls above and below which is restrictive as well as kind of weird but also undestandable that it's for balance so that it does not make the game too easy if you can just torch all enemies on the ground would make the slayer a bit too overpowered.\n\nI also dislike the very random loot in chests, I mostly end up with stuff I don't need unless I want to play the reload 100 times till I get what I want game.\n\nI hate that to use the mindreading ability you use experience points, so you end up with xp debt. It is a useful skill as it gives you passwords and lowers store prices or you can find locations of secret hidden items. But also alot of the time you don't know if they will have useful info as often it's just someone thinking something about how he hates guard duty. At first I would save before using it and reload if the mind read was useless, but that got tedious so I just mind read everyone. Doesn't seem to affect my lvling up, I always get plenty of xp and I always choose bonus xp as a quest reward. So not really a problem.\n\nOverall it's a very enjoyable game with good graphics, fun game play, beautiful sound track, quest choices and exploration.  I recomend it.\nI'd rate it 7/10","March 4, 2015","true","66.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Game, Man!\n\nThis is one of the most inspired games out there, it's more than clear that this world was developed with love and passion over the desire to make profit and sales. Gameplay is somewhat floaty and will require some getting used to but offers an amazing range of variety and clear and significan progress as you level up.\n\nThe story is nothing too shocking but a good one nonethless, I enjoyed it even though it was predictable and average, you might not be to impressed here.\n\nThe game's world and art style is what drew me in the most, it has amazing towns, very classical looking while offering new area that will later spawn nostalgia if you play long enough.\n\nHumor, something not common in RPG's but this one does splendidly well, even though they try and present this serious and critical situation of dragons and demons, the character's dialogue can be hilariously cliche and the developers clearly spent time focusing on making this game what it really is, a game. Of course one can demand immersion from RPG titles but do not go into this looking for that. The dialogue is clearly written to lighten up the feel of the game and bring smiles without breaking your experience.\n\nVoice acting is mediocre with no lazy work, all characters are voiced professionally and respectfully.\nAlthough the game promises an open world, the player will have to make some progress before in the story to reach the core of the game, having the dragon power, and even then the game continues to be a challenging one.\n\nIn the end this stands a solid RPG made by a very dedicated and passionate team, although by no means a triple A title, the game holds a firm standing in the RPG genre as a unique and creative title.

The world, its lore and characters, are just so interesting while the combat strung it all together so nicely. As a ranger I would go around launching exploding arrows at groups of enemies while my undead summon pulled aggro. But there was also a lot of moving around and dodging enemy projectiles as well. Lengthy stuns and instantaneous flinch attacks can make fights pretty frustrating, though. And then there is the dragon combat. You fly around hitting towers and other flyers with your fire breath and fireball attacks for the most part. You can't attack or even see ground units which means when you switch back to human form you can drop into the middle of a group of enemies and not even realise it till you're dead. Theres not much else I can say about it other than it makes for a nice change of pace. Overall, there are a lot of side quests and a lot of different places to explore. There weren't many variations on the dungeons, but they never got stale.

The reason was that they always called Divinity an Action, Diablo-Clone RPG and I am a more traditional RPG fun. No matter whatever are the superficial similarities between them, Divinity is very different than Diablo. It is more like an old school RPG, with action gameplay.\nThe Rivellon lore is quite generic, but the stories and the quests are interesting and unique. A better comparison of the game would be the Gothic series. This means no hand-holders in the quests, Few quest marks, and solving quests through reading books and thinking. There is also a lot of exploration and a lot of hidden things in the game. But let's be more Concrete\nStory: At first sight it looks like an effort to cash in the fantasy fans love for dragons. This was also another reason for my initial contempt. Even if this is truth, the Rivellon world is full of shady characters and violence which exists beneath the surface of a fairy-tale-like fantasy. Even if the creatures living in Rivellon are quite generic, nevertheless their actions aren't. The plot can get boring sometimes, but it get's really good after the Hero goes to Aleroth, which is full of interesting quests and a lot of funny characters. For this reason STORY 7/10.\nGameplay: The game has aged a bit and it is obvious. There are some game bugs but they are not gamebreaking, Using the Dragon can also get cumbersome sometime. Riddles can get annoyingly difficult sometimes. but usually in the side quests. There are interesting and immersive battles and a nice addition of a baldur's gate like pause system. Companions AI is cute, but not fantastic. For this reason GAMEPLAY 8/10 (or 9 if you are lenient because of the age of the game)\nMUSIC: 10/10(whoever is involved with the Divinity series knows why\nVALUE FOR MONEY(I bought this extremely cheap because I liked the Divinity Original Sin in an Anthology offer): 20/10\nGRAPHICS: OLD BUT CUTE 8/10\n\nIS IT FUN? HELL YES. OVERALL: 8/10.

Just when you think the game is being too generic for its own good it suddenly gets epic, it actually takes you by surprise.  Welcome to the world of Divinity 2, Larian Studios most ambitious RPG title to date.\n\nThe land of Rivellon is a whimsical yet foreboding ecosystem filled with colourful characters and sinister creatures, all of which are surrounded by a gloriously thought out fantasy realm powered by the same Gamebryo engine used in Oblivion. It is a place where talking to obnoxious fruit and getting seduced by lascivious treasure chests is the norm.\n\nThis sort of fantastical absurdity makes Divinity 2 all the more engaging and places it in a class above the normal RPG fare.\n\nDivinity 2 is real time action orientated Role playing experience with dense, yet slick old school RPG elements.  The character creation process is simple yet effective as your characters progress is shaped through the course of levelling up. Unlike some other games in this genre, enemies do not scale and level with you which is a refreshing change, if you fancy taking on a new area with low experience prepare to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you – you will be slaughtered!   This element may initially force you to stay close to home, but it also allows you to flesh out your abilities, strengths and weakness and work towards the goal of combating these high level foes.  If you do manage to take out some high level enemies, the XP gained is truely worth the effort.\n\nThroughout the realm there are tonnes of hidden caves, chambers and areas filled with all sorts of loot, all of which will help in your quest.  Weapons, garments and armour can also be charmed altering the statistic values based on the type of charms used as well as enhancing your own skills. Levelling up allows you to assign points to various skills, all of which are accompanied with an introductory video on what each skill does in the real world – a great touch.\n\nLater on in the game you get the ability to transform into Dragon and be in command of your very own Battle Tower, I won’t go into any spoiler specifics with this but it presents the player with a completely new gaming mechanic in regards to both combat and fast travel.  Certain locations can only be accessible in Dragon form and populating your Tower is an excellent well thought addition to an already astounding RPG.\n\nPop culture references feature throughout Divinity 2 in humorous abundance adding to its charm and appeal.  NPC voice acting is fantastic, breathing life into a densely populated land.  The characters you meet all have there own motivations and needs which you can manipulate to your advantage with the Dragon Slayer power of Mindread – with often hilarious results.\n\nBoth Divinity 2 and the sequel Flames of Vengeance are excellent examples of the RPG genre that are definitely not dumbed down for the masses and will provide a richly rewarding experience for any player willing to invest some time in the land of Rivellon.\n\nI can definitely recommend Divinity 2: The Dragon Knight Saga if you want an in-depth, charming and highly playable action RPG, I grabbed it on sale off Steam a while ago and have put well over 100hours into this game. Divinity 2 has all the popular RPG staples such as lore, books, thousands of weapons, items that can be “charmed”  and presents itself with golden age RPG sensibilities with no constant hand holding.","November 26, 2013","true","0.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's sort of a cross between Fable and Skyrim. If you're expecting Dark Souls type combat you will be sorely disappointed. When reading about locking on to enemies and roll dodging in the manual it sounded reminiscent of Dark Souls, but I had to remind myself.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting abilities that are limited by both mana consumption and cooldowns. There's also not a strict class system which I really like in RPGs. There's not a huge amount of character customization in terms of appearance - much closer to Morrowind than Skyrim in that regard.\n\nThere are some annoyances such as not having quest markers for NPCs. There was one who gave me a quest, but then moved to a different location because he was involved in a side quest. Due to him being involved in that side quest, I wasn't unable to complete the original quest he gave me until went back to the town where he originally gave me the quest.","April 11","true","133.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

For example in one quest you would have to find out about a murderer or finding an talkin melon you have to find the other fruits to open the dorms and kill the witch who made them fruits. - so even the sidequests are of the kind that you wanna find out more about the thing itsself.\nIn Divinity 2 it is not predicted if you choose mage warrior or bowman. You can mix  them all. You can - for example be a bowman how can switch to some claymore, does damage and gain hp back by that.\nAnother aspect why I like this game is that it is definately not easy but why is that bad ? You can find many potions that increase your magic spell power or other potions to increase a resistance against fire damage. Yes the game is hard but using your brain and stuff makes it possible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justx2/recommended/219780/","justx2","JuStX2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justx2/","95 products in account","Simply put this is a arche-typical Fantasy-setting RPG - Single Player only.\n\nSome things people may be wary of are:\n\n1. The Hint system (mind read) is used by expending Level up XP to use. While this is what the description says, it's not so much expending as extending, and what I mean by that is you never really *lose* the experience you already have, you just go into what's called "Experience Debt" which has to be repaid before you can continue to gain normal experience.\n\n2. The Tutorial Assumes you are already firmiliar with at a minimal RPGs, and probably assumes too much about your experience with action-games. What I mean by this is: The Tutorial doesn't go over more "basic" RPG Elements such as "Equipment" or "Gear" let alone "leveling" but it does give you basic controls. What I mean by it assumes too much about your experience with Action Games is...for the tutorial to cover controls is fine, but more of the advanced moves (ie rolling/jumping/dodging) are not well explained until AFTER you need them. Long Story short - the tutorials are very basic, and could use some polishing towards total newbies.\n\n3. Although the game is a bit dated (circa 2008 - 2009) the actual game-play/graphics details and other "Preformance Effecting" Details are quite up-to-par with modern standards. This game was obviously ahead of it's time even though it's time was a while back.\n\n***WARNING: The Next Few Sections MAY contain some spoilers. Reader Descretion is advised***\n\n4. I have -not- encountered any spiders - yet. I have to make mention of this because this is something I personally like, but realize not everyone wants. To Progress roughly 20~ Hours into the main-line quest stream and not see a single spider (albeit some webs) enemy is a good thing to me, because I am among those who are afraid of spiders (however - I am most certainly NOT afraid of Scorpions so I'm not "Archnophobic" by a typical detail). Mostly the Enemies I *have* encountered are undead/humanoid/demihuman types. Ie 2 Legs 2 Arms and Some Form of head and torso. The ghosts have no legs just two draping sheets tho.\n\n5. The Dragon Form - about the dragon form, although it cross-interfaces with the human form it feels more like the enemies are split into Dragon-Class (flying/structure mostly) and Human-class Enemies, and there is little combination of the two. Although you can fight some dragon-class enemies with a bow, the structures and such will not fire at a human. Moreover - the Ability/Skill system is only slightly different between human and dragon abilities, the major difference being you have (afaik) no "Natural" Skill Points in Dragon Abilities (you have to read some kinda book to get points etc). Also Although the Human form regenerates overtime at a variable rate - dragon form only heals when actively healed (ie with a spell/ability) which means you'll be using alot more of your dragon time using abilities rather than breathing fire.\n\n*** END -Possible- Spoilers ***\n\nOverall the game is good enough that I'd continue to play it for quite some time, however the aforementioned flaws are some of the things I wish had been explained to me before I found out on my own (which took some time)\n\nThe Story in particular is excellently told, and personally I find myself continuing to play the game mostly because the story is so mysterious and intriguing. Good Example, One quest (which I have yet to complete) has you facing against a "Veggie" Witch, which to say nothing of the comedic standpoints is very unique among the thoughts of curses when someone evaluates a game such as this. Well-thought out the story is, but at times is just plain comedic to be sure. The Main Plot is no laughing matter though, but I'll leave that for you to discover. Advice: Get Used to Dying even on the easiest settings if you don't pay attention to what your doing. On the other hand, on the easiest settings there comes a point at which you become nigh invinicible late game.","December 21, 2015","true","47.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game starts out as you being a initiate to a elite force of dragon hunters called the Slayers. Your mission is to hunt down the last dragon knight and put him or her to death. (dragon knights are people who can turn into dragons) well this dragon knight screws you over by forcing her powers on you and ruins your life. I'll let you figure out the rest. I give it a clear 10/10 can play the same game hundreds of times but to be warned it is almost as hard as darksouls on normal, so do every side quest before  even thinking on taking on the bossess.","September 22, 2014","true","30.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Divinity II is one of those games where you struggle between giving credit to developers for making an enormous step forward from their previous games, and yet are faced with a standard experience at best.\n\nFor every single thing the game does well, it botches in another or similar area.\n\nThe combat can be very challenging, but is marred by the most boring skill system I have EVER seen in an rpg.  Not only are these skills uninspiring, but nearly all of them scale terribly.  In most cases it's simply not worth having multiple points in one skill.  The classes are divided into warrior, mage, and archer archetypes.  Warrior is boring, and mage is outright disappointing, I have not played the archer.  Outside of the types of skills, the system is classless, and you can put points where you want, although damage skills are modified by stats.  There are limited enemies in the main game (Ego Draconis), making your skill point distribution a weighty choice until you can reset them about 40% of the way through.  Even worse, acquiring or advancing many quests (several key ones in the expansion) require you to sacrifice xp in the form of mindreading.  You can reset your skill points, BUT for some reason you cannot reset your Stat points which are largely responsible for the damage bonuses / resistances of the game.  Really?  How hard would it have been to program that in?\n\nThe dialogue of the game is near-poetry, but the plot fails to deliver at several key points and not only manages one unsatisfactory ending, but two with the expansion pack.  You will labor long, and you will probably not like the end result.  How you feel afterwards is purely dependent on how much you enjoyed getting there.\n\nAs you can see from the pictures on Steam, the game allows you to transform into a Dragon.  What it doesn't show is that you inexplicably cannot attack ground troops.  You are limited to aerial enemies, none of which are a match for you anyhow, and equally mundane offensive structures.  For what is undeniably a major feature of the game, and receives significant buildup in the story, I found its application completely lazy.\n\nThe environments are nicely-detailed, as are character models (even if weapon/armor textures for the character are re-used more often than I'd like), but the game-world itself is actually fairly small and limited for something proposing to be an epic rpg.  This is generally offset by having many interior cells, but you cannot help but feel somewhat confined the whole game, especially since the entire expansion takes place in and under the city of Aleroth.\n\nThis "one step forward, one step back" ideology can mar some of the better qualities of the game.  Much of the dialogue is gratifying, and at numerous turns I was happy that many of the dialogue choices (though not as extensive as a Bioware game) were sentiments very similar to what I would actually say.  The other fact is there's a lot of meat here - quite a lot to do, if in such small spaces.  This can be a good thing or a bad thing.  Many of the sidequests are interesting, even if they largely offer inconsequential rewards, and you really have to explore every nook and cranny for all the treasures.\n\nOnce you acquire your base, you can send items directly there from your inventory no matter where you are.  You can also access your base from anywhere within the game via a stone that you carry.  You can have runners fetch you enchantment and alchemy supplies, work on your partner creature, enchant gear, brew potions, increase skill caps, and access your storage.  Storage has a limit, but as a packrat I can tell you you'll never run out of space.  These features are excellent.\n\nIn terms of performance, I run the game at max settings, and still had a crash-to-desktop a few times.  After several hours of play the game becomes choppy and requires a restart to smooth it back out again.  Other than occasionally dicey summoned-creature AI, the programming is pretty solid.\n\nSo, if you're hard up for a new rpg, I recommend the title.  Truthfully though, the replay value is slim to none, but if you're looking to burn about 60 hours, you could do far worse.","April 26, 2014","true","59.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game combines open world feel with a linear play through. There are a couple world sections that you can travel to at different times. Each section is worth exploring as there is a lot of fun side quests and loot. However you are in a fixed storyline in each of these sections and often returning to old sections is pointless. On a scale of Open-world to Linear this game falls as a little more Linear than Fable III (You have a central hub after a main questline and can go to different areas to pick up stuff you missed, but once the end sequence of the game begins there is no going back).\n\nThe BIG downside to this game is that there is 0 replayability.

The art direction was a fairly typical high-fantasy look without going too wild. As 'real' a world as you're likely to see in this genre.\n\nThe music was extremely well done. Not much more to say about that. It was very good.\n\nGameplay was mostly smooth, there seemed to be some issues with jumping and it became advisable to always jump just a little ahead of what you thought you'd need. There were also some issues with clipping on objects but didn't occur often enough for me to get frustrated by it.\nLevelling was very smooth - each level actually made you feel more powerful but never took you to a point where there was no challenge at all. Different builds (Can't really call them classes, it's a classless system, you just choose the talents that you want and level them up as far as you want) may get different mileage but by the time I was near the end of the game the only thing I really had to watch out for were large groups of ranged or magic users since my health was tightly tied to hurting things.\n\nOverall it felt like a slightly more primitive version of Dragon Age in many ways. Certainly preferable to what they did to DA2! Also, no spoilers, but you WILL feel like you've been kicked in the neck at the end of the game, don't worry, the expansion makes up for it.\n\nYeah... the expansion. I should mention that you don't import your character and you don't start with any of the gear you had, or indeed any at all, just enough gold to help buy things to get you back on your feet. Also, it takes away your shape-shifting ability until right at the end, that felt a bit dickish. So, while the 'world' was smaller and the play more limited, it did still have a reasonably engaging story to help get you through it.\n\nMade me all the more eager for the studios upcoming Original Sin game set in the far past of the same world.","May 15, 2013","true","60.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can spend some of your exp to read minds and find out various useful information, like passwords, locations of items or keys, or even get the illusive stat/skill point boosts.\n\nAs well as turning into a dragon later in the game where you can pretend to be the pyro and do the W+M1 thing.\n\nCombat is in 3rd person, and only in 3rd person. It's like a more floaty Fable, or Enclave, or something, except you can't block, and you can only dodge and jump. You got your Melee, your Ranged, and your various melee, ranged, and magic active and passive abilities.\n\nAlso speaking of 3rd person, like the previous games, theres plenty of items strewn about the world, as well as some hidden switches, but why they didn't put in any first person mode is beyond me, because your character's neck is really stiff, and you can only look down so much, and its a general pain to pick most stuff up in general, unless your looting a container, or those floaty item bags enemies sometimes drop.\n\nThankfully, there isn't like 9 different stats to choose from on a level up like the last game. Instead, there's just 5. Although for some reason, instead of the traditional 5 stat points per level up, you only get 4 this time around. That kind of sucks.\n\nThe game's difficulty is like a coin, on the first half, the game is hard and vaguely unforgiving, and on the other half, it's ♥♥♥♥ easy. Like any good RPG I suppose, the previous games did pretty much just that too, and until you get to the second half of the game, you will die many times, and when you die, the game does not respect your time, locks the controls, and shows your character twitching out and dying. So trying to go to the menu or quickloading in rage won't work until the game finally tells you the obvious: You've died, load a savegame. Although quarter way through the game you get access to the battle tower, a base instance of sorts where you can *finally* stash your items, increase your cap of certain skills from a trainer, as well as access to an alchemist, necromancer (managers your minion which you can then summon after you first enter the battle tower), and an enchanter. You can also send out 3 dudes out on an adventure to gather ingredients, ore, and gems for you. They can be equipped better for a fee to do it "faster", and reduce chance of injury. So finally, the game gives you a breather after you reach this damn tower. As with the other games, it pretty\nmuch gets easier the further you are in the game. My strategy towards the end of the game was spin to win: Whirlwind spam, as its literally faster than my standard attacks maxed out and knocks everything within range flat on its ♥♥♥ or dead. Ahh, classic whirlwind spam. As well as using the not-omnislash move on enemies that must absolutely positively die, that's always fun, especially when it glitches out and plays a really corrupt version of a transformer transforming.\n\nThe game progresses a bit similarly to the second game, and is roughly split up into 3 acts, once you're past an act, you can't go back. Each act has a fairly big overworld to explore and quest in and whatnot.\n\nWaypoints from the first game are back, except you don't need a scroll to activate them. You just approach them and use them, and you're off to an activated waypoint of your choosing. You can jump 4 inches in the air, then later 8 feet in the air, but why you can't sprint in this fairly vast world just brings my slightly impatient ♥♥♥♥ to a boil. Although you can get around pretty fast when you have access to your dragon form.\n\nDivinity as usual has it's sense of humor, and it's references. I always get a good laugh every now and then from certain dialogues.\n\nDivinity II uses the Gamebryo engine, roughly the same one that Oblivion used, so it runs slightly like garbage, although I've only had one crash in my nearly 50 hours of playing. So it's pretty stable, and it loads areas relatively fast. Let me tell you one thing though, it does not feel remotely like Oblivion, except for the somewhat dodgy framerate,\nsome of the lighting, and those silly 2D sprite tree leaves. Although I did get a Morrowind vibe from the game treating herbs and ore veins like loot containers, although unlike MW, this game actually has a take all items hotkey (E), so you don't have to get hand cramp PTSD flashbacks.\n\nWhen physics objects like barrels roll around, they play some sort of ominous death beat on a pair of ghost bongos. I don't know either. It's kind of funny but also really disturbing.\n\n...And like every good RPG, the merchants will rip you off blind, aka charge you 10,000 gold for that rusty old dagger thats been sitting up the merchant's bum for the past decade, and give you jack ♥♥♥♥ for that literal holy grail in your posession. You can mind read merchants to (usually) get them to lower their prices by like 5-10%, or some other minor amount. Doesn't seem to help with selling stuff to them though.\n\nA lot of things feel very finite, like herbs will never regenerate, and enemies don't seem to respawn, at least not until the last third of the game. This is what the previous games seemed to do, but it was mostly fine, because the previous games weren't ultra stingy with potions in the first third of the game, and merchants actually restocked. You'll find yourself stuffing your character with food consumables to save on potions early game.\n\nLet me remind you, like the other games' AI, enemies will relentlessly pursue you until you're at least a thousand feet away, or incredibly dead. So you have to deal with them, or somehow convince your character to get the lead out and run away for twelve hours anyway.\n\nAlthough the fairly finite resources thing is remedied after you get access to the 3 runners in the battle tower, in which you can send them out, return to the field, return to the tower, and they'll be back in an instance, hopefully not injured and ready to give you the stuff you asked them to find. So you can pretty much farm most of your alchemy/enchanting materials to your hearts content if you want, or you could avoid the serious cheese and just do it every now and then if you have a crippling fear of the game getting too easy.\n\nSpeaking of cheap, the RNG containers are back. So you can once again save and load over and over until you get some good materials, or recipes, or equipment or whatever. One time I got 2 of the same exact potion recipe in the same chest. Neat.\n\nAfter I beat the game, I was like "Oh boy, that was pretty decent, now time to take on a silly bonus campaign with my now overpowered character, Dragon Age style!" Then I proceeded to click New Game - Flames of Vengeance, only to find out it was the last 3rd of the game overall. *facepalm*\n\nIt's a pretty fun game and gets easier once you get the hang of it. Wish it could have been deeper and more indepth like the older games as well as being a bit more vast.","June 1","true","49.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And Encumbrance which increases the capacity of your backpack. (I know it may not seem so usefull at first but if you loot everything you get your hands on to sell or use later you will most likely put all the points you can in to that skill ^^ that being 5) and of course the weapons expertise skills Single-Handed, Dual-Wielding, Two-Handed, Sword and Shield and theres even Unarmed expertise if you wanna try that out.\n\nIm telling you this game got A Lot to do in it :)\nI almost forgot, there is a quicksave in the game and I suggest you save often because your choices can change things, as they say in-game "Your Actions have Consequences"\n\nMay I just say one more thing that will guarantee you will be interested in trying this game.\nAfter you get to a certain point in the game (Its pretty early in the game) you are able to turn into a fire breathing dragon at will! At the push of a button! (Default being Q) :D But you can only attacking flying enemies or Ballistas and other buildings that attack you. Oh and there are several DIfferent Armor Sets that gives bonuses to your Dragon Skills :) You get your first one after you get your dragon form if you check your Storage Chest in the tower :)\n\nOnly bad thing is at some point it got a bit repetitive, but that may just be because the way I played it with magic only. I leaned more towards using bigass swords near the end because I got them and it was way more fun at the end :)","July 9, 2014","true","96.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Having read some reviews and seeing it on sale I decided to give it a go. I see now that this is a big game and its going to take a while to complete so I may add to this review later. My first impressions are good having just finished what could be classed as the first area. There are similarities here to other RPG's in that you have a bunch of side quests and then the main one. Thats  where they stop as the rest of the game is quite original in that your character is a dragon slayer pretty much with an open book skills develoment tree. I like this because you can customise your path to be either a pure class or a hybrid. A kind of pick and mix of skills. I've varied my character up to this point and he seems ok in combat so at this stage there doesn't seem to be a penalty for being a mixed bag. That may not work for everyone though depending on your play style. There is a certain strategy when dealing with opponents and it is this that may make you think more about the skills you buy. For instance I found my survival chances went up when using a bow against certain opponents as opposed to just charging in. This is why I am warming to the game because its a thinking mans RPG. Skyrim it is not but at least you can be a dragon in this rather than just riding one. The story is also fascinating with lots of historical references which add meat to the world you explore. The decisions you make also have consequences from small to large depending on what you do. The graphics are quite nice with varied scenery and architecture. Monsters range from little kick them in the butt types up to larger more challenging ones. Often you will get mobbed so its wise to learn some aoe skills or face oblivion. Its a game of secrets as well and some are not easy to find. NPC voice acting is pretty good and adds to the atmosphere. I like all the different personalities you encounter on your journey.\n\nAs it stands if you are a hardcore RPG fan then give this one a try. If you are new to the genre you may find this one a bit difficult to get into due to its depth.","July 4, 2014","true","80.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game has been one of my favorite RPGs. One that I will go back to time and time again. It can be over the top, cartoonish, and childish at times but thats what gives Divinity 2 its charm. Days worth of content await and much more for the player who's willing to overlook its dated gameplay and graphics. Combat may not be as easy and the entire experience may vary per person. Dialogue can range from rich to shallow humor, but with the amount of easter eggs and homages, one can be sure that conversation can be quite a treat. The dragon form is one of the best aspects of the game as it is unique in itself. I found myself flying a good bit of my playthrough and just attacking fortresses in the areas presented. There are some glitches and bugs that can make it a chore to play at times but nonetheless it is a very good game that blends two distinct genres.  My only regret is that Larian wasn't able to make this game the way it was supposed to be due to budget cuts.

Gameplay is bad.Some mechanics are making me say "Why?" a lot.\n! Stats are mostly useless and unnecessary.Has stuff like stun resistance in gears instead of being linked to main stats you have.And for most part Only useful stat is Vitality which is a bad thing for a RPG game you need stat build depth.","March 22","true","86.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stealthmomo/recommended/219780/","stealthmomo","StealthMomo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stealthmomo/","558 products in account","As much as I love Divine Divinity feels a little 'incomplete.' I don't know why but it really gives that not-so solid feeling whenever I play the game. Don't be fooled with my game time because I bought and played this game a long time ago on Good Old Games together with Divine Divinity and the sequel Beyond Divinity.\n\nAnyway, aside from that obvious fault the game surprisingly have a lot of content for you to complete. The skill system is flexible enough that you can choose whatever skills you want to develop which makes your character unique as you progress through the game.\n\nI think the game should have been released as is without the developer's console command.\n\nBut since I love the developers and they are really passionate about creating games, I don't mind playing this again and I think I will enjoy it this time given to the fact that it's a Steam version that I can easily upload screenshots and make game guides.\n\n[...]\n\nThe idea behind the Developer’s Cut was to create a new SKU (the publishing term for a new version of your game, comes originally from Stock Keeping Unit, a unique code to identify the game). And the idea behind that was that it might get us some extra attention at the time of release, sufficient to get attention from those RPG players that didn’t try out Divinity II yet.\n\nWe thought long and hard about what we could put in this SKU and came to the conclusion that it would take us too long to put some meaningful content in. Our gut instinct therefore told us that we shouldn’t do it,  but then the idea originated to make some kind of a developer’s version of Divinity II.\n\nIt’d be a version where we’d share the story of making Divinity II in the form of a documentary, include the design documents & the milestone videos we’d made for the publishers at the time, and the cherry on the cake would be the inclusion of the developer console we’d been using during development. This would enable players to see how we actually looked at the game during development, and allow them to do things only we could do (like flying around in areas you’re not supposed to fly or turning yourself into any creature you could think of). It’d be something we’d give away for free to those who had already bought DKS, and something that might tickle the interest of those who hadn’t.\n\nIn short, it was a new SKU created from an old SKU without too much effort, exactly the kind of thing we were looking for, even if – tbh – to this day we still only have a vague idea of what exactly a SKU is, other than what it says on Wikipedia.\n\nSo we decided to go ahead with the Developer’s Cut, and thus create an Anthology that would include Divine Divinity, Beyond Divinity & Divinity II: The Developer’s Cut. But saying that you’re going to make a new SKU and actually releasing it are two different things.\n\nBecause the Developer’s Cut included the patched up version of the original Dragon Knight Saga, we needed to browse through all of our existing contracts and get an OK from any previous publisher that might have rights in this, which turned out to be quite a job, worthy of yet another separate blog entry and good for eating up about a quarter of my time – leaving me with a measly three quarters to take care of all the rest.\n\nOther than new contracts, the new SKU also required a new logo, new descriptions that needed be translated in all kinds of languages, new Steam listings, new promo material etc… and the process of getting all of that in place, you’ll never guess it, is worth another blog entry on its own. Suffice to say that even at the time of writing this current update, not all of that is finalized. But I have good hopes ;)\n\nIn addition to that, we also had to localize all the new material and because we changed the code of the game, that meant we also had to engage in new rounds of QA. Now, saying ‘QA on a 100+ hour game’ in the same phrase as ‘multiple languages’ is in general enough to intimidate any development director, no matter what his pedigree.\n\nLuckily, the QA part wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be, because the cool part about including the Developer Mode is that you can actually use the cheats while testing. I’m told that Octaaf, our lead QA, can finish the game in 1 hour 43 minutes and 22 seconds. (Matthew, the lead gameplay programmer on Divinity II can do it in 1 minute – he says – by issuing the “oe end “ command in the console ;) )\n\n[...]\n\nhttp://www.lar.net/2012/10/09/hatching-the-anthology/","February 24, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is a typical swords, bows and magic type of fantasy world.  The one addition to your normal RPG is the ability turn into a dragon at specific points in the game.  It is hard for me to state why I enjoyed the game so much.  It is just a great and interesting top-down RPG, something that is hard to find these days.\n\nThe good:\n1. The normal RPG type stuff is done excellently.  The quests, equipment, skills, etc.\n\nThe bad:\n2. Your character always sheaths his weapons during dialogue.  Thus after talking to enemies you have to redraw your weapons wasting valuable time.  You may die before you even drew your weapon.\n3. Movement during combat is not always fluent.  If you are hit (e.g. by an arrow) while jumping the character is instantly moved to the ground and staggered wasting time and momentum.  Even worse, when swinging your weapon there is no correlation between clicking your mouse and actual swings.  Sometimes attacks are fast and sometimes slow and I have no idea why.\n4. My personal preference is for RPGs where you deploy a team of units with different skills.  Here you only have yourself and summoned creatures.\n\nThe ugly:\n4. Being a dragon is totally disappointing.  When normal you can only attack ground units.  When you are a dragon cannot attack ground units only certain towers and flying units.  Surely you want to be a dragon to flame those annoying units that swarmed you on ground.","April 25","true","36.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The RPG game is enjoyable to some people, but not to others due to its nature: it's more of like reading a book. The skill tree and combat in general aren't very tactical: it doesn't really matter what you choose. The reason why the game is so awesome in my opinion is the voice acting and plot. It is one of the few games that have actually managed to give characters a value! All characters are unique, the way they talk, the thoughts they think (yes, you can mindread), the things you learn about them from other characters. It's not your standard RPG with combat, leveling and gearing points. It's a well written, interactive story you follow with your also unique character whose uniqueness comes from the choices you make and the impression you leave.\n\nThe game fits in the same category with Star Wars: KoTOR series.","December 14, 2014","true","43.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It felt like there was a downside to every positive.\n\nThe mindreading mechanic was interesting, but paying XP to do so - often for nothing useful - invited tedious save scumming.\n\nCombat offers some interesting options, but is undermined when enemies get stuck on the environment or simply forget about the fight and stroll away while you shoot arrows into their back. It also feels pretty simplistic when compared to other games of its genre. Seeing enemies in Kingdoms of Amalur dodging arrows and reacting to being set on fire made me realise just how basic combat is in Divinity II.\n\nThere's some enjoyable quirky humour, but also plenty of bland and tedious lore.\n\nThe game generally looks good, but the animations during dialogue are bizarre; the characters appear to be undergoing a seizure while speaking.\n\nThe prospect of playing as a dragon is exciting, but it takes a fair while to get there.\n\nWhen you do get there, it's rather disappointing. It is a feature which is essentially walled off, not only from certain locations but all ground combat. Worse still, it can be graphically  overwhelming - the dragon battle with Zagan prompted me to uninstall, being one of the most disorienting and frustrating segments of a game I've ever encountered.\n\nThere's a lot packed into this game, but I just couldn't embrace it.","June 6, 2014","false","24.1"," 53 of 103 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","53","103","0","0"

I can't give it a bad review because, quite honestly, I enjoyed it; I just wish I could have enjoyed it more.\n\nThe first thing to hit you when you start the game is the talent 'tree.' Or more like a talent wall; there are no pre-requisites asides leveling up, which means you have a lot of freedom in how you want to build your character. At least, you do in the sense that you can pick any talent; cross-picking melee, archery, and magic may not be the best move, but some mixing and matching can be interesting. Great if you like experimentation.\n\nOr, well, until you find some of the broken combos. Find the perfect setup and the game is too easy (to the point where you can one-shot the end-boss). Try to spec to something 'more fun', you'll need a weapon (or two) of the setup you're going for, plus armor that matches, and you aren't guaranteed to like the new spec more. So pretty much like any RPG, right?\n\nThe talent tree is a good example of what the rest of the game is; a nerd's wet dream of dragons and magic that would be awesome, but perhaps not executed in the best manner possible. Dialogue choices! Your own fortress! Talents that favor utility over straight combat! Mind-reading NPCs for hidden info! You can turn into an f'in dragon! This game has a crapton of cool mechanics, and it encourages you to use them... except for the part where the cool mechanics fall a bit short in execution.\n\nYes, you can turn into a dragon, but there are invisible walls everywhere. Yes, there are dialogue choices, but they don't really affect the world. Mind-reading is cool, but without risk; you can tell the importance of the info by the price of the mind-read to determine if you want to delve. The fortress you can eventually own is really just a hub with some utilities (though tastefully made).\n\nAnd of course, the story is a bit generic. Prophesized hero destined for greatness, as usual. That's not to say the lore surrounding everything is necessarily bad, and there are a lot of details hinting at a well-thought out and coherent universe (and the game occasionally gives you bonuses for reading up on them), but it can feel generic if you're a regular of the RPG genre. Still, I quite like knights and dragons duking it out, so this kind of generic is fine from my point of view, but I just wish it could have done something more.\n\nThe world is semi-open; a good number of areas, but a linear progression, sort of like leveling up a character in WoW - you've got a large world, but you can only go X number of places at your current level, and revisiting older places offers no rewards.\n\nSide-quests can be amusing, and the good news is that a lot of them are NOT simply 'go kill X'; there are usually puzzles, traps, and even riddles involved before you can touch target X. Heck, you can even permanently fail some - that kind of pressure is sort of thrilling! That being said, you have to dig for the fun ones - very few would you go back and complete 'just because it is fun.'\n\nIf you're really itching for an RPG to play, Divinity 2 isn't bad. You've got to think about gear, specialization, exploration, leveling, and everything else that goes with RPGs. It has everything that goes into an RPG from dialogue choices to various characters to bosses, making it a great game if you "just want an RPG." It just doesn't shine in any one department.\n\nAs I said earlier, I can't possibly un-recommend this game since it does everything right and I enjoyed myself. I just wish it could have been more.","December 10, 2014","true","42.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

What different this one from others how ever is none boring quests, there not much kill this, deliver that and repeat. Also your choises will change your game story and you may read NPC's minds with the cost of XP giving you more information or additional quests and treassures. The game is filled with humor and refrences, just the way i like it. You may save whenever you like, and with perma death you will have to. I don't know why they even had perma death with unlimited save, could as well had some kind or respawn rather than letting the player replas the content they forgot to save. I had a few problems where i managed to get into places where i shouldn't and thought that was a part of the current game but if It's not obvious, it's propably not how It's done :p It's not 100% polished, you might need to look the quests up on a wiki and it could have had a bit more different mobs but if you like RPG and enjoy conversations, decisions and story this is a game for you.

It had been forced out of production too soon for the developer's taste due to lack of funds, I found out after I had played it.\n\nWhat you actually recieved out of the box was a brilliantly written storyline that kept you engrossed pretty much from the start, a combat system with more depth and variation than it initially lets on and with graphics that could rival any AAA game on the market during the time of its release. I was shocked to hear the developers claim they were disappointed because it lacked so many things that they wanted to put into the game, but couldn't due to financial strains. The main rival to D2 was Dragon Age 2, and the fact Larian Studios, the developer, was disappointed in themselves meanwhile mopping the floor with every other RPG on the market, (in terms of game quality and not sales) says a little about their selfstandards. This is pretty obvious in Divinity: Original Sin if nothing else.\n\nFor a game that lacked half the content it was supposed to have, you'll wonder exactly what that content was when you come out an odd 40 hours of gametime later when you've finished one of the most engrossing and twisting storylines this side of a classic JRPG. As an example the Divinity Dragon Commander title is actually a byproduct of what was originally supposed to be an RTS part of Divinity II.\n\nIf you enjoy any rpg from Diablo to Skyrim, I would recommend trying this out. It is challenging in that the combat system is used to its' full extent throughout the game and there is no one tactic that would work on all enemies or situations. It is varying in that the scenery changes everywhere you go and not much is reused in terms of assets and nothing feels rushed or left out and it is, of course, engrossing thanks to wellwritten characters and a twisting storyline with many small pitfalls that you decide the outcome of in best D&D spirit.\n\nIf you've played Original Sin, or anything from Diablo to Skyrim, you would probably enjoy this game. If nothing else than to blast airships as a dragon.","September 25, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game features a classless leveling system where points are freely spent in any of 5 trees. Hitting shelves in early 2010, the game's graphics are still solid 4 years later.  In Divinity II you will have to discern the truth from the lies in history as you hunt down and try to stop one man as he tries to ascend to the lord of evil.\n\nThe Good: Divinity II really gives an RPG fan almost everything they could want.  Skill and stat points to spend, many weapons and armors to find, forge and upgrade, an excellent home base with a smithy and alchemist (among others), good music, large lands to explore and loot, a bunch of side quests and a pet to customize and build to help you on your quest.  The game was just plain fun to explore and to move through.  It is also pretty long, I spent just over 70 hours on the original (Ego Draconis) and the expansion (Flames of Vengeance) and I still didn’t have that “man, I wonder when I get to kill the boss” feeling I get on some games.  If you enjoy Might and Magic 6 & 7, Morrowind, Oblivion or other open world exploration and loot games than Divinity II will be up your alley!\n\nThe Bad: The game is pretty easy once you get the hang of it ... and it isn't very hard if you don't get the hang of it either.  I played on normal difficulty and I really wish I cranked it up.  I had one tricky spot in the game but I realize that at level 30 I still had my level 16 gear on and I had not forged any weapons yet.  After forging a custom set of armor and weapons I was so powerful that I was killing everything in just a few hits; normal hits not powerful skills!  These weapons were so good I also beat the expansion at level 45 with these same level 30 weapons.  The only really hard fights were fights that had a strange gimmick.  One boss have a 45 second fear … you could go get a drink while your character ran away!  Also any monster that can heal WILL completely heal themselves at least once, the percentage based heal should not have been given to monsters!\n\nThe Funny: The mindread system is really neat in this game but half its worth seems to be comedy.  When you read minds you get special quests and sometimes skill points but you also get embarrassing facts out of people.  It costs you a little experience but it is worth it to mind read; for the laughs if nothing else.\n\nThe Summary:  I give Divinity II: Developer's Cut a solid 8 out of 10.  It's a great little diamond in the rough that, even 4 years after release, is a great game.  Also, since I've helped myself to many a skill list online before but never contributed, I took it upon myself to fill in the lack of skill information online for Divinity II!  This my gift to you dear reader, I have personally tested and written down each and every last level of every character skill in the game and made them available on the Wiki! Follow this URL ( http://divinity.wikia.com/wiki/Divinity_II_Skills ) and you can see the skill details and my notes on every skill! Happy Adventuring!","April 30, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And yet, it is exactly what I love about lesser known action/RPGs. At first glance it almost looks like Fable or even Amalur, then you become both disappointed and immediately intrigued by what lies underneath, which is a similar feeling I had when playing Risen 2.  It’s certainly not a bad game, just lacking. Typically when you think RPG you envision a game that through good skill, strategy, planning, and good decisions overall, you triumph.\n\nHowever, you often get blindsided by stupid flaws within the game engine, cheap attacks by enemies, or in general don’t have enough in your favor to win by traditional methods.  You yourself have to become cheap…or it could just be that I expect a genuine straightforward fight, especially since I play as a warrior in these games. Either way, it’s an action/RPG that’s definitely worth a second look.","March 16, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all, it follows the best traditions of the previous Divinity games (and the story as well), including the not-too-serious tone, lot of NPCs and side quest, while adding a ton of new features: 3D world instead of isometric; dragons; mindreading, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the difficulty curve was quite interesting: I had really serious troubles cleaning out the flying fortresses in Ego Draconis (I needed to find and use every boost, and proceed very-very cautiously), on the other hand, Flames of Vengeance did not provide a lot of challeges (at least for me). It might have something to do with a bad skillset, or something like that, but I don't know. If you don't mind dying several times to hordes of nameless grunts, while acing the boss battles, than do not consider this as a weak point .:)\n\nAlltogether, it was really fun, the jokes/quests were great. The main story is mostly cliché, but the other stuff is more than better.

The series has always been somewhat of an underdog in the world of RPGs. Yet, after playing I begin to wonder how fair that has been. Certainly the story and the world portrayed is quite inconsistant in tone and design. It can be both serious and a spoof, and that might turn off some players. However, this dissonance is the source of the game's charm, and in terms of depth and gameplay, it does deliver, though it can be a little wonky. Definiately, if you can get the Anthology, the game is worth it.

I completed the core game and the expansion pack "Flames of Vengeance.")\n\nDivinity 2 is an EXCELLENT game, if you haven't played the first two games. Basically their main story and lore take it up the pah-tootie. There used to be seven races, now we're down to just humans. The main villian (Damian) should not be in this dimension according to the game's lore, as he is cursed to remain in another dimension until aided by the forces of good. Etc. Etc.

I completed the core game and the expansion pack "Flames of Vengeance.")\n\nDivinity 2 is an EXCELLENT game, if you haven't played the first two games. Basically their main story and lore take it up the pah-tootie. There used to be seven races, now we're down to just humans. The main villian (Damian) should not be in this dimension according to the game's lore, as he is cursed to remain in another dimension until aided by the forces of good. Etc. Etc. I could point out plot holes all day, but they only really apply to people that played Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity.\n\nEveryone that is coming in new to this will LOVE IT to pieces.\n\n+t's an excellent example of the action/rpg genre.\n+The snarky writing is hilarious, Larian Studio's humor shines all the brighter with every new game.\n+You can read people's minds and see the ghosts of the dead!\n+You can turn into a dragon and burninate the country-side!\n+You get your own Battle Tower, complete with alchemist to make as many potions as you could ever want! <3\n\n-WAY too many sub-quests, not enough main plot stuff. I think this game wants to be an MMO.\n-Golden "!" and "?" for quest-givers, lame!\n-You can't flirt with men, but there are plenty of sexy things to say to women in this game. (Larian has a history of mistreating its female characters and players. Everything is he/him/his in the main dialogues, even if you're playing a woman.)\n-The ending is a SLAP IN THE FACE, and I was FURIOUS when it was over. I won't spoil it, but my GOD it sucked!\n\n\n\n7/10-- Would recommend to friends that wanna get into action rpg's. Play for the game and the hilarious writing, and ignore the ending.

Also in combat. Larian guys haven't you learned this is bad after 2 games?\n- No respec of stat points, and respec of skill points costs a lot of money\n\n\n===\n\nThis is a very good RPG. After the failure that was Beyond Divinity, this new chapter is fresh and well made.\n\nComplex enough (but not too much compared to other titles), vast and entertaining, it will be good for both newcomers and veterans of RPGs in real time.","May 14","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

During that 10 hours, I found my self very interested, however the only thing I felt was lacking was the Combat system.  It felt too simple for me; and while its been quite some time between writing this review and playing it; I still felt like it was overall a good game.  I did not stick through till the end of this game, mainly because it started feeling like an MMO.  I was just running around doing the same things over and over again, and that was all I could look forward to doing in the future of the game.\n\nStill, I recommend this game, as I know that there are many gamers out there who enjoy this; and I did find some enjoyment within it.  It was certainly worth the low price I had paid for it, as it was on sale at the time.","February 27, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is not obviously trying to be anyhting else but a modified divinity game, no longer top down but third person.  That beig said, it gave a sense of scale that just didn't live up to the hype. I found myself repeating tasks, combat became stale fast, no new tricks and it is a long game but I found myself using only 3 or 4 techniques and thats it. The game has no real LEGENDARY weapons and armor, stuff that takes more than a guanlet to complete. Buying weapons and armor is pointless beacuse what you find or loot is much better. Over all I will give it my recomendation but only a 5/10, get it cheap and keep an open mind.","December 31, 2014","true","75.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Combat can at times be really frustrating due to Enemies Stunlocking the player for large amounts of Time. And Some Balancing Issues that make the game really easy after a while due to a health regeneration that constantly heals more life per second than the best Health potion in the game, (at about 50 health per second at any time) Which i felt i needed to get after getting stunlocked constantly while fighting 10 + enemies at a time  and  thus not beeing able to even  use Health Potions due to stunlock.\nRanged Combat got Boring really fast for me since you have next to no influence to your aiming, which does not mean you cannot hit the enemie you want, but skill in aiming doesnt really get rewarded (by extra critical hits on head or something like that), since it kinda auto aims, so i changed to melee heavy Character after about 3 hours of playtime.\n\nAnother big Issue with the combat is that you cannot possibly know which class your enemie has based of his appearance. you meat enemy healers that charge at you with 2 handSwords as much as you meet them with bow and arrow, or Summoners that dual wield Sword/mace , or 2 hand weapon or bow and arrow. the worst thing happening to me in regard\nto this was in one of the Flying Fortresses where Enemies with the Skin of Deamons were shown to me as "Wizards"- The sometimes Unclear Difference between Summoner , healer , Soccerer , Wizzard and Ranger Doesnt help Either  as it makes focusing dangerous enemies unecesaryly hard and makes the Combat sometimes Very Annoying, Confusing and Frustrating.\n\n\nThen there is the Story:\n\nThe Games Story Suffers From some Really inconsistent Quality in Writing, event tough there are a lot of good written quests and characters in the game the overarching main-storyline suffers from many issues, plotholes and flaws. While some Characters From Previous Games return, most importantly the Wizard Zandalor that already Appeared in Divinie Divinity, zandalors main role is to breach the fourth wall, and spouting some things at the player as if it a 6th School Play , And A "Villan", a Term that i use rather loosely, that does appear as if he ist cut straight from a James Bond 007 movie, always appearing in front of the player, just to dump a few henchmen in the room and disappear leaving you to "die" in his Deathtrap, Which you of course escape rather easily, and after the third time he appears you just laugh at him for beeing so incompetent and it becomes impossible to take him seriously due to him beeing about as much of a threat as Team Rocket. the Load Screen advice to Run from him whenever you see him becomes a complete mockery once you finish the game and notice  there is not a single fight against him in the whole game instead they recycle almost all the previous boss mosters at the end of a game to make for a "final boss fight"\nMany other of my Complaints about Plotholes and mistakes in the Story i wont elaborate in this review to keep it spoiler free.\nThe end comes a bit sudden and is a bit confusing, as the Add-on automatically started i didnt even notice the base-game ended at first.\n\n\nAditonally:\n\nThe Game feels really unfinished or rushed at many points, which gets really obvious when you reach Aleroth and Notice that the big City got demoted to a Linear "run in, kill enemies, run out" mission, only to be expanded to its "orignial size" to be explored in the "flames of vengance" addon. also a large part of the world map seems to have been planned out as accessable area, but was never included in the game. In a Developers Vidoe included in the "developers cut" they say that they were restriced by the xbox360s abilitys at the time of development.\n\n\nAfter so Much Bad i had s to say about the game you may aks: "why does steam tell me you Recommend the game?"\n\nThe Good :\n\n\nExploring the World is A LOT of Fun. If it is on foot with a good freedom of movement due to high jumps and only few "invisible walls". Or Soaring through the Skies as a Dragon, Its A lot of Fun Gliding through the beautiful Landscapes in Dragon From or exploring theground on foot. Additonally the world is Filled with great written and funny Characters and encounters throughout the whole world. at every Cornor you find an intresting side quest that motivates you to immerse yourself into the gameworld.\nwhere the Main story suffers from many mistakes, the sidequest are made excellent and the real  core of this game. Especially a  travellign summoner named Bellegar always got a chuckle out of me and i really enjoyed the encounters with him or his deeds in the world. As well as the White Killer Rabbit (undoubtably a refernce to Monty Python and the Holy Grail)\nAlso There are Bunch of Riddles mixed in the Gameplay that really enrich the dungeons and gameplayexperience.\nAlso the game has a few neat nods to Divine Divinity that i really enjoyed. for example the talking skeleton that you could kill by making him think about what exaclty holds him together with nearly exactly the same words as a conversation between 2 skeltons in DivineDivinity.\nOr a magical whishing well that complaints about another magical well that got arrogant after it fulfilled a wish to the hero of Divine Divinity.\nAll those things Made the world feel really alive and even tough the game was Annoing and frustrating at times i just couldnt stop Playing the game (which is a really good thing that not many games manage to do for me), beacause i was too much involved into the Game world. And all in all  i had a great time with the  Game and can really recommend it to others for playing\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nA Game with MANY issues, but Enough good Aspects and fun elements to make it Really worth your Time.\ni can  recommend the game to everyone who likes to dive into a fantastic world and explore every single part and sidequest of it and can turn a blind eye on the issues of the game.\n\n\n\nI Hope i could give you an insight to my experience of the game and i wish you as much fun with the game as i had :D","January 18, 2014","true","37.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combat in this game is great as well. Its challenging you cant just hack and slash.You can see my soecs on my steam page, Im running this on everything ultra and it looks  really pleasing to the eye. It reminds me so much of  Elder Scrolls, but not at the same time. the story is great. so all in all for $3.99 its an amazing steal.

To the same point if you like, more “action” in your RPG then you won’t be disappointed either.\n\nDifferent combat systems are fantastic, you can do some mix match as well to go from magic/combat/ranged, it’s done very well, and this gives good strength to the replaybility factor, since you want to experience.\n\nIf you like real time RPGs and you don’t have this game, what are you waiting for, this is a hidden GEM of a game.\n\n•	Loot system is excellent, there is enchantment of weapons/gear as well\n•	You can morph into a dragon (and level up your dragon mode)\n•	Has a fully capable console, which allows you to “cheat” or do some other interesting things with the game.\n\n\n•	Story is 8.5/10\n•	Combat 10/10\n•	Visuals/Art style 9.5/10 (yes the game is older, but if you ask me it still stands up nicely)\n•	Replay ability 10/10\n•	Sound/Music 9/10\n•	Overall 9/10\n","June 14, 2015","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I only played the melee build and I personally think its terrible. Why? first off, well you can't really use the shield to block. You just use it only as a secondary weapon that adds armor which defeats the purpose of the thing. Second, it lacks any depth whatsover and just wants you to click click click to win. Sure dodging and jumping is there, but the usefulness of those mechanics only truly shine against ranged enemies. Also, if you have a low-end PC and expect to handle this game well because it's old, Don't. The game runs terribly with my laptop, and my laptop handled skyrim decently to say the least. Overall, if you want to play for the story, go do it. it's worth it. But me being a combat centered fella, I cannot recommend this.

Usually when I review a game I like to have at least 5+ hours or if it has an end I'd prefer to have made it passed the games story, but I just can't play this anymore. So with my meager 3 hours I'm just goint to put my thoughts down. Also a warning that'll hopefully let you know to take my review with a grain of salt.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of most of these rpg games in general, in a broader sense I'm not a fan of games that make you do everything alone. So this game had a strike against it for me right off the bat, because no matter how important they make your quests/missions/whatever sound you're always 100% alone (aside from your temporary summons).\n\nAlso, I know this is common in games with questing but I'm just saying. If you're trying to make someone feel a part of an epic story, the least epic feeling thing you can do is make them spend loads of time saving pigs from slaughter, or helping some farmers wife leave her husband. They feel more like chores than quests.\n\nPros:\nEven though it's an older game it's graphics aren't terrible so it's not eye destroying if you're used to todays quality.\nThe story sounded like it could be pretty interesting from what little I got of it.\n\nCons:\nAnimations are ♥♥♥♥♥. Jumps are awkward, attacks are clumsy, and people animate when they talk to you like they're having a siezure.\nCombat is boring, this was a big one for me. You have to fight your way passed everything and even if you have quite a few skills I couldn't see it being more fun.\nDifficulty is all over. I was killing things easily that were 1-2 levels under me, taking them on a few at a time, but as soon as I fight 2 things on level even though they were ranged and I dodged most of their attacks I was getting melted. When they did hit me it was dealing loads of damage and I don't know how I could've prevented it. I was done with the quests I could do before the area so leveling was out of the question, and the gear I could've bought was hardly any better than what I had on.\nVoice acting is mediocre at best, there's some decent dialog but it's mostly bland and the voices were giving me a headache.\nThe undead I could summon were butchered in seconds, the skills I unlocked were apparently the worst I could get (I'm good at choosing like that) since they hardly made a difference and auto attacking was basically all I did.\n\n\nAll in all I'd recommend looking for something else, I really wish I'd have played one less hour so I could request a refund for this. I'll never touch it again.","February 9","false","3.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","5"

The combat is relatively simple, yet it feels very sweet, especially near the endgame when you're taking on literal hordes of enemies, cutting them all down with superior damage.\n\nWhile I found the experience very fun, I can't help but mention glaring problems I had with the game, for one, the skill system was clearly geared for only damage dealers, there was nothing that I felt, would've fit a support/tank build, (which is understandable, since this is a SP game), but it got worse as I went forward, realizing how stupidly powerful I was with Dual wielding vs. any other set (especially against Bows, Bows really fell short in the end game). More specifically, the life drain skill was incredibly powerful at later levels, to the point where my high damage, low defense character was clearing rooms and never having to pop a potion or use a heal.\n\nAnother issue I had was that the game felt clearly rushed, as the environment and characters all felt very shallow, with little of anything that you could actually do, outside of reading everyone's mind or doing missions. With very little characterization of non main plot characters, (with exception to a few), I felt that completing side missions was really just an excuse to get more XP, and since monsters don't respawn (until the endgame) its really the only choice. Though that in itself is a good thing, I just wish the side-missions felt a little more fun and engaging.\n\nDespite all this, I would reccommend D2 to a friend, because the main storyline itself, is very engaging and quite good. I hope Larian (the developers) will make a D3 and get the backing of a larger publishing company so they can use the additional resources and time that they deserve for their works.","December 22, 2013","true","43.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It had so many game breaking bugs that there is no way it was tested, at all. I bought this game hoping the PC version would play better I mean you can patch a PC version alot more right? Apparently not. If my first few seconds in the PC version is any indicator to how less broken the game is (froze in place and crashed) I'm opting out and I would suggest you do too.\n\nIgnoring all the game breaking bugs I LOVED the idea of this game. However the execution outside of the bugs leaves a LOT to be desired. The dificulty curve is terrible early on. You'll be getting stomped on everywhere you go. The whole becoming a dragon thing won't happen till the halfway point of the game, and then it's rather underwhelming, and you start getting stomped on again at this point cause now you're a bigger target. that can't attack much more than before.\n\nAlso the game felt very Stingy with Exp. I had to squeze out every quest I could find to level up later on and I can't remember if was because enemies don't respawn or cause they don't give exp.\n\nI don't know, if you REALLY want to buy this game be prepared for a LOT of bugs and looking for solutions to them online. Also SAVE very often and on a LOT of different slots because there are some bugs that can break your entire file and will keep happening unless you reload to a very specific point before that bug hits.","February 11","false","0.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Music, quests, skill system, battle system, world map. Nothing was one bit appealing; it just felt like a bunch of low-effort implementation of necessary mechanics. They weren't bad, really, but nothing seemed the least bit *good*. If this game were a meal, it would be plain rice and soggy vegetables, and a shapeless chunk of lean ground beef cooked medium-well. With water on the side. I have no troubles eating these food items, but without anything special being added to the plate, I would never wish to eat it as a meal.\n\nThe one outlier was the animations. Absolute negative for me. From walking to jumping, spellcasting to talking, everything the characters did made me want to gauge out my eyeballs. Oh, and also the main menu felt like it was locked at 15-20fps. Increasing frame rate cap did nothing to help it, but the ingame was just fine.\n\nIt's kind of sad because the story seemed like it would be pretty good if I could trudge through the painfully mundane game.","April 18","false","1.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It's clearly not finished. It has no story or plot whatsoever (I have no clue what the story and goal is, after playing for hours on end). It has cookie-cutter enemies throughout. Quests are boring and confusing at best. The dialogue is laughable, in a bad sense. There are strange and unexplained castles in the sky that contain only enemies and no quests and no relevant loot. Why are they at all in the game? Just for levelling up? That's not an RPG. That's a chore. As a dragon my avatar can't see and attack enemies on land, but when I convert it back to a human they suddenly pop up from nowhere. I could go on and on.\n\nIt looked and behaved great early on, but it seems the developers got bored of it and threw it out the door as fast as they could.\n\nI played Arcania (and its expansion) just before, that was excellent in comparison. A true gem in the rough. Try that instead.\n\nFor a game that handles human/dragon conversions the right way, check out Drakan. It's not an RPG (more a medieval shooter) and it's certainly not new, but it's brilliant in comparison to Divinity II, despite its dated graphics.\n\nEven at bargain bin price this game is awful.\n\nUpdate: I'm playing the expansion now and my avatar is at level 43. Despite this, and the fact that I have two companions and playing on Casual, I can't even put a dent on an arena full of monsters (20 or more) where all can heal themselves, and where I only have 90 seconds or so to finish. If I can't I have to watch a long sequence about my avatar being locked in (forever?), so after a while I just force-stopped the game and restarted. Again and again... Actually I did finish it once, but as the game locks up every time it changes scene, I had to replay anyway, which might happen again next time I possibly succeed.\n\nAgain, a god awful game, suitable for masochists.","January 8","false","68.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/219780/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Divinity 2 is a remastered version of Ego Draconis featuring new content with an enhanced engine packaged with an add-on Flames of Vengeance (FOV). The 2 games form a complete story when played together.\n\nPersonally it took me 45 hours to finish the 2 games, and this is taking into account that i had skipped alot of side quests and even referred to a walkthrough for some of the puzzles. If you were to do everything and experience all the game had to offer, it will probably take you close to 80 to 90 hours or even more.\n\nThe first starting village you entered had a surprisingly huge amount of sidequests. The problem is, most of them just aren't very interesting, and most of the time, instead enjoying the story in the sidequest, alot of them felt more like merely items in a checklist that has to be finished off just for the rewards.\n\nThe main problem i feel though, the whole game just doesn't take itself very seriously. It tries to tell an epic story but the execution just feels amatuerish. (Was it really necessary to re-introduce the player character in FOV via a parody of the movie "The Terminator"?)\n\nThe character animations are very rough and almost all characters you talk to tend to like to flail their arms wildly in the air in a very exaggerated style. Its as if they were thinking if they make the NPCs move their arms more, they would look more alive lol. Its really funny to see an esteemed Knight Commander talking to you and flailing his arms wildly in the air like a mad loon. Alot of the NPC faces are also re-used and you will see quite alot of similar looking faces everywhere. Oh, and there will be a part where you can have 3 followers and guess what their names are....Tom, Dic-k and Harry. Seriously...LOL\n\nVoice acting is noticeably bad, and alot of them either sound bored, over-enthusiastic, or just plain silly. Music is a mixed bag, with some tunes feeling suitably atmospheric, and some tunes that won't sound out of place in a James Bond movie lol.\n\nThe main selling point of the game is to be able to turn into a dragon and fly anywhere. But this concept isn't as exciting as it sounds. For one thing, the world is not truly open-world and fully explorable. There are alot of invisible walls everywhere. And you will not have the pleasure of morphing into a dragon and burning down all the enemies on the ground. They just magically disappear when you morph into dragon mode which i suppose was to not imbalance the gameplay. Still it would have been nicer if they were able to combine the 2 into a seamless experience instead of the current system that they had.\n\nOne particular feature that i enjoyed was Mindreading, which basically lets you listen to the thoughts of NPCs. Its a very nice idea, as you can sometimes get extra rewards or even new quests with it. But again, they had to put a silly penalty of requiring EXP to actually do mind reading. Personally i felt that it was really unnecessary to do this, to punish the player's level progress while he checks out something cool with an NPC.\n\nThe ending of Ego Draconis is also very controversial and suffice to say, basically undermines everything you have done, and is one of the worst endings IMO in an RPG. The add-on Flames of Vengeance(FOV) corrects this however, and provides better closure. I am aware that FOV came 11 months after the Ego Draconis, and i have a gut feeling that it was crafted to pacify the players who have been crying foul of the original ending.\n\nIt may look like i am bashing the game, but i really am not. There is an interesting game in there somewhere, but only if you are willing to endure the amatuerish style it is presented. Maybe thats the way this RPG is meant to be enjoyed, a funny little game with some movie parodies that doesn't take itself very seriously.\n\nOverall Rating: 6.0 / 10\nIf you are willing to overlook its many faults, this is still a worthy purchase if on sale.","May 25, 2013","false",""," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

I was hyping myself to play this. It looked genuinely fun to be able to become a dragon and be an unstoppable force of death. Unfortunately my experience was less so.\n\nThe game is excruciatingly difficult for beginners. Even more infuriating is the difficulty ramp itself and the fact that to my knowlege, enemies do not respawn. I thought i would do some sidequests to level up quicker but nearly all of them are in areas far above my level. and that added to the fact enemies dont respawn makes leveling a difficult task.\n\nPotions are also abnormaly rare, at least when i played. I would find myself in a horde of enemies and use up all of my potions before even reaching the boss to a dungeon or area.\n\nOne boss named jagon was so infuriatingly impossible to defeat that i resorted to cheating to beat him. That may sound like it was unnecessary, but I was not allowed to leave the dungeon unless i beat jagon! I couldnt level up because the enemies would not respawn and the entrance was locked. I would have been stuck in that dungeon unless i reverted to a save that was well in the past. Me and Jagon were both level 11.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I read that it becomes much funner and easier after you become a fully realized dragon slayer. But I was at a point of almost zero tolerance for the game.\n\nIt does not help that the UI, combat, and level design are all angering and not very streamlined. I have spent almost 20 minutes walking up and down hallways to find levers or buttons to doors that are locked for seemingly no reason.\n\ntldr; This game made me furious while i tried to have fun.","August 14, 2015","false","6.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

There are a great many reasons why i think this game falls short but one of the biggest is the set system.\n\nNow to begin the list in no real order.\n\n1) The textures are horribly done, they other do not fit in the environment they are in properly or just plain look terrible.\n\n2) The one that annoyed me most durring gameplay: the reflective surfaces being too high on metal armors (meaning armor shines too much when exposed to light such as the sun).\n\n3) The storyline starts out good but turns so generic it bored me.\n\n4) The skill tree is horribly unbalanced, which includes the 4 classes being unbalanced. being a melee class is pretty much useless, same with being a summoner. So your best bet is to major in being a mage or ranger as a main class and take knight as a subclass.\n\n5) The horribly written books in the game gives no encouragement for collectors like myself especially considering how late your personal storage is introduced, which means if you do want to collect the books you need to waste valuable skill points on weight capacity, however honestly whats the point? Most of the normal books are terribly boring to read.\n\n6) With the combination of xp level range system, monsters almost never dropping anything, absolutely no monster regen, and that includes boars. There is almost no incentive to visit previously missed areas unless you find out there is a set piece there.\n\nIn closing i would like to say for the most part this game is mostly Gothic and Drakengaurd put together but a bad attempt at both, of course there are elements of other games as well. There are elements of Diablo as you have no doubt noticed. The dragon combat was one of the worst dragon combat systems i have ever seen honestly... it was slow and highly restricted on where you could go.","July 10, 2015","false","35.7"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

The story is very good, the environment is gorgeous, the world and lore feels a lot more developed than a lot of ARPGs, etc., but the game does suffer from a lot of bugs and other issues which seem to get progressively worse the longer you play. The gameplay is decent and has its own flaws and quirks. This game has a huge amount of potential but seems to become more and more unplayable. I really want to play this game more, but it's just too broken. I reached about 30 hours in before the game got to where I just can't progress any further. I've tried using previous save files, but some bugs still get triggered and it's not worth repeating hours of the game to see whether the bugs show up or not. I really want to recommend this game because of how much I enjoyed what I could play, but it's just way too buggy.\n\nI've encountered several bugs which range from annoying to completely game breaking. The longer I play, the worse the frame rate becomes, to the point I have to save and restart the game. The only issue is, the frame rate has gotten permanently slower no matter what settings I try. When I first started the game would be about 60FPS (at the cap) but has fallen to average somewhere between 20-30FPS (sometimes falling as low as 10FPS for no real reason) even in the same areas I got 60FPS before. It doesn't seem to be an issue with my computer, but a bug in the game itself since it only really happens with this game and several other buggy games. Certain cutscenes will also crash the game randomly.\n\nI've also had a bunch of random physics and control bugs which aren't too bad but are extremely annoying. I've managed to clip into things and come close to sequence breaking from issues with the physics. If you land on certain objects (things which you can very easily jump on), you can get stuck to the point of having to reload a save file. Sometimes the game will freak out and the controls lock up or get stuck performing the same action if you perform an action while moving or if you use a spell while attacking. If I use the dragon's flame attack and cast a spell, sometimes the dragon will get stuck attacking with flames, and be unable to move left or right, until I click several times. I've had several other issues during combat where my character gets left unable to move or attack and the camera stays locked until I cast a spell (it isn't a status effect), but I can't figure out exactly what triggers it. The dragon form targeting seems to have broken permanently in my game and will randomly jump between targets on the screen (literally all of them) even without moving (mouse or keyboard) and with stationary enemies being the only thing on screen.\n\nCertain quests have been rendered impossible because of bugs as well. The General Raze fight is impossibly bugged on my game. The first time I played I ended up dying as I opened the menu, then I reloaded from an earlier save and the Walking Armour spawns were broken. If I reload from any previous save and work back to that point, the spawns are still broken. The number of spawn points has doubled (the healing pods spawn them), each spawn point spawns about the same number of things that the whole room did before the bug (could be more, hard to tell since they spawn inside each other), and the delay time dropped to somewhere between 10 and 15 seconds or so per round of spawns. They spawn so fast and with so many that it is quite literally impossible to kill them all. They continue spawning in the same spot past the point the game AI stops trying to control new spawns. The dragon form seems to have broken on my game after resetting my skill points since it doesn't get any increase in health or other stats when my character levels up. I do get random dragon skill points every couple levels for some reason though... Certain battles which require dragon form have glitches with enemies spawning, like the Zagan fight, where the other things keep spawning even when the nest towers are all dead. There are other minor bugs like certain quests where you choose who to give something to or whatever are either both completable or both incompletable depending on the savefile (played through the first 2 hours like 3 times on different files, had the first savefile be completable for both options for an early quest, normal choice the second, and incompletable the third). I've also failed to find certain NPCs which are supposed to be in certain areas, I don't know if these have been because of any kind of bug or just not hitting the right trigger.\n\nThe gameplay is overall very fluid and fun, albeit extremely unforgiving. If you level properly and fight very strategically, you can get extremely overleveled very early on. Of course, the game is unforgiving with your stat points so if you plan poorly, you can completely gimp your character until you get a lot more stat points. Combat is pretty easy to follow though it is easy to get overwhelmed depending on what kind of character you play. Certain parts of the combat system can get annoying, like enemies healing faster than you can kill them, no real blocking mechanic, and other minor glitches. The biggest drawback in the gameplay is the fact the difficulty ramps up pretty harshly with very little warning. It's usually possible to take on higher level foes if you're used to playing with Dark Souls style tactics and can lure enemies away. Certain areas are almost impossible without coming back later even if they should be the right level for you to beat. Tricking the enemy into falling off the map or knocking them off doesn't seem to net you experience though, which can ruin certain areas since enemies don't respawn.\n\nThe story, lore and environment are what really shine in this game. The story itself is a pretty stereotypical bad guy turned hero type thing, but the way it's told is what makes it actually good and not just a complete cookie cutter type scenario. Lore seems to be mainly divided into books and interactions with people. People in towns don't always have something important to say but usually have something unique. You have NPCs who feel more alive than most RPG NPCs. Towns feel like they're filled with people rather than just reskinned NPCs from the town back. NPCs also feel like they have personalities; their motivation for their actions aren't just good or evil. You also have choices to make that aren't just black and white, good or evil, but hinge on personal judgement. You can try and glean more information from other NPCs but the choices are almost never obviously good or bad, but just different which is a nice change of pace. I don't know how it ends since my game broke too badly to really hope to complete, but it was definitely building up pretty awesomely.","June 7, 2015","false","33.8"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

The combat quickly becomes a repetitve grind (think WoW but single player) interspaced with frustrating boss fights. Ranged builds will suffer from many fights taking place in mines or corridors with locked doors and no room to maneourve, while melee builds will get demolished by spell and arrow spamming packs of mobs. The vaunted dragon-form combat is a glorified fast travel system since while in dragon form you can't attack "ground level" enemies; forcing you to try and slug it out in human regardless of the situation. Likewise although the game has a relatively large number of skills most of them are either useless or don't work in important fights.","January 4, 2015","false","20.5"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

It's OK and has some good parts and bad parts to it. The items are Random, Skill point and abilities are intresting and I like the clunky combat thos very easy to exploit and somewhat easy.\n\nThe bad parts of this game is the lack of character debth and plot development. The main bad guy is not intresting at all and I would go as far as to say he's "lame"  to quote some 80's computer slang.\n\nOnce you get to the battle tower the game opens put, for some games this a good thing, for Divinity 2 it's a bad thing as I have no motivation to continue on, I suspect there will be no amazing cut scenes I will miss, no new intresting characters and most importantly getting to this point of them game has been unfulfilling.  If you absoutly have nothing to play for whatever reason...if it was 1996 again, if you are trapped on an island and this is the only game on a computer... then I would say Divinity 2 would be a pretty good game.\n\nWith games like D&D, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Borderlands, batman, battlefeild, most jrpg's, Dragon age...diablo, dungeon defenders, anything intresting on your ipad, kingdom rush free on kongragate, board game nights with friends, munchkin! poker! and many many more activities.... their is no real reason to put your time here.","October 6, 2014","false","16.0"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

But it's not worth its price, unless you're buying it on a Steam sale, like I did. The general concept of the storyline is rather decent, yes, and the graphics and general gameplay are, to quote one cartoon character, "pretty pretty shiny shiny" but the game falls flat on its face when you get to the last 10% of the Ego Draconis campaign and Flames of Vengeance does very little to fix it. The... *cough* twist at the end effectively murders the plot, reducing it to "just barely not terrible" in one fell swoop. It's difficult to put it without spoilers, but let's just say that the plot as a general whole until that point becomes entirely irrelevant and your decisions, it suddenly turns out, make no difference to the ending.\n\nWhat's worse, Flames of Vengeance, the expansion that should have reputedly saved us all, actually makes it worse by having that /plot twist/ at the end of Ego Draconis have no real effect on the world, aside from you feeling mildly uncomfortable. If it was supposed to fix the disappointing ending of Ego Draconis, it only made the situation worse. Larian somehow managed, in one grandiloquent failure, to ruin the entire game just as it was ending.

It is unbearably painful to play in these difficulty spike areas, given how generic the combat is no matter how dumb the AI acts. This game starts off painfully to the point that I wouldn't recommend it, no matter what happens later on in the game, simply because it is too frustrating to get past the initial hurdle. If you want to play this game, know full well that it is easy to break a character build that will be unable to progress past future enemies, a flaw that they attempted to fix by cutting down enemy health and damage. Larian studios, although making improvements to their combat in their newer titles, completely failed here and left a mediocre combat system in this game. If you want to make a game functional, don't start off a player's stats at 1, this is not an mmo, though they certainly designed it to feel like one for the basic human character. At these stat levels, it was bound to happen that they would encounter problems balancing enemy levels and stats early on. On a plus, you at least have cool combat animations.\n\nThe jumping mechanic is glitchy at best, don't blame yourself if you jump in a stream and cannot get out easily. The ending is garbage and cliche, you spend the entire game listening to cutscenes of the villain making grandiose speeches in front of you. The expansion also has a mediocre ending, although it at least makes you happier than the base game with its conclusion. The engine is on par with TES Morrowind, but many times less enjoyable or memorable. The dragon mechanic is a cheap gimmick halfway through the game, with completely uninspired flight mechanics and nominal mmo interfacing. I can guarantee that half of the positive reviews are waxing nostalgia for the franchise, which is deserved given how much better its previous titles merit. Absolutely the worst of the franchise, skip it if you don't want to be screwed over by the story and forced through repetitive and pointless gameplay. The only upside is that the side quests are at least original and interesting in the choices you can make, never painting a black and white picture.\n\nI honestly do not know how people tolerate this game to play it through. The core game is entirely flawed, such that there is a limited pool of XP, nothing respawns, you literally have to beat every side quest to have the XP to make a good character build. There is nothing enjoyable about the combat, it even takes away from the enjoyment of playing the game. It is a torture to try and beat the game when you are instantly dying because you didn't pick the boilerplate max stat character build. This game had so much potential, the combat engine ruined it entirely for me. I'm glad I got this on sale for less than three dollars, it is not worth anything more. I don't hate games often, but this has caused me serious grief and I regret every minute I spent playing it.\n\nBefore the Dragon Knight Saga, this game got between a 6 and a 7 on many review sites. Even with the Dragon Knight Saga, it still deserves the mediocre score, and nothing can redeem this game besides a complete re-make.","December 5, 2014","false","21.0"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","1"

There are things I like in the game, but it basically throws you into the fray with little to no instruction on the mechanics. It's also really difficult to tell where your loyalities lay you start out with one faction then through a (chance?) encounter you end up as an enemy of your first faction also one min you're doing quests for a faction then next quest you're killing those same guys pretty confusing.  The game also has a pretty annoying tendency to corrupt it's files, the only solution I've found if to clear local content and reinstall (I've done this like 4 or 5 times  in the last week or so, it's a 2 to 3 hr process each time). I tried using the backup feature from steam (thinking if I had a local copy the reinstall might go faster), which oddly doesn't seem to have a restore option (Why?).\n\nThe game designers I think are certifiably Sadistic. Two interesting puzzles that seemed to have no point or solution.\n\nFirst is in a mine, where you find yourself playing jumpy jumpy games climbing a wall to reach a plaftorm that has a lever on it. Ok well I have no Idea why such ar room would be in a mine first of all, but then the fireballs started, what idiot would shoot flame in a mine? Don't the developers know that there are explosive gases below ground open flame is not recommended and these guys are throwing fireballs. Go figure. Oh and here is the best part you finally reach the level you pull it and 2 new platforms appear but they only stay visible (usable) for about 10 seconds 5 of which is burned up by a cutaway scene that leaves you rooted in place. Needless to say I never solved it.\n\nThe other realls sadistic one also involves platforms you have to jump to, presumably to find the leaver that tuens off a Necromancer's force field. Great except it's all overtop of a pool of lava, I jumped ot like the second platform and it fell and gave me the interesting experience of dieing in a vat of lava. I finally decided I really didn't want to turn off that forcefield all that badly.\n\nSo, the long and the short of it I payed like $6 for the trilogy (on sale). Thank goodness because if I'd paid any more than that I'd be pretty poed by now.\n\nGet this game only if you have a high tolerance for frustration.","January 5, 2015","false","151.4"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","3","16","0","0"

You hunt dragons for a living. The game starts with you and your crew picking up the trail of the very last Dragon Knight known to mankind. As you start to track the beast down, Damian, the game's antagonist, is closing the siege on some of the last bastions of human civilization. His goal is to enslave or eradicate every living person and control the world with his power. All pretty standard so far.\n\nThe amazing part of the game is that, spoiler alert, you get to become a Dragon Knight, transform into a dragon and fly your way around. That takes a while, though. Like, fifteen to twenty hours of gameplay. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe rest of the game is all about looking for the fabled Hall of Echoes, where you'll adquire knowledge on how to defeat Damian and stop his ultimate goal: The revival of some old-♥♥♥ dragon mother.\n\nGameplay is actually pretty fun, action oriented and all that. Most of you will be quite familiar with the type. My grudge with this game is that it adds absolutely nothing new to the table and has a colossally mediocre story, which for a RPG is something quite important. The game may be worth buying and playing if you got nothing else to play. Other than that, it's not worth it.\n\nGameplay - 6/10\nSoundtrack - 5/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nContent - 7/10\nChallenge Level - 7/10\nReplayability - 2/10","December 2, 2014","false","34.8"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

Once you turn into a dragon, all the land-based enemies literally disappear. The dragon form is really *only* for moving to out-of-reach locations. While flying you have to destory towers, ballistas, nests, and flying enemies, which I found lacking. It was an awesome idea, but it did not deliver.\n\nThe story is pretty good, the gameplay is decent (I found the jump a little annoying to control at times since you jump so high), and levelling up is fun. It has a stat-based system.\n\nI found the skill tree lacking. I only played as a mage, which was fun; however, there is only one spammable spell - magic missile. Other attack spells have cool-downs, which is alright, but some more variety would have been nice. One good thing about the skills are that you can mix and match to make your character however you want and you can respec at a relatively low cost about half-way through the game.\n\nI'm probably not going to play the expansion.

Right out of the gate, I was pretty unimpressed. The cut scenes were glorious, but then, cut scenes often are, and this, unlike DragoneAge 2, doesn't really live in the cut scenes. I had been excited about character creation though, so ... moving on to that. Pick a gender. Pick one of 4 heads. One of four hair colors. One of four voices. You're done. Really? They might as well have just handed me a pregen. VERY disappointing. Well, maybe the mechanics will be amazing. Moving on to the obligatory turt-orial. Annnd- the game locked up just as I was attempting to stroll through the gates into TutorialTown (Farglow.) Looked for info online, found very little bug-fix/tech help available at all, but finally tracked down the advice to crank my gfx to min, which worked, but the reason I bought it was because it promised to be glorious and graphical so... as soon as I got past the hiccup, I cranked them up again, and it seemed to be fine after that. Well. Fine- ISH, anyway. Again- I bought it to take pretty pictures. It has no way to turn off the UI hud, and a locked cam. So screenshots are an immediate disappoint. Ah well. And still, I rest my hopes on the game mechanics, so again, moving on. Tutorial town- They hand me glowing eyes, tell me I can read minds now, (but it costs xp to do so,) offer me merchants with a lot of gear I can't come close to affording, and tell me I can pick one of 3 classes. If I';m a ranger, I can use a bow, a warrior can use a sword and leap around impressively, and a mage can throw colorful sparks. Uhm... This is feeling more and more like a glorified platformer by the minute. Ran around, talked to some folks, discovered that the dialog is at least moderately adult- they toss in colorful epithets like "♥♥♥" and "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s" so it's for grown-ups I guess. And the soundtrack is just... BIZARRE. Again, reminiscent of 8-bit techno. It was... different, I'll give it that! Fought some goblins. Died. Didn't feel inspired to waste more of my day on it. 4 out of ten, if you want thumbs or stars or something. Not hugely impressed with Dinvinity II.

I got this game when it first came out on the Xbox: 360. I was kind of disapointed. I mean the game was quite buggy, laggy and just had it problems. Needless to say, I returned it and got something else.\n\nNot I see it on sale and decide, why not give it another try. Well I did and I can say its not so laggy, or course I have a gaming machine now that can handle it. Anyways, the storyline isnt that bad, I'm not super far into it, but it's rather interesting. However, this game can be brutally hard. I recommend to save often. And when I say often, I mean before a battle, after a battle, and every other step. If you don't become a ranger/mage, and save up your money for a really powerful bow, your gonna have a hard time. The difficulty spikes in this game can be ridiculous.\n\nI've always been a warrior type. Love to go in and battle my enemies toe-to-toe. But in this game, It's so hard to do that, especially when you get ganged up by 5+ people at once. Even with good armor, they can shread through your health like butter. But in this game, I had to do ranged just to get by. And some quests require you to go into some difficult areas, usually above your level.\n\nHowever, this game does have its interesting bits. The story is interesting to say the least with your choices having an effect on the world around you and even what price people sell their goods for. Having the choice to decide peoples fates, or to have my actions matter is something I love about a game. The NPCs in the game are also quite welll done. Every NPC has it's own name, characteristics, and converstions. Each thinking something different that may help you in a quest, or with getting lower proces at shops.\n\nThe skill system I can say however is nicely done. You don't have to dwell in just your calss based stats. You can be a battle ready warrior shooting fireballs and summoning creatures, to an unarmed mage beating his enimies to a pulp.\n\nAll in all, with the crazy difficulty spikes, the somewhat "ok" story, and the just barely getting around, I can't recommend this game. The skill system was great, and the NPC's are wonderful, but the combat difficulty is what ruins it. It's an ok game, but not great. You can give it a try, and you may love it.","March 11, 2014","false","11.0"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","6","24","0","0"

Infact, it works in the game's favor!\nSure, the graphics are less than stellar, but the audio is good and the combat & leveling are above average, there is A TON of stuff to do in-game and the writing as a whole is an exemple for all RPGs out there: it is smart, quirky, humorous and witty, by far the best part in the game.\nI found the puzzles to be somewhat of a challenge and i liked most of the characters (Did i mention the writing in this game?).\nThe storymode is divided into two parts: they are both interesting, and there is a really good twist between them.\nThe best part about this game is that it doesn't hold your hand: you want to do something? it's up to you to figure out how to do it, you need to think in order to be successful, and that is very much appreciated.\nThe game might be considered more of an  Hack n' slash rather than a full-blown RPG, but that also works in the game's favor in my opinion.\nfor this price, it is an absolute must.

It also couldn´t hide its obviously intention for a console release, which lead to clunky controls and the typical "port" feeling on the pc (despite the game being released on pc first). However, Larian is a great Dev-studio and seems very dedicated to iron out its mistakes and thanks to the Directors Cut we get a very good open-ish RPG experience.\n\n*Graphics and Sound*\nThey still look very pretty and while it can´t keep up with time, the art style and overall love for detail creates an environment that holds up, combine this with the fantastic soundtrack and immersion is given in this game. Sometimes bad textures stick out and not much variation in animation, however the game is several years old and its nothing to really sniff at. The soundtrack is really fantastic, i would go so far as saying that it is one of Larians biggest strength in all of their games. Keep the sound up and you won´t be disappointed. The atmosphere created is spot on.\n\n*Technical side*\nI have not seen one bug, whatsover. I also had zero crashes on Win7 64x. Obviously thats just my experience and others my vary.\n\n*Gameplay*\nI´m pretty sure controler wouldn´t be in issue, this of course can be helped with free 3th pary software, however i choose keyboard+mouse and it worked fine. The combat is action-hotkey oriented, however movement makes a difference (like jumping and then smashing down on enemies). Most of the enemy fire can also be dodged. Still, it does become a bit repetitive after some time, this might be because i choose a melee character to play, but it certainly has also to do with the very odd power curve in the game. While at the beginning one could sometimes struggle in fights and go thru some health potions, you later become a monster and just hack thru enemies. The game also rewards exploration and riddle solving giving you (in my opinion) sometimes overpowerd items as a reward, this making you to powerful early on.\n\nNeverless, combat is sufficiently and the dragon form mixes it up enough. Riddles and hidden treasure were a big surprise, sometimes very hard to catch/see and some required actual thinking. Thats rare.\n\nRespecing is always possible when the player gets his strongehold. There is also crafting in the game, which except from enchanting, i never needed though.\n\nAn important thing i need to mention that others pointed out wrongly. Yes it is openworld-ish, but more in the theme of Baldurs Gate (actualy less): you get your main story and you can explore the current zone(s). But not progress further until you finished your main quest in these. So its not like Skyrim and the world is also not that big.\n\nAlso it is true that you can´t import your save from the first one...but i think there is an autosave generated because the directors cut treats the game as a whole with the expansion AND you have your gear/money and everything still when you enter the x-pac section of the game.\n\n*Story*\nStory is important in a RPG and Divinity 2 does deliver but also lacks depth. The story isn´t bad and there are some twists and turns, especially at the end. Any RPG player however won´t find a lot of surprises, its pretty generic. However, the big strength in Larian games are the side quests, filled with hints, riddles, very funny dialouge and options. They are the main drive force of the game, and to me, are the interesting part. There are also enough of them to keep you playing.\n\n*Overall opinion*\nFor 20.- its definitely worth the purchase, even better with a deal. Its a good RPG that rewards exploration and thinking, with a not so great combat system but lots of humor and interesting quests in it.\n\nOverall i think the ambition behind it was just bigger than the budget (this reminded me a LOT of Kingdoms of Amalur). Still, i expected much less and was really surprised.","March 6, 2015","true","41.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very fun game, made me laugh alot with some of the dialogue as well.\n\nTrue, some of the stuff is cliche and expected, but its a game... You could read Harry Potter and know in the first 2-3 chapters exactly what is going to happen and your still going to keep reading. At least in this game you don't have that aspect. You have an idea, but it doesn't necessarily mean your right ^^\n\nWhilst it is annoying they removed the aspect of dominating your foes from above (air vs air only), IMO it improves the gameplay. I used to turn into dragon form and heal up in the air, then drop down ready to take them on again. Fun would be removed if you could just turn into a dragon and decimate everything.\n\nOverall, fantastic game, highly recommend.","January 10, 2014","true","78.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It was worthwhile playing through Divine Divinity - there's a lot of little callbacks and references to the world and previous events that made the experience of Divinity 2 more enjoyable.\n\nDivinity 2 is a 3rd person Action RPG with a skill tree and stat allocation - think like a combination of World of Warcraft and Diablo. My wife said it reminded her of Dark Souls (or at least watching me play it) and I can see the resemblance. Overall the system works well - it's got a nice skill basis such that you can dodge around projectiles and attacks and avoid using potions and even kite enemies around if you're ranged. The options for character customization are broad too.\n\nThe world is large and full of character, and they definitely improved the quality of voiceover from Beyond Divinity. The plot is solid with an interesting (but apparently controversial) ending. Unfortunately it does fall into the trap of 'throw dozens of enemies at them' again, with the endgame becoming a -bit- of a trudge. They do close it out with a solid final area though.\n\nThe expansion pack sold the game for me though. They took the enemy count, toned it down, and made the majority of it venturing through one town fixing problems, talking to people, solving puzzles. One giant series of side quests, essentially. It was executed really well - and then they nailed the final sequence out of the park.\n\nPlaying through the first two Divinity games to get to Divinity 2 was definitely worth the wait - and I'd even recommend picking it up outside of the anthology if you don't care about the world-building done by the previous two games.","December 9, 2013","true","41.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has very good character development mechanics for an RPG and offering a very flexible skill tree system where you can pick skills and upgrades from any branch (example: make a warrior with a fireball spell from the sorcery branch). The game is open world and has a strong storyline to encourage gamers to continue developing their characters and find out what will happen next. I haven't played either of the earlier games, but I think this game is set 1000 years after them and I think the NPCs refer to the events of the previous games as well as the hero characters from said games.\n\nOnly bad thing I can say about this game is it is a difficult game, even on normal difficulty. The game gives you very steep difficulty curves and (because I picked to make a Warrior class) the Warrior class has a very hard time because many of the enemies are ranged with poison spells and this makes me have to resort to using a bow which is supposed to be for a thief or ranger class in my opinion. I would advise making a ranged character if you dislike challenges.\n\nPS: You can choose to play the original version of the game instead of the director's cut.","January 5, 2014","true","45.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The early (character)levels are a bit to hard and the later levels to easy, but some might like this "getting op" feeling.\n2.

You could read Harry Potter and know in the first 2-3 chapters exactly what is going to happen and your still going to keep reading. At least in this game you don't have that aspect. You have an idea, but it doesn't necessarily mean your right ^^\n\nWhilst it is annoying they removed the aspect of dominating your foes from above (air vs air only), IMO it improves the gameplay. I used to turn into dragon form and heal up in the air, then drop down ready to take them on again. Fun would be removed if you could just turn into a dragon and decimate everything.\n\nOverall, fantastic game, highly recommend.","January 10, 2014","true","78.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

You may disagree with my opinion.\nThis review is for Part One, Ego Draconis.\nDivinity II: Developer's Cut is a brilliant game, possibly (with the exception of Skyrim) the best.\nFirstly, you have all the classic RPG elements - goblins, evil necromancers, legends and prophecies and stuff, and of course female armour which seems to protect you more the less of it there is. That makes perfect sense, right...?\nThere's a plot twist early on in the game in which you become a Dragon Knight - a Dragon Slayer blessed with increased power who can turn into a dragon by using the Dragon Stone.\nA fecking DRAGON. That fact alone makes the game amazing.\nYou select a class at the beginning, but you can eventually sort of make your own as the game progresses - you're not entirely stuck into one class like Mage or Necromancer or Warrior or Archer, you can morph them into something new. I call mine a Battle Mage - A Mage/Necromancer who has some Warrior skills.\nOf course, as with every game, there are cons. The level design for Sentinel Island is simply appalling - it takes twenty million years to get anywhere and once you get there you have to engage in a short conversation and then travel for another twenty million years to go and have another short conversation and then you travel for another twenty million years to get to the bloody totem to choose the person you want for a specific role.\nYou have to do that four times.\nThe switching between Dragon and Human could also be a bit smoother, and so could the movement when you are a Dragon.\nThere's also the problem with the female armour.\nRATINGS\nGraphics - 6/10\nGameplay - 8/10\nStory Originality - 3/10\nThe Actual Story - 6/10\nValue for Money - 5/10 - Should be more like £10.99 not £12.99\nReplayability - 5/10 - You can re-play the game with different classes but eventually it will get boring\nLength - 6/10 - I haven't yet finished my current game and I have spent about 6 hours on it\nExtra Special Feature - You can become a dragon.

Infact, it works in the game's favor!\nSure, the graphics are less than stellar, but the audio is good and the combat & leveling are above average, there is A TON of stuff to do in-game and the writing as a whole is an exemple for all RPGs out there: it is smart, quirky, humorous and witty, by far the best part in the game.\nI found the puzzles to be somewhat of a challenge and i liked most of the characters (Did i mention the writing in this game?).\nThe storymode is divided into two parts: they are both interesting, and there is a really good twist between them.\nThe best part about this game is that it doesn't hold your hand: you want to do something? it's up to you to figure out how to do it, you need to think in order to be successful, and that is very much appreciated.\nThe game might be considered more of an  Hack n' slash rather than a full-blown RPG, but that also works in the game's favor in my opinion.\nfor this price, it is an absolute must.

Also, the main story is just okay, and won't really mean a whole lot to you if you aren't familiar with the series.\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\n(Lengthy bit where I ♥♥♥♥♥ about Ultima)\n\nThe Divinity series is interesting. It's a series that clearly and openly takes cues from the old Ultima series; a series that has the distinction of having some of the best RPG's of all time AND some of the worst. If I were to describe the first Divinity game, Divine Divinity, in a nutshell, it would be "Ultima 8: Pagan, but good." Divinity 2 gets a similar description with regards to the disaster that was Ultima 9: Accension.\n\nIt's a large, open world third person action RPG. The game will expect you to do a lot of exploration, talk to a lot of people, face some pretty damn challenging enemies and solve some pretty interesting puzles, like playing a game of riddles with a talking treasure box. The game also does something very well that Ultima 9 failed at miserably; making you feel powerful. In Ultima 9 your character was the Titan of Ether, a god in a sense, and both the story and the game itself didn't even seem to notice. At an early point in Divinity 2 your character becomes a Dragon Knight, which is a really big deal for the setting, and the changes that it inflicts upon your character over the course of the game are pretty substantial, and most importantly, they're actually FELT. Not just within the contet of the game, but the series as a whole. The distinction between your character in Divinity 2 and the other characters you play as over the course of the series, even taking engine differences and personal customization into account, is literally night and day, and it does an excellent job of making you feel like a budding top-tier entity in the world of Rivellon.","June 12, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no designated class that your character is stuck with, and no huge stat boosts applying to one particular 'class'.

I played the entire game -- 67 hours (the Director's Cut includes both the original and the expansion pack, Flames of Vengeance.) I liked the streamlined skill tree -- it made it easy to try new skills. Plus, you don't have to pick a class. I used explosive arrows from the Ranger tree, and a couple skills from the Meele tree (whilrwind, thousand strikes) -- when I wasn't tossing fireballs.\n\nThe early game is pretty basic, but after awhile, you get to become a dragon, and that made the game uniquely fun (the dragon never felt as powerful as my human form, however, which seems really counter-intuitive. You also can't wipe out humans on the ground with your flame breath -- that would no doubt be too easy.)\n\nMy biggest issue was the vague quest system. There are no markers for the subsequent steps in quests, and what exactly you need to do is not spelled out. A lot of the quests left me scratching my head, wondering where the game wanted me to go next. I have limited play time, and while I like to explore, I don't really enjoy retracing the same steps over and over as I run around the countryside or in town, trying to remember where Bernard or Benedict or Brutus was when I picked up his quest days earlier.  Keeping track of 20+ quests and each one's next steps required more devotion to detail than I was willing to spend. If you find that to be the case, you might do what I did, and print out quest guides from Game Banshee or the various Divinity wikis (or have them in a browser and Alt+TAB, of course). I'm a completist, and didn't want to miss any side quests. BTW, I played Divinity: Original Sin before this one, and that game's questing system was perfect!\n\nMy only other complaint was it takes far too long to get your home base -- so managing your inventory is a real pain, unless you spend skill points to be able to lug more stuff, or sell off stuff you're not even sure you need yet.\n\nOther than that , I had a good time and would recommend the game to anyone who likes fantasy RPGs.","May 5, 2015","true","67.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a great game, but a decent one. The good outweighs the bad, but not by much. A flawed gem that should be purchased on sale (which given it's age now that's easy to do).\n\nTHE GOOD? It's got loads of great humour in it for starters. Including lots of little side shows like rescuing a woman from undead, and then hearing her berate her husband later for sending someone out to rescue her and nagging at him about his marriage vows. Seriously plenty of funny moments. It's nice it doesn't take itself too seriously as a game.\n\nThe other big plus is the quests are a little better than your average find this, go here, get this quests. There are lots of optional quests, you can ignore them (but you won't level enough if you do, so make sure you do a few). Fortunately many are interesting and entertaining enough to be reasonably worth the time.\n\nThe skill system also is decent I guess - you can build any way you want. Just don't go shoving 1 point in everything - you'll suck.\n\nTHE BAD? Well, there's a few issues. The first one is one of those annoyances that makes you want to punch stuff - whenever you are in a dialogue screen and then come out of it into combat, even if you had your weapons drawn, they are now sheathed. And it takes ages to pull them out. While you are fumbling aimlessly (even though you had them out before the chat), you are getting wailed on. In some fights that can matter. It's dumb. It's unnecessary, and bloody frustrating.\n\nRPG games are often made or broken on the use of quest logs, maping markers etc. This game falls WELL short in that dept. It's HARD remembering where you did something to get back there once you've got the thing you were after...  - you can't make a quest active with a marker to help you out, and unless you are truly anal, you won't bother with writing notes to help yourself. This bit really does suck. It makes the game frustrating at times. You run around trying to remember which place to go back to to close out parts of the story. Poor. Annoying. A bad oversight.\n\nLike I said at the start - it's ok. I've played worse RPGs.

This is basically the Collector's Edition of the Game of the Year version of the original game. Simply put, the original game was very buggy and re-released with DLC, a new game engine, and many bug fixes. This improves on that re-release.\n\nTo compare it to more well known games, it features combat similar to the Elder Scrolls series, loot and upgrades similar to Diablo series, and (less influential) dialogue chooses from the Mass Effect Series. There is also a tremendous skill tree from which you can mix and match all play styles without restriction (other than your level). Two unique features in the game are mind reading, which usually allows you to find additional loot, and turning into a dragon, which has very smooth controls but less expansive combat.\n\nThe story is kind of all over the place, but it needs to be mentioned that the ending of the main game is terrible. I will not spoil it, but the game ends without any kind of big moment. There are, however, some twists and a tone that isn'y present in many games. The included DLC is great in terms of flushing out an entire city with numerous type of unique people, personalities, and quests. However, once again the main story is not consistent with the ending again feeling pretty cheap.\n\nOverall, Divinity II: Developer's Cut is a really good game. There are some bugs with it (I really only experienced 1 bug that didn't let me finish a side quest, but it was corrected in Developer's Mode). It may not blow you away, but it is still a very fun experience that allows a large amount of freedom. The game is a must buy on sale, but still worth the full price if not on sale.\n\nI posted an entire playthrough on my YouTube channel for anyone interest in checking out aspects of gameplay.

Also, the main story is just okay, and won't really mean a whole lot to you if you aren't familiar with the series.\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\n(Lengthy bit where I ♥♥♥♥♥ about Ultima)\n\nThe Divinity series is interesting. It's a series that clearly and openly takes cues from the old Ultima series; a series that has the distinction of having some of the best RPG's of all time AND some of the worst. If I were to describe the first Divinity game, Divine Divinity, in a nutshell, it would be "Ultima 8: Pagan, but good." Divinity 2 gets a similar description with regards to the disaster that was Ultima 9: Accension.\n\nIt's a large, open world third person action RPG. The game will expect you to do a lot of exploration, talk to a lot of people, face some pretty damn challenging enemies and solve some pretty interesting puzles, like playing a game of riddles with a talking treasure box. The game also does something very well that Ultima 9 failed at miserably; making you feel powerful. In Ultima 9 your character was the Titan of Ether, a god in a sense, and both the story and the game itself didn't even seem to notice. At an early point in Divinity 2 your character becomes a Dragon Knight, which is a really big deal for the setting, and the changes that it inflicts upon your character over the course of the game are pretty substantial, and most importantly, they're actually FELT. Not just within the contet of the game, but the series as a whole. The distinction between your character in Divinity 2 and the other characters you play as over the course of the series, even taking engine differences and personal customization into account, is literally night and day, and it does an excellent job of making you feel like a budding top-tier entity in the world of Rivellon.","June 12, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's awkward and unpleasant, things have tons of health, your skills have long cooldowns, cost lots of mana and are largely not very powerful or worthwhile. You can't block, and moving is too lagged by attacking that you will be hit constantly unless you roll around from side to side endlessly, and even then it's unresponsive.

Good lord what an amazing night that was. One of my favorite and one of the most underrated RPGs out there.

I have hundreds of hours in this game (I have no idea why Steam only shows 1.4, kinda mad about that actually!). Biggest downside is the dragon segments can get slightly repetitive, but not terribly, just mix up your strategy a bit and you won't even notice. It's also not 100% open world, with some linear paths, but this game pulls it off nicely and the environments never get repetitive.\n\nBut even if you aren't like me and don't find this one of the best action RPGs out there, it's still absolutely worth playing.\n\nAnd I do want to emphasize this isn't one of the best ever in the sense that Witcher 3 is, where it's just a damn good game.

It feels like a giant "♥♥♥♥ you" to melee hybrids almost. So much undodgeable damage when you go into close quarters, its so much more entertaining just to use bows and magic from a distance and sidestep everything.\n\nThat being said though, despite its issues its clearly a very indepth, extensive and immersive RPG. I just wish it seemingly wasnt so focused on healing the damage you take instead of avoiding it. It feels like an action RPG that was made by people who dont know how to make action combat, tbh. Kind of like DA:I to an extent.\n\nI know it sounds like im bashing this game, but i really do enjoy it all the same. i just wish the challenge came more from actual mechanics as opposed to design oversights.

Because the way you see and play and invole yoursel with the game will be changed forever.\nIt starts out with you being a new dragon slayer and going to a place called Farglow to learn the basics of dragon slaying.   You will choose what class you want to be.  There are 3 here to choose from: MAGE,  FIGHTER,and RANGER.\nSOME HAVE SAID THAT CHARACTER CHOICE AND CREATION RUN ALONG THE SIMPLE.   I think you will develop your character through the choice of over 30 skills which are devided into the three mentioned clases plus a priest class.   The basic development fall into two basic ways to develop your character.\nYou can develop a  character using skills from his class or you cat develop one using skill choices from several classes.\nThis will let you develop a character that suits your style.  A single class character will be stronger and a character developed using skill from more than one class  will be more visital,    I started as a fighter but soon saw the advantage\nto being good with a bow.  Keep in mind that your class choice  will give you some skills to start the game depending on the class.\nThe skills are devided into 2 types active and passive.  You can have as many passive skills as yo wish,  The active skills and other items are placed in a 8 hotkey display at the bottom of the screen.  You can have more active skill and special abilities but only 8 will be in the hotkeys. The special ability's things you can do,\nEach time you gain a level you get 6 stat points  that you can increase one of your 5 ststs.  You also get 1 skill points to purchase a new skill or improve an exsisting skill,   Each skill has 5 levels till later in the game.  Take note with just one\npoint/turn you will have to learn the hard way that once you make a choice it can not be changed till later in the game.\nBecause of the way this game levelup and does not use the game levels are based on your level some interesting things happen.  If you get into a situation where your character is higher that the NPC monsters then you may have a\nbattle where the NPC gets his lickls and you get a small number of xp points or eve 0,  Which  leads to the practice of witholding stat points and even skill points till you come acxross NPC's who give you more xp points.  This may sound strange but in playing the gqame it does work.  I like it because it limits the practice of "Power Leveling" The way the game levels is something you should take at face value like many of the game  mechcanics work in the game if you just usr them and in time it will let you see what a marvolus game this is...It is hard but ther is always a way.\nNow the combat will really be frustrating at first.  You do not have nice turn based combat because it is real time.\nWhen you get into the second part of the game in the begining section you will encounter large groups of hostile NPC's\nand will have to develop ways to deal with them.   Once an area or a group of units is dead they stay that way.\nThere is the run in ....kill a couple..aned try to get out into a safe place. save and repeat.\nDifferent movement skills are used in the game to solve problems and quests.  Once again this is not the normal thing in many RPG's.   For example  there are many kinds of containers to open and a bright yellow light will occur if  something can be opened including  some empty containers.  Now depending on the angle of you mouse and how your character is this  yellow light may not always show up. Moving you character slowly in each direction will help.  Also a messahe will apear next to the hotkey area and tell you there is something to open or use or take.  One of the more difficult things you will have to learn is jumping.  Many quests have platforms to jump from one to the next and some platfors arte moving,  There is a learning curve if you are using a mouse and keyboard (controlers  are not enabled for the most part\nThere are many wepons, armor inchantments, charms, and pluses for stats that you will be able to use depending on you level.  There are some who do not like the armor methods used in the game because they can't  get matching sets.  I find no ewason to comment on this because the absurdity is plain to see. It is possible to taloy your character in many different way to reach a certain result.  If you find a situation that call for an archer, maage or whatever then you cause rifferent selections of eqyuipment, to get the job done.\nI think this is a great game with many vqarid and challanging  problems.   It never fails to have me shaking  my head.  The graphics are just right for the game theyare neither to strong or two week.   One thing that I have never seen in an RPG is the notebook tab.  Her yoyu wil;l find several very useful  features,   Thgere is one that has all of your conversions\nso if you are a little confused about speaking to a NPC it is all there every blessed word.  There is one that has every combataction and the result and there is one that has all the NPC's that you have dispached.  The quests are handled in a list of completed quests and open quests you are workinmg on.  A nice feature is the quests that are open are in different colors so you can tell when one is compleated or  can't be compleated or is reasdy to complete.\nThere are things I may not like but I do not mention them unless they seem out of place.  I write this review to tell the reader how the game works.  There are games I do not like because I can see that they could have done better but did not due to such thingss as cost of development, or are just game put on the market to make money.  I do not play games in development or bata  games bedcause I have better things to do.   I do not comment on other reviews because I believe they are voicing ther opinion which I see has no place in a review.   Expressing you opinion is not the way I think a review should be done.  I could be wrong and people might take this review as being to high and mighty, but it is just the way I see it.\n\n","July 17, 2015","true","534.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of humor hidden in there if you know where to look (and even if you don't)... Brave Sir Robin.  The quests and dungeons are fun to go through, and the puzzles.... can puzzle you.  There minimal (and at times none at all) as far as hand-holding goes for the quests and puzzles - which is a GOOD thing.  You won't be mindlessly following an arrow or looking for the magical sparkly button.  No.  You'll be in a dungeon, actually trying to figure out the puzzle, as it should be.  On rare occasions when you do get stuck, there's always walkthroughs...  Although racking your brain a little longer is much more rewarding when you finally DO figure it out.\n\nAlso, there's no set classes.  You can play your character any way you want to (though I would suggest specializing in 3-5 skills).  It may not seem like much, but I'd much rather have a single poison arrrow that does nearly 400 damage over 20 seconds, than a bunch of arrows (stun, split arrow, fire arrow, pinning arrow, whatever) that does much less...  That is to say, it is true:  If you are a jack of all trades, you are a master of none.  And masters tend to pack a punch!\n\nSwing swords, shoot bows, blast 'em with fireballs, summon undead, summon demons, punch people with your bare fists...  fight however you want.   The only dis-advantage to this is... questing, story, and fighting is all there is to it.  No mini-games, no "romance", no craftng system so to speak...  But as an adventure story, it's top notch!\n\nAlso?  You can play as a dragon.  (and own your own tower).\nIt's true - you will be playing the game a while before you are a dragon.  The game is not rushed!  Many play-hours for you to enjoy, so enjoy it!\n\nI honestly wasn't expecting "that much" when I bought this game, and I was pleasantly surprised!

That's all that needs to be said.\n\nJokes aside, it's a rather well built game that if anything sometimes expects too much from the players. Don't expect to take less than 30 hours to complete it IF you skip all the sidequests. Actually, I don't know if you can even complete the game without completing all of the sidequests, because the difficulty curve is more like a difficulty LADDER, and if you're not strong enough to move up the big steps, you won't be getting anywhere anytime soon. Overall solid game, requires some dedication. It's not just "The dragon knight game", it's "The pretty challenging game where you can play a dragon knight if you're patient enough for it".","July 14, 2013","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ground combat works perfectly fine and is satisfying, but by the time you're able to turn into a dragon on command, you'll be so powerful in human form that turning into a giant, fire breathing death lizard feels like a step down. I dunno how they managed to have being a dragon make you feel /more/ vulnerable, but they did it. You don't have all the armor and weapon bonuses you've been stacking up when you transform, so it'll take some time to adjust to the increased difficulty of the flying segments at times. Still, there's plenty of loot to be found, a killer rabbit, and you can be an absolute backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you want to. Gotta love multiple choice dialog. I recomend getting Divinity 2 when it's on sale, it's a good game but not the best of it's kind on Steam.","May 9","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have only ever played this and Original Sin but I still feel this is true.\nWhilst the main game runs for about 40 hrs and the expansion another 10-20, I feel like there should have been more areas to explore.\n\nOverall: Great game, get it, especially on sale. My cons in this cause are simply things I wish they could have done more with, what did do was superb.","May 18","true","51.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
