How the @£#!# did the developer manage to trick valve to release this on steam? I would like to know, because then i would be rich too. I guess they didn't write them a letter, because they are even worse to translate Portuguese into English than google translate. And i can't believe they won them over by showing them the game either, because the game hardly works at all. I clocked in about 40 minutes, and 25 of them was me trying to make the game playable. I tried every setting but game keep on crashing.\n\nOther then that i notice that the graphics are terrible. Witch are a miracle when you think about this game use the cryengine witch are very good. The game looks like its 10 years old. However i could live with that if the game have cool features and if you can play it without crashing every 5 minutes. Also the game has some insane stuttering when its not crashing making the screen freeze up to 5-6 seconds if you move to fast. So the game is unplayable at the moment.\n\nAlso the interface seemed very bad and sound was not good. The gun sounds like someone did one knock on the door, and was very week compeared to the ambiant sounds.\n\nAccording to the developers website this game has some very cool features, but that doesn't matter if you actually can't play the game. But keep in mind this is Alpha 0.1, so that might change in the future. However the game is developed by a very small team of just two people. So don't expect any fast progress on this game.\n\n\nDon't buy this game in current state. However, if you really love this type of games, i recommend you to keep one eye on it and perhaps one day it will become both playable and enjoyable.\n\n(PS. Thank god for steam refunds. At least i get my money back.)","October 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 82 of 120 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","82","120","11","15"
