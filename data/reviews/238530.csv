Each outfit comes with its own set of stats and abilities, each one having its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSuper Puzzle Platformer Deluxe hits the action, puzzle, and indie spots tremendously well. The music is great and keeps the game at a fast pace while the sound effects blend perfectly into it.

Players can choose one of nine different outfits, each with thier own ability (for example: Ninja offers double-jumping; Domino Mask utilizes two-way shooting), and endure amidst a small arena of falling blocks. Jump, shoot and strategize your way to a high score.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, the premise is simple: survive as long as possible, with no time limit. This quickly becomes a welcome challenge, as numerous traps [and blocks] will appear according to the players' level (goes up to four; the higher the level, the more difficult it is to survive). Each map has its' own set of traps. Usually, it is a better option to wait for the screen to fill at least halfway, as connected adjacent blocks of the same colour will all explode when shot as a combo. As blocks explode, they drop block bits, which add 1 point on thier own. Collect enough bits in a row, and an invincibility star will appear.\n\nGet this title while it's still only 2 dollars; it's worth it.

I loved it!\n\nYou're a little block-shaped guy trapped in a Tetris pit and given the Polar Star from Cave Story. Your mission is to achieve a high score and survive for as long as possible against colored blocks and hazards constantly falling on you. You can clear blocks by shooting at them, and any adjacent same-colored blocks will also be damaged by your shots. Destroyed blocks drop little triangles (also from Cave Story) which will level up your gun. Getting crushed by a block will level down your gun, but most hazards (including the spikes at the bottom) will outright kill you and end your run, so you’ll have to be careful.\n\nThe main gameplay takes place in eight endless levels, each of which has its own set of hazards. Through continued play, you can unlock the different levels, as well as different characters, and about thirty “survival” challenges each of which will require you to dodge a preset pattern of hazards falling on you. I found everything in this game highly addicting and satisfying to defeat. The instant death traps were indeed frustrating, but they made the eventual success that much sweeter.\n\nMy favorite part of the game had to be the soundtrack. Unlike most retro-inspired chiptunes which sound like the NES, this game’s music is beautifully molded after the Sega Genesis (or perhaps old AdLib midis, if you prefer). There wasn’t a bad track in the whole game, and they all got me pumped to try again just one more time.\n\nThe game’s about 10-20 hours long depending on your skill level and your desired goal of completion. Getting the very last few achievements requires beating some sadistic levels which require you to survive for thirty seconds against a terrible onslaught of hazards. They are difficult, but manageable with some persistence. My only real gripe with this game was that the fourth level (Cookin Cave) seemed to be the hardest and most frustrating with some instant-death hazards which seem to come out of nowhere, but it’s doable once you notice the patterns in the level. Overall, the game’s length was about perfect and it didn’t overstay its welcome.\n\nI recommend it to all achievement hunters, and anyone who likes the looks of the trailer. I think I’ll be having fond memories of this game for quite a while, at least until I can get the awesome music out of my head.","September 29, 2015","true","16.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The basic idea is that this is a matching block breaker type game, except you don't have any control over how the blocks fall.  Instead, you're a guy on top.  The game actually plays like a platformer, except you score points by breaking blocks.  The bigger your combo (the more of one color that you break in one combo) the more you score.  There's some exp type things that raise your general attack power.  You also immediately level down upon taking some forms of damage (some damage out right ends the game, like falling on spikes),  As you progress you unlock new stages which in turn have their own unique mechanics that don't typically appear within other stages.  Certain stages (♥♥♥♥ing fire cave, for example) are harder than the end ones simply because of the design of their mechanics.\n\nThere are also some challenges and those were fun, though they're more about learning the progression of the drops than anything else.\n\nAdditionally, there are different characters that have different abilities but I never found myself wanting to use any of these.  The base character is pretty balanced and his ability is good.\n\nThe music is pretty good in Super Puzzle Platformer and I really enjoyed listening to the sound track.\n\nGraphics are graphical.  They don't get in the way but they're also not super fancy.  They work.\n\nIf I had any negative things to say it would be how the difficulty curve scales (that ♥♥♥♥ing fire cave, world 3 or 4, is pretty hard but later stages aren't really).  That, and if you're an achievement hunter then yeah, this game can go ♥♥♥♥ itself lol.  Most of the achievements aren't hard and I had fun doing them (beating challenges, clearing stages, getting max level on stages).  However, the ones that suck ♥♥♥♥ing suck.  Although not the worst, there is an achievement for dying 1k times: sorry, I don't want to play this game that much; even grinding that out would be a massive hassle.\n\nThe worst, however, involves lasting for an inordinate amount of time in a stage to unlock a special challenge.  There is a challenge for each stage and clearing one of these challenges earns you an achievement.  These challenges are pretty tough to unlock and I gave up on them.  Not interested in the time it takes to get that.\n\nThose two points, the achievements and the difficulty, are pretty minor though.  I count this as a great game and I think everyone should play it.  It deconstructs the puzzle genre very well.","September 4, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a very challenging block puzzler that plays a bit like Mr. Driller or Egg Mania (YEAH! Just made you google that obscure game) where you control a character instead of the actual block drops. Shoot blocks for XP shards (which look almost exactly like the ones from Cave Story), which make your weapon stronger. Connected blocks of the same color reward more XP and points. Be carefull, as shooting a block combo from under you can mean death if you don't jump in time. Other hazards can make things difficult. It has the sharpness and solidity I've started to see in other Adult Swim games, but the difficulty is no joke - get ready to kick ♥♥♥ or get yours kicked. If you were looking foward to this game already or if this kinda of game appeals to you, I don't see any reason for you not to enjoy it other than the somewhat unforgiving difficulty.

I'm especially fond of  arcade titles like Bubble Bobble(and its sequels) & Snow Brothers. What makes the concept work is that you're playing a puzzle game, but you don't actually realize it. You're just thinking "Wow if I capture these guys in bubbles and pop them at the same time, I get a huge point bonus". Figuring out how to get all the baddies at once is the puzzle, but your skills are simultaneously tested by everything out to kill you. Somebody thought "Wow I should combine a puzzle-platformer and a falling-block puzzler. That'd be super!" So now we have Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe. Alright then.\n\nThe story of SPPD is that it's a SPPD. You're a thing with a weapon, trapped in a hole, and blocks continously fall from the sky. You can destroy all the blocks as they fall, but that's not even slightly fulfilling. Instead you chip away, so that a huge mass of same-colored blocks are grouped together. Destroy that and you get a mess of gems, and possibly an invincibility star.\n\nWhy would you need invincibility? It's probably for all the traps trying to kill you. These traps can be destroyed by shooting the blocks next to them. That's not always a possibility though. You also have to account for the spiked-floor, or the pool of lava, or the dangerous pit of dying death. You don't want to mistakenly blast your floor out from under you. The goal of each world is to get as high a score as possible before you die...or get bored.\n\nOne of the standards of the falling-block puzzler is that as the game progresses, the blocks drop at increasing levels of speed. Eventually it gets to the point you have less than a second, to figure out where you want the piece to go, and if your reflexes will get it there in time. Our human limitations are what cause the game to end. SPPD doesn't do this...as far as I could tell. The pace of the game stays at the same rate throughout; the blocks never seem to fall any faster, nor do the traps get any more numerous. Eventually boredom sets in, because there's no longer any struggle for survival.\n\nWhen games end unexpectedly (death) your first thought is "BULL ♥♥♥♥" your second thought is "Wow I bet if that didn't happen or I dodged that, I'd have gotten further." After enough time is spent in a game of SPPD you just kinda want it to end so you can move on. That's how I felt, when I "accidentally" got myself killed. If you're spending more than 15 minutes on a single game of a falling-block puzzler, it has to be an intense as hell and you're still kicking ♥♥♥. After 30 minutes you're either a Tetris God or going to enslave humanity if the game ever ends. SPPD never really pushes things, which is a shame because the concept, controls, and music are quite good.\n\nSo why do I recommend SPPD?\n\nThe main mode is just one part of the game. The challenge mode throws traps at the player, and they have to use what little abilities they have to avoid them. These stages are 30-45 seconds each but they're still a decent challenge. The more advanced stages can be unlocked after amassing 50,000* points in the main mode levels. They can be quite difficult to pull off. Figuring them out is a puzzle, but all you're thinking about is how to survive.\n\nThis, along with the main mode, strike me as a couple of missed opportunities. There's the aforementioned main-game-never-speeds-up issue and now we have the challenge-mode-isn't-fleshed-out-enough issue. There are nine unlockable characters, they have different abilities. With enough effort all of these guys could have their own sets of stages. What's there is already really good, but more stages that centered around the various characters could really add to the game.\n\nThere's also multiplayer. I figure it's the kind where as you destroy lots of blocks, life is made harder for the opposing player. It's probably pretty awesome. I should go up to one of my friends and say "Wow, I've been playing this game called Super Puzzle Platformer Del-" and then they cut me off with this weird look. So yeah...I didn't try it. Maybe your friends are more open-minded.\n\nDespite two missed opportunities and a complete non-factor** I'm still giving this game a pass. It's fun to play in short bursts, and it has all the ideas down and the mechanics to back it up. An enhanced (or more enhanced) version could turn out to be really sweet. Plus there's the great soundtrack. Good music is never not a plus when it comes to videogames.\n\nThere was an Adult Swim humble bundle awhile back, so this is probably another one of those games that you've had for awhile and never realized it. Give it a look.\n\n*Don't quote me on that.\n\n**My fault for not having puzzle-platformer-friendly friends.","September 24, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Instead it is a literal mash-up of a puzzle and platformer game where the playfield is a tetris-like grid of falling blocks.  Regardless, there is still strategy involved and the game is still a fun combination of destroying blocks to try and rack up huge combos all while avoiding falling objects and hazards.  The highlight to me is challenge mode however, where you face a series of challenges based around different traps.  After beating the game you can unlock much more difficult challenges which are a lot of fun and approach Meat Boy-level difficulty.  My one complaint is that sometimes I feel the hazards in a level appear a little too quickly and unfairly (I'm looking at you, fireballs in Cookin' Caves!)","October 28, 2014","true","12.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It takes the harsh metallic sounds of the Sega Genesis' (or the Megadrive for anyone outside the States) sound chip and makes sweet, sweet candy with them. Back in the day, as a Genesis kid, I always used to harbor a bit of jealousy over the warm, clean tones of the SNES, but time has been kind to the Genesis and its uniquely futuristic sound and the overabundance of SNES inspired chiptune music makes it feel fresh and new.\n\nThe songs manage to be frantic and driving while still conveying a sense of ambience fitting for the level. Landon Podbielski's compositions gave me a whole perspective on the kind music that Sega's little 16-bit box produced. I never bother downloading game soundtracks, but this one is going right onto my hard drive.\n\nIn any case, if you're turned off by the "puzzle" in this game's title, don't worry. It's mostly a platformer and "puzzle" is really more of an aesthetic theme to set an arcade-style platformer in. There's a little thought required in setting up big chunks of blocks, but it's not like Bejeweled or Tetris Attack where you're trying to set up big chains of combos. Where a puzzle game's challenge mode usually has mini puzzles where you try to clear the board with a minimum number of moves this game has platforming challenges further enforcing that good platforming skills are more important than outside the box puzzle thinking. Fortunately the game gives you some tight controls to work with, like, Super Meat Boy good.\n\nIf you're not into games that focus on high scores than this might not be for you. There's no story to follow and while you can unlock all the levels just through sheer brute force there's no point beyond having a different level to try and get a high score in. Seeing that this game is all about the almighty high score it's odd that the high score table is so annoying to navigate. To my knowledge there's no way to snap to your place on the overall highscore board. So unless you get a high enough score that you only have to scroll down a few pages you're never going to know where you stand which really kills my motivation to try for high scores. In a game like this it's pretty unforgivable to not be able to know where you stand and easily see how you're improving.","September 13, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's subtle, but it's there... sometimes... if you look closely.\n- some of the characters are really useless.\n\nThat's it for the bad. Now the good.\n\nIt's a perfectly handled mashup of platform action with a sort of tetris-like. Controls are tight as hell. Speed and difficulty is just right!

Solving their patterns is difficult but fair.\n-Extremely replayable.\n-Some challenging quotas to unlock new characters and the hardest "Game Hero" challenges.\n-Playing just to unlock and complete everything will probably take about 10 hours.\n-That "one more go" factor.\n\nCons:\n-One character is inherently better than most of the others.\n-There's an alternate fire button, but most characters don't have any alternate fire at all. You can just use it as a regular fire button for them I guess.\n-When a block falls on you, you go down a level (you can reach up to 4). When you go down from level 4 to 3, a single pip pickup will take you back to level 4. This means that at level 4 you can just tank the blocks as long as you break at least one block and take its pip during the invincibility period.\n\nOther:\n-Stage hazards and spikes kill you in a single hit. Easy to deal with for careful and capable players, but capable of punishing players who play chaotically.\n-Stages are always the same dimensions and always have 3 colours of standard block.\n-One character has a gun that fires a non-concentrated stream of bullets, which can even hit blocks on the row on which you're standing. It's both destructive and impressive.\n\nThe game is quite addicting, with only a few very slight imbalances to distract you from the puzzling and the platforming, and it's good fun. Its formula doesn't change very much, but this allows you to get very used to it. Well worth someone's time.","June 29, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your goal is to platform the best that you can while blasting away the block obstacles and avoiding various deathtraps such as fireball shots, drills that destroy a column full of blocks, and many other traps.\n\nThe presentation is great. Hitbox is clear. The music is energetic techno, which for a fast-paced game that gets hectic, it's really beneficial.\n\nZ and X are used to shoot, and the arrow keys are used to move your character, especially the up arrow key because that's also your jump key. Doing specific things while a stage is going on can unlock outfits. The outfits you choose before selecting the various stages gives you various abilities, such as a slower descent or a double jump. However, you have 3 stats; Jump (how high you jump), Power (How much damage you're capable of doing to the obstacles), and movement speed. Depending on the outfit, you get different stats, which adds a plethora of replay value. While the asthetics of choosing a stage are just asthetics, the types of traps you encounter vary from stage to stage. Playing through a different stage with a different outfit adds wonders to even more replay value.\n\nThere's multiplayer, but sadly, I can't play it because I only have one friend that has this game.

If you're actually willing to fork up the cash, you'll get hours of platforming with retro, mid-90s graphics and intense action with an early 2000s flair. Which, admittedly, sounded a lot cooler in my head, but you'll see what I mean if you watch a trailer or you can justify the pricetag of $7.99.\n\n-Gameplay & Controls-\nLet me start out by saying that this game’s premise is uniquely bizarre, and it’s hard to not be off-put by the concept when you first start playing. It’s essentially a giant game of Bejeweled, except instead of tapping to clear tiles from the the screen of your overpriced smartphone you’ll have to physically navigate the board with an armed yellow square, pressing the fire button to destroy blocks grouped by one of three colors. Personally, I’ve never seen this kind of take on the overpopulated Bejeweled genre, and this added layer of depth to a game that I’ve never thought could have any depth whatsoever makes it both unique and fun. Plus, there are additional Challenge levels and enough achievements to keep you playing for quite some time, which altogether makes this one of the best casual games I have in my library.\n\n-Graphics & Visuals-\nStylistically, this reminds me of some sort of modern mobile rehash of an arcade game from the ‘80s or ‘90s, with a slightly updated pallet to fit in with the times. Somehow, though, this odd combination works. We already know that going into the game, of course, because we’ve actually seen this style before. It’s the same one utilized in Super House of Dead Ninjas, and to some extent, Fist Puncher as well. That’s Adult Swim’s trademarked style, it seems, and while it’s perfectly alright, I just wish that all the bright neon overtones didn’t seem somewhat recycled. Still, it’s visually pleasing, and if you’ve enjoyed the studio’s other games you’ll definitely be pleased by Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe.\n\n-Music & Audio-\nEverything audial plays on the modern arcade vibe that the game continually tries to emphasize. The music is alright for what it is and goes well with the visuals, but when combined with the fast-paced nature of the game all of the rapid-fire sound effects can seem like too much. The sound effects and music can be toggled separately, though, which goes a long way when you prefer to listen to your own music while playing.\n\n-Final Thoughts-\nThere is much to love about Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe. It’s rare to find casual games that are so engaging, and with its own unique spin on a game that is constantly cloned, this title maximizes replayability and entertainment. You can pick up and play whenever you choose, as well, which is something I really value given my busy class schedule. All this being said, however, I can’t justify paying almost $8.00 for this game. If you’re interested in what it has to offer, your best bet is to wait for a sale or to buy it as part of a bundle. It’s a game that’s worth getting — just not at this price.","September 4, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The controls are intuitive, but it doesn't tell you the objective, or the hazards, or anything. It's a delicious break from the norm of agonizing handholding and unskippable tutorial dialogue. But, since learning the game is an experience in itself, I will not state any of that here.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the rules, it feels like it'd be easy. But as you progress, you start overstepping your boundaries, taking risks you shouldn't, and you'll end up with some awesome close calls. The game is balanced fantastically- You'll almost always see your death coming, and you'll immediately know how you could've avoided it.\n\nThe multiplayer is good fun with a group of people, and is pretty reminscent of Tetris Attack. Clearing a cluster of three or more blocks sends a hazard to your opponent's screen, and it tends to come down to 'last man standing.' Which usually doesn't take long: It gets hectic fast.\n\nThe variety of characters all have their different strengths, as well. The starting character can float across the whole stage, while some can fly, another can double jump. Some have strengths in firepower, being able to take out blocks much more quickly, or not suffering knockback from shooting.\n\nFor what this game is, how much content there is, and its price, this game is a steal. And they recently put out a substantial content patch for free, just out of the blue.

But you'll constantly die before reaching it. But when you do reach it you'll be doing the same bland thing for half an hour trying to get a good score. By that time you're about to reach that high score you'll be screwed over by several traps at once making one large impossible to dodge trap. It will happen at complete random and will happen regardless of wether or not you played carefully or dangerously. Not only will you feel cheated in this game all the time you'll also feel quite bored once you get the hang of it. There are no good multipliers. The amount of points you get per cluster of similar colored blocks is nothing even if you fill the screen with them. That in itself is pretty dissapointing, having reached the pinicle of gameplay in half an hour. Finally, again I'd like to mention some of the levels are unfair. There is a glitched level that glitches while you play it and all its purpose is is to cheat you out of satisfaction. Very poor visual cues mixed with missleading visual cues does NOT equal fun! Pile on completely unfair and impossible to dodge traps, while mixing in pixel perfect accuacy and you have this game! YAY!\n\nUnless this game is free (I believe it was originally) then I suggest not buying it.","January 15, 2014","false","13.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It's so close to being a respectable puzzle experience like Tetris, but it has problems that hold it back.\n\nFirst, and most glaring, is that the text that pops up whenever you level up, level down, or destroy blocks will block your vision of falling blocks and traps. It is incredibly irritating to not be able to react to a falling trap because the game felt the need to say "groovy" in big annoying letters smack dab in the middle of the playing field. Or you couldn't position yourself just right to get out of the way of falling blocks because of the same reason. It's annoying, it's unfair, and it's unneccesary.\n\nSecond, the traps feel unfair most of the time. Not taking into account my previous complaint, in the fourth level, (Cookin' Caves) there are fire stick traps pulled straight out of Super Mario Bros. that limit your mobility severely. If you aren't blind sighted by the thing coming down, you'll be hard pressed to find a safe spot to destroy it. Sometimes even more will come down at once, limiting you to about 25% of the playing field. When I'm trying to setup large combos, avoid falling into spikes or lava, and move out of the way of falling blocks, it feels extremely unfair to have some kind of trap fall in and completely screw up your plans AND likely end your game.\n\nMy last big problem is that there is no way to push blocks around. Why not? It would only serve to make the game more enjoyable and give the player more control over the field. It would add greatly to the gameplay. Instead you have to wait around for blocks to drop into places you want them to. I can't tell you how surprised I was to find that such a potentially good feature was not in the game. Maybe one of the unlockable characters can, but that's no excuse. It should be available from the start.\n\nDespite all this, the music is top notch and the graphics are really appealing. And when I wasn't getting screwed over by being blinded by text or unfair traps, I did have a good time. But it could be SO much better than this.","December 1, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You level up as you play, if you'r hit by a brick in the head you loose one level until you'r at level 0.

I think I came into it with reasonable expectations, but Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe falls short for me.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, fast-paced, and controls well once I got used to it.  However there were no instructions or tutorial provided.  I start a game, and I have to guess how to move, how to interact with the blocks, and even what the objective is.  I go to the options to see the controller map, and there isn't one.  You go to controls and you're already changing them, one by one.  I have no idea what the default keys are now.  Plus, the text is hard to read - always inexcusable, 8-bit or not.  My first impression could've been much better with just a little more effort on these points.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a cheap indie 8-bit platformer built around a few simple mechanics, I'd look at other offerings - VVVVVV, for one.","November 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And, if you could be let to believe you can't rebind them because there isn't an option to change your control scheme from inside a level. Which is baffling as a design choice.\n\nHowever, once you find the options to rebind. The game will parse one key rebind at you at a time. And, you'll find out that having 10 face keys on a gamepad won't be enough for a game for whose controls equate to move, jump, shoot, and alternate shoot! There really could have been some consolidation of button functions here.\n\nAdditionally, the game has some really clunky switching from control schemes. I still haven't found out how to go from a keyboard to a controller without a fair amount of confusion and hardship.\n\nThe gameplay itself however is fairly decent, isn't really an improvement over the original flash game.\n\nBut the game suffers from terrible and clunky UI problems overall. One such example: The game uses something like a  640x400 resolution blown up to a larger size, which you can view in either fullscreen or windowed. But, you can't reduce the window to the original 640x400, which can be a little oppressive.\n\nAlso, I found the game's music to be pretty repetitive.\n\nOverall I really recommend you skip on this one, but check out the original game on adult swim's website if you are still interested. If you fall in love with the original, you'll probably like this one too despite it's flaws.\n\nI still feel this version of the game seems like a lazy port, however.","May 25, 2013","false","0.6"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","3"

I've enjoyed it so far, though it started out pretty difficult, I've hit the last "dungeon" in a matter of a couple hours, and it's only slightly harder than how it started out. Unfortunately, the game's difficulty feels as though it's based on the random generation of blocks and "enemies", the fact that there's little to no instructions, and the poor controls on everyone but the very first character (the caped one) that's playable.\n\nIt's pretty fun and mostly mindless, though there is a bit of strategy that can help. Focus on keeping the majority of your area as one color block, clearing the other two colors a little quicker.

Adult Swim Games has managed to publish a game that has done a pretty great job or looking, sounding, and feeling retro.\nSuper Puzzle Platformer Deluxe sounds like a mockery of the 16-bit era, and it sort of does just that. The music sound like 16-bit music you would have heard on the Sega Genesis. The graphics looks like something from the Super Nintendo. There is even a option to turn on "Blast Processing" (<- you should read up on the history of the Sega Genesis if you don't know what that is). The game is actually in like a Platformer Action game that takes place trapped in a Traditional Puzzle game. You can jump, and shoot, and collect things to power-up all while trying to survive and get the highscore. You don't actually control the Puzzle element of the game as far as the pieces falling, but the blocks you shoot to destroy will also destroy matching colored blocks that touch as well as special blocks like spikes, cannons, spinning flames, morning stars... wait, am I talking about the platformer part again?\nThere is even a local highscore board if your friends wish to challenge your skill, and a multiplayer if you need to prove who is the best once and for all. Challenges and other character also get unlocked if you really need to test your skills. It is recommended you have a controller for this (Xbox 360 controller works great). If you are a fan of retro games, this game should not disappoint.","September 14, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've enjoyed it so far, though it started out pretty difficult, I've hit the last "dungeon" in a matter of a couple hours, and it's only slightly harder than how it started out. Unfortunately, the game's difficulty feels as though it's based on the random generation of blocks and "enemies", the fact that there's little to no instructions, and the poor controls on everyone but the very first character (the caped one) that's playable.\n\nIt's pretty fun and mostly mindless, though there is a bit of strategy that can help. Focus on keeping the majority of your area as one color block, clearing the other two colors a little quicker. Feel free to leave some peppered in, of course, since you'll want somewhere to land when you do burst them all. Collect a ton of triangles at once, and nn invincibility star will popup near the top of the screen, and you can have at the area from there.

You're equipped with a gun, and your job is to shoot these blocks down in colored sets, such that you still have room for moving around, yet you don't open a hole into the spikes below.\n\nDuring your careful shoot-a-thon, the game occasionally changes things up. For example, you might suddenly see spike blocks or cannons falling down into the arena - additional hazards to avoid.

If you just shoot everything you see, blocks that match colors will open wide holes you'll have to jump into at some point.

Its a puzzle game, and a platformer game. Siding more on the puzzle side. Blocks fall down screen. Although here in order to get rid of them. Your character must run along the blocks, avoid the floor below, and shoot the blocks away with his gun. The more blocks touching. The more blocks dissapear when you shoot them. Creating a multiplier giving you a higher score. The higher the score the more you level up. When your character levels he is able to do more damage with his gun, and shoot blocks faster than at a lower lvl. The challange comes from latter stages that throw numerous obsticles in your path. Fireballs, giant buzzsaws, and gun turrents. The fun this game gives is enough to recommend. However, the Snes style presentation, and the amazing soundtrack to this game justifies this purchase.

Adult Swim Games has managed to publish a game that has done a pretty great job or looking, sounding, and feeling retro.\nSuper Puzzle Platformer Deluxe sounds like a mockery of the 16-bit era, and it sort of does just that. The music sound like 16-bit music you would have heard on the Sega Genesis. The graphics looks like something from the Super Nintendo. There is even a option to turn on "Blast Processing" (<- you should read up on the history of the Sega Genesis if you don't know what that is). The game is actually in like a Platformer Action game that takes place trapped in a Traditional Puzzle game. You can jump, and shoot, and collect things to power-up all while trying to survive and get the highscore. You don't actually control the Puzzle element of the game as far as the pieces falling, but the blocks you shoot to destroy will also destroy matching colored blocks that touch as well as special blocks like spikes, cannons, spinning flames, morning stars... wait, am I talking about the platformer part again?\nThere is even a local highscore board if your friends wish to challenge your skill, and a multiplayer if you need to prove who is the best once and for all. Challenges and other character also get unlocked if you really need to test your skills. It is recommended you have a controller for this (Xbox 360 controller works great). If you are a fan of retro games, this game should not disappoint.","September 14, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You destroy blocks with a gun, and they drop little shard things that you use to level up in order to increase how fast you break blocks and how many points you gain.\n\nThe real fun of the game comes from the fact that like other block puzzle games, blocks of the same color combine (there are three color varieties) and must be chipped at in order to be destroyed (the health of a stack is the sum of each individual block), and large stacks of them give huge payouts in shards and points, but preserving and growing a stack until you decide it's too dangerous for it grow any larger (the higher and more cluttered the floor is, the harder it is to dodge hazards) is a balancing act of increasing difficulty and patience. Various trap blocks fall, and you must destroy adjacents blocks or stacks to dispose of the hazards. The tight controls and the enticing risk-reward tactics make this game surprisingly fun even for an infrequent fan of platformer games.","February 8, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blocks fall down. You shoot them & jump around the gaps. You earn XP & level up. Bigger tougher blocks appear, like rockets, lasers etc. You shoot them & earn more XP. All with a cute retro pixelly look & great chiptune music.\n\nThis is really tough at first, far tougher than it should be, but once it clicks, it's a nice wee take on the genre.

Cool. Do you like fast-paced platforming? Cool. Have you tried them both at the same time? No? Try this game out!\n\nI got this in a bundle, and (as is usual with any bundle game I haven't heard of) was not expecting much of anything. I mostly buy these bundles in search of a diamond in the rough, something I get a lot of playtime out of for around a dollar. While this game isn't anything incredible in particular, it IS quite a bit of fun.\n\nYou play a small person with a gun, and you must clear the level of all the blocks. The way to do this is to match colors of blocks, and shoot the group until it disappears. When the entire map is clear of blocks, you win the level and progress. There are different powerups and items, and you unlock new characters if you do well on the level.\n\nThe main thing I look for in bundle games are games that I feel compelled to keep installed. This is one of those games. I can see myself coming back to this every now and then for a twist on Tetris with some fast-paced platforming.","November 21, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can move left, right, jump and fire. You first stand on two layers of blocks as blocks start to fall continuously from above. Your job is simple: avoid them, shoot them and don't die. A block takes 3 or 4 hits to be destroyed but all blocks of the same colour that are adjacent to each other explode in the blast. Destroy lots at once for a big score and don't hit the bottom - the spikes cause insta-death. Your quick-thinking decisions will involve where to fire from and which block of blocks to wipe out.\n\nPRESENTATION & DESIGN\nIt's a pixel-art style kept simple. You have a map of an island which is your level-select screen. This has six unlockable areas denoting the six levels to play and the main idea is to try to get your best score on each and attempt to beat it with later playthroughs. Some players will attempt to crack certain conditions to unlock more characters.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis is a fast-paced game requiring quick-thinking and quick-reactions. One false move insta-kills you, often prematurely, and this unforgiving nature of the game can make things frustrating. Emotional players will need to be prepared to yell at the screen in despair on more than one occasion - and the fact that you need to wait through a load of animations to get back into the action after death, might just make stress levels worse. Despite this, most patient and balanced individuals will enjoy the blast.","May 16","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
