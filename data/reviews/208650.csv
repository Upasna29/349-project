It's 2015, why is a game of this caliber is being locked at 30fps? While the frame rate cap is editable, you have to go into the config to do it instead of the main menu. But that doesn't matter, the game is terribly optimized. Whether it's capped at 30 or 60fps, you'll get major framerate drops. A single GTX 970 isn't even enough to keep it at a stable 30fps, which is completely ludicrous. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of releasing a game like this.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that, at the very last hour, they edited the Steam sub for the people that got the free Nvidia copy for buying a GTX 970 or 980 so that they wouldn't get the Harley Quinn pre-order bonus. Why do that? You already give away a free game, why take away a little pre-order bonus that everyone else who pre-ordered would get?\n\nIt just ends up making a lot of people angry. For months now people have been asking whether or not the people who got the Nvidia free copy would be getting the Harley Quinn pack. They were completely unclear on it, just beating around the bush.\n\nThis is no way to treat your fans.\n\nAt this point, this game isn't worth buying because of technical issues and such a terrible practice by it's publisher. Even people who got this game for free must feel like they got betrayed right now.\n\nSave your money, wait for updates and play something else in the mean time. I recommend the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a game that is much more optimized for PC, developed by a group of people who actually care about their fans.\n\nUpdate 1: No patch yet, but after some tinkering in the config file. I've gotten the game to run at a somewhat more stable frame rate. If I stand still or move slowly I can maintain a stable 60fps, but as soon as I hop into the Batmobile or start gliding around, frame rate will start dropping anywhere from 50's down to the low 20's. The worst part is every now and then the frame rate would tank so hard it would go down to single digit, like several other people have noticed. So I guess for right now, maintaining a stable 60fps or even 30fps is impossible unless you want to play Batman: Walking Simulator.\n\nUpdate 2: I got a chance to play the game a little bit, so this post will be about the gameplay. The combat and control are great and responsive, You never felt quite more like Batman than you are in this game. You feel powerful. The entire Gotham City is your playground and it feels amazing to traverse it. The only problem I have with the gameplay is that driving the Batmobile in "Pursuit Mode" felt pretty bad. It was hard to turn around corners without smashing into something, combining with the terrible frame rate and let just say I rather just glide across Gotham City than drive the Batmobile. I really hope they tweak the control for the Batmobile, it's my least favorite thing about the game right now. "Battle Mode" however is great, only because it's alot easier to maneuver around with it on.","June 22, 2015","false","46.5"," 12,019 of 13,057 people (92%) found this review helpful 527 people found this review funny","92","019","13","527","325"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wurzle/recommended/208650/","wurzle","wurzle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wurzle/","603 products in account","Updated 10/29 for the PC re-release that happened on 10/28:\n\nMany of the worst issues in the original release of this game have been resolved, but if it came out as-is today I would still say the port is pretty disappointing. Many people who couldn't play the game at all before can get a playable framerate now, but even on a very high end system the frame pacing is very poor and results in a stuttery experience.\n\nThe texture loading issues that plagued the game on release are gone, but you still see shockingly low resolution textures during almost any cut scene.\n\nImage quality is all over the board, but is improved quite a bit by turning off AA, CA, and film grain effects.\n\nSpeaking of effects, there seems to be a bug that scales the intensity of post-processing effects with the screen resolution the game renders at. The most obviously visible occurance of this bug is when lens flares are rendered. In 1080p, lens flares look more or less as they should. At 1440p you'd think Batman just had LASIK surgery because looking at a street light produces a double or triple lens flare corona that makes it very difficult to see what is going on. Considering the whole game takes place at night and there are more lens flares than a JJ Abrams movie this bug can get pretty irritating.\n\nIf you're a huge batman fan and you've been waiting to play this game, I'd say it is definitely playable now. If you're on the fence and were waiting to see whether they had turned a legendarily bad release into a good one for rerelease, I'd say wait until it is heavily discounted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal review of initial release version:\n\n\nOne of the worst PC ports of all time.\n\nThis game had some incredibly misleading advertising. In the Nvidia gamework promo reel, posted to youtube by Nvidia on June 6 (only a few weeks before the game was released), they show ambient occlusion and rain textures - both of which are present in the console versions, and entirely absent from the PC version. The same gameworks promo trailer is also a full 60fps, but the game ships with a 30fps cap. By editing an .ini file you can remove the 30fps cap, but many have reported that causes other graphical issues such as textures only loading the very lowest detail level (they look pretty similar to the textures from a Nintendo 64 game).\n\nAside from the false advertising, this game can't even maintain a consistent framerate on hardware that FAR exceeds the recommended specifications. For example, despite having the game installed on an SSD, and running a 980ti with the latest drivers, I still get dips into single digit framerates in many situations. For example, any time I get in the batmobile, I am watching a slide show for a few seconds.\n\nSave your money and wait to buy this game until it is fixed (if it ever does get fixed).","June 24, 2015","false","41.4"," 2,638 of 2,918 people (90%) found this review helpful 135 people found this review funny","90","638","2","135","46"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zoltrad/recommended/208650/","Zoltrad","Zoltrad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zoltrad/","249 products in account","POST PATCH UPDATE\n\nMy did this take a while, well the game has now had a major patch and things are...better. The game is still by default held at 30fps but now an option in the menu has been added that lets you choose between 30/60/90 fps although they do say if you put it above 60 you may experience some issues with the performance. In my experience the game runs much better than before I get a solid 60fps on maximum settings (not including NVIDIA crap) during fighting/walking/gliding/grappling with almost no hitching, however I must say while driving the batmobile you can get 60 around the outskirts of Gotham but in the center where its busy and there are more npc's and other cars it does drop to around 50fps quite frequently. While this is not great it is certainly better than the 20fps it used to be when driving the batmobile.\n\nThe options menu has had loads of changes more suitable to PC with texture settings actually having an option for "High" this time rather than just medium which brings me to the games graphics. The game looks marginally better although not really in any significantly noticeable way. While batman games always had that shiny polished look to all its textures, I find that the moody lighting and glossy textures tend to hide the fact that some of the textures just aren't that great meaning walls, backgrounds and such; but they are good where it matters I suppose such as the batsuit, batmobile and generally all character models.\n\nSo should you buy it? Sigh this is a rather hard question but let me try to expand. I feel like this game is in a playable state, not perfect...but playable. However, I urge everyone not to forget the disaster that was this games launch. In my opinion such a terrible launch and treatment of the PC community requires that we show WB and Rocksteady that this is not ok by voting with our wallets and not buying this game. By doing so, showing them that this is unacceptable and if this is the state in which you release your games and it takes you like what 3-4 months to fix this then you don't deserve our money and support. So if you don't have any strong reason to buy this game then please don't. There are better games out there that you can still buy, if however you are intent on buying this game then at least wait for a sale because working or no this game is not worth its standard price. Take note of this games launch and please don't preorder and keep an especially keen eye on WB games since its clear whatever they may be publish to PC will likely crash and burn since they don't give a damn about PC and PC should not give a damn about them.\n\n\n\nORIGNAL REVIEW\n\n- Performance issues everywhere.\n- Had to use ini files to uncap the default 30fps lock.\n- I have drops to around 23fps on a rig that supersedes the recommended system requirements.\n- Do you have an AMD graphics card? lol good luck m8\n\nIt's a shame because there is a good game somewhere in here but the performance issues make it unplayable, I strongly advise against buying this until it is patched and begins to work properly.

I returned the product shortly after it was released.  There has since been two performance patches which reportedly improve things.  I decided not to purchase it again as it's so close to November when other games launch and my time is limited ATM.\n\n*** If your interested in purchasing the game look for more current reviews. ***\n\n\n---\n\nPlayed it for around an hour so far.\n\nThe combat is fun and responsive, the gliding is great and the game looks okay (AF is set to 4 by default which makes some textures look awful).  That's the good parts.\n\nThe bad parts are the framerate issues which are all over the place and the batmobile.  The game will frequently pause or dip to sub 10 fps on a gtx 970 when entering or approaching new areas.  Cutscenes have similar issues to witcher 3 in that while in engine they run at even less fps (by default the game itself is locked to 30, tweakable in the ini files) than the normal game making them stutter or appear stilted.\n\nSummoning the batmobile causes major frame rate drops.  At one point I summoned the car to try the batmobile takedown move.  By the time the frame rate recovered the batmobile had crushed the pack of guys I was fighting including the Riddler henchman I wanted to interrogate.\n\nThe batmobile itself handles awfully.  There are forced batmobile sections which involve chasing targets such as tanks or vehicles.  The handling makes some turns difficult to pull off and the vehicle feels clunky.  Some have recommended turning into a tank for a small amount of time for more precise control but this kills all momentum.  Tank mode is really boring but necessary to take out armored vehicles.  If you eject while under attack from armored vehicles batman will get upset someone is wrecking his car.  There doesn't appear to be a way (yet) to deal with vehicles without the batmobile which ruins the feel of the prior batman games.  Hopefully the need for the batmobile is limited later in the game.\n\nUnless this is patched soon it's definitely a refund.  I bought the game based on the prior Rocksteady Batman titles which played well on launch but this is a terrible PC port.  Never really expected the game to turn out this way but I guess alarm bells should have triggered when there was no PC review prior to launch.\n\nEdit:\n\nFor those commenting my PC is below min specs.

I am using a 970 on stock settings and 3570k overclocked to 4.5ghz with 8 gigs of ram, just for a frame of reference. Game also uses Denuvo DRM which has been reported in previous games that used this such as Dragon Age or Lord of the Fallen to have performance problems associated because of the processes behind the DRM. It is my hope that this title doesn't see any performance impacts because of the DRM implementation, but sadly I think it is...once again. Seriously, do we need ANOTHER layer of DRM on top of the already existing DRM (Steam?) Ugh.\n\nPC PORT IS LOCKED TO 30 FPS BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THAT. "TURTLEBOATS YOU DONT NEED TO SHOUT MAN, NOW YOU ARE MAKING ME SHOUT!"\n\n-To change the ini files go wherever your game is saved and go to: Knight\BmGame\ Config\BmSystemSettings.ini and change the parameter for "MaxFPS=30" to "MaxFPS=60"\n-To delete the intro video files go to Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\BMGame\Movies and delete StartupMovie and StartupMovieNV.\n\nGraphics Impressions: The game is really hit or miss at times and while the game can look good, some textures arent as crisp and tight as you would hoped it would be.  At a distance the graphics  look servicable, but once you get close to even some of the thugs, they look like reused assets from the previous games.  The graphics settings in this port are honestly bare bones (you cant even tweak how high you want aliasing to be set at!) The game looks a bit outdated in areas but that should not come as a surprise since the game is using the same engines as the previous Arkham games, so while they have probably maxed out what that engine can do, it does not have all the bells and whistles you would like to hope for in a next gen title. It looks as though without the nvidia settings, the max settings on this pc port is on par with its console brother.  There are a limited number of specific Nvidia exclusive graphics tweaks that seperate it from the console version, so in that sense it is dissapointing.\n\nTo me the best way I can describe how the game looks is: washed out. The textures aren't crisp, enemies float above the ground after you knock them out, pop in happens quite frequently.  The best parts to me graphically are the parts where you are soaring down around Gotham and seeing all the vibrant lush neon lights.\n\nGameplay Impressions: Combat feels better than ever, it feels a bit more faster and fluid than the previous games (got through playing the series recently so its easy for me to compare.) To me I loved how the combat worked in previous games, but felt it was just a tad slow, nice that its sped up here. No more walking through tight corridors or seeing the same locales like in Asylum or even City to an extent, this games world is massive. Zipping from building to building with Batman's arsenal makes you wish a Spiderman game was only this good at its "web slinging" action. There is a great sense of speed while you coast from building to building and is quite fun. One moment you are on top of  building, next moment you are flashing toward some thugs and blistering their bones.  You can now also interrogate your victims and make them spit out some pertinent information to your mission.  Launching in and out of the batmobile in pursuit of some random street thug or being propelled in to the sky all work seemless and make me excited to play with my new toy any chance I can get.\n\nIts too bad the best moments and the highlight of the game - the gameplay - SUFFERS because of the shoddy port quality.  I have had my fps drop to as low as 20 in some cases. Something I have never seen happen on my 970 before running a game on its max settings (this is without the nvidia effects toggled on.)\n\nPerformance Impressions: The games open world looks good, not great.  That said for a game that looks like this it should not have my framerate stuttering all over the place at times. Other open world games like the recent The Witcher 3 actually look more impressive in many aspects compared to Batman Arkham Knight, and perform way more stable. I think the stability and the game being locked to 30fps is a very telling sign that this port was - nay - IS rushed without all the bells and whistles you would hope for in a next gen PC title.\n\nI will update this review later with a video with my gameplay performance using the 970. Thanks for reading and I am hoping to have more detailed impression as the night progresses. As of now I feel a bit bamboozled out of shelling out money for this, yea you can fly and punch baddies like before and its open world.... but it just doesn't look or perform like a next gen title should even with the Nvidia fluff on. The Witcher 3, really made my standards of PC gaming high, not only in a gameplay aspect but graphically speaking as well.\n\nGame feels really good when its WORKING and smooth. Heck I even had tons of fun just doing donuts and seeing the smoke effects in the batmobile at 20fps glory. For what its worth, I quite like the batmobile segments. You can cruise through walls, call it in to literally steam roll a group of bad guys, and it doubles as a freaking tank with eye popping particle effects.\n\nThe combat is tight and responsive as ever, however the performance just bogs the game down way too much for me to say that this game is an instant buy right now.  Couple this with the widely known game hindering DRM Denuvo, it is just mind boggling, companies continue to support DRM practices that hinder their own game and risk the games integrity in order to make another buck or two. All signs point to Rocksteady rushing this port out.\n\nUpdate 1: Game port was outsourced to a company named Iron Galaxy.  Well, there it is.\nUpdate 2: Last update for the night its 4am! Uploaded a quick video of the gameplay, take care for now my fellow Dark Knights.\nUpdate 3: Supposedly new Nvidia drivers are out today - will try them out and let you guys know if anything changes.\nUpdate 4 June 24th: Thanks for everyone being informed gamers and doing their research. It is my hope as well not to only get a better product I paid for and was eagerly awaiting for just like you, but to help set a precedent for future PC titles from big pubs/devs. PC gamers should not be treated like second class citizens.  We pay for digital titles that we can't sell back unlike console players, and are often left mercy to the corporations (its what they are) to fix their games.  We aren't guaranteed anything, thankfully Valve is now accepting refunds and reports of customers from thid party vendors like GMG are now willing to process refunds.\n\nThis is great news for us PC gamers. We have no excuses anymore but ourselves if we continue to support faulty products even if we are given the chance to get a refund. While I am dissapointed with this port, without problems like this, we as customers would continue to be treated in such a manner and there would be no progress.\n\nI am willing to give Rocksteady/ Iron Galaxy one chance, since they know and openly admitted to screwing up this port - thats a lot more than what Ubisoft ever did for their scam on Assasins Creed Unity for many of us.  I will continue to post my impressions of the game and keep you guys up to date, as well post a follow up to the performance after the next patch. Iron Galaxy/Rocksteady, take your time - please don't rush the patch just like you did with this port. For myself personally this is your last chance.\nUpdate 5: Rocksteady has issued a public statement saying they are pulling the game digitally.  In the meantime I plan on finishing the game for the review, and will post my impressions on the patch when it comes out.","June 22, 2015","false","30.8"," 1,508 of 1,675 people (90%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","90","508","1","80","34"

Horrible stuttering where the framerate is anywhere between 60 and 3  FPS when I glide or drive on my Radeon 290x.\n2. 30 FPS Lock on a PC release is unforgivable.\n3. NVIDIA Game Works things hammered in that makes the performance of AMD cards worse, Thanks for being a part of the team NVIDIA and Rocksteady.\n4. Price of the Season Pass is too high for the amount of content that has been revealed to be included.\n5. The native Anti-Aliasing in the game options still gives the game horrible jaggies. The option is either on or off for it.\n6. Not many graphical options, and those there are makes little to no differance to the performance.\n\nCannot recommend at it's current state.

It's the year 2015 ffs a 30fps cap is not acceptable, especially for one of the biggest releases of the year on PC.\n\nSLI is broken, along with the low-res textures/assets, streaming issues and stuttering, there is NO Ambient Occlusion in the PC version at all, rain effects/shaders are also missing that are in the console versions, just check some comparisons that are starting to pop-up. The bloody game crashes after exiting, every time. The PC graphics options are woeful, not to mention all you get are "Low" and "Normal" textures, that's it...really? Even at 4k there is aliasing/shimmering, and it just emphasizes the other graphical anomalies. I've never had this many technical issues with a PC game.\n\nAlso, for a game that was heavily plugged by Nvidia and makes use of Gameworks, why is there no Arkham Knight "Graphics, Performance and Tweaking Guide" that Nvidia routinely does for all the big game releases on their Geforce website? They did one for GTA V, Witcher 3 and Dying Light, so surely Arkham Knight warranted one? They obviously knew this PC port was a steaming pile of crap and they've tried to hide it as much as they could before release. There were no PC reviews before release either, all reviews were on the PS4 version apparently.\n\nDo not buy this game in it's current shape.

Given this game runs on Unreal Engine 3, an engine pushing over 11 years old at this point, it has performance that makes GTA IV run like any Source game in comparison.\n\nRocksteady have in the past demonstrated great optimisation in previous titles. My old laptop, which ran a GT 555m graphics card could maintain 60 fps in Arkham Asylum on the highest settings. This game, on my GTX 970 (which is one of the top 10 best graphics cards currently on the market) can barely push 40 fps stationary, and between 5-30 whilst moving. Good thing we got that enhanced NVIDIA driver to improve our performance!\n\nI think the worst part is that graphics wise, its not really much of an improvement over its predecessors. The post processing effects look really nice, and the rain effects are pretty gorgeous, but the overall texture and model quality just barely look better than Arkham Asylum, and that game came out NEARLY SIX YEARS AGO.\n\nI cannot recommend this to anyone until they fix the performance issues.

Been gaming since Atari 2600 and this gen has just been full of lies, fake "real-time" in-game footage (sleazy marketing swines) by publishers and Nvidia, and blatant false advertising - this is all besides the nickel and diming of microtransactions and chopped games to sell DLC.\n\nEnough is enough.  This was it for me, especially after taking time off work for this launch, paying for what I expect to be a working product (as advertised and flaunted by puclishers/Nvidia as high performance graphical tech), and spending these AAA launch days extremely frustraed just trying to get them running at a barely decent playable level rather than enjoying playing the game.  Giving them our money for broken products is unacceptable and the FTC should step in at this point to assist with consumer rights.\n\nI NEVER preorder yet I allowed everyone's hype to convinced me to do so.

Negative words about the game mean technical state of PC version of Batman: Arkham Knight at the moment of the launch. All the information I refer to can be easily checked on the internet, I give almost no references here.\n\nWhat Happened?I'm sure I can not write what happen at the launch of Batman AK on PC. In a nutshell: crashes, stuttering and terrible performance issues overall (even on the best systems, on both AMD and Nvidia setups), 30 FPS cap, texture and visual effects issues and so on. Of course, it was reflected in tons of negative feedback from community and press. Steam Store had superior percentage of negative reviews. The game was pulled from sale on Steam which never ever happened before as far as I know. Users were offered to refund the game and Green Man Gaming (games online store) even started refunds for BAK though they don't do it on regular basis as it's stated in their Terms and Conditions and Refund Policy.\n\nWho to Blame?Much sh*t was poured on Rocksteady (BAK developers) and on "external PC development partner" Iron Galaxy Studios (studio that ported the game to PC). It's clear that the first were responsible for the game in general and console versions of it in particular and Rocksteady did its job quite good as far as I'm concerned. IGS is made guilty more often (they were doing PC version of the game, at least), but I refuse to do so. They're experienced[en.wikipedia.org] enough in developing, porting and assisting in porting games for various platforms. They ported Bioshock: Infinite to PC and The Handsome Collection (Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel) to PS4 and XBox One after all. I wouldn't judge them unless I knew the conditions they were set and time they were given to do their job.\n\nBut I know who to blame for sure - Batman Arkham Knight publisher Warner Bros.\n\nQuick FactsWB made decision to have console versions of the game as primary ones (which is, sadly, a common practice nowadays) and to outsource porting to PC. It didn't happen to previous Batman games made by Rocksteady. Quite likely this decision was made just to save money on PC version because sales on PC are lower comparing to consoles.\nWB didn't give much sh*t about testing the game on PC. Anonymous sources say PC version of BAK was tested by 10% of sources (while PC is more complex than consoles) and in 720p. Standard resolution for PC gamers, right?\nWB took decision to protect their crap that can't hold even 30 FPS with Denuvo[en.wikipedia.org] anti-tamper technology. No comments.\nWB as a publisher is responsible for what they ship to customers. They decide when it's ready for release. They can delay the release (like it happened to GTA V PC or Witcher 3). And they knew the crap they had been releasing on PC. Undoubtedly. But they still did it. Shameless ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nWB f*cked up MK X launch as well. And its PC Version was also outsourced. What a coincidence, right?\nFinal WordsWarner Bros. made the ultimate slap to all PC gamers' faces and showed their attitude to us. I suggest you to pay them the same coin and blacklist them as a publisher. And you should definitely refund the game (if you haven't done it before). Have done it right after finished writing this.\n\nAs P.S. I will leave this TotalBiscuit's video about why you should never pre-order games:\nhttp://youtu.be/mf5Uj4XIT1Y\nThanks for reading my "review".

Who cares about the 30FPS cap because that's an easy fix in the .ini files. The stuttering and freezing, however, happens even on the lowest settings, and it is unfixable. I've never played a game with stuttering this bad before, and I've played games with a dying GPU.\n\nI'm giving this game the two weeks before I refund it, which I probably can't due to it being from a third-party. My review will change when the game is playable.\n\nEDIT 2: I recently had to upgrade my video card from an nVidia GTX 680 2gb to a GTX 970 4gb. Does the game run any better? Sort of.. The stutter issues don't happen so immediate, though they start appearing after extended play. Plus, with this video card, there should be no reason for these low framerates on "normal" settings in an Unreal Engine 3 game.\n\nEDIT 3: Thanks to the new video card, I've been able to play it a little more and I've discovered the Harley Quinn DLC can be completed in a mere 19 minutes.

The FPS is locked to 30 by default and suffers dips to the single digits when moving fast due to what I suspect to be a texture streaming issue, while there is an option to unlock it, it's best left on as it creates instabilities and the constant drops from 60 FPS to 10 - 20 FPS make for an annoying experience. I hope the Steam refund is used in wide effect, this trend of games launching in such state is getting rather tiresome.\n\nThe game itself is mediocre - featuring the same overly simple, monotonous combat from the previous installments and most of the same gadgets only this time you get access to the Bat Mobile, which does create a few cool moments but soon becomes extremely repetitive when you're forced to use it on nearly every mission in the game. The voice acting is horrible, beyond the 'so bad it's good' mark, it comes across as tired and uninspired where the characters in-game sound like they care little for the current situation with a stiff, almost sarcastic tone and hardly ever fits the mood of the moment at hand.  The world features some nice design choices and looks pretty good in my opinion, the aesthetics of the game are not too shabby either.\n\nThe plot is laughably bad, this is lower grade writing defined - not that I care much for it in most games, but in a game like this that's heavily narrative driven it's... bad. The characters are pretty dull and generic too, along with their cringe worthy dialogue that makes for plenty of moments where you're likely to let out a sigh, it's as if they read a few comic books, watched some of the movies & cartoons and took the cheesiest, most generic lines they could find and threw them in there.\n\nWhile this is essentially the same Batman game as before and you're likely to find some enjoyment out of it if you don't mind the monotony of being forced to use the Batmobile for a good portion of the game and if you really liked the other ones and are a fan of Batman in general, I'd recommend waiting atleast a year for them to iron this mess out and get a version inclusive with the swamp of DLCs planned - I,myself, will never buy anything from this studio again, their attitude is awful and they clearly shafted PC gamers to the bottom of the pedestal, like most AAA devs of this era do.","June 24, 2015","false","9.6"," 183 of 213 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","183","213","7","1"

There's plenty of reviews covering those*\n\nI got Arkham Asylum when it came out. One of my favorite games, ever. Same with Arkham City. I beat both of those games on PS3, and beat AA again on PC and will do City on PC shortly, and I rarely re-beat games.\n\nI don't know what happened to Arkham Knight. There are no boss battles in this game. None. There are a few souped up tanks/helicopters you fight with the Batmobile that could qualify as a boss battle, but there are not any actual hand to hand combat boss battles. You have no boss battle with Arkham Knight. You have no boss battle with Scarecrow. You have no boss battle with Harley Quinn, or Penguin, or Deathstroke. Why? Back in City/Asylum, Mr. Freeze is considered one of the best boss battles of all time. Ra Al Guul, Poision Ivy, EXCELLENT battles. You have almost a century's worth of material from films, games, comics, and tv shows to look for inspiration to how a 1v1 boss battle could be played out. Why are these not there? Like what a stupid design decision. I guess that's the most jarring part is just that there's just no good reason to not put them in. it's not like there were time/money constraints. As I said you have Batmobile boss battles where you fight unique tanks and what not. Why not allocate some of those sources to a real battle? I mean really, there was no Arkham Knight boss battle? None? And with the backstory they gave the guy, there is no reason he wouldn't have been able to have a huge epic fight with Batman. It's just so stupid.\n\nAlso, the story. The story is really good at some points. But I kinda wonder if there isn't some DC Executive ♥♥♥♥in with the stories cause he thinks he knows what he's doing better than Rocksteady. because Joker steals the show. again. Yes I know he died at the end of City. I know Rocksteady confirmed that absolutely Joker would not be in the game. Well, they lied. Joker's in the game, and he has more recorded dialogue than Scarecrow and Arkham Knight combined.\n\nThe Batmobile segments weren't bad in theory. I don't know why people say the Batmobile is tough to control, I think it's very smooth. The combat of it, in theory, is complex, strategic, and fun. It has a variety of fun weapons to play with.\n\nExcept all the actual fights with the Batmobile were just incredibly uninspired. Like with the exception of two fights, the dozens of tank fights in the game is just you in an empty area with a bunch of takes. Hit 'Fire' and strafe until everything stops moving. There's no 'tactical' way to assert the situations. You just strafe and ♥♥♥♥. the AI is also incredibly unfair at somepoints. basically, the way enemy tanks attack is that shoot in a straight line, and it's telegraphed for ~1 sec by an indicator line from the tank that traces the hits area of effect. Sometimes, when you're fighting 50+ tanks simultaneously (which btw sounds epic but is really just tedious) you see the lines pop up and there is LITERALLY (i used that in the traditional, non hyperbolic meaning) no way you could possibly dodge. Not that you can't react fast enough. I mean there is literally no possible button input in which you could possibly dodge some of the ♥♥♥♥ thrown at you. None nada. It doesn't happen often, it's the result of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ deal of the RNG, since attacks are more aimed at the Batmobile's general area rather than right at you. but still just stupid. Part of the problem also is it's almost like Rocksteady thinks that every time you fight a big crowd as Batman, there has to be some complimentary batmobile fight/segment. No, there doesn't. When you show some intimidating crowd attacking Batman, you don't need to do a tank squadron right after. Geez, why does this have to be explained? Why would you think this? That's like fanfiction logic.\n\nNow the actual hand to hand combat was really done well. It was very refined, and it's not just Arkham City with new attacks/enemies. The core gameplay is the same, but it's done in a way where you handle situations a lot differently than you would in AC. It feels inspired, like they had ideas about the combat that they were excited about implementing. For example, you get a voice sysnthesizer that can be used to direct an enemy to a certain location by a false voice of their commander. It makes you rethink the way Predator encounters are done. There's a LOT of nice touches like that.\n\nOverall, get this game if you liked the other Arkham games, but do not expect the holy pinnacle of the Batman series. Just expect some more Arkham style mayhem that can be frustrating but usually fun. If you haven't played any other Arkham games, go get Arkham City or Asylum. This and Origins are the ones who to save for those who really liked the previous 2 and want more.","June 27, 2015","false","43.2"," 312 of 411 people (76%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","76","312","411","18","22"

I have had several issues with this game so far and here is the list:\n\nGraphics are lacking; it could have been much better for PC. However, the console versions look great.\nPerformance tends to drop when moving through one city to another.\nSometimes turning off VSync and AA improves performance, but not by much.\nWhen racing through tracks, using the Riddler Blocker tends to pause the game every half second that it's activated. Unsure if that is input lag according to the controller.\nStuttering occurs frequently in the game when moving throughout for some, even that it becomes unplayable for some who first drive the batmobile.\nVsync locks it to 30 frames which signifies poor performance and/or implementation.\nMy advice: Wait for a patch and more reviews to release, but skip for now if you have a minimum-requirement computer. A future review may be in the works later down the line. I'll update the review as I go along with further updates and announcements.\n\n6/27/15 UPDATE #1: An announcement has been posted stating that Rocksteady and Iron Galaxy Studios are now focusing on the performance and graphical fidelity for the PC version.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aplexsys/recommended/208650/","aplexsys","Proxy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aplexsys/","81 products in account","I'll add my two cents to the flame.\n\nI'm a batman fan. I've read pretty much all the modern comics with his appearances, watched films, played the games, watched tv shows.\n\nSo imagine my excitement with the announcement of this game.\n\nI have an AMD FX-8370 with a GTX 970. 8GB RAM. I run games like The Witcher 3 at max, save for hairworks and a notch lower on shadows and foilage. I've never seen a framedrop, even in Novigrad. That should demonstrate that there isn't anything wrong with my system. I've run taxing tests to be sure using different benchmark utilities, and I get within the same ballpark as other recorded scores of this video card.\n\nI don't think PC games can be expected to run 100% amazing right out of the box. It's a difficult thing to accomplish. With the numerous different PC configurations that everybody around the world has, it's an undertaking that few games have managed to accomplish. Of course, it's absolutely fantastic if they do, but I don't hate it when a couple of ini tweaks are necessary for smooth gameplay. It's the nature of the beast. That being said, the lack of a bloody slider for mouse sensitivity is pretty stupid. The previous games in the series didn't even have that, if I'm remembering correctly. Even with my tolerance for doing fixes on my own, this is one of the worst that I've seen.\n\nI've tried everything. I've even given up the dream of a full 60 frames per second, and used that terrible recommendation that they posted on their forums: Telling users that don't have a 980 to run all the settings at normal. I couldn't even maintain a stable 30 framerate with those settings. I've tried numerous ini tweaks outlined in the steam forums, none of which, unfortunately, seem to make a difference. I jacked the ini file that the tweak guide author posted on pastebin and tried that (even though I essentially copied his guide to begin with). Didn't work.\n\nThe bottom-line is that this game doesn't work properly for the vast majority of players. Of course, there are outliers out there, who claim to be able to run the game great. Do I think they're lying? No. Maybe their configuration just works better than the rest of us for whatever reason. But there's no denying that the vast majority of players, even with good builds, are unable to run this game at a stable framerate.\n\nI bought the game on GMG, so a steam refund isn't applicable to me. Luckily, GMG, bless their souls, has stated that if the issues aren't fixed by the next patch, they'll issue refunds to everybody who bought from them.\n\nAll I wanted to do was play as the ♥♥♥♥ing batman.\n\nEdit: With the new patch, 30 fps lock is now playable.

The year is 2015. I disabled the 30fps cap and the game bounces between 30fps and 60fps to the point at which it's unplaybable, and don't tell me the game is playable at 30fps, I KNOW it is, but guess what, my rig cost me $1600, it can run Far Cry 4 in 4k on ultra settings at a stable 60fps, I should be able to run Arkham Knight just as well. I didn't spend that money to get a copy of a game that runs worse then it does on a glorified shoebox that's only good for casual gamers and people who like exclusives (I am the latter). Just because it would run better on my PS4 doesn't mean I should just fork up $60 for the title just to see it run at 30fps at 1080p with low to medium textures, which by the way are all that you can basically use in the game, because not enough time was put into the PC port. Luckily I merely got this game for free for buying my GTX 970s, but even then this feels like a ripoff. I'll repeat that. This game is so poorly optimized for PC that I got it for FREE, and I still feel like it was a bad deal. I'm waiting for a patch to decide whether or not to uninstall this game from my 2 terabyte hard drive which, shocker, there's still plenty of space on. It's not that this is a bad game as far as gameplay goes, which speaking honestly is the most important aspect of a game, so is it fair for me to give this title a fully negative review? No. But at this point I cannot suggest to anybody to buy this game on any platform if you care about the PC community, because people that want to pay top dollar for the best product should GET the best product. That's how capitalism has always worked, and another pillar of it is that we all vote with our wallets. So please PC community, for the love of all that is holy, do not buy this title on PC. If you want to stop production companies like WB and Ubisoft from putting out games that don't have good PC ports, then don't buy them. I don't care how much you want to be batman, go back and play Arkham City if you care that much. This game is not worth $60, I honestly feel like I should be compensated for even spending any time trying to get this game to run as it should on my PC. I understand some people will see my viewpoint as unreasonable, and I completely understand, but I entirely refuse to accept that this is the best that a large scale video game production company can do. I'm aware that they outsourced this to the same people that screwed up Arkham Origins, I don't blame the company that did the port I blame Warner Bros. for choosing them and pushing them to meet a deadline that they clearly couldn't. This entire situation infuriates me, and I have no doubt that another such game will come along in a few months and do the same. But for now Warner Bros. has my full attention and hatred. Please heed my words, and consider what is best for the PC community. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. Pretty please. With sprinkles on top. Screw Warner Bros. With love, cleanshot.","June 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 217 of 301 people (72%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","72","217","301","20","21"

While mouse and keyboard controls are not the worst, they could be better. I ended up switching to a controller and the game did seem to play more smooth.\n\nAMD users got the short end of the stick yet again so they will have to wait for a patch which is getting quite old to be honest, Witcher 3, Project CARS and now Batman: Arkham Knight.\n\nThe FPS cap can be tweaked in the ini files which does help the game run more smooth so I would reccomend trying that, the cutscenes are also locked at 30 fps so it will stutter during cutscenes. But just looks like a re-skinned (horribly optimized) version of all the previous games running on the exact same engine.\n\nC'mon rocksteady.... really?\n\nOne thing I have not seen anyone talk about is SLI, and I have had major SLI issues with the game, all them come while running the nvidia gameworks settings turned on. While the game does perform better it also has much bigger downsides, ntdll.dll crashes for some, lots of random flickering in the screen for me that did not happen when SLI was turned off. Some SLI users (myself included) have even gotten the always fun BSOD. Oh, and 4K has had some serious reported issues that make the game unplayable and I'm sure there are many more yet to be discovered. Turning SLI off and running on one of the two GTX 970's seems to have removed some of these problems.\n\nPros:\nUpgraded combat\nBatmobile - fun to use\nNew bat-tools to use in game\n\nCons:\nBad performance\nUnnecessary fps lock\nLack of in game options to help with performance\nBad port\nBatmobile - will kill whatever fps you have left\n\nIn the current sate of the game maybe a 3.5/10\n\nAfter more testing, few things to add:\n\nSLI is broken for most people, try to stay away.\nTry rolling back Nvidia drivers to the pre arkham drivers as that seemed to help some people, myself inculded, until batmobile arrives.\nRunning as admin seemed to help if you havent already tried this.\nStill getting random crashes which is annoying.\n\nOn a positive note the combat is outright glorious, best combat in any game that features a combat system like this.\n\nWill review again after we get an update, hopefully they get it right so I can recommend it.","June 22, 2015","false","4.9"," 78 of 93 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","78","93","3","0"

It seems Batman: Arkham Knight will be another exception but for different reasons. I actually loved Origins despite its flaws but the more I think about this title... the more I realize it was a chore to play. Keep in mind I got the premium edition (base game + all DLC) for ~$24 USD off of Bundlestars when they were having a sale too.\n\nI've got 149 hours and while I can say I've definitely got my money's worth, I can't say this is a good game. Before I cover the issues that annoyed me, I'd like to go over the positives first.\n\nFor starters, this game looks amazing -- there's no doubt about it. I've never seen an Unreal Engine 3 game that looks like this and I'm not just talking about the facial animations and expressions, I'm talking about everything. Another area the game excelled in was voice acting. Most characters were well cast and Kevin Conroy as Batman and a certain someone definitely were at the top of their game here. Also worth mentioning is the good twists and "gotcha!" moments that totally caught me off guard. The soundtrack was similarly great and hit most of the right notes, making me almost cry in one scene. Building off what Arkham City gave us, we get even more combat moves and ways to initiate a silent takedown. Not only that, we finally get to drive around in the batmobile and tear down the streets in it. I can't downplay how exciting it is to hop into this awesome vehicle the first time and then find out it's a tank! Yes, the batmobile can transform in a matter of seconds into a tank which the game calls "Battle mode". There's tons of stuff you can do while in this mode and it's all really exciting stuff.\n\nBatmobile aside, there's no shortage of side missions and other little diversions happening while you fly around the map such as: thugs driving around in cars like hooligans or riots happening on the streets. If you've got the season pass there's also a ton of different batmobiles that you can test drive with authentic sounds and multiple characters you can play as in the AR challenges. My fondest memories are of playing the Adam West race tracks while hearing the TV show's theme song and playing as characters like Harley Quinn and Red Hood because of how unique they are. The best part of this game would have to be Photo Mode though. This wasn't even part of the base game upon launch but it was later added as a free update. A good 1/4 of my screenshots for this game were done in photo mode and what makes it great to use is that you can pause the game at any time, choose "Photo Mode" from the pause menu, manipulate the camera angles, slap on a filter, zoom in or zoom out, choose a border, and do it all in a way that's really easy to use. You end up getting some great looking screenshots like the one below. But unfortunately... all of this isn’t enough.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=655193795\n\nEven though I’d say this is the best Arkham game for role-playing as Batman... there's such a thing as less is more. And damn does this apply to Arkham Knight. The batmobile's undoubtedly great but because the story mode over relies on it, the fun factor disappears. Tank battle after tank battle and the game doesn't give up. Maybe I'm exaggerating but I reckon a good half of this game is spent in the batmobile. Winch this, dodge these tanks and blow them up (it feels like an arcade game at times honestly), drive around and use this feature from the batmobile… and repeat. I really think the batmobile should've been optional and not forced in the way that it is. The batmobile just feels a bit too destructive at times as well. I laughed as I mowed over people and slammed into buildings leaving nothing but debris. In addition to all of what I've said, the batmobile reduces the rather cool boss fights that we had in previous games to... yep, you guessed it... tank battles.\n\nWant to battle Deathstroke? Tank battle. Want to battle the Arkham Knight? Tank battle. Want to battle Firefly? Batmobile pursuit (okay it's a bit different but still not much fun). It just shows a lack of creativity. Other side missions? Disabling bombs safely and destroying APC military vehicles. How? I won't even go there. Even some of The Riddler missions - one of my favourite Batman villains - are almost crippled because of this. I won't spoil anything but The Riddler has basically set up race tracks for your batmobile and you have to get to the finish line in time. Yay? Writing this just makes me upset at all the lost potential here (even a lot of the non-batmobile missions and sidemissions lack fun for some reason). I get Rocksteady wanted to spoil us with the batmobile as well as a large cast of villains but it came at the cost of quality and most of the game just feels extremely repetitive.\n\nNext is the story. The writing here is noticeably weaker than any of the other Arkham games (might be because Paul Dini left) and the story has too many plot holes for my liking. Not to mention the identity of one of the villains in this game is incredibly easy to guess. There's a ridiculous amount of foreshadowing and what could've been a powerful reveal is mostly uneventful. Besides that, to get the “True Ending” players are forced to beat every side mission and get 243/243 riddles. The true ending doesn’t even answer a lot of questions or provide much closure but locking something like this behind riddles is a very silly move. Thankfully there’s a 242/243 savegame on PCGamingWiki if you don’t feel up to the task. On the port side of things, the game runs mostly decent but I had some issues that need to be addressed. The first: unlocking certain Steam achievements will actually make the game freeze for a second or two every time you satisfy the criteria once more for that achievement. I’m not joking. It’s all to do with the PCEngine.ini file. The second: I had around 13 crashes total across my playtime but 8 of those were in the same part of the story (analysing the crash site of a vehicle for someone that was kidnapped). You might not experience it, but it too has been another reported issue that remains unfixed.\n\n\nOther negatives include the "Arkham episodes". 6 characters have a DLC mission made for them but 5 of them can be finished in less than 10 minutes. I could probably forgive this but these missions are divided into 3 sections with 3 short cutscenes usually. Combat room, predator room, combat room or the other way around, but I don't think that's worth applauding. Batgirl's DLC is fortunately 1 hour and man is it a good piece of DLC in the way that Cold, Cold Heart was for Batman: Arkham Origins. Season of Infamy is also good but not worth the $10. Moving onto AR challenges… most of them aren't tailored for every character. You'll notice this with someone like Harley Quinn where there's a lack of things for her to climb or jump up to. When it comes to combat, a lot of characters share a ridiculous amount of moves. Lastly, thug voiceovers are reused for most of the characters and maybe one line for some is changed. A good example would be "Batman's not going to save you now Robin!". For Nightwing? "Batman's not going to save you now Nightwing!". It's especially bad when these lines repeat over and over more than they ever did in Arkham City. Certain AR challenges have bugs where thugs stand still and do nothing. Other maps are just unfair and weren't made in mind with the current combat system (Iceberg Lounge and Catwoman's Revenge). I’ll stop here….\n\nI've written an essay but all I’ll say is this: the PC port's better now but this game is easily the weakest in this series. If I wasn't a person with a lot of patience and/or a hardcore achievement collector, I don't think I would've made it far into this game. 4.5/10.","April 27","false","149.4"," 171 of 237 people (72%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","72","171","237","16","49"

First of all, the framerate is capped at 30(!) fps. Great job devs, especially for a 2015 game. You can unlock it via the .ini file though, so let's ingnore this for now.\n\nI am launching the game again ready to enjoy glorious 60 fps gameplay...\nNOT! Even with all the gameworks crap turned off, i am getting dips to sub 30's while driving, gliding and various other situations making it pretty much unplayable at times. The graphics quality doesn't justify such terrible performance, i can't even imagine how the game runs on lower spec systems. Trying to tune the settings does little to no difference at all. Gpu usage in afterburner is unstable during gameplay from 40% to 80% which indicates the game is poorly coded and cant ulitilize gpus properly. Before you say my cpu is bottleneching my gpu, there are guys in the forums with latest oc'd intel cpus and TitanX facing the same issues.\n\nRocksteady already admitted here http://community.wbgames.com/t5/Support-for-PC/PC-Performance-issues-we-hear-you/m-p/571341#U571341 that they tossed the pc version of the game to an "external PC development partner" so you can understand how much they appreciate us.\n\nUpdate 25/6:\nWell, apparently WarnerBros halted sales of the game until it is fixed. You can thank steam's new refund policy for that because i highly doubt they would do such a move with the old, no-refund system. I want to be positive that we will get the pc version that we deserve but I still advice everyone who is eligible to get a refund and wait until the game's new release. If it works properly, you can just buy it again. If it's not, you can tell them to f*ck off and move on.

This port was poorly done. Controls are weird (Press 1 ten times to use a batmobile weapon, press alt+1 for a takedown, press Unasigned for combo batarang), they didn't even bother. I have a mouse with programable keys, so I could use those, but it should come to that.\n\nThe batmobile is pretty cool at first, but it becomes a burden as you need it for almost everything you do. Drones was their response to the whole "Batman doens't kill" discussion, but you now have to battle wave after wave of drones, even in some boss battles that should have been the highlights of the game.\n\nArkham City took Arkham Assylum and made it better, but Arkham Knight just couldn't do the same.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trevellian/recommended/208650/","Trevellian","Trevellian[C22]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trevellian/","633 products in account","Let me preface this by saying I only recommend this game if you are invested in the trilogy's story, because it does end the trilogy and the story did have it's moments.  But as an overall game, it gets a C+ in comparison to Arkham City's A+ in my books.\n\nThis review is not about the ineptitude and failure to deliver a good port, or how the game runs.  Because for me the game ran perfectly fine.  I have a system that could run it at 60fps just fine.  I was one of the lucky ones.\n\nTherefore I waited until I completed the game, and this will be a review of the actual game itself, and will contain spoilers.  For Knight and for Arkham City, maybe a little for Asylum, because I have to make this comparison.\n\nIf you were to ask me which of the Arkham games was the best.  Far and away it would be City.  Knight in comparison feels, lazy, and the Batmobile segments feel forced, far too often do you use the Batmobile for miniscule things, like Riddler tasks.  Why would the Riddler design a underground racetrack for the Batmobile?  His entire premise is about Riddles.\n\nSo why you ask is City a better game.  Well.  The Boss Battles.  Not only did City make you "Feel" like the Batman, it made some of it's most distinguished villains feel memorable.  Bane in Asylum was a good, classic, Nintendo era style boss fight.  Dodge him a few times, nail him in the back with Batarangs, take him on and rip his hoses out.  Freeze in City is by far one of the better boss fights I've ever played in a game.  I've never fought a boss that would actually block off a method of taking him on after you used it before.  Solomon Grundy in City, much like Bane from Asylum, was a big brute you had to dodge a lot and actually fight.  Even Ra's Al Ghul himself in City, or Clayface in City.  Were far and away, better than any boss you will fight in Arkham Knight.\n\nThis is why City is the better game.  Compare those fights in City to what you get in Knight.  Your first fight with the Arkham Knight is in a bloody tank.  He doesn't even fight you himself, he sits in a tank.  Yes, this is the first use of the Batmobile gimmick.  You continue to play along, man, doesn't seem to be many bosses in this game... oh wait heres the Second Encounter with the Arkham Knight.  Guess what?  He's in a bigger ♥♥♥♥ing bloody tank that can drill underground, which you run from in the Batmobile gimmick 3 more times.  Awesome, done with that.  Time to rescue Gordon.  Heres out first encounter with the Red Hood, unmasked lazily Jason Todd is the Arkham Knight, woo way to throw a twist in there Rocksteady.  Red Hood isn't even a boss, he's 4 glorified Predator rooms linked together to defeat him... thats it.  Thats the last you'll see of the Red Hood till the end of the game.  What a boss fight.  So The Arkham Knight/Red Hood is gone, so who takes over for him? Good old Deathstroke, but don't worry, you won't get to actually fight Deathstroke. They recycle the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Tank encounter you had with the Knight the first time for this lazily thought out "Boss Battle".  And I'm not even going to spoiler tag this, I'm going to spell it out for you clearly, THERE IS NO FINAL BOSS BATTLE IN THIS GAME.  You never fight Crane.  You go to him for the final moment of the game,  You do actually fight the "Fear Toxin" and Lock away Joker in your head but there is literally no satisfying boss fight in this game.  At all.\n\nI wanted to like Knight, and I enjoyed my time in Gotham City doing all of the various tasks.  But even those Tasks.  Where you capture the other big name villains in the game like Two-Face, Penguin, Firefly, Pyg, Riddler, Deathstroke.  Not a single one of them, in any shape or form, has a memorable boss fight.  They are bullet points at the end of a task list.  You finish 100% of the tasks in their chain and you capture them pretty much effortlessly.  This is absolutely disappointing and lazy.  They are Supervillains.  They are Batman's most lethal and ruthless adversaries.  And they turned them into fetch tasks.\n\nThere where other things missing from this game.  These 2 bothered me the most.  The Duel Stealth Takedown option is gone.  Replaced with the Fear Takedown.  Thats great, I can Chain Takedown 5 guys (At max'd skill)... but I have to do it loud.  So if I sneak up on two guys who don't notice me, can I stealth takedown them?  Nope, I can Fear takedown them, loudly.... Why did Batman forget how to stealth takedown two guys?  Why was it necessary for him to forget how to do one essential Batman thing to learn how to do another?  That is ridiculous.  The other major thing missing from the game is the ability to freeroam as the other characters like you could in City after completeing the story.  Or any Predator/Wave room challenges with the other characters in the game.  Nightwing, Robin, Red Hood, Harley, Azrael, Catwoman... all Playable during the game at some point, or in the case of Harley and Red Hood DLC, but I can't take them for a spin anywhere else?  Come on Rocksteady.\n\nMy advice to you is, if you want to play a Batman game, go back and play Arkham City.  Play a Batman game done right.  I love Rocksteady and I respect the ♥♥♥♥ out of what they did for Batman in the video game universe and the fact they tried to up the scale each and every game.  But the lack of anything memorable in Knight will forever be a stain on this series.","July 1, 2015","false","37.5"," 137 of 187 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","137","187","12","14"

Given that the initial release of Batman: Arkham Knight back in June last year was so catastrophic the publisher had to pull it from sale for six months I would not have recommended Arkham Knight back then unless it was heavily discounted and it would have been laced with some serious caveats to take into consideration. While technically the last few patches have gone to great lengths to stabilize the game - reports are that the game still suffers from audio glitches on certain systems as well freezing on some mechanical hard drives. Just to be on the safe side I installed the game on my SSD so I can't report about performance on mechanical HDD's so take that into consideration when purchasing. Also Arkham Knight does not (as far as I am aware) officially support cards in SLI or CROSSFIRE. Make sure you take this into consideration if you plan on running the game with either setup. While some players are reporting that it works fine, majority are saying that it doesn't so take heed.\n\nFor this review I ran the game on a MSI laptop with 16GB memory, 680M mobile GPU with 4GB video memory and i7-3630QM. As you can see I am running the game on a very outdated mobile chip and in order to maintain 30FPS I had to drop the resolution to 1600 x 900 with most of the settings disabled except for textures which I set to high. For the most part Arkham Knight ran perfectly fine at a stable 30FPS although driving around Gotham City in the batmobile or gliding around the city using your cape would often result in the game dropping to around 22-25FPS depending on the area. Given that I am running the game on a card way below minimum spec I suppose I can't complain too much.\n\nArkham Asylum was one of my favorite games from the previous generation (in fact it was my GOTY for 2009) so like many I was incredibly sad to hear Rocksteady announce during development that they would be moving away from the franchise once the game was completed (Edit: they did later hint that they may make another one in future) yet high with keen anticipation to dive into their final take on DC comics most famous Superhero, The Dark Knight. While the move to an open world setting hasn't exactly sat very well with me (I much preferred the tight focus Arkham Asylum employed that held players in a vice-like grip than the sprawling Arkham City where it was very easy to get caught up in all the games side quest busy work that I felt detracted from the games main narrative). If you chose to ignore all the padding - Arkham City was still a terrific adventure that helped solidify the franchises popularity. By the time Arkham Origins rolled around I was left feeling rather underwhelmed especially by Warner's copy and paste job that took all the things I didn't enjoy about Arkham City and amplified them. Arkham Origins was unfortunately also a buggy mess that still to this day suffers from some annoying bugs that got sidelined in favor of a DLC roll-out plan. Sadly it looks like Arkham Knight will be joining Arkham Origins when it comes to fixes vs DLC.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545931725\nArkham Knight is once again at its strongest when you ignore the overabundance of meaningless altercations with the cities criminal underbelly, which sadly also includes far too many laborious altercations with an army of hostile mercenaries assembled by one of the games main villains, the Arkham Knight himself. The main story thread which centers around Batman trying to stop Scarecrow from deploying a viscous toxin that turns the cities residents into murderous thugs is in my opinion the strongest story of the entire Rocksteady franchise. The main plot is incredibly serpentine with a mystery-writers list of red herrings and shock surprises that definitely kept me on my toes eager to see how it would all eventually pan out. As a word of warning it's probably best you complete Arkham Asylum and Arkham City first as the story takes strong narrative ques from the first two games and is essentially an ending to the plotline that was initiated by Arkham Asylum. While not necessarily essential that you complete both adventures your enjoyment of the third and final act will be tempered by your knowledge of what transpired before and some may feel a bit lost at sea.\n\nGotham City also feels more like a city this time around although you won't bump into many city residents unless the game deems it to be so. Much like Arkham City (which featured a full city lock-down) this time most of the city residents have been shipped out of Gotham to avoid Scarecrows toxins. While it once again does feel oddly barren at times the city does feel more like a living breathing city when traversing the streets of Gotham in the batmobile which are littered with mercenary tanks and cars operated by gang members. While many have complained that the games vehicle sections are too frequent and annoying I quite enjoyed the change of pace they offered in terms of gameplay. If I do have one complaint, and its a big one, Batman's batmobile controls like a heavy duty crane performing Swan Lake on Ice. I think it mostly boils down to the actual controls of the batmobile itself, which are definitely odd to say the least, especially for a gamer like myself you loves Racing Sims and Arcade Racers. It definitely takes getting used to controlling the batmobile and I never particularly felt comfortable doing so. The game also introduces a series of obstacle courses, devised by The Riddler himself, which appart from not making much sense to begin with (like The Riddler would go out of his way to set up a series of underground race tracks for Batman) each course does gets progressively more difficult and frustrating given the vehicular controls. Unfortunately one of the games main side quests is tied to this silly game mechanic which I imagine most will endure because it involves saving Catwoman.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed Arkham Knights main story line I was more than a little peeved that upon completion the game never truly ended. In order to get the games true ending, and I have no idea why the developers chose to go this route, you will need to complete every single side quest the game has to offer. This will initiate the Knightfall protocol but sadly most of these missions, such as clearing out various enemy factions, collecting Riddler trophies to finding trapped fireman are a tiresome chore that quite frankly I ditched once the main story reached its conclusion. Why Rocksteady did not leave all the collectible ♥♥♥♥ and mundane tasks for those who get enjoyment out of performing such things and make them optional is a questionable design choice since it forces players to complete things that I have come to hate about open world games and their collect-a-thon mentailty. I find this sort of stuff dreadfully dull and boring on a good day so when I am basically forced into it just to see the games true ending then it gets up my nose in all the wrong kind of ways.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=564806036\nArkham Knight definitely has many issues that once again stem from lackluster open world design which seems to plague most of these kinds of games epecially since Ubisoft started to churn them out by the dozen to the more obvious and glaring technical issues. If you are able to look past the initial disaster that was Arkham Knight then there is enjoyment to be had here. Just go in with a forgiving mind and you may be surprised.","February 27","true","61.1"," 79 of 100 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","79","100","4","5"

Enough has been said about that. With that said:\n\nSo I buy Arkham Knight - I must admit fantastic game and i can run it ok by reducing the settings. I have a season pass too. Yay! Oh but theres issues with the PC version? So they pull it from the store. Fair enough. Months go by. I wait patiently for them to get going again so i can get some DLC and continue to enjoy the game. That time has come, except apparently my season pass only unlocks about 3 pieces of DLC, non of the new mini campaigns no new batmobiles, and not most of the skins. So can i get this straight WB, i assume my season pass covered the 'season' where you stopped releasing DLC and i am now expected to pay for it ON TOP of my season pass? I am furious!\n\nI will never buy a WB game again (and to be fair, I've really enjoyed their recent ones, Arkham Knight included) due to these shoddy business practices, and cannot reccomend that anyone else does. Please people, dont encourage them.\n\nedit - Thought I'd throw an edit to be fair to WB; They have fixed the season pass issue. Yay!! However I can't help but notice that although WB have now stated that for Windows 10 machines they recommend a minimum of 12GB RAM, they have not updated the min/recommended sys requirements on the store page. Despite the fact that, with Microsoft ramming Win10 down everyones throats, more and more people will be finding this issue out the hard way. I can only assume it's because if they were honest it would almost certainly stop a large percentage of steam users buying the game and if we know one thing, it's that WB loves that money.  So, unfortunately, one issue is fixed but many more remain. And shoddy business practice is still rampant. I still cannot reccomend this game and my views on future WB games remain unchanged.\n\nedit 2: More shoddy business practices, just when i thought it couldnt get worse. The 'offer' they have made as COMPENSATION (although i imagine most affected already own most if not all of the Arkham games) is being used as a marketing technique to get more people to buy this broken game. They're advertising it on the store page as a Special Offer. Why not label it what it is. Poor compensation to the schmucks who bought the game. I must admit though, i was pleased to see that they are offering refunds. So one step forward, two steps back i guess.","October 28, 2015","false","30.7"," 62 of 76 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","62","76","3","1"

Upon launch this game was apparently unplayable due to how poorly it was ported to PC, and hopefully the flack WB Games got for it will teach developers in the future to show more care for their PC releases...however, the game itself (once the bulk of the bugs were worked out) is actually pretty fun.\n\nAs usual, the storyline is solid.  The Arkham games in general have been some of the best adaptations of Batman from the comics ever.  And Batman rarely translates well from the comics.\n\nAfter Scarecrow got his face chewed off by Killer Croc in Arkham City, he's come back for revenge on Batman, and this time he's brought along a new player, the Arkham Knight.  The Arkham Knight is someone we haven't seen in the Arkham series before, but if you're familiar with the comics, you'll have fun trying to figure out who it is behind the mask, and why they're hell bent on destroying Batman.\n\nAs with every other game, Riddler's been leaving trophies and graffiti around town, but this time he's got a hostage, you have to complete various challenge levels with Catwoman to help her defuse an explosive collar, and you're able to switch between the two in real-time to help them work together more efficiently.  This feature is also present whenever you're fighting alongside Robin.\n\nThere are more toys, this time around.  The Batarangs, Batclaw, Line Launcher and Explosive Gel are still there, but this time you also get a voice synthesizer to command henchmen around for Predator challenges (until they inevitably catch on to the deception), a disruptor (which I think may have also been in Arkham City, I'm not sure), the Remote Hacking Device has more utility this time around and you can even call in the Batmobile to whereever you are in the city, even if you left it way on the other end of the map, it seems to always conveniently be just around the corner.  But I won't complain.\n\nThere are street battles against the Arkham Knight's tanks, there's environment takedowns during fight sequences, there are car chases, there's an even wider variety of takedown methods...there's just so much more to the (presumably) final installation of the Arkham series...so if you liked the previous games but are worried it's just more of the same, worry not.  It's totally worth it.  And if you're apprehensive because of how buggy everyone said it was at launch, don't worry, it's fine now.  I only had one issue my entire time playing it, and I'd practically beaten the game by the time it happened, I started clipping through buildings.  Just reloading from a previous save fixed it, I only lost a couple minutes of gliding through the city, no big deal.\n\nI give it an 8.5/10, I really liked this damn game.","May 13","true","40.7"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","50","58","0","8"

With settings all the way down, and the game looking worse than Arkham City, which is 4 years old, I still only get a framerate of around 40 in the benchmark. of course that is locked to 30 FPS in game so that doesn't matter, am I right?\n\n- 30 FPS does not look good when you are gliding across the low textured rooftops with depth of field and motion blur forced on, because you can't disable them in the settings.\n\nI took to the .INI and configured a couple of things: I disabled motion blur, ambient occlusion, bloom and capped the framerate at 60. I then started the game for real:\n\n- FPS 45-80 which is playable for me, I am not a demanding man. Unfortunately some things just didn't load properly:\n\n- When in detective mode, no enemies, or people generally, were rendered. So I could see the analysis of people I couldn't see. And upon deactivation of detective mode for a second, they were still invisible, and then they popped in, rendering through 3 sets of textures in half a second.\n\n- When in combat, there were no markers above the enemies when they were about to strike, no indicators of when to block. I was playing on 'normal' difficulty, and I am pretty sure they are supposed to be there, altough not entirely certain.\n\n- I changed the keyboard controls to fit my usual Arkham setup, but the notices ingame did not really update. It kept telling me to press 'R' to eject from the Batmobile, but all it did was look behind the car. Through pressing random buttons I found that I needed to press 'E'. So that's kind of useless.\n\nAt this point I have nothing more to add. I have been waiting for this title since the release of Arkham CIty, and I think I deserve a properly working title for all this waiting, and for paying that amount of money.\nI will just have to wait a month or six and hope they are able to fix this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","June 24, 2015","false","50.2"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","48","55","5","1"

At that time I would have given it an average to low review as it lacked polish and whilst playable it clearly had some major issues.\n\nSince purchase -as I was fool enough to pick up the season pass with it- I  have been forced by the publisher to sit on my thumbs for months as they forcibly stopped me from accessing the DLC I paid for while they pulled the game which as a one off was a bitter pill but I suppose I could look forwards to them bringing it all out with a shiny. polished, "as it should have been" version of the game.\n\nFinally yesterday they re-released the game.....\n\nNow the game crashes every 120 seconds in the batmobile, and around every 8 minutes on foot. The same graphical bugs, low post processing quality and missing features (I'm looking at you fancy rain effects) are still there/missing after 4 months of "fixing". I am still effectively barred from accessing the dlc content I paid for months ago because now in essence the game for me is non-functional.\n\nI am Extremely disappointed and feel let down by the whole debacle as such despite my best intentions I can personally only rate this game based on my experiences with it's playability which for me has lessened to the point that it is now unplayable.\n\nI won't give it a straight 0/10 because some people might be able to get it to run, like I was when it first was released months ago.\n\n3/10 seems only fair to me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/recommended/208650/","saltydaveiv","david / BNET: OceansAbove#1601","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/","338 products in account","I wouldn't recommend the PC version of Arkham Knight for anyone currently, and aside from the well known reasons (which I'll get into later on, a review is supposed to be helpful afterall). First of all, the developer despite kind of being Rocksteady, it's really not Rocksteady. Out of a 120 person developer team at the time, about 5 was responsible to look over the PC version which work was outsourced to Warner's "it's ugly, it stinks, it ♥♥♥♥♥ everywhere, but it's my dog" studio, Iron Galaxy, aka the guys with a different name after High Voltage studios crew changes. They great references such as the broken to this day Mortal Kombat 9, broken to this day Mortal Kombat X (something they are so ashamed of they removed _EVERY_ reference from their studio's portfolio / facebook page that they had anything to do with it). All of their games tend to run unplayable or barely tolerable for those with low standards, suffer from memory leak ultimately leading to unavoidable crashes (come at me with your 16Gb RAM configs please, it's only a delay, not a fix), causing overheating problems with barely any GPU usage while tormenting CPU (but of course not using more than 2 cores at a time, often not even two). And guess what: Arkham Knight was relased in an unplayable state. It's not that highlighted graphical features were missing, it's not that the game ran slow because of it's hardly justifiable hardware requirements (yes, I just said that, look around how other similar or better looking games run and with what hardware requirements) due to poor optimalization. The developers pretty much never heard of AMD drivers, and while they (4 months after that piece of sh...room IG were taken off the project) were busy with adding more NVidia exclusive effects that were also missing on relase - I repeat, after 4 months - the performance is still unreliable. People and fanboys are about to kill each other on steam community hub and basicly every Arkham Knight forum that isn't united in hate towards Iron Galaxy and Warner Bros (latter being ultimately responsible) arguing if the patches were helpful or not, but truth is: it's a fifty-fifty. Each patch drasticly changed the performance, and while each was supposed to help, half the people even got it worse than before. It's not about old drivers, old hardware, people with the newest well taken care of software background and monster PCs make performance reports from extreme to extreme on both good and bad side. Decide if you want to pay for that before you can try.\n\nThe situation got so bad that Warner Bros was forced to take Arkham Knight back from all the stores worldwide, actually put Rocksteady on their own game and engine (heavily modified Unreal3) to work on. Again after months of waiting, they pushed out a huge patch that was again a 50:50 bag, Warner forced out all the dozens of paid DLC and season pass and everything, and gave away "free gifts" (all the Arkham games for free... you know, the games we already had and played, as those were the reason we bought Arkham Knight, so esentially a nicely wrapped big bag of nothing for most of us), and moved to the policy of refund without question for all steam customers (outside sources that gave a steam key almost immediately backed off from this deal, such as greenmangaming or ♥♥♥). Nice. Except I don't want an apple when I paid for a watermelon. And I don't want a truck of apple shipment either when I want to enjoy my f....ing watermelon. I WANT ARKHAM KNIGHT TO BE FIXED. THAT IS WHAT I GAVE YOU MY MONEY FOR.\n\nUnfortunately, when a company pulls out a move like this (refund without question), and started off with not caring much about the PC version and after almost a half year of scandal they "showed mercy" and told their developer studio to work on it with some minimal effort (of course console DLCs are always priority, and guess what, PC paid DLCs also came out before the game even worked properly to AT LEAST the majority... so up to this day, because it's still bad). How much money you think a company will pump into a clearly loss-generating reputation hurting project? Especially after their full refund because they made 3 big patch attempts to fix it with all the glorious promises and they failed each time.\n\nI don't expect this game to be fixed, ever, nor brought half as good as other Arkham titles or Unreal3 games in general, regarding optimlization. If you are really such a diehard Batman fan, you sleep on a Batman pillow under your Batman poster listening to Batman themes while dreaming about Batman, maybe you should give it a chance when it's on a "basicly free" type of sale. Other than that, avoid it like plague.\n\nIt's not that I'm disappointed and I can't get past the first few minutes because of horrible performance and VGA artifacts (without overheating!) or that the huge majority of the PC community says it's really horrible. What bothers me, is that even after having faith in the project after it's without equal quality on launch (not even AC:Unity was this bad), and after waiting for about a half year or more at this point, all their promises of fixes and improvements made things worse, while they pushed out all the paid DLC content (for some reason that went without problems). And that is a direct spit between my eyes from Warner. And that's not the way to make me pay. Sadly I did. Won't make that mistake again.","November 17, 2015","false","1.3"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","42","47","0","0"

I'll try to be as synthetic as i can.\n\nPositive aspects :\n\n- The main story and  PERFECT ending were properly designed\n- The Batmobile addition and the improved combat system\n- The melee combat system is even more fluid and challenging\n- No loadings when entering/leaving buildings\n- Flying and diving were polished to the extreme perfection\n- Gotham City is awesome\n\nNEGATIVE ones ( spoilers included ) :\n\n1 - pointless upgrade system  :\n\nYou'll have to spend several points in order to be able to unlock abilities,forcing you to wait a ♥♥♥♥♥ON of time before getting some of those 8-points abilities that are quite often meaningless, like the super-hyper batmobile's ejection system.\n\n2 - some upgrades ARE STUPIDLY OVERPOWERED :\n\nClear example : you'll meet 2 new enemy types : medics and camouflaged soldiers. Don't worry,your jammer rifle will thwart their abilities,neutralizing them immediately.\nNIO,JUST NO. A NEW ENEMY SHOULD RESULT IN AN IMPROVED THREAT / AND INCREASED GAME DIFFICULTY AND VARIETY. This is not the case at all,especially in New Game +.\n\n3 - Lack of boss fights and overall boss stupidity :\n\nYou won't have boss fights. Forget about Bane,Coppehead,Deathstroke,Deadshot,Mr FREEZE.They're FFF GONE FOREVER. This is...stupid. Now. The Joker is dead,right? THEN ♥♥♥♥ING REPLACE HIS DEATH PROPERLY! New epic boss fights are totally absent,except for the Riddler's wresting match. ( "--__-- ).\n\nWanna have a laugh? Riddler vs Batmam is like "Loki vs Hulk in Avegers 1". 'Nuff said.\nSPOILER : Loki gets brutalized.\n\n4 - Bosses Stupidity :\n\nHOLY CUPCAKES. The Arkham Knight should be the ultimate enemy but instead...he's a clueless ♥♥♥♥♥ running with his drilling-♥♥♥♥♥-machine into underground explosives?!. He should also have been a melee combat expert...BUT NO! A FIRST CLASS CAMPING WUSS,like Mr.Mundy from Team Fortress 2 !\n\n- Deathstroke : he'll replace the Arkam Knight right after you'll defeat him. The worst thing about it is that....you'll have to defeat Deathstroke in the same way that you've defeated the KNIGHT! HOLY MACKERELS! Deathstroke's fight was epic in Batman Origins...but here you'll just have to play hide-and-seek-and-rocket-him as well with 100+ tanks. ROCKSTEADY...you could have shown some creativity! Lazyness at the 100th power.\n\n5 - The Batmobile :\n\nThe Batmobile addon could have been useful...the problem is that...IT'S NOT.\nCompared to the grappling hook flying...this car is as fast and handy as a shopping cart driven by a drunken sailor in the morning. ( Yes,obvious reference to the Irish Lovers' song here )\nAlso,in order to solve many Riddler's challenges you'll need this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle. Good luck.\n\n6 - SIDE QUESTS :\n\nThis is where the game fails the most . They're utterly repetitive and BADLY designed,clearly showing how lazy they were building them .\n\nJust to show :\n\n1) Man-Bat case : i thought "wow a cool new enemy to fight;super senses,super agility,the ability to fly,to produce supersonic echoes.." THE HARSH REALITY : DO A PIGGYBACK RIDE TO SUCK HIS DAMN BLOOD. Please. What a wasted opportunity.\n\n2) Firefly's case : forget the epic fight scenes in Origins,say welcome to a batmobile pursuit. "--__--\n\n3) Dr.Pyg Case : all those ♥♥♥♥tards killed by him have the 3 body clues in the same 3 areas all the ♥♥♥♥ing time. Some more variety in finding those clues would have been great. But no : scan epidermic level,muscular level and skeleton. You're done. The boss fight? The butcher from Wanted. You're done.\n\n4) Hush : a forced scene with Morgan Freeman,ops. Lucius Fox. 3 minutes and Hush is butt♥♥♥♥ed,again.\n\n7 - DLCs and overlall additional content\n\nHarlet Quinn DLC was a llama's spit in the eye long 5 minutes.Literally.\nAsking for a 40€ season pass before the game came out on PC was awful,dreadful and un-ethic.\nBatgirl's DLC lasts 45 minutes and doesn't show anything new from the base game.\n\n8 - PC Port\n\nI have a great Gaming PC and the game itself goes on 30fps on ultra-Nvidia-tailored optimization. Not more. Checking you game files integrity WILL DELETE CHUNCKS OF YOUR GAME. The game itself will crash  at least 3-4 times during your gameplay and WILL USE MORE THAN 3 GB of your memory when it's running.\n\n9 - Challenges :\n\nThey're pretty easy,except for the Batmobile's ones. Prepare to rage.\n\n10 - Enemies' total awareness and common sense :\n\nThe devs said : " During Stealth rooms enemies will counter you,adapting their tactics in order to outmatch you. "  F-A-L-S-E.\n\nREALITY : they will learn ( was about time after 3 games,i'd say) after you wipe out the 30-40% of them; even if they learn,they're still too slow to react properly. Stealth is easy . Too easy. No matter if they added the heavy patrol guard,the drone controller and the medics. They still aren't a serious threat.\n\n11 - FEAR TAKEDOWS :\n\nHoly cupcakes. The hardest thing to do in steath is do deal with several enemies at the same time. This new skill will delete the problem,allowing you to pretty much obliterate any real issue you could have in those clueless rooms filled with scaredy cats enemies.\n\nTo sum up :\n\nThis game could have been better AND IT HAD TO BE. Devs were just too lazy on not optimizing the game,not improving side quests and NOT MAKING THE GAME HARDER. A wasted chance to make the last Batman game unforgettable.\n\nVerdict  : 4 / 10","June 22, 2015","false","49.7"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","47","55","5","1"

To describe this product as substandard and bad would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe the PC portation as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. In short: It is one gigantic clusterf**k.\n\nThere may be people among you that ask me to give WB Games the benefit of a doubt and that they might not have known the state their game was in but that would suggest a complete loss of oversight and control which is just not realistic. I wish WB Games would have taken the same approach as with the Special Edition that was ultimately delayed because of quality issues. The fact that they haven’t leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of the PC community – appearance, apparently, is more important than a working software. The more we’re faced with such subpar programming the more I warm up to the idea that there should be a governing body; an equivalent to the NHTSA, NTSB or FDA.\n\nI bet the executives over at Rocksteady, the name behind Batman: Arkham Knight, are fuming. See, Rocksteady wasn’t responsible for the PC port of this game but another third party was put in charge (various sources speak of Iron Galaxy) – yet, Rocksteady has all the bad press and is busy doing damage control; I feel for you guys! Maybe you should send some flowers to whoever signed off on this travesty. I wonder how you can sign off on a 5-disc physical copy of a videogame that installs exactly 7.7 GB and makes you download the remaining 26.1 GB from the internet – WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?! Whoever waved this through should have his decision power relegated to answer questions like whether you’d like fries with that burger.\n\nHow can you ship a game that has a framerate lock at 30?! Sadly, the problems won’t stop there – besides being slow and prone to stutter and locking up which topples the game over the brink of unplay-ability, you’re likely to suffer from audio glitches and then there is the god-awful Denuvo DRM, it’s as if there has been no lessons learned from Lords of the Fallen. Legitimate players are stifled and get hurt the most with those laughable protection attempts to fend off Pirates sailing the seven ISPs. I get that you want the community to purchase your games and you want to be compensated for your work – every gamer that actually cares for videogames understands that. The problem is that by treating everyone like a potential criminal and pumping out defective software you’ll lose your customer base, you’ll lose them by not taking them seriously and frankly you deserve it.\n\nArkham Knight is the absolute worst PC port I’ve ever seen. The only way to fix this is to have a fresh go at it, preferably not by the same company that is responsible for the initial portation but someone capable and competent. Instead I’m afraid we’ll just see a myriad of patches and nobody owning the mistakes that were made.\n\nUPDATE: WB has pulled the game and suspended sales and already the masses are singing praise - the poor delusional souls. Commending WB to ‘a brave step’ or ‘the right thing’ is silly and wrong and is a perfect reflection of what’s wrong with gaming nowadays.

The original title of this game was deliberately misleading in order to surprise fans when they discover the true protagonist of this game, the Batmobile. Drive around the stunningly beautiful Gotham City and take in the sights at a smooth 20FPS, all while blowing up unmanned APCs and blasting unarmed men with your taser. The gameplay is a mix between Twisted Metal and Burnout, you chase down cars, blast them with your cannons, then drive up walls. Gotham City has become so lawless even the laws of physics no longer apply. Team up with old foes and release plant spores all over the city, because your frame rate wasn't tanking hard enough.\n\nUnfortunately the good also comes with the bad. Just when you thought you were free from the universally reviled fighting segments from the previous games, you get kicked out of the Batmobile occasionally and have to control Batman. Fight through waves of mindless goons and throw a few batarangs so you can progress to the next driving segment. On the bright side, the dreaded challenge maps from the previous games were removed and were instead replaced by racecourses so you can drive your cool car around some more.\n\nThe story contains the greatest twist out of all the Arkham games. You learn that Batman, the world's greatest detective, is unfathomably stupid. Watch as he discovers the blinking bomb shaped device in the road happens to actually be a bomb, and be drawn to the edge of your seat with anticipation as Batman tries to identify who the Arkham Knight is, because you probably figured it out immediately.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game to driving game enthusiasts everywhere and fans of Harley Quinn's massive assHOLYSHIT.\n\nI know you've all looked, you can't lie to me.","June 27, 2015","false","12.1"," 62 of 80 people (78%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","78","62","80","54","4"

It seems the pc version of this game will never truly be fixed. If you're running a top-of-the-line system, you might find this playable (although that's not a guarantee) but otherwise you should stay away for performance reasons alone. Even if you get things running smoothly, it's still not a very good game.\n\nThe story is...fine. Incredibly predictable, but fine. If you've read even a few issues of Batman published within the last decade you're going to know exactly who the Arkham Knight is the moment you meet him. There's also just way too much going on. In addition to the core story missions, there is a glut of repeatable side missions that focus on different members of Batman's Rouges Gallery. The problem is that once you've played one kind of these missions, there's no reason to play any more of them except for completion's sake. All the penguin missions are identical, as are all the Two Face missions, as are all the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Riddler Races, etc, etc.\n\nWhich brings me to the biggest problem in this game, one you doubtlessly know about, the batmobile. It sucks. It's completely antithetical to what the rest of the game tries to offer, and it's forced upon you again and again. Why would anyone who enjoys the satisfying, rhythm-based combat or the puzzle-like, predator sections want to play Missile Command with tanks? It's boring and feels like a tax you're obliged to pay to access any of the fun stuff. It's also weirdly tied to the Arkham Knight, so it makes me resent his inclusion in the game even more. Wanna go fight Scarecrow's goons? Too bad, you gotta make it through 5 waves of Arkham Knight tank-faff first.\n\nWhat's more, by being so watered-down the fun stuff isn't even that fun any more. The combat is pretty much the same that it's always been (although the few sections you get to team up with another member of the bat family, wherein you may execute cool team takedowns, are pretty fun), and there are so few predator sections (which were my favorite part of the series) that the game doesn't feel like it has room to experiment much with them.\n\nDon't even get me started on the Riddler garbage (too late!). In Asylum, the Riddler stuff was essentially a bunch of fun extras that led to a really cool secret. City was a bit more ambitious but it was all fairly do-able. In Arkham Knight there are over 240 of those ♥♥♥♥ers, not to mention awful races where you'll blow up the batmobile umpteen times trying to memorize patterns in a lethal (yet somehow hideously dull) car-based version of Simon Says. And they use this ♥♥♥♥ to gate the real ending of the game. That's right, if you want the conclusion to this pile of dross you're going to have to sift through a whole lot of it.\n\nIn summary, Arkham Knight is a mess. Even without the technical issues, it's still an overstuffed game where all the good bits are suffocated under the sagging, bloated flesh of bad mechanics and repetitive design.

Then the game released, and I found myself with 2 copies of the same crap.\nThe game ran incredibly bad, no matter the options I changed, but I kept playing, even with the unbelievable framedrops, because I love Batman. I couldn't stop myself from playing just from my sheer love of the Arkham saga. At least until... near the end of the main story, during a cinematic, the game completely crashed on me, while using 6GB of RAM.\nI finally decided to stop and wait for a patch before making a review.\n\nFast forward to September, the first interim patch is released.Does the game run better? Yes, it does.\nAre there still framedrops? There are, specially with the batmobile (they drop even below 30).\nCan you run the game on max with everything on? No. Interactive fog makes the fps drop below 40, no matter how much I lower the other options like texture quality, shadows, etc.\nDo I meet the ultra requirements? I do.\nWill I preorder another game from WB or Rocksteady? Never.\nI love the story, the new moves, the voice acting, all of it, but... they took months to improve the performance of a game that was released in a sorry state (and failed to meet the August patch release schedule), and still can't make it work properly for a PC that meets the ultra specs. Way to end the franchise. Congratulations, Rocksteady and Warner.\n\n28th of October patch arrived, and nothing changed from September.","September 7, 2015","false","53.5"," 61 of 81 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","61","81","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themanisinsane/recommended/208650/","themanisinsane","TheManIsInsane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themanisinsane/","547 products in account","While no doubt a controversial PC release, most, if not all, of the technical issues this game launched with have been well ironed out at this point. And outside of that I'd dare to say that Arkham Knight, while maybe not as exciting as previous titles in the series, is a great game.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, the freeflow combat system is still an incredibly fun and satisfying gameplay system to battle with, and the predator encounters are still tense and engaging. But both of these systems lack the shine they once had when the series first began all those years ago due to general franchise fatigue. But I can't imagine any way to make any real groundbreaking improvments on either front.\n\nThe introduction of a playable batmobile seems to have been an attempt to battle this fatigue, and in some respects it succeeds. I found it exhilarating to race through the streets, chasing down enemies and completing races. But while they are fun at the start, on the whole the tank battles sections are not varied or complex enough to be very engaging. There is also an extremely dissappointing absence of interesting boss fights, which the series has lauded for in past titles. Almost every boss encounter is a slight variation of either the freeflow, predator, or tank battles systems.\n\nThe legendary setting of Gotham City has also never been more detailed and full of life though. And not only in any other game, but also any other medium. It is an absolute blast to glide around Gotham and appreciate all the care and detail that was put into its construction. But the lack of complex interior environments is a dissapointment.\n\nThe game's story is maybe its most impressive feat, and is anchored by a miriad of outstanding performances. The pacing is outstanding with each story beat being followed by an even better one. It has such an incredibly strong start, which it confidently builds on until the very end. Never before has there been such an enthralling narrative that successfully delves into Batman's mental and emotional psyche.\n\nBut with that being said, my biggest complaint (in terms of both the story and entire game) is that many iconic Batman villians are given a bit of the short stick in their side missions. Characters that have dense wonderful stories in the comics; like Hush, Deacon Blackfire, and Ra's al Ghul; are quickly and unceremoniously rushed out the door in an obvious attempt to ties up all the series' loose ends. And while I consider this a true travesty, I'll still confidently say that Batman Arkham Knight is a great game.","May 2","true","128.8"," 50 of 64 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","50","64","0","0"

SLI is also still not working and it runs pretty much like it did before todays re-release.\n\nIf that doesn't sound like there was a competent team working to fix the pc version of this game for the last 4 months, i don't know what does.\n\nAt this point you should forget about this game even existing on pc as WB clearly already has.

Getting 25-35 fps average. I know my 660 ti isn't top notch, but I can still run most games on high just fine. So this is disappointingly low performance for such a big AAA game.\n\n*Edit: December 30th, 2015 - Another patch has been released and I bought myself an SSD. Mostly solid 30-40 fps, but inside the GCPD its more like 28 because there is so much stuff in there post game. And I get the occasional dip to 28 when there is a lot of destruction going on when I'm in the batmobile. I think my SSD has more to do with the framerate bump than the latest patch though as I've read of others getting big framerate boosts when using an SSD on this game. Its playable now, but only after I bought an SSD, and even on the lowest settings its still a very pretty game.\n\nStill going to keep my review as a "No" recommendation because its still very poor performance from such a big budget game. They spent more time making dlc then they did fixing their broken game. Do not support this game.\n\n=========\nStory:\n\nAbout the Arkham Knight character being "an entirely new character". That is a lie. Its an old character. False advertising.\n\nThomas Wayne narrated a trailer. He is not in the game in any form. Just an FYI in case you got your hopes up about hearing more from him.\n\nIf they had just done the "Arkham Knight" like he was in the comics, the story would have been decent IMO. Not trilogy ending worthy, but decent. But because the marketing flat out lied about Arkham Knight being a new character it completely ruined the reveal and the buildup to the reveal for me. The buildup for the reveal is kinda weak as well, if they had set it up earlier in Asylum or City or even Origins, then it would have worked a hell of a lot better as a trilogy ending. I still would have known what was coming, but at least it would have been set up better.\n\n=========\nGameplay:\n\nThe batmobile starts out pretty neat, but the game forces you to tank fight in it WAY too much, especially in the latter half of the game. And not only that but the tank combat rarely ever changes, the minor additions to the combat do nothing to change it up and it becomes a chore every time you hear someone on the comm say tanks incoming.\n\nSome of the puzzles where you have to work with your remote controlled batmobile are neat, but then the game forces you to use the batmobile for a majority of the puzzles and it gets tiresome.\n\nPredator takedowns (I think thats what they were called) are awesome to look at, but somewhat exploitable if you're half decent at stealth takedowns. And once you upgrade it you can pretty much clear an entire area without even trying. Low risk, high reward gameplay.\n\n=========\nTL:DR\n\nIf you can ignore the performance issues, accept a rehashed story, and slog through all the tank combat, then you'll find an average Batman Arkham game.\n\nIf it ran perfectly I'd probably give it a 7/10.\nBut because it runs so poorly I give it a 4/10","November 15, 2015","false","40.7"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","45","58","0","1"

There is a fairly serious memory leak, and their 'fix' was to tell users 'we’ve found that having at least 12GB of system RAM on a PC allows the game to operate without paging and provides a smoother gameplay experience.' (Windows 10), or 'If you encounter this, simply re-launching the game will resolve the issue.' (Windows 7). Other FPS issues, such as severe rain/batmobile slowdown as well as very clear object pop-in, are still present.\n\nWB has issued an 'apology' in the form of free past-Arkham games, but most of the people affected, who bought the game at original launch, or pre-purchased, already own these prior games, as they are fans of the series. It seems more of a simple promotional tool to pull in more new buyers (The 'apology' free pack is for anyone who buys the game for the next couple weeks, in addition to the past), rather than actually compensating those who were affected. New buyers actually get all the same content as pre-purchasers and original launch buyers, while also benefitting from a $10 reduced price.\n\nPerformance aside, if you're lucky and have the game run well on your machine (it seems to be left to chance whether the game works well or not on any system, high or low end) the game itself is actually very well done and fun. Most of the characters, with the exception of the main antagonist (whose identity is made painfully obvious WELL before the reveal), are written and voiced well, and the different side objectives are mostly fun. The combat is fluid, as you'd expect coming from any of the past games. However, it doesn't add too many new elements. The one big new 'feature' is the batmobile, which should be a fun addition, but is shoehorned into any situation the writers could think of, and turns out to be very boring to use.\n\nEDIT: Oh, forgot to mention. One of the optional boss battles, with the Riddler, is locked behind obtaining ***every riddler trophy in the game***. Basically, you do his side questline, which was actually pretty enjoyable, win, and he says 'well, you haven't won until you do ALL my challenges, peace!' and runs away. As someone that likes doing side missions and completing side-arcs, this really bugs me. I'm not willing to run around for hours and hours doing boring little puzzles and 100% the game just to get to a new peice of content/arc closure. I gave up and just watched it on Youtube.\n\n===================================================================\n\nAll in all, with the performance issues, horribly handled launch, poor community support and self-serving 'apology', I can't recommend this game at anywhere near $50. Even if you buy it with a good rig, it seems to be a 50-50 shot whether or not you'll have performance issues that hinder your play. The actual gameplay and story is fun though, so it may be worth taking a risk (or 'demoing' it to test performance, then buying) once it goes on sale for $10-$15.","October 28, 2015","false","34.0"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","1"

I can't, though. Performance is horrendeous! I have a Titan X paired with an i7 5930K and 32GB DDR4 RAM. After fiddling with the setting:\n\nAt Max settings: It has a baseline of 60FPS, but with erratic dips into as low as the 30s for no apparent reason while gliding and even worse drops at Batmobile sequences. GPU usage hovers around 65%.\n\nAt the LOWEST settings: And this is where I get angry, the SAME thing. Baseline of 60FPS with the SAME s♥♥♥♥♥tic drops. GPU usage hovers around 50%.\n\nWhat that tells me is that the devs actually succeeded in screwing up the implementation of the very stable Unreal Engine. If console performance is good, then it proves that they gave NO THOUGHT to PC gamers and just did a barebones port with no optimization. And if the console performance is also bad, then the developer just sucks, period.\n\nEven the way they went about realizing that there were very serious AMD performance issues: It's like someone on the Dev team booted up the game on launch day on their home computer with an AMD card and went: "Oh my God, it doesn't work!" This means they did NO testing, period. If they had just booted it up on a PC they would have seen these issues, even with top end hardware.\n\nOr even worse: they knew about the issues and just didn't give a crap.

Rocksteady better be releasing that patch in a couple of days.\n\nThis isn't to say the game is bad, but if I can't play the game at all then obviously it has issues that need to be fixed before it gets the review it deserves rather than the one it gets\n\nEdit: Still no luck to getting it running smoothly. Been told that the pre-load files may have had something wrong and am currently redownloading. Only problem is for some reason I am only getting around 200 kb/s right now on steam while downloading from other sources is just fine (3 mb/s)\n\n2nd and possibly final edit until optimization patch comes out: I am now able to play with everything on the lowest settings and it still suffers from frame rate drops, small amounts of stuttering and audio desyncs during conversations and cut scenes. Other than these known issue it is a very good game. The story and side missions come rather naturally in most cases and the riddler is back to actually giving some riddles rather than small puzzles. The story is great so far with something that throws me completely off guard often. I loved Arkham City and Asylum and this game by far takes the cake for me. I will recommend this game only after the optimization fixes.\nThe heat coming from my computer when playing this game right now also causes my room to become unbearably hot.\nAnd the latest issue is randomly the game will seem to alt-tab and whenever I try to re enter it crashes. Only happened twice now within the 7 hour time frame that I have been playing. Minor nuisance since the game autosaves a lot.\n\nHonestly it has been too long without another update and the first one still hasn't fixed the terrible preformance.\n\nPros:\n\nThe game itself is very fun. The batmobile is a great part of the game that helps with puzzles and overall is just a fun way to get around the city. Combat has been expanded with new enemies and the ability to pick up and use weapons. The one thing that will never make sense is why Batman must go out of his way to show boat when he picks up a weapon. He stands there for an extra 3 seconds flipping a bat instead of hitting people with it. The main story was amazing with a twist around the corner everywhere.\n\nCons:\n\nExcept for the Arkham Knight. That was the worst identity and was obvious who it was from the start (If you are a big Batman fan). Side quests are boring and repetitive. Looking around a alrge city for dead people was fun. Chasing Firefly in the batmobile each and every time was repetetive. Chasing cars for a while and following them to a stash was boring. Finding a mysterious creature and curing it was boring. They were all practically the same. Remember in Arkham City when the bosses were fun too? You don't get that in this game. Come to think of it, there wasn't actually any bosses. The Arkham Knight should have been a great boss fight, but it wasn't at all. It seems like every boss fight in this game either comes down to chasing them all over the place and taking them down or dealing with a bunch of adds and henchmen without actually fighting the boss.\nBatmobile combat is less than stellar. Shoot unmanned tanks and shoot more tnaks. There are tanks everywhere. Often times it will be 50 to 1 and you have to take them all. Often times I am frustrated by the batmobile combat because there is so much ♥♥♥♥ to watch out for and just isn't fun.\n\nUltimately I wanted to like this game. I just can't when the entire game feels like Rocksteady didn't make it except for the story. Along with the fact that it still has not really had any fixes to issues like the stuttering framerate. Yes the game runs. But it also crashes and stutters every now and then.\n\nI can not reccomend this game at full price even if they fixed every single optimisation issue. The game is just missing fun bosses, new gadgets, and the only thing really holding the game up is the story.\n\nIf you really want the game just wait for the GOTY edition at like 20 dollars. IF it gets GOTY I guess","June 22, 2015","false","19.2"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","38","48","2","0"

I've had some performance issues, but I really enjoyed the base game content. The DLC isn't really worth it so far (the story packs are nice short "clips" to play through and the Batgirl DLC is quite enjoyable, but other stuff is just skins or challenges, stuff I don't care).\n\nSo far, I'd really recommend the base game. It has its issues, but it's a very nice end to the Arkham Trilogy (or Quadtrilogy if you want), especially considering the very great open world feel without the fear of missing anything significant before beating the game.\n\nSo far I even declined on using that possibility to get a full refund on the game. I didn't consider it fair, considering I've had fun for nearly 50 hours (and still haven't solved all Riddler challenges). However, today I noticed this game popping up yet again under Steam's "Popular New Releases". I check in and what do I see?\n\nALL REVIEWS WRITTEN POST-LAUNCH (BUT BEFORE 17th NOVEMBER AS OF RIGHT NOW) ARE TAGGED AS "PRE-RELEASE" BY THE PUBLISHER. THIS IS *NOT* HELPFUL.\n\nI could understand them marking old reviews from before the October (or was it early November?) re-release as "pre-release". It's dodgy, but still fair considering they took it off the market, etc.\n\nHowever, I don't see why they should have the right to claim reviews written yesterday, clearly POST-RELEASE as pre-release just to try to lessen their significance.\n\nDon't blame the devs, they've delivered a great game, but what the publisher is doing here is more than dodgy. I guess this also marks my last WB Games game for a long while, because this is nothing I want to support in any way or form.\n\nSo now I'm back to undecided and really thinking about getting all my money back. Not because of the game. It has its flaws but overall it's still awesome.

First the game is locked to 30 fps by default. Despite Nvidia's website saying it supports SLI, I get absolutely no usage on my second card, unless I dedicate it to PhysX and the performance is still abysmal. There is a serious lack of graphical options, leaving you with texture quality (low and normal), AA (on or off), level of detail (low, normal and high), shadow quality (low, normal and high), and Gameworks options. It seems to completely break RTSS overlay across the numerous games I've tried to use it with, requireing a restart to fix.\n\nGlad I played $30 for the "Premium Edition" including the season pass from a reseller. Although refunding it would have been a better option. Seriously WTF Rocksteady?

For me, it runs well, though I have a fairly powerful PC.\n\nFor what it's worth, I enjoy "Arkham Knight". Under different circumstances, I'd recommend it.\n\nHowever, I do not feel adequately compensated for WB's ruining the launch of a game I paid full price for, and took days off to play. Giving me free games I already own, and adding console features that should have been included anyway does not feel fair to me.\n\nWB's behavior was immoral, and close to criminal. I can not in good conscience make this a positive review until I feel they actually understand what they did wrong, and repay their fans accordingly.\n\nTo the employees at Rocksteady, you worked hard on a game for several years, and it shows in the result. I'm sorry that upper-management bungled your work at the last minute.\n\n\n\nOriginal:\nI'll delete this negative review when the game runs. But seriously Warner Bros. I have a good Nvidia graphics card, yet this game still looks and runs like garbage on low settings. Yes, I updated my drivers. No, I'm not going to dig into the system files of a game I paid full price for. Like Assassins Creed Unity, this port has been released a month before it was ready.

Took months to fix and the entire time nothing was done to make things right with the PC community, just thanks for being patient in a situation where players had no choice but to either hang tight or get a refund.\n\nGo watch some Youtube videos of people playing the game to get the best it has to offer without any of the pain as Rocksteady loses their way by overpromising and discovering just how hard it is to deliver on those promises. Get ready to experience the Bat-tank, a wannabe Batmobile that plays more like it belongs in Armored Core than a Batman game and will leave you wondering how on Earth Batman avoids killing people while running them over in a two ton vehicle doing 90 mph. Watch as characters are marginalized to pointless side missions which feel like a reason to implement some weird puzzle mechanic or to merely make things so easy there isn't even a challenge anymore. Watch in awe as Rocksteady disregards their own story timeline and simply throws characters in where they don't belong because they already built that character model so who cares if we got the wrong Robin? Prepare yourself to be underwhelmed by every piece of DLC content that is not only overpriced but underdeveloped as skins look worse than they did last generation, new characters can't be used in free roam mode, and story content that leaves you scratching your head as to when any of this is supposed to take place.\n\nThis is how they did it. This is how they killed the Batman.\n\nGood job Warner Bros., Rocksteady, and Iron Galaxy Studios for taking what should have been a surefire hit and doing nearly everything possible short of coming to my home and punching me in the gut right after I booted the game up to ensure this was a miserable experience. Save yourself even those couple of bucks you're thinking of spending on this because it's already heavily discounted because they lost a ton of money on this port. There are far better games to play than this and far better developers who will actually deliver a functioning game when promised without compromising their vision to make sure the console version is working and the graphics are as pretty as possible with gameplay coming second. There are times where even the voice actors are phoning it in because they could tell how ridiculous this was. Spoiler alert this game contains the most unconvincing death scene ever that leaves you wondering when a 12 year old took over writing duties and why the cast seems more interested in delivering as few words or emotion as possible before moving on like it never happened.","October 2, 2015","false","24.8"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therockerfly/recommended/208650/","therockerfly","The Rockerfly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therockerfly/","378 products in account","TLDR; 7/10 game running at a 3/10 performance. Game runs poorly, actual story is okay but ruined in the last hour, extra collectables were a chore and not worth the time and effort. Buy GOTY edition for cheap but the game still isn't good enough on PC. I will update this review with future patches.\n\nPlease note, I have played Arkham Asylum and City both to 100% on PC/xbox 360. I have also played origins but did not 100% the main. This review will not contain any spoilers. I played at 1080 resolution at around 60/45fps with very occasional dips lower, with the lowest settings for everything. I have an i7 4770k, 16gb RAM and a GTX 770 and I played this on windows 8. I played the game on a SSD so loading times might be considerably better for me than the files on a HDD. When I played the game, I had the interim patch but from what I understand, the full release hasn't changed much. Also, I played the game with a wired xbox 360 controller on a 1080 TV on hard mode. Your experience may differ based on your hardware and software. Also I will not be including a full dlc review in this.\n\nPerformance/appearance:\n\nBatman Arkham knight ran poorly on my machine. There was issues concerning large frame rate drops about (20-30 fps decrease), textures not loading for a few seconds, micro stuttering and large loading times. The performance is unacceptably bad for a game in 2015 with a major publisher backing the studio. The patches have improved the performance however, it is still not good enough for most gamers. You shouldn't be required to have a SSD, over 8 GB RAM and a 760+ for a performance this bad. I suspect more patches will be added in the future to improve the performance so if you want an update of the performance based on my parts in the future then send me a mail and I will see if things have improved.\nBatmobile sections were the biggest offenders of reducing the frame rate however the frame rate dropped at random during other portions of the game.\nI will say, the game was nice to look at with some cool destructions physics, lighting effects some excellent rain effects. If you are using an nvidia card the nvidia gameworks options look nice but they completely crippled my frame rate to around 22-18 fps. I'm not sure what the effect will be on an AMD card but I imagine it will probably make things even worse for your experience.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay is broken up into a few different sections. These include combat, stealth, free roam, driving the batmobile and small detective section. These mechanics are used in part with the side missions and the main campaign. If you have played any of the Arkham games you know how the combat is and the free roaming however there has been minor changes which did make a difference to my experience with the game.\n\nCombat was much less precise than in Asylum or City. I found myself hitting enemies who I was not aiming for more than a few times which lead to some unfair deaths. My partner and a friend played the PS4 version and we found the same issue with their experience too. Some of the new enemies aloud for healing and revival which combined with existing enemies, meant combat lasted far too long in some sections. However, as a Batman veteran, the game was a nice challenge with the combat and it was nice for hard mode to actually feel like it was hard at times.\n\nStealth is for the most part unchanged. You distract enemies, you knock them out, you pick them up one by one and you which if you have played any of the previous games you know the song and dance. There are some minor changes but they don't change too much bar getting the fear multi takedown ability which makes many of the stealth sections much easier. In response, enemies have new gadgets and tech but it is given at a nice difficulty curve.\n\nFreeroaming was probably the least changed mechanic but the most improved. The grappling hook has received a much welcomed boost in strength and you can go much further and faster than in previous games. I did have some issues with the frame rate during some of the very fast flight sections however they were not too frequent. The only down side to freely roaming the city is some sections will require you to use the batmobile. Which leads me to my next point.\n\nThe batmobile was the worst bit of the game and unfortunately you have to spend a lot of time in it. As I mentioned in my performance paragraph, I found the frame rate was at its worst during these sections with the frame rate dropping significantly when driving very quickly. The batmobile is also used in stealth section in some ridiculous ways and many times during the game when i didn't know what to do, the solution as using the batmobile in some silly way. I get that this is a game and I should suspend my disbelief but I also didn't have much fun during these sections due to the dull tank controls, low frame rate and at the rate I had to use it.\n\nDetective mode has probably been one of the smallest but most significant changes for Arkham Knight. The main detective vision has been seriously nerfed giving less detail on objects, being blocked more often in stealth sections, not available in the batmobile and having a lower viewer distance. For most of the game this isn't an issue, however I will explain why it is an issue with the side missions.\n\nThere are some decent side missions but some of the supervillains were pretty lame and their side missions were tedious with the same mission repeated several times. If you aren't going to try and get all the riddles then move onto my story section. If you have played any of the previous games then you will know about the riddler mission which involves collecting question mark tokens and taking pictures of question marks and small hints of characters from the batman universe. As I mentioned in detective mode, the vision mode has been hugely nerfed and now riddler clues are not highlighted at all. This means you are almost forced to go find all the riddler informants and constantly check you map which can be a chore at best and a miserable slog at worse.\n\nStory:\nAs I mentioned, I won't be spoiling the game. I felt the Arkham Knight was a little underwhelming but it was to be expected. I would recommend avoiding IMDB pages and looking up voice actors if you don't want to know who the Arkham Knight. However, the identity was pretty obvious about 50% through the story. Parts of the best bits of the story are literally there to develop the reveal or the Arkham Knight and was some brilliant depictions of some of the iconic sections of the batman lore.\nThere was a complaint I had that one of the best bits of the game and some of the story arcs of one of the characters was made completely pointlessly in the last reveal. This was a disappointment to me as it was one of the best bits of the game and probably the single most shocking part in any of the Arkham games.\nOverall, the story was the only thing keeping me going and I found once I was done with the story, the fun I had with the game was diminished and I was getting impatient with the side missions. If you are compelled to collect everything like I was then go for it but if I were to do it for a first time again, finish all the side missions except the riddler and then watch the true ending on YouTube.\n\nPlease let me know if I have missed anything and I can update my review to reflect my opinion on the sections I have missed.","October 29, 2015","false","48.5"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Speaking about Batmobile for one thing it's sad when drone fights become annoying when the game forces you to crush an army of them for hundered times over and over. On the other hand driving Batmobile through Gotham streets or on one of many race tracks the game offers is pretty enjoyable. It was for the first time I found Arkham challenges entertaining.\n\nPredator mode is terrific as always, including more features than before, new types of enemies and also gadgets. This is what developers did really great work with. However what I think is not done with great care or I could say was sloppily made is the story. Many think the story is the best part of the Arkham series, but in this title its predictable, rapidly escalating and not going too far. Best part of it are cutscenes which are joy to behold.\n\nAltogether I recommend this one if you have played previous titles.\n\n7.5 /10","February 17","true","50.4"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","0"

Nothing comes close as it pays homage to so many great characters, In detail I havent seen before! Nothing immerses me as much as a video game does, This is one of the reasons Batman: Arkham Knight is so great (and why I love video games so much :) ).\n\nExploring Gotham is a treat gliding or driving the Batmobile, Announcements pop up from all over and the game constantly engages you to search all around the city. Each Villian has there own feel and interesting story to go with. There are many twists in the game which im sure would have more effect on me if i didnt already know what was going to happen ;) (Massive Batman nerd here), But the way they're revealed is great and enjoyable. The combat is great as always maybe a bit stale now, But this is the final batman game so its been well used and not overdone.\n\nThere is so much i want to talk about, but it is hard to without spoiling the story and i hate when reviewers do that.

What can I say, it's kind of a letdown.\n\nI've played for an hour so far and the game itself is probably good.  The combat is fun as always and in contrast to a lot of other people I find the whole Batmobile gameplay quiet appealing so far.\n\nThat being said, the performance and optimization of this game is a huge bummer.\nArguably I don't have the best rig there is, but while I can play The Witcher 3 on high settings without any problems, Arkham Knight's performance is just awful.\nThere are constant fps drops which really disturb the flow of the game and lowering the graphics settings doesn't really do that much, despite making the game look much worse than Arkham Asylum.\n\nOn top of that, there aren't even that many settings to begin with ingame. You actually have to meddle with an .ini file to change things like Motion Blur or Depth of Field, settings that SHOULD be easily accessable through the menu.\nYES, you can change these options (which for some people will crash the game on startup, so good luck with that, I guess), BUT this still doesn't excuse the lack of a proper ingame menu to change them. It's Dying Light all over again.\n\nSo let's hope there will soon be some patches to the performance as well as to the possibilities of configuration. In it's current state, the game is, at least for me, not fun to play.\n\nAnother point of criticism is the magnificently intransparent DLC policy coming with this game. I preordered it and according to my vendor's advertisement I SHOULD have the Harley Quinn DLC....well...like many others I don't, and nobody really seems to know why.\nWhat I read on forums went from it being Gamestop exclusive to having been pulled by Rocksteady from the preorder last minute and now being avaiable through the Season Pass, which would quiet frankly be beyond devious.\n\nSo all in all, it is a pretty messed up launch and I strongly recommend AGAINST buying it at this point, at least not for full price. I actually got it cheaper and I still am rather annoyed.\n","June 22, 2015","false","35.0"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","28","34","2","0"

Wtf WB Games? They were one of the funnest parts!!!\n-Has a pretty obvious twist if you're a fan of Batman, knowing the comicbooks\n\nOverall\nThe game was very enjoyable to play overall. However, one feature that I really enjoyed from previous Arkham games, the Detective Crime scanes were lacking, very disappointed by this. The Batmobile made a heavy impact on the game, in both quest and campaign, making up for lack of detective work. This is, what I believe, to be a great ending to the Batman: Arkham series, however with WB games taking its sweet time releasing the patch, I feel like the PC version is dead and unrevivable.\n\nEDIT: With the refund option now avalible for everyone, no matter the hours played, I would recommend to refund the game for PC.

The game is run using the Unreal Engine 3. The PC release of Arkham Knight brought plenty of controversy and issues.  The technical issues on the PC release almost forced Warner Brothers to suspend sales on the game in order for them to address the issues people were having. The game was re-released on Steam in October 2015 after a few patches in order to solve the technical issues.  Sadly people still reported problems with the game forcing Warner Brothers to offer full refunds on the game regardless of whether you met the regular criteria or not.  To this day, the developers are still working on technical issues which people are having.\n\nBefore I start my review, I would like to point out that I played this game on a mechanical hard drive, with one nVidia 970 (my second one is being RMA’ed right now!), playing at 1080p with graphics turned on and the majority of the nVidia graphics options turned on as well.  On launch of the title, Warner Brothers recommended that the game be installed on a solid state drive, so as you read the review, please bear all of the above in mind.\n\nGame play in Arkham Knight is again, the same as its predecessors; this shouldn’t be taken as a negative thing though, as the game play is absolutely stellar. The combat system is as fluid and easy to grasp as ever, with some new and interesting combos and special take downs being introduced, such as double take downs when you are working with a partner on some missions.  Some new gadgets have been introduced, a remote controlled batarang which can scan the area for information, and a voice synthesiser, that mimics other character’s voices; this gives you plenty of different ways to use such as ordering enemies around and opening voice controlled locked doors.\nThe major new game play mechanic that has been added in Arkham Knight is the Batmobile.  You are able to summon the Batmobile to your location when you are on foot or gliding in the air. The Batmobile has two different mods that can easily be used at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is the regular movement mode with little on offer in terms of firepower, as you are traveling from A to B. Battle mod turns your Batmobile into a death machine; as you utilise all of the weapon systems on board. The Batmobile can be upgraded using the points you are rewarded with for levelling up as well.\n\nGraphically, I was really impressed with how the game looked. The high resolution textures and rain effects are all stunning.  All of the characters look almost life like, and you can really appreciate this when you get close up shots on their faces; so much detail has gone into the modelling and texturing, to the point where you can see the blackheads on the Joker’s face! All of the game’s animations are done very well too; the Arkham combat system has a very fluid feel to it, so they need to be spot on or else it would just look out of place.\n\nThe plot within Arkham Knight is probably my favourite of the series so far. It is the last episode in the Arkham series, so takes place after origins, Asylum and City. I have not read the comic book series so I missed out on a lot of the plot in between the games but the game does do a good job of trying to fill in the gaps.  Arkham Knight introduces a few new main characters to the fold if you haven’t read the comic books too, such as Robin, and a more starring role for Barbara Gordon. With plenty of the other regulars returning, such as Cat-Woman and Alfred. You will encounter plenty of the super villains, Scarecrow, Penguin, Two-Face, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Harley Quin, and of course, the Joker. One new villain, Arkham Knight also has a starring role and has an important storyline plot attached to him as well.\n\nDifficulty can be scaled depending on how hard you set the game. I felt the medium setting to be just enough challenge without hitting the brick wall. None of the boss battles in Arkham Knight are just generic fist fights, each of them uses a unique mechanic which adds some variety to the game.\n\nAs with its predecessors’ the open world aspect of the game does a very good job of filling in lots of “blank space” with plenty of side missions and collectables to find. Most Wanted missions, Riddler's Revenge, collectables and AR challenges makes the optional part of the game full to the brim with content. You are also able to unlock different endings to the game by completing the side missions as well, giving you more incentive to continue playing after finishing.\n\nI have been playing for about twenty five hours so far, this has allowed me to finish a handful of side missions and the main story in the game. I will definitely be dropping a few more hours into completing the rest of the most wanted missions in order to unlock the alternative endings, but I can’t see myself wanting to collect the hundreds of Riddler items again after my fiasco with the past two games with them!\n\nNow, onto the technical issues.  As I said above, I am using a single nVidia 970 and the game was installed on a mechanical hard drive. The majority of the time the game was running around 57-60 fps. There are moments where the frame rate will drop to 30 for no good reason. I can understand if it drops on more graphically intensive scenes or when there is a lot happening, but it can sometimes happen when you are in a building with very little going on. Maybe this would have been different if I was using SLI, but even then, it has been reported the SLI makes no difference to the performance. Taking all of this into consideration it seems I was on the lucky side and the pure power in my machine seemed to pull it through to an acceptable playable state.\n\nMy conclusion of Batman Arkham Knight may come as a controversial one, but like all of my reviews it is my honest and truthful opinion. I am going to highly recommend Arkham Knight. The game play and interesting compelling story make it a definite worthwhile play through.  I would only recommend this game to people who have a bit of meat in their rig to play it though, unless you are willing to sacrifice some of the graphical fidelity, please bear in mind all of what I noted in the technical issues section of the review and make your judgement on purchasing the game on that if you are on the fence. The game’s retail price on Steam is £34,99, I would also recommend that you don’t purchase it for that price, either get it from another source (definitely not GEE 2 AAAA hint hint hint hint) or wait for one of Steam’s sales as this game will go on sale for less than £20, and more than likely even more now.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inlimuniter/recommended/208650/","inlimuniter","inlimuniter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inlimuniter/","245 products in account","I waited patiently for four months for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. to put this game back on Steam and fix it properly. I bought it when it was first up for sale, and the game ran very poorly for me, yet I wanted to know where the story went so I struggled through all the lag and stuttering and horrible textures to play through it to the end of the main story. I only own a PC and not any consoles so that was the only choice available to me to play through the game. I was really excited to play the sequel to Arkham Asylum and City, two games that I really enjoyed, and I am a huge Batman fan. I read all the comic books, and I watch all the movies and cartoons, so I was always going to play through this game, awful port or not.\n\nNow I will admit I don't have the best and most up to date computer in the world, but I find it more than adequate to play through pretty much any other game I might try to throw at it. I've enjoyed playing The Witcher 3, GTA V, MGS V and countless other great games on it this year with perfectly acceptable settings and stable performance. But somehow this game just won't quite run nicely for me, even after the update from a month or two ago, which did improve things for me and make the game run a fair bit better, it's still not quite right. The framerate jumps up and down like a yo-yo, from around 55fps to 25fps, constantly shifting. I'd prefer the game to run at a consistent 60fps but I honestly don't mind a framerate in the 30 range, but only if it's stable and consistent, but it is not in this game no matter what settings I put it on. It's kind of like watching a movie and somebody is constantly pressing the fast forward and pause button. The textures, which I have to play on 'low' as I have a 2gb VRAM card, have improved from the awful state of release, but I still see occasional objects that just look like a blurry mess. There's also still issues with dialogue going out of sync on cut scenes.\n\nWhat annoys me here is that this is a game running on Unreal Engine 3, a game engine that has been around for over a decade and developers really have no excuse for not being able to develop stable and well optimised games on it at this stage. I understand that it is a 'heavily modified' version of Unreal Engine 3, but it really shouldn't matter. And it most certainly should not be an engine that requires amazing hardware to handle a game developed on it. I believe Bioshock Infinite runs on UE3 and I run that game at like a stable 80fps with everything on max settings, different type of game admittedly, but really there is no excuse.\n\nNormally at this point I would say that graphics don't really matter, and it is gameplay, story and replayability that’s important. I would dearly like to say that about this game, but I just can't quite say that. I did enjoy many things about this game, it is basically the same as Asylum and City but with some cool new moves put in which work from the FEAR suit. I do love the design in this game. The way Batman's suit looks is seriously cool, and Gotham City is beautifully detailed and huge in scope. The new thing in this one is the Batmobile, I know a lot of people hate it, but I actually rather enjoyed it, but it is certainly overused. I particularly don't like it when you are literally driving the batmobile inside buildings to solve environmental puzzles. I get it, you've got this cool new thing, and you want to show it off, but there is no need to try and force it in to nearly every part of the game.\n\nI did like the story of this game, I particularly like the references to The Killing Joke, and how they brought back a certain character. Many of the moments in the story were very emotionally charged in a way that the previous games lacked. What is a shame is that the game lacks the great boss battles that the previous games were so memorable for. Scarecrow as the main villain I found particularly disappointing. I've always found him interesting as a psychological manipulative villain, but all the stuff about him in this game just basically comes to nothing. There's also another villain in this game whose story is a bit odd, without wanting to spoil anything all I can really say is that it's just kind of lame the way they try to hide something which is very obvious to any Batman fan. They could have just done his story a lot better, and it could have been amazing, but as it is, it's just kind of a messed up opportunity.\n\nI cannot give this game a thumbs up and I do not recommend it. It is not completely unplayable to me, and as described the game has a lot of commendable things. If you are a fan of the series and have to play it, then yeah get it, but do be aware that for a lot of people it is still unplayable. If you can get it on another system or are able to wait then don't get it now on Steam. Don't expect this game to ever be properly fixed. Warner Bros./Rocksteady have been saying for months about all the stuff they are going to do to fix it, but still haven't done all the stuff they said they would. They seem more concerned about getting the DLC up. Their idea of compensation is almost laughable, not that I ever wanted free stuff from them, I wanted a working game. But the way they treat their customers is disrespectful, and ultimately that is why I have to give this game a thumbs down.\n\nEdit: well the game now runs quite well for me, with some tweaking. If I lock the framerate to 30fps to get a pretty consistent stutter free experience that looks quite nice. It's not perfect though by any means and 30fps is far from ideal, but I can live with it for now. My thumbs down still stays though I'm afraid. It took too long for them to even put a graphics menu in with a fully featured set of options, and the attitude from Warner Bros just was not what I would call good customer service. Even with the game working alright for me, it's still a bit of a let down compared to the previous games in terms of story and gameplay. I can't help but wonder what I'd think of this game had it been released in the state it is at now. But I'll never know the answer to that unfortunately.","October 29, 2015","false","69.9"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sindraws/recommended/208650/","sindraws","sinDRAWS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sindraws/","841 products in account","You do not have the graphical capability to fully enjoy this game. Whatever you think, your graphics card is most likely not powerful enough to support this game. That's all there is to it.\n\nAgainst all warnings from friends, I pre-ordered this game along with the season pass to play it on launch date, like I've done with all of the Arkham series games. This is the first time however that I decided to get the game on PC, the last times were always on PS3. But since this game is next generation, I could not justify buying a PS4 just to play it, I instead decided to use my PC, which, while a year old at this point, is still very powerful, I can play most new games with the highest settings (Mad Max and Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain work smooth as butter with maxed out settings). This was not the case with Batman Arkham Knight on June 26.\n\nWhile I was one of the lucky ones to be able to play the game at all, throughout my playthrough I had only 2 crashes which came at two unrelated random points. But otherwise, I could play the game and I was willing to overlook most problems, chalking it off as it'll get patched in the coming weeks, I mean it's not uncommon. My nVidia GeForce Experience optimal settings recommended that I minimalise all settings, which to me was shocking, how needy could the game be? So I ignored it and wanted to experience how bad it can get. And oh man, it got bad. The framerate could not handle anything and would often drop down to 1.\n\nThroughout my gameplay I eventually had a system going where whenever I was out as Batman, I would set my texture quality to medium, shadow quality to low and level of detail on high, but whenever I was in the Batmobile and there was any kind of action, I had to drop the texture quality and level of detail back to low and back again whenever there were any kinds of cutscenes going on so I could enjoy the experience even slightly. But even then, I played the game and defended it, because in the end, when it all comes down to it, it's NOT a bad game.\n\nI enjoyed the Batmobile sequences more the more I learned how to handle the controls and the innovations in combat when you're controlling Batman were definitely the best so far. The parts of Gotham you get the explore (and it's not the whole city, just 3 parts of it) are big, but not overwhelmingly so, because the Batmobile makes pretty fast to traverse around. The usual controls were a bit changed however which did confuse me throughout the game, but it's nothing too damaging to the overall experience. I had fun, enjoyed the story which I will not spoil, but I'm pretty sure everyone knows at this point, and managed to complete my normal playthrough to 100%. I decided to leave the New Game+ mode for whenever the game gets patched and I can play it with optimum settings.\n\nSo if I liked the game, why the negative review? Simple. This port is atrocious compared to the console ports. The PC port was a simple afterthought and was handled by another developer, not Rocksteady. So when push came to shove in releasing the game, all the innovations that Rocksteady made, were not translated properly and the game sufferred. As most of you know, it was so bad that WB had to take the game off Steam so that they could develop a patch. For 3 months. It is now October and the patch was released. Can people play this game now? Yes. Did they fix some major issues? According to them, they have. Have they really? No, the game still functions the same as it did before for me. I can still only play the game with minimum settings.\n\nHonestly, I think the only way they could have fixed it would have been if they reworked the graphics engine for the game and I seriously doubt they want to do that at this point. WB PR solution to this is to give out all the previous Arkham games out for free to the buyers who've waited for 3 months and not returned the game back in the first week. I already have all the Arkham games. I think most fans do. They're the ones that made us want to buy this sequel. Plus, the games have been on every other sale for around 5 euros each, so I'm pretty sure everyone has them. I personally am not getting anything out of being patient and supportive from all this time. From my perspective, they've done nothing to improve my experience.\n\nSo no, don't buy this game. Not on PC. Wait a couple of years. Let it drop in price, naturally upgrade your computer with time, let them patch it over and over and only then you'll have a good enough reason to play it.\nOr go play it on the consoles now, it works perfectly fine there.","October 28, 2015","false","74.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

A 30FPS lock, inconsistent framerates and the game deleting itself is the best TL;DR I can come up with. Disabling SLI improved the performance slightly, but the frames are still all over the place with the 30FPS lock taken off in the .ini files. It's an eyesore playing in the Batmobile and when gliding so have fun with any kind of movement around the city.\n\nThe actual game seems great, I managed to rack up a decent amount of hours despite the technical issues causing me to grit my teeth at times. Interesting story, further depth added to the combat system and just more of the same is what I wanted from the Arkham formula. It's a shame this is brought down by Iron Galaxy's ineptitude.\n\nThank you Rocksteady, Iron Galaxy, WB for the worst PC port in recent memory.\n\nPOST-RELEASE REVIEW\n\nPerformance is still below what I'd expect, but at least WB can sell their DLC now so that's alright.

This is a pretty huge improvement, since large portions of the game require you to use it. There's still a lot of motion blur (unsure if that's frames related or what) when moving the camera, and a couple moments of frame drop every now and again. Overall the experience is definitely improving, and the optimization issues are not impeding my progress in the game.\n\nEDIT #1 as of 6/23, late afternoon\n\nI was told about this thread, which has been very helpful with regards to stabilizing the framerate. Shoutout to Derp or whatever your name is for going over all the gamefiles and figuring this out. I also downloaded the "game-ready" drivers which apparently came out yesterday, you can read more about it here[www.geforce.com]. With all of that, the game is definitely playable but certainly not amazing.\n\nStill getting frame drops from rotating the cam and driving the Batmobile, but it has yet to go into slideshow mode again. If the remaining frame drops are eliminated and the devs fix up the game so nobody has to root around in the game files, I'll consider switching this review to "recommended". As of now, I wouldn't recommend the current experience to consumers (especially not at full price)\n\n\nMy original reviewas of 6/23, early afternoon\n\nI'm leaving this up in full so people get an idea of what the game was like on release:\n\nNearly unplayable in its current state. At first I thought the framedrops only occurred during cutscenes, until the combat started and the game became a slideshow randomly. God forbid you get in the Batmobile- for whatever reason that thing absolutely MURDERS the framerate.\n\nThe rest of the game seems to look good, the combat seems snappy and responsive, and the gadgets all seem to function just as well as the other games in this series... I just can't play it when I'm faced with constant fluctuations between 14 and 25 FPS. I can barely make out what's happening on-screen and I feel like I'm going to get motion sickness or something. Yes, I've heard of the .ini file you can edit to unlock the 30FPS cap but all other reports seem to say the performance somehow gets even worse when you do that.\n\nI'm totally willing to re-write this review if Rocksteady shows they actually care about finishing the job. As of now, they've released an unfinished, unoptimized game that is not fun to play and I cannot say anything other than this- stay far, far away.","June 23, 2015","false","28.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

Since Oct 28th the game received an update every month (up until the point I'm writing this review) that would have performance fixes, stability improvements and included DLC that was being released monthly in the Season Pass.\n\nBatman Arkham Knight runs a lot better than it did on day one; provided you meet the system requirements you should have no issues running the game. Just make sure you have the latest drivers.\n\nI haven't focused much on the gameplay/story side because there are thousands of other reviews out there - I will say this; if you're going to get this game you need the Season Pass; the extra DLC, AR challenges, Story Packs and Skins really adds necessary depth to the game.\n\nI am quite happy changing this review from a negative to a positive - I would also imagine most negative reviews are pre Oct 28th. I'm not endorsing the state the game was originally released in but the fact is it runs a lot smoother; if you are still holding off buying the game just go and get it.\n\nWhile it may not be the epic finale we deserved it's still a great game any 'Arkham' fan should pick-up.\n\nP.S. I can guarantee people will rate this down because even 7 months later it's still the cool thing to hate on this game.","January 31","true","382.5"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","29","38","2","2"

But there are already over thousands of reviews about that so you don't need me telling you the game is for most people unplayable. Bad Frame Rate, Game Crashes, Horrible Textures, etc...But I'm gonna center this review around the actual story and gameplay.\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight takes place one year after Arkham City. Ever since (spoiler to city) The Jokers Death crime has decreased to a all time low. All That changes when one fearful night Scarecrow announces that he will detonate a chemical weapon of his fear gas in the city, causing most citizens to evacuate. Leaving the City full of thugs, Batman Villians, and The GCPD (or whats left of it). It's up to Batman to find scarecrow and save Gotham from this Chemical Attack. But Scarecrow is Not Alone. He has Assembled, The Penguin, Two-Face, The Riddler, Harley Quinn, and A new Villian leading A private Militia Army Calling Himself "The Arkham Knight" (Who's main motivation throughout the whole game is the Death of The Batman) to help him take down the Bat. The story had me hooked from the beginning. There were quite a few moments where I just sat there with my mouth opening so suprised at what's happening/happend.\n\nSome of the Side missions aren't as interesting as they were in Arkham City but there still fun and interesting to do nonetheless. Introducing new characters, interesting side stories. And Seriously....Fudge the Riddler and his trophies. Can't wait to beat his ♥♥♥ when I actually get around to finding them.\n\nThe gameplay is as solid as ever. Batman is at his prime in this game with more moves, more and improved strategies on how to take on goons, alot more fighting animations for the caped crusader along with many new enemy types that will have you planning who to take out first. The game also for the first time introduces, something great, The Ability to drive the Batmobile through Gotham and taking out goons and unmaned tanks that the Arkham Knights militia will use to try and take you out. While I love the batmobile I felt like the game has too many situations where you have to rely on it to help if your stuck in a area or stumped on a riddler challenge. Even in story it tries way to hard to shove the fact that you can drive the batmobile in your face. So just know you may get tired of it at times, atleast for story and side missions and such. The thing I was looking forward to the most though in this game was the ability to reach great heights overlooking Gotham City while gliding. Gliding through gotham wether right above streets watching goons or gliding past the tallest buildings in the game. It feels so satisfactory. You truly feel like your The Batman.\n\nIt's a great story and really fun gameplay. Hopefully when they get the bloody thing to work properly people will be able to enjoy just how great a game this is. Probably the second worst thing about this game though behind the horrible pc port...is the constant fact that they constantly shove in your face that they made Origins cannon with RockSteadys Arkham Games. I was not a fan of Origins and too this day I say the game never happened. Sure it be a ok game if it wasn't suppose to be tied to The Arkham Series but it is and I cringe whenever they make a remark in Arkham Knight of something or someone that was in Arkham Origins. And it's hard to forget it when you see old villians from Origins in it, or when characters talk about something that happened in it. *Sigh, All in all its a great game but I will keep the thumbs down reccomendation until The PC Port is fixed.\n\nUPDATE: 4 Months now and even after the patch, it's still broken, Still major lag and frame rate drop.","June 26, 2015","false","117.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","22","26","3","0"

Underneath all the bugs, is a game I'd love to experience at its best. Underneath the missing graphical effects is a game I'd love to see in it's true form.\n\nBut that is not Arkham Knight PC version. Arkham Knight on PC is one of the worst ports I have ever come across. I honestly did not think a game could be as horrible as AC Unity. But I am proven wrong.\n\nThe game's mechanics seem very nice so far even though I am very early into the game and it's story. But the constant FPS drops and overall stuttering is a HUGE turn off to play this game to begin with. The lack of graphical settings to choose from is pathetic. The fact that the game is locked to 30 FPS and can only be disabled by editing an ini file is rediculous. I have seen many people trying to help each other out by giving out tips on editing the ini file to increase performance. Which is nice to see I'll say that. It's not often I see the gaming community trying to help each other out.\n\nBut a AAA title should NOT and I repeat NOT be released like this to the consumers. It is utterly disgusting that players themselves have to actually take time to edit ini files to try squeeze out as much performance as they can even though they meet the recommended requirements or are even far above them. I've seen some people call others "entitled" and to "relax it's just a game" as well as "if you don't like it, get a refund" among other more nasty comments. Thats entirely besides the point and honestly, the people dishing out those comments need to wake up and realize that releases like this are just a big no. You wouldn't want to buy a physical product and have it barely work would you? "Oh it's just a TV, it's ok that it stutters and that the screen goes black every 5 seconds" I doubt you people would be fine with that would you?\n\nThe point is that a AAA publisher and developer should not be releasing something like this to their consumers. Paying $60/+ for something that runs like pure garbage is just unacceptable. And WB deserves every bit of hate they get for it.\nThey knew very well what the PC version was like. And they still released it.\n\nThe story so far to me seems to be interesting enough. But I still feel like it's going to be difficult to enjoy it due to all of the issues present in the game. This game could have been an amazing PC release. But due to WB's lack of care and poor choices on the PC Port. I honestly cannot recommend this game to anybody. Unless it's bugs and performance issues are resolved, this game is something I would stay away from.\n\nIt is not worth the money and honestly, I think WB is going to have to do a lot to make up for this. While I did not pre order the game. I was tempted to buy it shortly after it's release. And so I did. But I see now that it was a mistake. I hope that some big shiny pure patches come soon and fix all of these issues. Otherwise I will not be buying another game from WB ever again.\n\n\n\n\n","July 1, 2015","false","48.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justAEA/recommended/208650/","justAEA","justAEA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justAEA/","745 products in account","Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Arkham Asylum and City. They're among my favorite games (City being my all time favorite). So naturally I was very excited for this game. I had full faith in Rocksteady after their previous works but unfortunately, they ♥♥♥♥ed up. Arkham Knight is one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. You probably already know how horrible the port is, so I'm not going to talk about that. I'll focus on the game itself.\n\nLet's start with the story. I personally didn't like it. I found it cliche and boring. There is not a single memorable moment in the entire campaign. It is unbelievably cliche. Same with villains. Scarecrow was awesome in Asylum. Here, he is a joke. He doesn't do anything, just talks about fear. Arkham Knight is even worse. He is very boring and weak. He calls you a coward but hides behind an army of drones. His 'boss battles' are terrible. His identity is ridiculously obvious. If you have the slightest comic book knowledge you'll immediately know who he is and if not don't worry, game tells you who he is way before it is actually revealed. Also SPOILER ALERT I'm really sick of these people's obsession with Joker. I get it he's a good villain but he doesn't need to be the main villain in all Batman games. Oh yeah, you thought this was about Arkham Knight? Nope! Joker is the main villain again. ♥♥♥♥ you Rocksteady.\n\nGameplay is also kinda messed up. Many people claim it's the best in the series but it's not. It has a few nice improvements and it has much more depth but it lacks the smoothness that made Asylum and City so great. Input drops, attacking an armored enemy instead of the normal enemy right next to him, losing combo for no reason are only some of these problems. The new environmental takedowns look cool but they are unreliable. Sometimes they cause you to drop your combo for no reason. Same with picking weapons from ground. The detection on these thing was so bad, I stopped using them after a while. Also the camera during combat felt a little more zoomed in than previous games and it often caused me to lose my combo. I also hated the new big enemies. They're essentially the armored enemies from City but they're so hard to distinguish in the heat of combat. In City, they wore red vests so you'd immediately spot them. Here, they look like regular enemies but just bigger. Fear takedown is also a new addition, it looks cool but its implementation is awful. Forget about relying on that thing. Anytime I wanted to use a fear takedown in a tight spot Batman just punched air and got me killed.\n\nOf course the big new thing in this game is the batmobile. It's fun for a bit but it's way overused. You use it to get around, solve puzzles, fight tanks. Game forces it on you so much. You can't take two steps without it and I'm sorry but that's just stupid. Just like Riddler race tracks. I mean, just think about it. Riddler creating race tracks for batmobile. Nice one Rocksteady.\n\nArkham City had great side missions. Admittedly, they were a little repetitive. What I mean is, they mostly consisted of doing the same thing 3-4 times. Arkham Knight takes this to a ridiculous level. Almost every side mission in the game has you doing the same thing time after time again. Specially those god damn Militia missions. They're just a cheap way to increase the game's length in my opinion.\n\nRemember challenge maps? They're gone. They are replaced with AR challenges and these suck. You cannot play as other characters in them and they have awful blue walls around them. So disappointing. There is only one fun AR challenge and you don't even play as Batman in that one. More than half of these damn things are for batmobile. We get it Rocksteady. You're really proud of that damn tank. Stop shoving it to our faces.\n\nIf you've made it this far you probably noticed I suck at long reviews and I agree with you. So I'll stop here. Batman Arkham Knight is a terrible port, it has a boring, cliche story, good but not good enough combat, way too much batmobile, the worst villains of the series, awful side missions (a couple exceptions) and a very disappointing ending. Way to end your legacy Rocksteady.\n","September 21, 2015","false","149.9"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","23","30","3","8"

But the game is really bad optimized, i mean really. When i started to play the game i found out it's capped to 30 fps, but you can change it in the game files. but the problem is that when you drive around in the Batmobile you get around 10-15 FPS! And that is really BAD, because you don't want to play a game where you only have 10-15 FPS, you can't play a game with 10-15 FPS! So before you buy this game be ready for FPS lag, i would say you should wait for patching!\n\nBut because Batman Arkham Knight has such a great story i would give it a 7/10.

Let me make a list of everything wrong with this game.\n\n-Locked 30 FPS\n-Lack of graphical options\n-Horrible performance and frame drops\n-Graphic glitches (texture bugs/artifacts)\n-Constant crashes\n-Small, inexperienced team ported the game (12 people developed this PC port)\n\nSo the game is locked at 30 FPS, and can easily be unlocked in a config file, but is cleary locked considering at anything above 30 fps you get constant FPS drops and it becomes an unplayable stuttery mess. I have a mid-range system too, nothing too high-end, but I should be able to mange 60 FPS at the lowest settings at 720p (Core i5 4690k, R9 270, 8gb Ram) but nope, at 720p low settings, I do sometimes get 60 FPS, but if I even move I drop to 40-30 FPS, and it becomes hard to do, anything really. It is VERY noticable while driving too, and it just becomes a headache. There are also only 3 standard graphic options (leaving out gameworks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), texture quality, which only has 2 settings, low and normal, shadow quality, which is low-high, and Level of Detail, which is also low to high. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed. This game shows EVERYTHING that is wrong with modern PC ports and this needs to change.\n\nAs stated before, this is one of my new favorite games, but when it comes down to it, this is just an unacceptable port.\n\n*Edit: Will update after a patch is released for a more "proper" review of the game.","July 1, 2015","false","6.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

This is something that Rocksteady takes very seriously. We are working closely with our external PC development partner ." They did not even have the decency to por the game within their own studios. The final nail in the coffin is the fact that they neglected to tell pc users that they would be using Denuvo DRM. In the end sure I got a free game but maybe next time they should give their consumers full disclosure so when making 329 dollar decsions they will think twice and buy a different brand video card. I was excited that it came with two free games one of them being the witcher which has had no real issues and the other bineg this broken game.

I can't get to the main menu because the game is lagging so badly. I am sure that this problem will be patched soon, but I stayed up late on a monday to play it tonight. I payed for their game and their ridiculously overpriced season pass to get all of the pre-order bonouses in hopes to play tonight. I read some other reviews and others are having similar problems.

They put a 30 fps cap on a 2015 tripple A game? Companies that make these kind of decisions are a cancer to the PC gaming comunity. They could have done a better job on optimizing and I am incredibly disappointed.\n\nBut on the plus side, once you remove the frame cap it plays like any other game except I was wondering how the combat system changed from the gameplay trailer?\n\nSo overall I cannot recomend this game due to the poor optimization, the 30 fps cap and the missing features. Once all of this is fixed I will update my recomendation.\n\nUpdate #1:\n6/30/2015\nSo 10 hours into the game I have noticed 1 bug where a tank was stuck in the floor and I have noticed 1 fps drop... Then again I am running this game on a 980 ti and on an ssd, but I can't imagine every gamer being fortunate enough to afford such a crazy setup. I still can't recommend this game just because Rocksteady really blew it. We still don't have a date for the fix which is horrible.\n\nOne way for Rocksteady to fix this would be to add special features to the PC version like maybe Ultra (8k?) textures, additional free content, maybe make the season pass free or why not just all of those thing? The launch of this game was a huge disappointment to the PC gaming community and even though I enjoy every second of this game I honestly can't recommend it until we get a proper functioning game with an apology and some kind of compensation.\n\nUpdate #2:\n7/7/2015\nAfter 18 hours finally defeated the main story arc and a couple side quests. I have had exactly 3 crashes which were higly annoying but not so tragic for 18 hours of gameplay. Experienced 1 texture pop. Other than that I can't really complain a lot, I mean sure they should have optimized te game a lot better but it worked for me. Rocksteady made an amazing game, everything from the visuals to the story are amazing and I can't wait to recommend this game to everybody as soon as they fix it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceReacher/recommended/208650/","SpaceReacher","Spacey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceReacher/","246 products in account","There is no savior..no more hope..no more Batman.\nIn the final installment (hopefully) of rocksteady's Arkham series you play as Batman (obviously) faced with the reality that the Joker is finally dead. We see Batman differently in this game, he's losing it, his mind, his power, his reality. When Scarecrow threatens Gotham with a new toxin, it leaves the city in the control of the criminals, the police barely struggling to keep order. Batman needs to even the odds.\n\nI'll start off this review by telling you that I had no known issues with my copy of the game. I removed the FPS cap and it ran smoothly, except for one crash. While I can't be too upset on this front, I must admit that it does upset me that others weren't able to play this on day one. Regardless, this review is about the game, not the launch.\n\n\nPros:\n\nGameplay[/h1]\n\nThe combat is as smooth as expected from rocksteady. This carries over into the Batmobile. When you first get into the driver's seat and accustomed to the controls you'll be surprised at how well it works. Both modes. Passive and Aggressive. Each one has it's own set of moves, gadgets, abilities and more to choose from. You'll progress through the game getting more upgrades to help your sense of superiority.\n\nStory[/h1]\n\nStarting from months after the Joker has been creamated, You (Batman) begin to have maddening halluncinations wreck your brain as you go from area to area, creeping closer to the inevitable loss of your sanity. Backed by the reapperance of Scarecrow, You are pushed to his limit in this game. Or at least as much as he could be. You're a bit darker, a bit more crazy, a bit more insane. The story works, it does, from minor events to the more major, everything feels like something Batman would have to deal with.\n\nMusic[/h1]\n\nNick Arundel has done it again. The music has tones of the orgininal, mixed in with it's own idiviulaity feeling. You'll get a blend of a little bit of the old mixed with the new. The music doesn't outshine at any parts in the game. The soundtracks is Batman's own. It's hard not to easily fall in love with it.\n\nVoice Acting[/h1]\n\nKevin Conroy, as per usual gives us an amazing and vibrantly dark Batman voice. Mark Hamill returns and haunts your character. In more than one way. The voice acting is done nice, while a couple lines did feel forced in the beginning, it seemed to work itself out by the end.\n\nArtwork and Locations[/h1]\n\nGotham returns bigger and more impressive than Asylum and City. You can even see Arkham City in the back. The main three islands will keep you busy with flashy signs and dreary landscapes, skylines that were meant for Gotham are there. The whole city has this..gloomy feel that works well with the overall game.\n\nReplay Value[/h1]\n\nGetting in a total of 33+hours by completion, I can say that there is a New Game+ which if I wanted, I could go back and do it all again, and I just might. I'll be tracking down the rest of the riddles until then. But, still..it's a positive that there are the usual VR challenges that can keep you coming back, trying to beat yourself or your friend's scores.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n\nRepetitive[/h1]\n\nWhile progressing through the game, you'll receive missions. From stopping Two-Face from robbing Gotham dry or destroying Penguin's gun caches. You'll notice a pattern form.\n<Introduce bad guy> ...\n<Do bad guy missions> ...\n<Complete and apprehend bad guy> ... While this is nice, they used this formula for almost every "Top-Tier" robber/baddie. None of them felt intimating by the time I took them back to GCPD.\n\nBosses[/h1]\n\nThere are none. It's a tedious chore to take down the criminals. For example, Firefly.. you go from fire station to fire station, using the Batmobile's winch to extinguish the fires until the man who set them comes bursting out. You chase him in your ride until his fuel bar has been depleted, ejecting and tackling him, beating him down, he flies off. You do this three times before eventually removing his Jet pack. This..is not a boss battle. None of them were. There wasn't the satisfactory feeling of Killer Croc's fight, or Freeze's inventive battle. No moments where I was caught off guard or pleasantly surprised for good reason.\n[/list]\n\nConclusion:Batman™: Arkham Knight is a game I wanted to love. That I wanted to recommend. I simply can't when there are two others, maybe even three other Batman games (asylum, city and maybe even origins) that I could recommend for more bang for your buck. I can recommend playing this game, I just can't recommend getting it at the current price tag for a couple reasons. Save your money for a sale, wait for GOTY edition. This is a good wrap up to the Arkham series, just not as great and explosive as you think it will be. Go into this game with a lot of skepticism.","June 29, 2015","false","35.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

This is why the score is a Not Recommended.http://youtu.be/oQufkohUPwo\nGame: Batman: Arkham Knight\nGenre: Action-Adventure Open World\nDeveloper: Rocksteady Studios\nPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\nCopy supplied by Nvidia\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight is the final instalment in the open world action-adventure superhero franchise that started in 2009, and is developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.\n\nSTORYNine months after the events of Arkham City, the Scarecrow developes an improved and deadlier version of his fear toxin and threatens to release it in the city of Gotham. The police evacuates all the civilians and stays behind to arrest all the criminals that are destroying the city and to help Batman capture Scarecrow and the other supervillains (Two Face, Penguin, Riddler, etc.). Also, there is a new enemy in town: the Arkham Knight, someone who built an army and invaded Gotham with the sole objective to kill the Batman.\nDoes this sound interesting? Yes, it does. Is it entertaining? Not really. While it starts strong, the story gets boring really fast: they try to make you care about multiple characters from the comics that barely made cameos in the previous games, the villains do almost nothing at all, the Arkham Knight's reveal is a huge disappointment and the 100% completion ending doesn't make much sense. Fortunately, the saving grace is the presence of an old character that comes back during the game, elevating the quality of the story quite a lot for me.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game looks spectacular: huge city full of details and easter eggs, constant rain, beautiful animations and varied environments make this one of the prettiest games ever. However, as we all know the PC version also features missing features and painful optimization: even though I modified the .ini files and used a tweak tool, there are still many problems with the performance. And this is without talking about all the glitches that are present, like enemies disappearing inside walls, objectives that don't activate, entire riots of enemies that run away.\nNote that this section will be updated once WB and Rocksteady fix everything, but we can't forgive them for this barely playable first release.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe melee combat is mostly unchanged: you attack and counter enemies in brawl, while also adopting different attacks depending on which enemy you are fighting. Some nice improvements are the possibility to punch downed enemy without losing your combo, grabbing bats and other weapons to deal more damage and to use environmental kills. In some sections you are also helped by Robin, Catwoman or Nightwing, who are playable for a small amount of time each.\nThe open world is vast and features many tropes of recent Ubisoft games: control a tower, defeat strongholds, find collectibles. Fortunately, the varied environments, vibrant city and multiple side missions make this an enjoyable experience: gliding around the city, finding Azrael, looking for Riddler Trophies, saving firemens and helping the GCPD makes you really feel like you are the Batman.\nAnd now, to the most diving section of the gameplay: the Batmobile. When I started playing, I loved it: it runs fast but you always feel fully in control, the combat controls are tight and precise and there are some interesting implementations in some puzzles. However, after 10 hours where you have spent over half of your time shooting tanks and chasing cars, it gets really annoying. The game becomes repetitive, and because of the Batmobile's presence, all of the boss fights have been changed with big tanks to blow up, and stealth sections have been reduced way too much.\nWhile there are some nice additions, the side missions are very interesting and varied and the open world is fun to explore, the Batmobile is shoved down our throats and it becomes the most annoying element in the game, sucking most of the fun out of it.\n\nCHALLENGEEven though I started on Hard, the game is very easy to beat: I found the fights shorter and easier to win, the stealth sections with many covers and AI that wanders alone, the Batmobile chases repetitive and the tank sections a dodge-and-shoot borefest.\n\nSOUNDKevin Conroy, Troy Baker, Jonathan Banks, Grey Griffin and many other voice actors come back to the game, and they all work very well. The sound effects are great as always, as well as having the same powerful punching sound effects. The Batmobile also sounds fantastic, resembling the sounds featured in the Christopher Nolan trilogy. Nick Arundel also comes back as composer, and does a fantastic job enhancing your Batman experience.\n\nREPLAYABILITYOpen world full of activities, New Game+ mode, 79 achievements, upcoming DLC and a ridiculous amount of Riddler challenges make this a game that us fans will keep playing for a long time.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game only when its technical issues have been fixed. Right now, the large amount of bugs, poor performance and missing graphical features don't make this a worthwile purchase. Also, the overuse of the Batmobile and uninteresting story will put off many players, making them miss the better paced previous installments. I wanted to love this game. I love all the others, and I went into this with high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics: 5\nGameplay: 7.5\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 8.5\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 8\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","August 7, 2015","false","29.2"," 43 of 67 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","43","67","5","0"

I still think the Arkham games are a must play for anyone who likes games, console of P.C.  I even went as far as playing through this game even when it first released just because I have a huge appreciation for what the Arkham games brought the table when it comes to world building, art and game design.  With that said, the release of this game was a sham.  The game was unplayable for a huge chunk of the P.C. fanbase and even those of us who could play it had to deal with countless issues.  The season pass was shady, as usual, and months later we've come to find that the DLC that we got was just... disappointing- barely adding anything worth experiencing.\n\nBugs and DLC aside, the game itself is a bit of a disappointment.  The story feels flat and unsatisfying, Riddler is extra annoying with his unnecessarily large amount of trophies and really out of place Riddler races.  The Batmobile was a thing you were forced with deal with rather than a fun addition to the game.  The cast seems interesting and promising but fails to deliver; I really wanted to see more of Robin and Catwoman, Batman's interaction with his constantly-falling-appart family, anything.  It's the last game in the series, give the fans closure... but no.  Instead there's a repetitive and predictable story filled with the same tropes and structure anyone who's read a Batman comic in the past 10 years has seen over and over again.\n\nWith that said, the gameplay is still good ol' Arkham.  Combat is still fun and snappy, beating up thug after brainless thug is still satisfying.  The game is gorgeous when it wants to be and the art design is still awesome.  I guess that's a plus.  Let's face it, if you're a fan of the series you're probably going to get the game anyway but, as much as it pains me to say it, I would hold on to that thought.  Wait until it's in a better condition or even better, wait for a very deep discount.","November 1, 2015","false","45.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Apart from the poorly performance of this port (hey we give you a game with your graphic card, that you cant run), it hurts me almost physical how aggresively the DLC politic is shoved down our throats. "Season pass here, pre order bonus there. Join our useless portal to get exclusive stuff." its like you have to visit the grandma who cant stands you and feeds you with all stuff of bad candy. It just feels wrong in every way.\n\nAnd dont let me start on the first impression I got from the stuff I saw so far in game. I mean, I loved the 2 other Arkham games from Rocksteady, but it just seems, like they run out of ideas and said "f*ck it, lets put the Batmobile into it". Yeah a lot of people want to drive that massive vihicle, but there is a huge different in "wanting" and "have to". Apart from that, the controls of the Dark Knights biggest toy, feels sluggish. But to be fair, that is just a first impression, maybe its something I can get used to.\n\nOh and the graphical options are a freaking joke, like only the Clown of Crime could pull off. Most options can only be changed after restarting the game. The description of the different options are as transparent as a brick wall. Anti Alliasing = Yes - No...Really?\n\nMaybe, just maybe this will all be fixed, after a glorious Patch-Festival, but for now, dont buy that thing. In fact, that dlc policy that WB pulls of, only justifies a heavely discounted all in one version.

It's quite a play it safe sequel in terms of new features and story. Story constantly teases the whole "how far will Batman go? Will he break this time?”. Story to me is a bit of a let-down, the trailers made it out to be that all these major villains are joining forces to kill Batman, when in reality it's just Scarecrow and Arkham knight, with the other villains just being side missions...quite repetitive ones at that. There is no sense of danger throughout the game, yes Scarecrow is threatening to blow up a chemical bomb, yes Arkham Knight has a whole militia in Gotham...but there is no one in Gotham....just a few thugs going for a joy ride. At least in City you felt some sense of urgency with Batman's declining health and the countdown to protocol 10, you had this feeling that you have to win against the odds. In this game, none of that.\n\nGameplay wise, I can't complain, everything to love about the Arkham games is here and improved. More enemy types, more gadgets, better adaptive AI. It's fine, although a tad easy at times. You can take a lot of punishment, to a point stealth is pointless in some predator areas....not all but some. Batmobile is....meh? It's cool to drive around and how it moves around the city is pretty cool, you feel like you are in some badass tank/sports car. How it's used in the game? Some of the puzzle sections are quite fun and do require thought but part of me wished there was a bit less of it. Towards the end of the game it felt like a chore. My main complaint of gameplay are the damn tank battles...why? So many tedious tank battles...I haven't felt this bored from a side activity since the tower defence in assassin's creed revelations. Again, it's fine early on, but after a while they don't up the difficulty they just make you fight hordes of tanks to a point it’s just mashing the fire button while sliding left and right.\n\nHaven't mentioned anything about the PC port being god awful....It's embarrassing that a AAA title which was released back in June is stilling being patched. The game was playable enough for me to get what I wanted from it...which wasn't much. Regardless, it’s pitiful and no excuse can be made for releasing a game in the condition it was in.\n\nOnce it’s patched up and fixed, I would say it’s an ok game. Better than Origins, not as good as the first two games. If you want more Batman, get it. The open world is fun and at times you do feel like batman, just feels like there was a lot more to be desired, or maybe they probably squeezed all they could out of the franchise. Just a shame it ended the way it did for PC gamers, even when they fix this game, to me it will always be known as that ok Batman game which was a terrible port. It’s like a big fart.\n\n6/10-For all you number people\n","October 24, 2015","false","29.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

We all know who that is and he has done more work than entire Rocksteady and WB combined.\n\nSo 4 months have past and the interim patch broke my game much worse than the previous patch. So it was even more broken, once again I was forced to use community patches done by community and not WB and Rocksteady. Then today comes and I am expecting to play DLC's.\n\nAs you can see from my playtime I already pushed over 100Hrs into this game. Well guess what, I have troubleshooted multiple times and yet to recieve all said DLC supposed to be released today. I was expecting to be able to play DLC's but that is not the case. From what I read on Forums the Season Pass holders have some serious issues and have been pretty much scandaled.\n\nNow Pros\n-Game runs decent if you lower your settings and not overdo things. Gameworks look good.\n-Story was very well done and even the Riddler challenges were decent.\n-When game ran smoothly on launch for me game mechanics were amazing and fluid.\n-Lots of funny references and well done comedy.\n-Unexcepted Ending though depends what you think is good.\n\nCons\n-Rain textures still buggy, Only work every once in while.\n-Gamework options are horrible for performance and should not even be touched or turned on period\n-Game runs worse then launch day.\n-SLI is still not fixed for those with said setup\n-Villian claimed to be original isn't at all but a lie. Die Hard Fans Know him very well\n-WB support is horrendious\n-Apparently game now needs 12GB of RAM on Win 10. This is not realistic at all.\n-DLC Content not fully released to Season Pass Holders\n-Compensation done by WB is worthless if a diehard fan. If you own the games then your out of luck.\n-Promises still being broken and patch notes released are not even patch notes but a joke.\n\nAll said and done I would not recomment this game to anyone and if you have a console then get it for that instead. PC right now has been treated poorly and WB has done nothing but lie through their teeth. Many Claims made and promises broken. Releasing the game with no performance gains is unacceptable. Many have claimed performance has yet to change.\n\n===New Information===\nAfter almost 6 hours DLC content is now downloading and can't wait to play said DLC's. Though I hear that for some game is even more broken now with DLC's installed so I am crossing my fingers hoping I do not fall into that category. Though even with DLC's finally being released finally I still would not recommend buying this game for PC. Get it for Console since it works marvelously on that since the PC community was not a priority.\n\nI will state though the story is fantastic and a masterpiece but sadly ruined by many of the game issues that plague this version. You can get the game running much better but you have to go really far out of your way to get the fixes and at least doable.\n\n===Additional Update===\nAfter playing the game after its re-release I will say the game still needs massive fixes.Without using 3rd party help from specific topics in Batman Arkham Knight forum this game would still be heavily unplayable for many.\n\nThough WB recently announced that until the end of 2015 refunds through steam and only purchased through steam are available to get full refund without worry of your playtime. I have obtained my refund and is still pending but time will only tell if the game gets any more serious fixes. On top of that WB also mentioned that they will speak to the community about things that apparently can not be fixed in the game. Reason why I got my refund. This is a warning flag in my mind and so be wary of this title. Tried playing the DLC's but some like the Red Hood DLC kept crashing and I felt there was no story with that DLC. Just mostly you fighting a bunch of enemies and majority of the Vehicle skins can only be used in racing which is a shame.","October 28, 2015","false","119.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

If I leave the game locked at 30fps, the game is "playable".  No massive hangs or anything, but there's still lots of terrible textures and low-detail models being used when the game can't stream in the better quality stuff on time.  Frame rate drops to low 20s every so often.  Motion Blur seems to add a slight delay, leading to everything feeling sluggish...  5.1 Surround audio is ignored for some voices, but not others, which is very disorienting.  etc etc etc\n\nAll you need to know is it's one of the worst PC ports I've ever seen, and unless there's some miracles coming, I don't know how even half a dozen patches gets to this to acceptable levels.  I really hope this game is playable some day, but I'm not holding my breath.

I bought it recently and have played about 20 hours. I haven't had a single glitch in that time. Follow the recommended specs, and you should be fine.\n\nFor the game itself, it's both good and bad. I still like Asylum the best of the series. I think it was actually the right size in terms of gameplay with a good progression overall to both main and side quests. This game is enormous, and it's really not always in a good way.\n\nFirst, the good:\n\nThe Batmobile is pretty awesome. I was genuinely surprised. I thought it would by clunky and pointless like most attempts to add vehicles into established series are, but it actually plays really well. I think the chase side missions involving the batmobile are some of the most fun in the game. The pseudo-destruction reaped upon the city as you mow down statues and cleave off corners of walls adds to the feeling that you're driving an incredibly powerful machine. Mowing down an entire riot of baddies sending them flying in all directions is also entertaining. It's over-powered, but the game compensates for that by locking off encounters that should be fought without it.\n\nThe new types of side missions are also cool. I like the addition of the flying drones, and the takedown method for them is clever. The different types of bad guys are managed well, and there are lots of creative opportunities for playing around with your abilities.\n\nThe Mediocre:\n\nThe story has its good points, but a lot of it is really melodramatic and predictable. Harley Quinn's voice is the single most annoying thing ever created. Picture everything she says as voiced by Jar Jar for added entertainment value. The way The Joker is handled is a lot of fun. I think that's the most entertaining part of the story. The part that's trying to be a Nolan movie just fell on its face for me. Yea, I get it already. Joker/Batman represent an ethical duality where they're both really two sides of the same coin. They exist outside the law pursuing their own view of the world at the expense of society based solely on their own beliefs. Blah blah blah. Please stop beating me over the head with it like it's not a simple, well-trodden idea. It works really well when they treat it as satire. The Joker has some great moments openly mocking you or egging you on. A number of times I wished I could actually choose to do what he suggested. That would've made a much better game in my opinion. There's also some good chatter of the generic bad guys commenting on elements of the world or just their own generic nature. When it tries to take itself seriously, it becomes dull in its trauma.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThis game is huge. This seems like a weird thing to cite as bad, but it's so absurdly large that it becomes genuinely aggravating. The side quests are the biggest example. There's an entire wheel of side quests. I'm not sure how many there are exactly, but I'd estimate around 20. They're not just go somewhere, do the thing, and finish the quest type of deals. You go do the thing, and then five more of that thing appear an hour later. So you go do those five, but then still five more appear another hour later. After fifteen to twenty-five of them, you might finally be done. That's the case for nearly every single one of the twenty different side quests. Some things aren't even official side quests but still need to be eliminated anyway like the aerial drones.\n\nSo you clear out a sector of the map. Then you progress in the story a little, and all of a sudden that sector isn't clear anymore. It's not filled with something new and cool though. It just has a few more of exactly the same time-consuming thing you already cleared out the first time. It's fun clearing out the aerial drones the first 5-8 times. When they start appearing four more at a time in the late game, it's just painful. The checkpoints would also be fun just a few times, but there are like 40 of them to clear out. Many of the side quests are really just the same thing in a "different situation." Rescuing firefighters, clearing military checkpoints, and clearing out watchtowers all involve taking out exactly the same clustered group of baddies in basically the same way. You're just doing it for a supposedly different goal. Every single one of those will have to be done so many times to fulfill their own quests that you'll have no desire to finish them. My hat is off to anyone who has 100% this game. That's a Sisyphean task to me.\n\nIt goes further. There are 243 riddler puzzles. I kid you not. I'm actually bored just by the idea of going after them all. It's obvious someone just went through the map after they finished this massive city and stuck a trophy in every single place you could possibly fit one. It's obnoxious. All of this goes against basic game design principles. Have a clear and varied progression that increases in challenge. Most of the content in this game is the same thing over and over. The unfortunate part of that is it really takes away from the parts of the game that are well-designed and do present a varied challenge. I understand they were trying to make a huge epic conclusion, but they really cluttered it up and made it shallow by throwing in too much of the same kinds of content.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nOverall I recommend it. I paid about $13 for it on sale, and I think I got more than enough good content for my money. I'd pay up to $20 for it. Pay the price tag if you really love the series and know you can run it. The story isn't bad and does have both fun and cool moments. The batmobile is awesome to play with, and the city is fun to fly around sporadically wrecking baddies. Explore the more varied content until you feel like you've seen everything you want to, and then quit. Much of the extra content and side quests quickly become overly similar and boring. Don't plan to 100% the game. For reference, I did 100% Asylum and loved it. I wouldn't recommend even trying to 50% this one in terms of completing all side quests and clearing all sectors. It's not a fun task. Play through the main story and explore, and you'll have a good time with it. I'd say 7/10 for a rating.","April 9","true","20.2"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","7"

WB release broken game. Hideously broken. Unplayable for most users. They released it KNOWING this. Huge public outcry, so they pull game from shelves. They then sit virtually incommunicado for 4 months and release a patch that actually makes it WORSE fro some users. More silence. Two months later they put it back on sale after another patch, recommend that you have a MINIMUM 12 GB of RAM to run the game, release DLC they charge a fortune for despite it being uniformly crap, and offer as recompense free copies of the other Arkham games which 90% of purchasers already own.\n\nI bought the season pass. I didn't get a refund, thinking (wrongly) that users would have the right thing done by them. I already own EVERY Arkham game, so for my patience and loyalty I get absolutely NOTHING. The behaviour of WB has been nothing short of disgusting. On these reasons alone I do not recommend you buy this or any other WB/Rocksteady game EVER. Play them if you like (and I'm sure you know how to arrange this) but do not give them your money. They simply do not deserve it.\n\nAs for the game itself...aside from the stuttering cutscenes, the way the dialogue that can't quite keep up with the graphics, and the frame drops (and I'm running a system with 32GB RAM and twin 4GB cards but dual cards areen't supported lol) and the tearing, and all the extra NVIDEA effects that cripple frame rate....it's ok. The timing on the combat seems out but you get used to it, the batmobile is cool enough but overused (oh and you can't use the DLC skins for it in game, only in the stupid "races" which are just obstacle courses). The map is huge but a lot of it doesn't have much to do in it, aside from speeding past it in the batmobile. The story is ok, The gadgets are ok. The DLC is terrible - you can't even use all the costumes in game except in the AR challenges. Some of the new enemy types - medics, those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with drones - are a nice addition.As for the mystery of the Arkham Knight? Took me 5 minutes to get it right. Ho hum.\n\nIs it anywhere as near as good as Asylum or City? No. If you want a good Batman game buy those. If you already own those get Shadow of Mordor (which is excellent just don't waste your time on the DLC) - the gameplay is essentially the same with a fantasy twist, you actually have to THINK to take down Captains,  the story is great and the Nemesis system adds a brillaint new mechanic.\n\nIf Arkham Knight was super cheap - under $10 - and you have 12GB of RAM - MAYBE. But frankly just don't give your money to WB, and play something else - there's a ton of far more deserving games and publishers out there. Buy Phantom Pain or ARmello or that Rocket soccer car game everyone seems to like. Hell give the money to a homeless guy or your favorite charity. Flush it down the toilet. Buy some meth. Whatever floats your boat. Just don't give a publisher that thinks treating customers like ♥♥♥♥ is ok any of your hard earned cash. Vote with your wallets, it's the only way they will learn.\n\nAnd Warner Bros. ♥♥♥♥ YOU. You're on the List.","October 29, 2015","false","57.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

In game, the only time im experiencing the 60 fps is when i'm running around and during combat. Get in the batmobile, get slammed with drops to around or below 30fps (maybe thats why they capped it at 30??? Because its super noticible when transitioning to on foot).

You can easily fix it with a quick googe search, so it's good now, right? Kinda... Not really...\nThe game is not well optimized, we need some stutter fix. When i just spin the camera i drop from everything between from 68 to 21 FPS. Super annoying when i'm gliding, as it can drop to even 1 FPS. I even used the performance test in the game and got solid 48+ FPS atleast, it looked smooth and quite sexy. Not what i get in the game though, it's not as sexy. :/\n\nAs long as it is like this, i do not want to recommend it. But atleast in the little sequence where i got into a fight, it was good, it felt like Batman combat, smooth 40 FPS, hehe...\n\nEDIT:\nOther than that let's review the rest of the game.\nAs of now i've gotten a bit more play time, so i'll break down somme of the elements in the game.\n\nCombat:\nI love it. The basic combat is easy and satisfying, it looks smooth and cool and you just land a sick punch after another. There are some more advanced combat, where you can sneak upon enemies and take them down easily in a chain from 3 to 5, a mechanic that makes it easier to take down armed enemies and it's a reward for stelathing.\n\nThe Batmobile:\nIt looks amazing, it's such a massive tool and has a beautiful design. The driving however, feels too heavy, it feels like you're driving a boosted tank, steering it is kinda weird, but powersliding works fine. There is however a combat mechanic in the batmobile where you kind of control it like a 4-legged sliding robot. This mechanic feels great, really. You can strafe with small boosters and steer through tight spaces easily and your winch to pull down stuff on the map is awesome.\n\nStory so far: SPOILERS, maybe?\nI'm still just in the beginning, but the main villain is Scarecrow(I love Scarecrow) and it's about his new chemical experiment(zombies, kind of?) and so far the interaction and cutscenes are pretty cool. I must say, it gets you in the story fast and keeps going like that as of now.\n\nGraphics:\nThis game is beautiful. On High ofcourse. It does look good Low, but you can see the lack of details up close, especially on the batsuit. The rain/weather looks good enough to make a darker atmosphere.\nBut as it is poorly optimized i'm running my game on Low still. Could go High, but too many frame drops in movement.\n\nMemory:\nIt's a really RAM heavy game.\nI have 8Gb of RAM. While playing on Low and no AA. 3 Monitors, no programs other than Steam open. ~85% memory usage. Open Google Chrome, 95-100%. Just a heads up.\n\nPS. Will edit as the game gets updates and I get further in the story.","June 22, 2015","false","10.3"," 40 of 63 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","40","63","7","0"

Don't be fooled: the problems with this port are not subtle. They cannot be explained away simply by claiming that the issues are uncommon and weren't uncovered by play testing. I have a 980 ti, one of the most high end and expensive cards available for purchase. I had to turn down the settings to achieve a playable frame-rate. In one instant I'll be at 60-70+ fps, and a second later, I'll be at 25, with no difference in the action on-screen.\n\nOh, and don't forget, the only reason I was able to go over 30 is because I manually changed a config file that states any frame rate over 30 will make the game unstable. It blows my mind that a company would release a product in this state. It's all about greed. They are confident they can take your money, release an apology, and take their time fixing the most glaring issues in an economical way.

Install graphics card. Play games at max settings at 60 fps give or take a few. Nvidia is nice enough to give me a free game to test out my new card. Pre load game yesterday. Can't wait because I love this series.  Load the graphics settings. First thing I do is turn v-sync off. Then look at how little settings there are to change. Turn everything up to max and run pc diagnostic test . Runs from 61 fps to 156 fps through testing. Play game. I notice my frames cannot go above 30. I make sure I turned v sync off. Yep, it was off. Contemplated in my head that they actually caped a PC game.... Hour goes by and game crashes. Reload game and storm knocks my power out...... Turn PC back on and run game. still 30 fps. go to reviews and sure enough it was locked. Damn consoles.  Edit file to uncap the fps. 0/10 would not want to do a work around again. U wot Rocksteady?\n\nPS: Game runs ok, not great. Fps can dip to 30 fps in some areas. The game has crased five times on me, all being during a riddilers challenge. I like the main story so far.

I think we all know that.\nBut it's gotten a lot of work since then.\nIt's not perfect - I've had a total of 4 crashes (all while gliding in the air, oddly), the Batmobile controls could use some fine-tuning, camera glitches and zooms weirdly when flying the Remote Batarang through vents, performance isn't great, and some of the Riddler challenges are frustrating as heck - but it's still worth buying.\n\nHaving just gotten 100% completion (First time I ever did that in an Arkham game), I can say that this is a worthy entry in the series.  Better than Arkham City for sure, probably better than the others as well. Gameplay is great, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous, the story and writing are as excellent as ever, and it's overall absolutely worth the price of admission.

Disappointed and a little angry that they plopped out this pile after so many delays.

Just picked it up in the sale and my god, it's like a whole new game. R9 290, i5-4690K, 8Gb mem, everything maxed except for shadows and it runs between about 45 to 60 FPS with very little stutter, or at least no more than I'm accustomed to from slapdash console ports. Which is to say, infrequent and bearable.\n\nIs the game any good though? I don't know, only played about two hours so far. What I do know is..... the combat feels like it has far less weight to it than in the previous games; it feels more fluid, looks far more badass with all the leaping and froing, but it also feels easier somehow and as a result less engaging.\n\nThe batmobile isn't great. I mean, I play batman games to swoop around above city streets like a giant armoured lunatic, stalking my prey with my ominous cloak flapping meancingly in the wind. I don't play them to drive around, running people over while failing handbrake turns into buildings. If I wanted to do that I'd reinstall GTAV. So, the fact that the button that always used to be detective mode has now been mapped to GET IN THE bloomin' BATVAN on the 360 controller.... yes. This creates comedy. Plus, it drives like an excitable sponge.\n\nGotham looks gorgeous. I'm quite looking forward to finally giving it an explore.\n\nAnyway, I'm going to give this a tentative thumbs up. Only because it's Batman, which is bound to be moneys worth, and it now works, and it's on sale. If the batbuggy bugs me out enough through the game I might reconsider, but right now, considering my play time, I see no reason to be churlish.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOkay, a couple of more hours in and I can happily say I'm having a blast. The batcart is not winding me up, in fact it feels quite well integrated into the game, the combat is just as much fun, and the story is beginning to suck me in. On this basis, that tentative thumbs up is a definate.","March 22","true","28.7"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

Frankly I play a ton of games both old and new, and rarely do I find a game to be just totally unplayable on any of my computers. It was a huge disappointment that this game had so many performance issues it was really unplayable to begin with, and even after their couple of patches it is barely playable with low fps in many areas and still some graphical artifacts.\n\nIf you do somehow manage to get the game running at a decent speed (which requires a better graphics card and more memory than any other game I have come across to even begin to play), then the game itself is okay but has seemed to me to be the weakest in the Arkham series since it ends up centered so much on requiring the batmobile. It is a lot of fun to have a new toy, but you are required to use it so much that it ends up feeling like a racing/tank shooter game half the time. The rest is pretty good and most of the things you liked about the previous games (if you haven't played them, you should) are still in there to some degree. I am sure it will be a great game in 5-10 years when it is patched either officially or unofficially the way it should be and when most people will actually have computers that will run it reliably.","October 28, 2015","false","16.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Let's get started:\n\nHOUR 1\n\nGame crashes on first launch, which is only fair as I seemed to be one of the few souls who got to play all 3 previous installments with zero technical issues.  Second time works, so I set about tweaking settings since my GTX 760 is not going to be able to handle this game on max.  Unfortunately, as messing around with these settings requires several restarts, this quickly becomes tedious as the game sticks diligently to its setting of launching succesfully 50% of the time.\n\nAdditionally, Geforce Experience seems to be on the fritz, so I decide to reboot the PC.  Nope, Geforce hates me too, so it's to time to uninstall him.  While waiting the mandated 20 minutes for that to happen, I go hunting for a fresh copy online, and with so much time on my hands, hit the forums for some light reading, upon which I learn that Geforce seems to not be doing so well in the customer satisfaction index side of things.  Thinking quickly, I decide to forego a software install and opt for just the drivers.  Whew, that was close!\n\nGoogle Chrome tells me that should be done in 2 hours (thanks to the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥mongering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dickless wondercunts at the DSL company).  I tried launching the game anyway, but the failure rate has rocketed up the charts, like a boy band single, to 100% currently.  I'm going to validate the files then see how many times I can launch the game while the driver downloads\n\nHOUR 2\n\nWell, the validation seems to have helped, but even with all the graphic settings turned down low, the game is still stuttering a lot, particularly with the driving, and the low-res textures are quite nasty, especially the outdoor thugs who are supposed to be wet from the rain and instead look like they're covered in tha goop from the pods in the Matrix.  Having said the Batmobile is hella cool and I can see how gorgeous this game would be if I wasn't trying to run it on a potato. Last but certainly not least, playing as batman himself feels like slipping on your favourite jacket.\n\nOne thing that surprised me is that with the bigger map and bigger streets, this is the first game in the series where I'm happy to just sometimes wander the streets on foot instead of zipping about with the batclaw or just sticking to the Batmobile.  The city feels a lot more real than the compact Arkham City and the semi-fake one from Arkham Origins.  I can't wait to explore.  time for some dinner, then a driver install, and we'll see what's what.\n\nMore to come...","June 23, 2015","false","62.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

Something we would wait for. Something we trusted Rocksteady to deliver on. How did you choose to reward this show of faith?

You'll point to console units shipped and worldwide sales totals as a counterpoint, but you know full well the truth. You won't be shocked as you hear your name spoken with barely-concealed scorn at trade shows. You'll be hurt, not insulted, that studios grow cold to your embrace. You'll understand that the bewildering, naive choices you made in handling such a beloved franchise will have chilling effects lasting years.

It's easy to get a Flawless Freeflow bonus when you get a solid minute to predict your enemies' next moves. I can run TF2 at 100+ FPS IN THE MIDDLE OF HEAVY COMBAT. I run Sniper Elite 3 and Max Payne 3 at 60+ FPS at all times. GTA V was PC optimized 100x better than this, despite it taking over a year to get it out there. At least Rockstar took the time to develop a product they knew we would love (graphics-wise, anyway). But one of the greatest video game series to ever be created gives us this f*cking sh*t port?

I loved the first two games (Origins was meh), and this one was certainly fun with the BatTank.\n\nBut damn it Iron Galaxy, this is one of the worst PC Ports in ages, and yes it is a port. In addition to the HORRID graphical glitches, framerate drops and others that have been mentioned by over 4000 reviewers, there's other glaring issues that show that whoever ported this doesn't know what they're doing.\n\nYou know the control scheme used in the first three games? Yeah that's completely gone now. Instead, takedowns have been relocated to "alt+1" from the usual places on the keyboard, so when you press e to try to take down badguys, you'll go "huh" as the auto-takedown move is now moved to a two step combo that forces you to think about it in the middle of combat.\n\nWant to drop down quickly? NOPE. Rocksteady decided to make use of that middle mouse button, and now it's been included in all "ducking into grates" or "dropping from ledges". Worse, trying to execute a drop attack from a ledge makes Batman just jump to the left on his perch if you're on a ledge for some reason.\n\nThe absolute worst part *SPOILER ALERT* is when you're in the Ace Chemical Plant trying to minimize the bomb's explosion radius. For some stupid reason, the devs thought it'd be fun to make Batman move HIGHLY VOLITILE chemicals in the form of one of the worst forced "mini-game" segments I've ever seen.\n\nI'm assuming with a controller you're suppposed to "slowly rotate" the analog stick to try to (and I kid you not) "slowly remove the chemicals while a weird conveniant sensor on top goes from green to red on how much moving is done" to "walking it over to another area" to "repeat proccess but backwards". If at any time the sensor is in the red you have to stop everything because any more movment causes you to explode and you have to do the damn segment ALL over again.\n\nIt's even worse wiith the mouse because the "control" scheme just shows the mouse, and if you jiggle your mouse back and forth it will most likely be too fast and cause you to EXPLODE. Even trying to rotate the mouse in tiny circles can cause the sensor to go from green to "ZOMG DON'T EXPLODE" last stage red.\n\nSo overall, this is a pathetic excuse for a PC port, and I don't reccomend getting it until they patch this thing hard.","June 24, 2015","false","45.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","3"

Don't EVER buy it, just to show developers that people are smarter than they think, so they won't be able to release a broken product just to fix it later. Go buy The Phantom Pain that is perfect in every way, or go buy Mad Max, that works perfectly at stable 60 fps on max settings and is fun to play. Stay away from this game even though they fixed it. It is the worst Batman game out of Arkham series (including Origins), and not because, but thanks to one of the worst launch ever. Because it wasn't working players where looking critically at the entire game, not just optimization, and oh boy it is bad. While the main story is a lot of fun (except for Arkham Knight, because this character was awful), but every other aspect is far from good. Every single side-quest is boring and univentive, the Batmobile is pushed down your throat until you scream "STOP!"\n\nDON'T buy this game.\n\nOLD: I was able to play it at 30 FPS (not stable) with GTX 960, FX-8320 and 8 Gb RAM... on lowest possible settings (and really low resolution) until it crashed 30 mins later.

They really lost track of who Batman is, some of the VO is subpar, the story is kind of weak in terms of the Arhkam Knight, WAY too much time was spent on the Batmobile and not things to do with it making missions tedious after the first two or three times, there are numerous times they take the Batman Mythos and just wipe their asses with it... much like they did with the PC players...\n\nEven If you're a die hard Batman fan, or even just a fan of this series, this game can easily wait until it's $7 on a steamsale.  Don't pay full price for this, and certainly don't waste money on DLC that you'll never see either.  Wait until it's all out AND on sale.","August 20, 2015","false","47.7"," 34 of 54 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","34","54","0","0"

However, this is *not* why I'm telling you not to buy this game.\n\nI imagined writing this review closer to Christmas, praising the game and giving Rocksteady/WB a verbose metaphorical pat on the back for taking the time to fix it fully. Unfortunately, the developers (or more likely, the publishers) have recently decided to forgo bringing the port up to par.\n\nTemperamental shader and texture glitches have been present and untouched since June. We will never have multiGPU support, and, more importantly, the game's horrible memory allocation - a side effect of heavy optimization compromises made for consoles - is never going to be improved.\n\nArkham Asylum, City and Origins are all great PC games which will be enjoyed for years to come. They're classics.\n\nAs it stands, Arkham Knight is still a mess. I'm not sure how anyone passionate about making games could submit a port of a game of this calibre to Steam, and then come out with this half-hearted "well, we tried" attitude to fixing it.","November 19, 2015","false","50.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

Do not buy it either if you feel publishers and developpers alike should put more care into their console ports. You'll not miss much anyway. It's an okay game, but certainly not a must-buy; pick it when it's on sale if you have 20/30 hours, money to sink, and nothing else to do. It's more of the same Arkham gameplay with even less detective or infiltration phases; that is to say it does not require any kind of effort. Having the Batmobile is nice, but it was a little overused for my taste, as what you do with it during the main campaign is always the same. If you want to fully complete the game, you will have to do all of Riddler's challenges, which is a chore.\n\nI haven't played the DLCs, and I certainly won't, so I cannot say anything about their quality.\n\n(Disclaimer: I got it for free as part of my new Nvidia GPU purchase, which means I was not angry like the people who legitimately were, as they paid full price for a game that was - and some would argue, still is - an unpolished turd.)","June 24, 2015","false","32.8"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","0"

I run an Intel i7 with 8 gigs of ram and a 4 gig GTX 960 and average around 55 FPS in 1080p on Win 7. There are some frame drops at certain times where a lot is going on but really not that big of a deal. The graphics are done with extreme detail even down to the assets. I understand the complaint from those who pre-ordered as I would not be happy either. Now I am not saying it is okay but we all make mistakes. Now to rate the game as a whole for what it is worth without a childish hop on the bandwagon review. I will talk about this game going forward for anyone who would like to purchase it.\n\nThe open world design grant a great backbone to this games development which also subsequently allows for DLC to be added into the game seamlessly. The vanilla "story" if you will is great with a twisted plot that any comic/batman fan should enjoy. You can attack many different scenarios in a way that suits your playing style. If your bored you can wander the streets like in a GTA game and cause havoc or in this case beat up some bad guys.\n\nNow how does the game run. My GPU is NOT overclocked and I get 55+ FPS 90% of the time. I can only imagine a 970/980/TITAN to be way better. This is with all my settings maxed out on high with the exception of the nvidia interactive smoke, fog, rain, etc which is disabled. Now if you don't have a 900 series GPU or 4+ gigs VRAM this is where it might get tricky. I does use most of my VRAM. I don't have a 750 ti so I can't compare. As I don't know how it will run on 2 gigs VRAM or the older GPUs. It may be a struggle. I can say that anything above a 960 4GB shouldn't get a complaint.\n\nI suggest every future reviewer leave your system specifications in the review so it can be judged for accuracy.","February 4","true","49.8"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

Yes, this is a WARNING. WB, Rocksteady, WHOEVER ported this over and WHOEVER did not fix these issues: I will not pre-order or buy a AAA title again unless this issue gets QUICKLY fixed. When I get my new computer in a couple of weeks, I will come back and give this game a proper review. Still, be warned. If you do not swiftly act and make this port top-notch soon, I will have to warn others (Although, who DOESN'T know how horrid this port is?), which can hurt your sales, and hurt other AAA sales. I'm sure others are already doing this.\n\nYOU CAN FIX THIS. You can make this right. Fix this port. Make us, your customers, happy.

Still as broken as it ever was, windows 7 + 8gb ram = memory leak after less than 5 minutes in the batmobile, a bit longer on foot/gliding. Game can easily be completely unplayable on your system due to a memory leak and there is not a thing you can do about it, even the dev team gave up on fixing this issue. Just for reference, my PC runs AC Unity at a constant 30 fps with all settings set to high, so it's definitely strong enough to run this game, hell, it runs fine for 1 minute, it's just that this game's memory management doesn't function properly. I reinstalled it 5 times on my PC with various gpu drivers, and all kinds of pagefile scenarios I could think of, it just doesn't work properly on my machine (I guess after having great luck with running AC Unity and Watch_Dogs - this one runs at above 50fps most of the time on high settings, my luck with bad PC ports had run out) - to save yourself a headache, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC!!! Don't reward sloppy PC devs with your hard earned money, please.\nThe rest of my review was written on release date (the actual release date) and editing it even slightly would probably just p!ss me the eff off, so I'll leave it like this, unless the game actually becomes playable at some point.\nIf you're one of those people who thought Origins was a bad Arkham game, has Rocksteady got a surprise for you.\n\nSo yeah, let's make an UE3 game look like it's using Cryengine 3, but let's definitely not buy a Cryengine license, cause money yo!\n\nIf you have a card with 2gb of vram (if you have less, look the other way, the game will not run at all), be prepared to lower the settings to the bare minimum (that's right! all 3 settings, all of the 3 settings that are 3... THREE... 3... 3... 3, not 2, definitely not 4, but 3), lower the resolution below 1080p and expect huge fps dips and chugging and even complete pauses in gameplay (0 fps). This is always present in the driving sections, and often while gliding across the map or diving to take out an enemy.\n\nCan't turn off blur, depth of field, dynamic lights or shadows, film grain, chromatic aberration, you can just make your game look super blurry by lowering the textures, and have all these wonderful frame dropping filters on, to make your eyes bleed a bit more.\n\nLet's say a thing or two about the gameplay (after all I suffered through this game for 20+ hours so far) - It's a mix between the good old Arkham Asylum/City laser precise and very responsive combat, and some of the worst predator encounters I have experienced in an Arkham game, the enemy placement is a mess, there are too many enemies in every predator encounter I came across, and they decreased the number of ceiling grappling points drastically, so often you're in underground shafts or making those 2 ceiling grappling points work somehow.\n\nThe story "SO FAR" is not great, I'm not enjoying it regardless of the frame rate. The Riddler challenges with the batmobile are either a puzzle or a race against the clock, the races are just horrible and tedious, puzzles are decent but not great, all in all the Riddler side quests are not that good. The open city batmobile sections themselves are totally unneeded, and battling the tanks while you're in the car feels like a mediocre Playstation 2 Japanese giant robot game, it's just tedious and dumb.\nI have to say though that the car does come in handy and is used in really interesting ways at times, but that's only in scripted main story moments.\n\nVoice acting and music are of course top notch, not a single complaint there.\n\nCatwoman looks hot!\n\nOh yeah, you can unlock the 30fps cap imposed by Hitle... I mean by the devs, by editing an .ini file, but what's the point really? :)\n\nI'll update/rewrite the review and maybe even change the rating if I feel the game is actually worth buying when (more probably "IF") they fix this mess.\n\nSo, unless you have an nvidia gtx 900 series card or a titan, I suggest you stay away from this game for now.\n\nedit: They actually increased the game's price by 5 euros. XD\n\nedit 2: and now you can't even purchase it from steam, because it's so damn unfinished.","June 23, 2015","false","31.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","3"

(Can't get a decent stable framerate with a GTX 950 at all)\n\nThe Batmobile driving sections for me are where the most issues are. (I was following Gordon who was driving a police car and the game dropped to around 15 FPS)\n\nThe frame rate goes up and down and up and down and will probably make you motion sick.\n\nThe rain is still borked and AA settings is very poorly implemented and not up to the task.\n\nI had to install the game on a SSD to get it to boot properly as it was taking several mins to start from my 1TB HDD (Common issue since last patch) I've got 16GB Ram and it makes no difference to performance despite developer claims that 12GB or more helps on Windows 10. (I also have a swap file as well)\n\nIf you have a GTX 970 or 980t Ti you can probably play this as you have the GPU power and VRAM to throw at it. (Don't expect amazing framerates however)\n\nIf you have a 2GB card I would say forget it and save your money or buy it on a Console instead. (There is a good game here, although the Batmobile is over used to the point of tedium, the combat and story are good and have evolved from the original games) I can't recommend the PC version to anybody with all the unresolved performance issues.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy original launch review below.\n\nCurrently runs like hot garbage on a GTX 750 Ti, Nvidia's humble mainstream 1080P card is crippled by this game, barely utilises all 4 cores of my overclocked 860k and floods the VRAM of my 750 Ti. Framerate falls off of a cliff when you get in the Batmobile.  Needs a patch or two before it functions properly. Graphics Options are limited, 30 FPS frame cap cripples performance.\n\nEdit 1: I got a playable framerate other than a tiny drop once at 1366 x 768, however the batmobile sections still make my eyes bleed from framerate tanking.\n\nThe fighting in this game is much better than the previous games as Batman has a greater moveset from the off. I will be more positive once there is performace issues patch.","June 22, 2015","false","9.6"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","30","47","8","2"

Maxed settings it is locked at 30fps which is BS since the benchmark shows I can play 50fps steady. I can play the first scene as the detective, watch the cutscene, then it crashes. Same with the benchmark, it finished then crashes the game. Not even that the game has poor performance, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. If it actually played I'd get a steady framerate, but I can't even start playing as batman before crashing.\n\n~~UPDATE~~ September 3rd Patch ~~\nGame somewhat runs now. I was finally able to beat the story. Amazing story, great fun side missions, framerate is improved, but it still drops to 30fps in intensive scenes from 70-90fps. The game also frequently crashes with the error "Rendering Thread Excpetion : FATAL ERROR". This is apparently a common problem with no fix. Some people claim new drivers helped or turning off gameworks, but I have no nvidia features active and I am on the latest drivers so neither is the problem. The game is just broken. I can play for 20-40 minutes between crashes. This is the ONLY game with this problem. All other games work flawlessly.

There's still frame drops when summoning the Batmobile and drifting with it. This is with 1080 and all maxed with the following specs: i7, GTX970, 16GB RAM, SSD (OS, Steam, and AK in SSD), with all drivers updated. In short, it didn't feel like there were any changes at all - way below 60fps and occassional dips to single digits when summoning the/drifting with the Batmobile. For me, this means the Excavator encounter, chasing something/someone, and fighting myriad drones are still going to be sh*t. There are still texture streaming changes that if there are a lot of things going on or you quickly look at an area with lots of textures and details, the texture streaming is not always fluid and seamless - you still notice some textures load slowly.\n\nThere are reports that gliding slows it downs too (aka framedrops), although I didn't experience it. There are still the gliding bug/glitch where you will do a nosedive, even if you didn't initiate it - I still experience that from time to time.\n\nSome people couldn't start the game, which could be something about users changing game files, according to WB official statements. The solution is to delete the changed files and then verify cache, so the files that were deleted are regenerated, using the latest version of said files.\n\nSome reports the game takes a while to start, which could be affecting mostly those running the game in mechanical drives (non-SSD), which is still bad - the game shouldn't be too taxing that mechanical drives become a problem. If I'm already experiencing slowdowns and (sometimes) texture streaming issues with the game in my SSD, I'm certain it's going to be worse if I put it in one of my mechanical drives with 7.2k RPM.\n\nThe re-release/patch notes did not identify any gamebreaking bugs that were fixed, such as the locked door trap bug, or the drone bug. Also, it seems that to run the game without paging, you need 12GB.\n\nVerdict: still Not Recommended. 6/10\n\nAs stated, they barely fix anything, as far as optimizing it further and fixing known bugs and glitches. It seems that they prioritized getting the DLCs and the re-release ready.\n\nHowever, they intend to make amends for those who waited for a game that's still far from "optimal". They intend to give those affected with the entire Arkham library, along with a community challenge map pack exclusive to the PC version for a while (supposedly about a week) before it becomes multiplat, and some Arkham games-themed TF2 junk.\n\nHere's the problem with that:\n- What if you already own all Arkham games? Are you just f*cked? Will they even let you choose another WB game?\n- What if you don't like any other Arkham game? Can't you choose some other WB game? Can't you get a Season Pass of any WB game instead?\n- Another challenge map pack? A story pack would've been better than another challenge map pack, or character/Batmobile skins pack (there's a lot of that sh*t already), or another race track pack.\n- If you don't play and don't intend to play TF2, the last giveaway is useless.\n\n\nBAK with Interim and Windows 10:\nIt seems that switching to Windows 10 made it slightly worse. Now I'm playing 30-45fps on average, 10fps on the low end - 2fps being the lowest. Maybe I should not have switched to Windows 10...\n\n\n03 September 2015 Interim Patch:\nWell, the interim patch came out and it slightly fixed the frame drops and crashes. At least for me, it doesn't crash anymore, but it still drops to 10fps or less when certain things happen. And yes, it's usually when I summon the Batmobile, or driving it. Gamebreaking bugs, from what I read in the AK forums, are still not fixed. The big gain from the patch is the inclusion of the high res textures, fixed rain effects (still some issue with it, revolving around saving and loading the game), fixed smoke/fog (still some issues with it, such as reduced duration and interactivity issues), and inclusion of other settings to tweak graphics. Film grain and chromatic aberration can be toggled now, which is good.\n\nIt's still not optimized enough, and that's with the game in an SSD. I broke my "one rule" of not putting any game with Denuvo sh*t in my SSD. As mentioned, there are still frame drops.\n\nAlso, some people are still unable to run it or unable to run it as expected (maxed out everything at 4k on some machines with SLI and multiple "monster" GPUs). But this review is about my experience with the game.\n\nMy verdict: still Not Recommended.\n\nThe game, as stated, still needs further optimization. But if you meet at least in between the minimum and the recommended specs, and don't mind that the game is far from the expected "perfection" that some were hoping it would be (like me) and don't max everything, then you can buy it if you want and it will be playable. If you're all about "I WANT TO MAX EVERYTHING, TO THE MAX!" and have monster rigs, then don't buy it yet, as those with monster rigs are still facing issues.\n\nThere's also some issues with DLC. For now, DLC is still inaccessible, if you bought the Season Pass. You also can't buy the Season Pass yet, or any individual DLCs. Some DLC content are short. The Batgirl and Robin DLC, if you're a seasoned veteran and know what you're doing, you can finish it in under 1 hour - that's short. The Harley Quinn and Red Hood DLCs are extremely short that you can finish each in under 10 minutes - you can finish Red Hood's DLC in under 5. The "Challenge Maps" aren't the traditional challenge maps that you can customize, like pick a character that will play in that map or pick modifiers/handicaps. The racing tracks, I never really like - if you're into racing, then go get that DLC. The bulk of the Season Pass is skins.\n\n\nEDIT:\nRe-release info: Still not recommended. 6/10\n\nInterim patch info, with Windows 10: Still not recommended. 6/10\n\nPre-interim patch info: Added 2 gamebreaking bugs found (so far), a possible gamebreaking bug (the Minus key not working), and lowered score from 4-5/10 to 1/10.

The story is also very interesting for me, and the mission design is awesome. I gladly recommend the game, even if you're not a fan on the series (like me), but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T BUY IT FOR PC. If you have a console, be my guest and have fun. If you don't, then you should probably pass on this game. The port is TERRIBLE. The game barely runs on 30 fps, doesn't matter which graphics options I pick, while for example Witcher 3 runs completely maxed out without issues. The game also has a FPS lock on 30 so unless you edit a game file by hand, you're not going any higher than that. And last but not least, the graphics features are worse than the PS4 version. How the hell is that even possible?\n\nTL;DR:\nBuy for console, it's an awesome game.\nDon't get it for PC, it's terrible. If you don't have a console, just pass on the game.","June 24, 2015","false","20.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","4"

I didn't asked for a refund since I really wanted to play it whenever it would be available again, so I just waited.\n\nWhen I finished Arkham Origins I was ready to start with Arkham Knight, at that time it came back to Steam and most performance issues were fixed, I'm not going to lie you, I spend some time trying to configure the video settings to get the best performance/quality, and I did it, my PC is an Alienware Alpha which has a GeForce GTX 860M graphics card with 2GB of GDDR5, it is not too big but worked for me. I was able to play and enjoy this game a lot.\n\nSo now that I talked about the performance experience, I want to talk about my experience with the story of the game.\nFor some reason in these games you really feel you are Batman, the missions and information got your attention, there are details everywhere and it doesn't feel repetitive like other open-world games. The introduction of the batmobile feels weird at the beginning, but you get familiar with it quickly, sometimes you really wish to have it right next to you. Personally I prefer the enemies that represent mystic, dark or powerful characters over the enemies that are just mobs or militia, which were the main characters on this game, thinking about this detail, I believe Arkham City was better, but for the rest, I think Arkham Knight is offering a great improvement, it is good to learn about all the Batman family story and work with all of them.\n\nI really recommend it because I loved it. Performance issues are fixed and this game is playable now, don't worry about it.\nPD: The batsuit in this game is the best suit I have ever seen in Batman movies or games, I really wanted this suit for Batman v Superman, but anyway...","May 21","true","75.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

I think I should tell you straight-up: Arkham Knight is a FANTASTIC video game. If you don't mind 30 FPS and have an Xbox One or Playstation 4, I highly recommend you get it on those platforms! Unfortunately, you're reading this review on the Steam digital distribution service for personal computers, which I assume means you're gathering info on what the game would be like if you bought it from Steam. The answer to that is: It's dogshit!\n\nDuring the long hiatus where it was unavailable for purchase, Arkham Knight received one patch that addressed bugs and performance towards the end of September, and that was it. While improvements were made, the game's performance is still quite poor, and many of the errors that plagued launch haven't been fully fixed! Rain effects still don't work the way they do on consoles! As those of us in "the biz" like to say: Man, what a crock!\n\nThe patch that accompanied the relaunch added support for the game's DLC, and that's it! No improvements to the base game whatsoever.\n\nIf you install this game on an SSD, and have 16 GB of RAM and a high-end i7 and like a 980 Ti, great news! You can actually enjoy this PC game! But those of us who haven't upgraded our PC in the last two weeks are kinda screwed. If you are reading this review in the year 2018, when the game is $10 on sale and everyone has nuclear reactors in their computers (I mean, I assume, anyways) then your sheer strength of hardware will probably overpower the shoddiness of this port, and you will get a wonderful video game for your troubles! For those of us in October 2015, though... Yeah.

Performance of this game has improved since it's initial "release" in June, but so minutely that one could describe the change as from "complete and utter dogshit" to "wow, this is a pretty awful port". The mere fact that WB tried to pawn off the unpolished turd that was Batman: Arkham Knight in June was tantamount to spitting in PC gamers' faces. In my mind any attempts by WB to rectify this have been a knee-jerk reaction to the huge backlash at the games release, and the coinciding then-recent advent of Steam refunds. Now here we are at the end of October, with a still barely playable, ugly, crashing game. To put the brown icing on top of the poop cake, at the time of this review Season Passes are not even properly working, rendering a multitude of gamers unable to access content they have rightfully (over)paid for. The cynic in me who has seen WB's past transgressions wonders if it's some attempt to squeeze money out of unaware consumers by letting them "accidently" but DLC after already purchasing the Season Pass, in one last attempt to juice the PC gaming community for money until "post-patch" reviews are all out and everyone realizes this game is still a turd-sandwhich.\n\nDo not buy this game. Do not support Warner Brothers. I regret every moment of not refunding my initial purchase of Batman: Arkham Knight back in June, hoping against hope that WB and Rocksteady would pull through and deliver the game they promised us in good time.\n\nI do not recommend Batman: Arkham Knight","October 28, 2015","false","65.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Fortunately most of them has been fixed, but certanly not all. I have a powerful desktop with a 4790k and a 780ti and yet I still get frame rate dips into the 40's albiet infrequent but at normal settings. This is not because the game is so intense it's maxing out my hardware as it is im not getting full usage. I would say the performance is acceptable at this point. However the main issue now is crashing. I can't play the game ever since the september patch for more than 10 minutes without a crash, im sure not everyone will have this issue but in a way it's worse than having lower frame per second.\n\nThat being said the game is clearly still unfinished and I can't reccomend it despite being a great game in story and mechanics.

The reviews are all truthful in how poorly it runs. The stuttering is out of control making me think that the game has frozen in some parts, mostly when the batmobile is involved or I am gliding. The  stuttering can in some cases then throw the audio out of sync in cutscenes by as long as a few seconds. A lot of textures on walls, doors, or panels don't fill in making it look like it has textures out of the ps2 era. There are the least amount of graphical options I have seen in a PC game.\nIn terms of an Arkham game, it is mediocre at best. Nothing of the story all that compelling and the game seems much more empty than other Arkham games. The emphasis on outside environments rather than strategic indoor sequences that actually made me feel like Batman in the other games make this game lack in memorable Batman sequences. Overall, this game needs a decrease in price and Rocksteady and Iron Galaxy should be absolutely ashamed in how horrible this port is and how they have treated PC games as second class gamers.","June 29, 2015","false","19.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Forced 30fps framerate cap? No SLI profile at launch? No graphic options to disable motion blur? Right now this game is playing horrendously on powerful hardware. Not OK. It's obvious the PC version of this game got very little love by the dev team. For a AAA game, this completely unacceptable. The new nVidia driver even states that there are SLI optimizations. This is an outright lie. I forced alternate frame rendering in the control panel only to have FPS drops that made the game virtually unplayable. I've since disabled SLI and am using the second GPU for PhysX only. Playing with everything maxed out at 2560 x 1440, the framerate ranges from 15-55 fps, and it is all over the place. The game itself seems like it would be great if the performance wasn't giving me a headache from stuttering and everything else.\n\nThanks, Obama.\n\nUPDATE: I feel like I need to add that the game is amazing fun. After many, many .ini file tweaks and nVidia tweaks, I have the game playing at a (fairly) stable 30-60fps. Obviously this large gap is still indicitive of a very poorly optimized, unfinished game, but I am at least able to play it. For those seeing the reviews on Steam and staying far away, I can recommend staying updated on patches and at least playing the game if Rocksteady ever manages to give the game any PC-version love.\n\nIt's the worst port of the best game of the year right now.","June 22, 2015","false","31.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Hold off purchasing until WB Games gives firm assurances that the remaining problems will be resolved. We're talking micro-stuttering, missing textures and graphic effects. collision detection, cheap on/off AA, severe performance drops in at least two areas of the game, one during a story-critical segment that makes it impossible to tell what is going on.

The ambient rain effects bug caused by loading an existing save is still there. Ambient occulusion has a habit of not always appearing. SLI and Crossfire has still not been fixed and neither nVidia or AMD have released any driver updates for them.
