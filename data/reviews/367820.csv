Decromancer differs from most of the card titles out there in that it's much less random and focuses more on placement.\nYou don't have a "hand" from which to play cards, instead - you have a grid on which to place them.\nAll the cards you have are available from the start of a battle, but you're limited to only 3 creatures per turn.\nThe resources you have to summon cards do not grow with time (only with your character level), so plan wisely\nCreature cards have attack patterns on the grid, so their placement matter a LOT..and of course many also have special abilities, but that's not so novel.\n\nThe game is a port from mobile devices and so one should be prepared for some characteristic elements that are more suited to mobile, but the developer is still working on implementing some additions to make use of what PCs have to offer - like hotkeys. There's still traces of microtransactions here and there, but honestly - you never needed to make those in the first place - all the game has to offer is avalable through normal play. Sure it does mean a bit of grinding, but  not an awful lot and the grind itself is not a a boring thing you just keep doing over and over - replaying some known battles actually lets you try out some different tactics and polish up your skills.\n\nThere are of course some bad sides - biggest of all is that the game is mostly singleplayer. The only mp element is a hotseat skirmish. Decromancer doesn't make use of network connections, sorry. At least you can play it when you're out of range without losing anything.\nThere are some bugs of course, but that's what we - the players and community testers are here for to find them and the developer takes our reports seriously, plus the bugs we find so far aren't something gamebreaking so it's quite a job well done so far. Mind you that's a small developer without a big marketing department so it might take time to react and long periods of silence, but that only means they're focusing on getting the game right instead of flinging empty words.\n\nto sum it up (TL;DR ?)\npros:\n-Focus on tactics and planning - in battle, not just in deckbuilding\n-No microtransactions to access every element of the game\n-Well-made consistent single player campaign\n-The usual stuff that makes a game playable\ncons:\n- only hotseat multiplayer","October 16, 2015","true","40.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

They claim the game will be in early access for 1-2 months but it's been almost 4 months now with no patches at all. Bugs are numerous and game-breaking enough to ruin the experience. Sad to see the excellent gameplay and core design wasted. Hopefully this will change, but I'm not holding my breath.","February 6","false","3.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Was intimidated by the scale of Magic and such (I will go that route at some point though).  Took a chance on this game and played it for 9 hours straight.  Very fun and easy to get into but with some real stategy on card placement.  A few bugs here and there but hopefully devs will keep refining the game.  In short, I really like this game and recomend it.","November 1, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The core mechanics are actually pretty good which makes up for those small flaws.\nHowever I recommend getting this game on mobile first to try it out for youself for free.\nMore Details:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDOSQcg0znY","November 3, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Quest items to pick up are particularly guilty of this: some of them will eventually be picked up after one or two crashes, but some never do, and one of them might just make you unable to do anything else than grinding while waiting for a fix.\n\nThe main problem with that, is that you will be playing for more than 2 hours before running into a brick wall, at which point Steam will not refund you even though the full game is basically not playable.\n\nA very great game that I had the chance to enjoy through a third party software as its mobile version, but saying that the game is FINISHED is a joke. I don't own a tablet/smartphone and I was very happy to support the developer when it was finally released on PC, but it's been released here 5 months ago and even basic functions aren't working properly (I crashed during the tutorial battle, for example) despite the fact that the devs announced 1 or 2 months to polish it up.\n\nGood game. In theory. It had better be completely bug-free after Early Access if they plan to push the price up once it is done. If it ever gets done.","March 8","false","26.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
