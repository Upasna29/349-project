Left click drops a green platform and right click drops a blue platform. The green platform is a stepping stone. The blue platform is a springboard that launches you into the air.\n\nThe levels are small but have a great deal of verticality to them. There are collectables to pick up along the way but the goal is to find and press a sequence of red buttons which will open a gateway to the next level. It plays and feels a bit like Portal sans portal gun mechanics.\n\nYou can finish Over the Void in well under an hour, with most of that time spent looking down as you tend to fixate on the platforms you create rather than the brilliantly bizaare and colourful environments. You will regularly bump your head on ceilings and floating objects that you never see until they are below you.\n\nThe game experience generally does not feel structured. The ability to launch yourself into the air with the click of a mouse button precludes the possibility of having platforming puzzles. You never wonder how you can climb your way through a level and your platforming ability is never tested because you can prevent a fall at any time. Whereas Portal felt like a 3d puzzle game, this does not.\n\nI adored the aesthetic and the music, despite the platforming mechanics affording you little time and space to appreciate your surroundings. Over the Void works well as a 10 minute distraction every now and then but don't expect anything as substantial as a game or you will be disappointed.","January 10, 2015","true","1.9"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/330470/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Over The Void is caught between wanting to show you something and requiring you somehow arrive there on your own.\n\nAs an art piece it's beautifully bizarre, hyper saturated and full of weird twisting architecture inexplicably suspended in midair. The elegantly subtle house soundtrack is contemplative, maybe even a little meditative, pulling you into somewhere that feels familiar yet completely removed from our own world.\n\nThe problem is that Over The Void doesn't want to simply be a piece of art, it wants to be a game, and it doesn't know how to wrap its audio and visuals into something interactive. Your goal within each of the dozen or so levels is to hit buttons randomly positioned on parts of the environment whirling around you. To do so you place cross shaped platforms at will, either stationary or one which propels you higher into the air, until you've hit every button and the door to the next level opens. Aside from being extremely simplistic, navigating through these levels is rather abundantly tedious, as trying to platform upward requires you to look down and as a result it's rather hard to know where exactly you're going. This leads to a lot of bumping your head against the ceiling, or pieces of the environment, or random invisible walls that regularly appeared out of nowhere and proceeded to pound me toward the abyss below me as if the heaven's had seen fit to strike me down.\n\nIt's interactivity that feels forced, shoved in as a means to give you some objective to take on beyond admiring the world around you and perhaps to attempt to hide the complete lack of any context or narrative for what exactly is going on. I'd have been content, if rather confused, had Over The Void been nothing but a pretty screensaver for me to float around in, but its attempts to make itself more of a game cripple it and cause you to be so preoccupied with finding these blasted buttons that the artwork just becomes another obstacle you're required to somehow get around before moving onto the next level which may or may not work as intended. The abundance of control and performance issues make an already simple game feel unfinished and entirely unfocused, existing for no discernible reason than to be this incomprehensible thing attempting to ride the coattails of a recent trend of games as art that completely misses what makes any of them worthwhile.","December 19, 2014","false","1.1"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","40","51","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/330470/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Context\nOver the Void is more of an atmospheric art piece than a game. You have several levels to explore, with a few game elements to guide you through them. You also have a somewhat free movement to complement it all.\nOverall, I don't think it succeeds as a game, but is certainly a very nice experience. If you want something to simply jump into and be immersed in, I think this is very good!\n\nYou'll navigate a very expressionist world, with huge, abstract architecture, all backed up by a very nice and soothing electronic soundtrack. If this sounds good to you, give it a go!\n\nI've taken one hour in my first play-through, and about half of that on my second. It's short, but it's the type of platform that you can easily revisit just to relax and look around, if you're into that.\n\n\nPresentation\nThis is undoubtedly the most important aspect of the game. This is something you play for the audio-visual experience, and not for the challenge or the story. So, how exactly does it compell the player?\nWell, looking at the screenshots, you can have a very good idea of it. It looks amazing! It uses shape and color in a very unique way, and the scale makes you feel tiny, in a good way. Just moving around feels good, in this game.\nIt's not without its faults, however. I have a relatively small complaint just regarding the visuals:\n\nLevels feel a bit inconsistent\nThe first few levels take a very simplistic stance, but one that makes each level feel very unique and gives off a completely different vibe. Later levels, however, feel a bit too full, regarding both the colors, geometry, and particles effects. Those levels still look very good, don't get me wrong, but they're not quite as astonishing and the first ones.\n\nRegarding the music and sound-effects, I have a similar perspective. First off, they fit the overall experience very well, and are certainly pleasant to the ear. I'm not into electronic music, for the most part, but I still enjoyed this a great deal. A very nice detail of how the sound ties with the visuals, is the way some of the objects and particle effects pulse with the music, as well as your jumps emit a fitting sound-effect. Neatly done, so far.\nI do have a problem with the sound design, however. While it may seem very minor, I think it makes a big impact on the experience, but is also easily fixed.\n\nPausing in the musics breaks the flow of the game\nBoth upon dying, and finishing a level, the music completely stops. In a game about immersing yourself in the levels it creates an unwelcome dissonance, in my opinion. When you die, the music of the level simply restarts. When finishing a level, the music stops, and a new song starts on the next nevel, which loads very fast, without a loading screen (a way of loading that would contribute to the immersion, if not for the music).\nThere are as many games that fall into this as there are those who overcome this issue. FTL, the Bit Trip Series, Thomas Was Alone, and even Super Meat Boy are but examples of how to do it well. Making music flow continuously is fairly easy to do and does wonders to the game, in my opinion!\n\nRegardless of the issues that I point out, I think that the game is definitely worth playing for the presentation alone. It's not perfect, but I find it unique, and more games are certainly welcome to improve this style.\n\n\nGeneral Structure\nNow, I'll look at Over the Void as a game. As I said, the you go through various level, all with the same objective: opening the void to progress to the next level. You do it by pressing buttons throughout the stages. There's no story or objectives for you to complete, necessarily, and each level is self-contained.\nYou also have a counter on the top right of the screen, with x/50. This refers to several Orbs spread around the levels (in this case, not self-contained). They serve absolutely no purpose that I saw, aside from being yet another way of guiding you through the beautiful levels. I've also ended up with 51/50.\nAs far as I can see, the game elements are very artificial, serving as a vehicle for the player to look at the environment. Take that as you will.\n\nAnother issue (which isn't crucial, but would have benefitted the game if it had been done differently) is the lack of an ending altogether. I realize that there's no build-up to it, per se, but the last level simply leads to the credits screen without any kind of aknowledgement of the player's actions. I would have enjoyed something like what Antichamber did, even. Just a small animated section, some little detail about The Void. There's nothing. It's fine, but the addition would make it more charming, in my opinion.\n\n\nMovement and General Gameplay\nNow that you have an idea of what to do, here's how to do it.\nYou can walk, jump (pretty high) and create 2 types of platforms: solid, and bouncy. These platforms disappear as you go away from them, or when you press K to destroy them all. Basically, you simply place these platforms in front, or under you, and you go everywhere you want. The game's gravity isn't too strong, giving the player more liberty.\nIt also features more vertical gameplay than horizontal. About 95% of the time, you'll be moving through your own platforms, rather than using the game's structures.\nAside from this, there are 2 hazards, so to speak. One, is air bubbles that push you up, slowly, and the other is downwards wind, to push you down strongly.\n\nIt tries a bit too hard to be considered a game\nPersonally, these 2 shouldn't be there at all. Yet another "game element" that doesn't seem to have been thought out from the beginning, but as a way of making Over the Void a "game". The biggest problem I have with it, is the way it tries to feel more like a game, but being rather unsuccessful. You die when you go off the limits of the level (sometimes too high, altough it's rare, as you're mostly confined), or going into the void (or water) below you. The air bubbles serve more as an aid, and are there to change up your movement feeling. The wind, is there to kill you, and increase the challenge. However, this challenge comes more as an annoyance, as it doesn't add to the overall experience. You'll simply have to use your platforms to go around it... Meh.\n\nHow the level design could have gone hand in hand with the art...\nAs I've said, the game elements feel forced. But there was a way of taking the strong point of games AND the twisted architecture and make it into one cohesive experience.\nThis is a 3D platformer. And some parts of the levels work pretty well for you player to walk around and jump from one point to another (although not for anything significant - you can jump around a bit, but it never leads anywhere). But since you always have access to platforms, it's much easier to navigate that way. With more work and thought put into it, you could use the twisting architecture as platforms, and have the player work through it to reach a given button. There, it would be easier to integrate the hazards into the level design, and have it fit well. Some parts the player would float to reach higher places, while trying to avoid the strong winds.\nThat would require a whole redesign of a game, which isn't to be expected, of course. Just brainstorming, here.\n\nConstantly looking down is also a downside to it. Exploration and Navigation are almost mutually exclusive.\n\nAside from these, the games works well, for me most part. It has a few technical issues like getting stuck between platforms, some visual clipping, the game not responding after you Alt-Tab, and also a major lag issue in the second level (only).\n\nThese are all easy to ignore, though, in favor of the beautiful environments! This review may seem too negative, but I enjoyed it a lot! Please, take it as constructive criticism.

For QWERTY users, you can change ZQSD to WASD in the launcher, but not the game itself. This guarantees that most people will have to relaunch the game immediately after starting it for the first time. Sorry France, nobody else uses AZERTY.\n\nThe mechanics are a little poorly explained, but hop around a bit and you'll figure it out. Left click to create a floating green platform to stand on (boring!) or right click to create a floating blue bounce pad and fly over the titular void (weeeeeeeeee). Platforms vanish a few seconds after being created if you're not standing on them, keeping the void uncluttered but allowing you to stand still when you want to. But why would you want to? Given how much fun bouncing is compared to standing still, I switched those controls around too, and I recommend it.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find glowy red things. Turn the glowy red circles green by rubbing up on them, and pick up the glowy red sprite clouds as some kind of completion collectible. Turn all the buttons green in a given area to open the gate to the next one. Simple, but kinda fun in a relaxing way.\n\nOverall, a nice little exploration/platformer game.","October 13, 2015","true","0.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

It's a very short experience, yes, and perhaps $5 for less than an hour of wandering may put people off, but I think it was worth experience, certainly. My only gripe is that having a failure state at all is a bit counter-productive, especially in the last area with one certain button that's kind of a pain ti get without dying... but ehh, I did enjoy this in the end, yes.

You're basically navigating a 3D envirionment from a first person perspective with little concept of your own bounding box, although that's rarely an issue. The platform spawning mechanic really doesn't seem to offer anything engaging in terms of gameplay; it seems to only exist to provide some kind of challenge to the audience to meet the minimal definition of a game. If it was replaced with 3D navigation flying controls, there'd be little left to the game (fly to each button, then fly to exit) which seems to highlight the fact the bulk of the experience here is really just looking around and listening. That'd be acceptable, but even the pretty graphics are limited to strict untextured polygon and partical effects. The detail, where it exists, is on a geometric level.

Everything about the game is an utter disappointment.\n\nAll of the levels are fairly open and the goal is to travel around collecting widgets and pressing buttons. You can place a platform you stand on with LMB and place a platform that boosts you up with RMB. Unfortunately, the platform physics sometimes fail and you'll either fall through a platform or get stuck in one of them (you can clear platforms and do it again, but it's annoying).\n\nThe biggest problem is that the platforms place in front of your view, not under your character. This means that there are all of these gorgeous, expansive environments that you have to travel while staring at your feet. You're also frequently trying to hit buttons you can't see because you have to be looking down to place platforms. The placement issue really wrecks the game, and it's a shame.\n\nSo while the environments in this game might be nice looking, if you want to see them, just watch a playthrough on YouTube. If you actually want a walking sim where the exploration feels good, there are way, way better alternatives. That said, the problems in this game are fixable (and probably not that hard to fix). If that happens, I would probably recommend this at sale prices.\n\n\nOne other warning: If you are a Dvorak user, do not rebind WASD on to Dvorak mapping. The "o" button in the game is hard bound to release control of the mouse. This means that every time you move backwards, your ability to look or place platforms is lost until you press "o" again. Why such a function exists at all is beyond me.","February 12, 2015","false","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You collect bits of... polygon fire(?) and you activate hidden buttons that open some sort of black-wormhole that takes you to the next area.\nOver The Void is like Kairo because they are both first-person exploration (walking sim(?)) games; they both strain your brain.\nOver The Void is like SickBrick (and a number of other games) because there are messages written on the walls/the environments.\n\nI made it through three levels and, when I got to the last button, the platform didn't place (or did but I was falling too fast to catch it) and I fell to my death. Reload, find I have to do all of that level again. I had to quit and sit for a minute:\nThe draw of the game is definitely the "universes" you travel through. The only mechanics in the game are jumping and placing platforms. Some of the music is okay, some is barely tolerable (looping often). It's an indie game, so you know there's a (")deeper meaning(") behind it all. It's cheap (I got it while 75% off). I had fun in my short time with it.\nEDIT: Except for one level, they get progressively more... awesome, th'only word I can think of - so, too, does the music become more and more suited to the areas. Each level has that bit of floating text (the name of the level) - I might just be too enthralled with it, but at times, with that music, them visuals seem to convey not so much a story but just projection of sentiments (the rainy level and "get high," especially).\n\nMrNinjaSquirrel says "It's interactivity that feels forced, shoved in as a means to give you some objective to take on beyond admiring the world around you and perhaps to attempt to hide the complete lack of any context or narrative for what exactly is going on."\nI say this isn't necessarily wrong. What with there only being the most base of mechanics, dev could have either made the game more complex or just made an animation. For whatever reason, the game is as it is; I can dig it. If Over The Void was simply an animation, I doubt I'd be drawn to it. I can appreciate that the game is just "JumpPlaceJumpPlaceJumpPlaceSTOPAdmire...DropPlaceCollectibleJumpPlaceAdmire...JumpPlaceJumpHit-ButtonJumpPlaceSTOPAdmire..." because the visuals are that entertaining (...y-yeah). There are messages in the architecture and the architecture itself (")tells a story(")(again, like Kairo); what sort of complex story-telling needs to accompany you while you're hopping about these impossible places? I think any sort of story (which has been hinted at in aforementioned placed quips) would probably just sour the experience; "Oh, I'm literally jumping from black hole to black hole, collecting bits of my soul (polygon fire) that was dispersed because Sun God (IDK, the logo looks like that) was upset with me? Meh, that feels tacked on. I just enjoyed exploring..."\n\nReverie says "The biggest problem is that the platforms place in front of your view, not under your character. This means that there are all of these gorgeous, expansive environments that you have to travel while staring at your feet. You're also frequently trying to hit buttons you can't see because you have to be looking down to place platforms. The placement issue really wrecks the game, and it's a shame."\nIt seems that once you place a platform, any movement will cause it to disintegrate. You can, however, move the mouse to look around while on a platform. So yeah, this is a valid criticism in that the platform placement could have been designed to work differently. If they were placed directly underneath you, though, then the game would BE nothing but a walking simulator that had you going up and down stairs (as it were). As it is, you're jumping and climbing about an abstract world (lol so more immersive). Perhaps the game should have been more honest about what it is instead of apparently hiding behind the illusion of "legit video game" (i.e. puzzle platformer) because of the (")shoddy(") platform-placement; again, I just find the play-areas alluring, *shrug*.\n\nI recommend this game but can see that it's not for everyone.\nEDIT: That people struggle to give this particular game leniency for sometimes iffy controls (in doing actions) makes me sad... That I enjoy the game as much as I do calls into question how reliable my assessment of it is.","April 3, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Instead of relying on well performed jumps, you're able to place a platform below you to catch you fall. This allows for levels you've never seen the like of before, with some pretty colors.\n\nThat being said, the game is far to easy. There's no limit to how many platforms you can place and one platform is basically a trampoline so you're just left rocketing off trying to get to the buttons as fast as you can, which isn't fast enough. They're most often very easy to find and get to, with just a matter of how long it takes to get there. There's also orbs to collect, but those too are often easy to find and get to.\n\nThe real challenge in this game is the physics. You move around just fine (albeit a little slow) but the way you interact with the world is pretty bad. Often buttons will turn green only to turn red when you walk away. The buttons will sound like they've been pressed when they haven't been. The buttons will not make any sounds when they do get pressed. What looks like rain plummets you to your death. Anything that move sends you awkwardly around.\n\nOverall, a poor game.","December 24, 2015","false","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But really, mixed thoughts about this game.\nMusic is great, graphism are cool too. WYSIWYG\nThe game relies heavily on its atmosphere.\n\nAnd that's the problem... It's got nothing more to provide.\nConcerning, the gameplay, some may say it's a simple "First Person Platformer" mechanics.\nBut In my opinion, it REALLY depreciate the game. Because with all those "FPP" mechanics, I tended to look at my feet during 90% of my playthrough. And so missing the aesthetic aspect of the game. I had to take a break from the gameplay to enjoy the game ..... Not a really good move ....\n\nBut in the end, it's not pretentious, and the trailers don't lie to you.\nSo if you like what you saw you will probably enjoy the game.\n\nps: you can easily finish the game in one hour or less.","May 16, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And yet, Over the Void's main levels (all orbs included! I even found the secret jellyfish on the last level) took me one minute short of an hour to complete. I wouldn't complain about this so heavily, but the game seems to be overcompensating... a lot. The designs, while pretty, tend to try to distract from the fact that there's very little going on. Find the buttons, find the orbs, go through the portal. It tries to push for this "exploration" idea, but the levels are so small there isn't really much to explore, nor not as much incentive- besides the orbs (which are laughably easy to find). Besides, most of the time you could've spent exploring was spent looking directly down, since that's the only way you can create platforms for yourself. I have a strange feeling the protagonist has a stiff neck, from looking down all the time. I will say, at the very least, it's fun to show a friend when you have nothing else to play- or something to waste a free 59 minutes on, if you've got a couple cents jingle in your Steam account wallet.","June 3, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
