Well, basically it involves in problem solving, physics and at times, restarting. You need to get a blue solid shape into a transpart blue box to go to the next level, The tutorial is done pretty well and it tells you what you need to do, making the game easy to understand in about five-ten minutes. You will need to use your brain for this one in order to make it to the blue transpart box wich usually involves in restarting. You learn from your mistakes. Physics is pretty heavy in this game and it is pretty much what the game is based on.\n\nThe game generally looks as if someone drew it at school, it also has pins and rubbers that you can use to progress to the next level as those will be needed. It seems as if they designed this to be for kids, but that is my opinion only.\n\nThe options, I honestly would say it is a bit bare. You get three options: Music, Sounds and Full Screen. You can turn these  on and off if you wish. But it seems like it is lacking more in depth options, for example you can't choose the resolution of the game, you can only make it full-screen or not. I think there should also be a brightness setting, The game does feel a little too bright for me, so maybe having that option wouldn't be bad. The sounds and music you can't really adjust, it would be nice to have a slider to make it easier.\n\nThere seem to be plenty of levels that I believe are worth it's value, you can also go back to these if you wish and get the "par" for all of these, which is basically nailing the level with as minimum moves as you can. They also added achivements too, 17 to date of this writing. Which makes the experience so much better, I personally am an achivement hunter. :D\n\nAlso the sound track, it feels comfortable and relaxing, when you're playing through the levels you don't really feel any stress when you fail a try because the soundtrack keeps that from happening, it is smoothing and calm.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? Yes, I would. I believe the value of this game is great, I think the levels, the soundtrack and plot of the game are great. So I would indeed recommend this game. Good job at the people at Kittehface Software, This is one game where you have my approval for it.","June 8, 2015","true","9.1"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","0"

I did enjoy certain puzzles where there was a rube goldberg type of chaining going on, but unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives for me.  That said, I'm really rather neutral on the game but wanted to put this as a negative review so that people know that there are serious flaws and it's not simply a "Brilliant physics puzzler" as the top review currently states.\n\nPros:\n+ fun art style and music\n+ when it works it works well and can be quite satisfying.  there were a couple puzzles which just came together beautifully and I even replayed those levels to see it again.\n\nCons:\n- Outcomes are nondeterministic: If you do the same exact thing twice, you WILL get different results.  Often those results are the difference between a solution working and not working.  In a physics puzzler, this is an absolutely HUGE deal.  Likewise, the Undo doesn't completely revert to the previous state and will often leave you in a slightly in-between-moves state.  This means a lot of redoing to get something that works which makes it feel like you're cheesing your solution.  You can also exploit the broken Undo to get a solution that would otherwise not be possible.\n- The physics are based on actual physics, so there's gravity and momentum, but there are noticeable gaps where things don't behave according to how you'd expect.  The most jarring for me was a solution that required you to exploit the wonky physics to make one rectangular block turn while another square block flips to stay on top of the rectangular turning block.  That was the only time I used a hint in the game and it left quite a bitter taste.  Outside of that one puzzle, it's more quibbles than actual annoyances.\n- The menu system is absolutely terrible: there's about ten different tabs for different puzzles but you have to navigate between them in really odd non-intuitive ways and can't access a single list.  it tries to be nonlinear and give the player options, but really is just confusing.  You can't just select 'next puzzle' from the main menu and it doesn't remember what you were working on last so you have to find it in the maze of options.\n\nNeutral:\n* Very short: about two hours total with the newly released Master II puzzles.  But it's cheap, so I won't fault it for this.\n* The vast majority of the puzzles are trivial tutorial-esque puzzles that hand-hold you though the solution.  Only a few will require more than a couple minutes to work through.  Of the puzzles that are nontrivial, about half of them require guessing or trial-and-error to find what esoteric solution the designer thought would be really difficult to figure out (it is and it's not fun).  The other half are the good ones where you can concoct a plan, have that plan mostly work or mostly fail, tweak things, and finally achieve your goal.  It winds up feeling more like "what did the developer expect me to do?" than "what can I figure out that will work?".\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a solid 5/10.  If it was deterministic, I'd give it a 7/10.  A bit more of the fun puzzles would be an easy 9.","July 13, 2015","false","5.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","1"

The idea is to move an object from A -> B using the various objects in the field to swing it, catapult it, hit it, drop it etc... You only have 2 tools to play with, drawing pins to keep elements in place or allow them to pivot around a certain point and an eraser to remove elements altogether so they don't get in the way.\n\nThe physics are pretty good, results are consistent not random, though the undo button can be a little buggy, producing strange results. There are 80 levels and one criticism might that the first 70 are really only tutorials to introduce all the elements you'll need for the last 10.

Each level has a par number of moves you can score under, at, or over. If you are having trouble with any puzzles, "hint tokens," which you earn by beating levels, can be redeemed to show you how to start (or if you use a lot of tokens, finish) whatever puzzle you'd like.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty non-threatening and casual puzzle game, which isn't to say that all the puzzles are easy, but it never manages to get frustrating. For the asking price of $2-$3 dollars, you're looking at roughly a dollar per hour of gameplay, and you can certainly do much worse than that.","August 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is one of Steam's "bargain bin" games, when something is being sold for £0.39 in a sale, you don't really jump into the game with high expectations, but this turned out to be a brilliant purchase!\n\nTransPlan is a physics puzzle game, reminicent of the old The Incredible Machine series, except instead of having hundreds of ludicrous gadgets and tools at your disposal, you simply get an eraser and some thumb tacks to complete the puzzles. It is a very simple concept, but it's so beautifully done.\nThe mechanics of this game are very easy to learn and there is a perfect difficulty curve as you progress through the levels, things don't really get all that challenging until you reach the expert stages though, some of the master levels will leave you scratching your heads for quite a while if you chose not to use the hints feature.\n\nSo without a doubt I would recommend TransPlan to any puzzle fans, at such a low cost which gets even lower in the Steam sales, it's a steal. On top of that, it's a very fun game to try and 100% too when you're in that "I don't know what to play" mood.

If you have a penchant for this sort of game, this is definately one NOT to be missed.\n\nThe goal is to cause one geometric shape to be delivered to the same spot as another shape, locked in place (so far at least.) This is done by a combination of manipulating the moving shape, as well as other shapes, using the force of gravity. Shapes are manipulated by using pins, much in the manner of Crayon Physics Deluxe, or by erasing. Perhaps other means further on, and some of the shapes fall into sometimes partially controllable PILES of shapes. It can be somewhat complex, and so far the number of suggested necessary movements has gone as high as eight. The "reset" and "undo" buttons will be well used, and should be, without shame. I've had fun failing deliberately, just to watch gravity at work. (If you have a touch screen this game is a little piece of heaven! VERY well thought out.)\n\nSo far I've just passed the 40 puzzle mark, apparently of 70. Nothing is crazy-frustrating, and in fact can be fairly easily accomplished, though without the feeling of being a gift. (I've returned to a few, rather than become frustrated.) There is thought required for success, and since many can be solved below "par" (basically under "budget", or in less than the suggested number of movements) there is an additional challenge that can be quite a bit more interesting, even after initial completion. (I've come in as much as 5 below, on a 7-movement puzzle, and there are two achievements to recognize that very thing.) The map is well conceived, as is the process of becoming eligible to access certain puzzles and groups of puzzles. At any time there may be numerous puzzles available for consideration, grouped into categories such as "catapult" and "sling" (my personal favorite!)\n\nDon't expect this to be Crayon Physics Deluxe, and at this wonderful price and degree of accessibility, it shouldn't be. Every puzzle solved has given me a nice feeling of accomplishment, without the frustration so often a game-ending part of the journey. Since I am in no way an engineer, I am grateful for this really fun, well designed game with a very well conceived learning curve. And the DEVs will respond quickly, sometimes within minutes. For me, that can be the BEST feature in a game.\n\n(4mdt, puzzle pro)","June 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Surely that amount of gamers simply cannot be wrong, can they? I’d say that they are justified in recommending the game. It’s a very solid puzzle game.\n\nThere are a lot of positives in TransPlan. First, the art style is fantastic. It’s very basic hand drawn art. It gives the game a strong visual appeal and something that I actually find very relaxing. It very much puts me into the frame of mind of wanting to solve each puzzle. This is an important aspect of any puzzle game and the artists really nailed the brief here. The art execution continues further into the music. The word that comes to mind immediately is pleasant. The music is pleasant and helps open the mind. Before TransPlan I had never really considered the influence that music could have on a puzzle game.  But it is important. Good music, if music is to be used, is as vital to a puzzle game as any other genre. The game, even with its faults, is enjoyable in part because anyone can jump in and complete a puzzle. This is because the game does a good job of maintaining its casual feel and approach. The hint system, while not unique, is something that works rather well meaning that once you have been rewarded with sufficient hints – awarded through the completion of puzzles and because the earlier challenges are not too difficult most players should be able to acquire a sufficient amount of hints to successfully complete the puzzles that they are stuck on.\n\nYet for all of these I cannot escape the fact that doing the same actions can lead to varying and inconsistent results. If I have learned anything in my time as a gamer it is this – puzzle games of this sort should have consistent results. If you do the same exact thing ten times in a row you should find yourself having the same result. It should be a hamster-wheel analogy. Unfortunately, I cannot say that TransPlan is repetitious. Furthermore, the game’s physics engine can be exploited. I wouldn’t call it broken but rather it is something can be exploited. It feels like you’re cheating the intention of the developers rather than solving the puzzle as it was intended to be. Some of you may have no problem in gaming the system and some game theorists would explain that some games are created in part so that you can game the system but personally a physics puzzle game is not the right genre for that.\n\nWhen TransPlan works as intended it is a very smart puzzle game. However, I’m not one hundred per cent sold on it. I appreciate the positive and glowing reviews of the game – the developers are absolutely deserving of it but it wasn’t my ideal puzzle game. There’s nothing wrong with that and the positives highly likely do outweigh the cons. It’s a harder game to recommend than Anode but will hold great appeal to most puzzle enthusiasts.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 11","true","5.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It starts out simple and easy and become gradually more and more difficult. The graphic is made like a paper with handdrawn boxes and with pins and an eraser. Very nice style.\n\nThis is one of those rare gems of small but highly enjoyable games that sometimes surprisingly shows up at Steam sale. I got this one for one euro only and it was more than worth every cent.

The puzzles started out really cool at the beginner and intermediate levels. Many of the expert puzzles were fun as well, but later on in the game it seemed like many of my solutions were more trial and error than planning, and it felt like brute force was almost encouraged because it works so well for some puzzles.\n\nThe music is nice, but it does get repetitive fast. The art style is nice too with everything being hand-drawn.\n\nUltimately this game was a good experience, but the longevity is very weak. I would enjoy if there was some online solution implementation involved in order that you could try to beat others times. The recommended steps to solve a puzzle were often many more steps than needed, so it would nice to see what other users have had as a minimum amount of steps for a more legitimate challenge.\n\nUltimately, I'd recommend this if you enjoy physics puzzles, but you should know going into this that the game is short.","April 27","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though you can only execute 3 different actions - activate, erase, pin - these puzzles are incredibly diverse. While most of them are quite easy, I couldn't solve some of the last 10 puzzles without a guide because they made my run out of hints.\n\nAccording to Steam, beating the game took me about 75 minutes. Without a guide it might have been about 100 minutes. Without using any hints at all it might have taken 2-3 hours. In the end, it's a short game, no matter how you play it - but it's fun and worth the 3$ for sure.","May 21","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
