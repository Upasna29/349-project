If you ever played Port of Call, Transocean - The Shipping Company is a modern version of that. Everything from the time progression to "status" or "reputation" to unlock more ships.  There are some nice features of the sim that are handy to use such as the financial statements & diagrams, also the ability to take out loans is great as well. I didn't bother playing the campaign, just went right into the free play.\n\nAfter about 20-30 minutes of contracting out my small feed ship i unlocked all the ports of europe, thereafter I unlocked the entire world. I gained enough capital to purchase some bigger pre-panamax ships and began trading the lucrative routes.  Graphics wise the sim is pleasing to the eyes, beautiful colors, non-cluttered interface, lots to look at without getting bombarded with useless information.\n\nThere isn't a real challenging component to free play that I observed, eventually your larger vessels experience massive profit margins. If you complete a contract for 30 million euros, your fuel costs will only be about 5% of that, which is fine I guess, but I have a feeling that real shippers experience much more turbulent expenses. I'm not complaining, just, thinking out loud.\n\nAnyways, this sim is shouting for tankers & drybulker vessels, stock market simulation, buyouts, further player interaction with other AI shipping companies (or even other players!) I hope Deck13 doesn't simply abandon this just yet. Oh and wait, there is more.\n\nMany of you know the embarressing and disasterous repuation that German devs/publishing firms have for releasing unfinished products then abandoning them, i must say within the hour of playing, I didnt crash once, experience a bug or anything like that. It was flawless. Congrats!\n\nAnyways I'll swing a 8/10 would play again. Thanks.","September 23, 2014","true","4.7"," 256 of 293 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","256","293","0","1"

After just a couple tutorial missions (each and all skippable in turn), I was turned loose to make or break my company.  After a few lucrative ore contracts, I found myself smuggling contraband on the Mediterranian.  And got busted.  And my cargo seized.  And fined.  And my ship impounded for a week.  A time-based contract I still had in the hold expired, so there were penalties there.  And harbor masters didn't care to allow convicted smuggers in their ports, so harbor fees went up.  All that in two hours and not a moment that felt repeatative.\n\nA few features that I liked:  Your home port determines what bonuses your company gets.  I picked Lisbon for +5% on ore contracts and -10% to fuel.  The trick is, the smaller the port, the larger the bonuses.  So you have a reason to keep smaller ports and the ships that can service them.\n\nThere is some ship customization.  The Feeder I started with had three levels of Hull and Engine upgrades, which increased range and speed respectively.  There was also a license upgrade that would allow me to carrry what appeared to be hazardous waste.  Unfortunately, there does not appear to be options for custom paint or appearance (other than your ship name emblazoned upon the stern and bow).\n\nI remember reading a comment somewhere saying that the music was repeatative and annoying.  To me, it sounded like every port had it's own song.  And each port felt VERY unique.  I'm already developing favorites and least favorites.\n\nThe only meh item I encountered dealt with other ship traffic.  Large ships move fast and looked intimidating at first, but it turns out they can stop on a dime and give the player right-of-way.  I would have liked to have seen navigation lights and right-of-way implemented (and fines for failure to obey maritime traffic laws).\n\nAnyway, back to my ship.  I'm saving up for a fleet.  And I'm naming all my vessels after internet porn sites.","September 23, 2014","true","29.3"," 202 of 235 people (86%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","86","202","235","14","0"

Unfortunately you're essentially required to do it every time, since using a tugboat is $100K a pop -- so docking and undocking at any given port if you don't want to deal with this tedious docking mechanic is $200k. When you're starting out and your profit margins are very thin this isn't feasible.\n\nSecond, in the campaign your investor is essentially the villain. Every quarter she takes what seems like half of your cash and when you finally scrape up enough to rank up to the next size ship she saddles you with an impossible contract which requires you to ship an insane amount of goods to a specific port (including things that you can't even ship yet without ship upgrades that you can't buy) or lose $10M. Guess when this automatically kicks off? When you hit $10M in cash. Oh the best part? You have around a month to deliver everything. Twice. Twice I hit this point and this impossible burden combined with the investor taking her quarterly cut left me bankrupt. I would keep trying but the aforementioned docking mechanic saps my will to start over.\n\nThird, the sailing mechanic isn't very deep. When your ships are sailing you'll get popups like "there's a storm a comin" and it asks you if you want to sail around it or sail through. I can't tell the difference between the two aside from the fact that sailing through practically destroys your ship. This is fine, but if a game is going to abstract this sort of thing but then require you to micromanage things like docking it seems a little schizophrenic.\n\nTake these three things and it turns out to be a game that is profoundly unfun which is a shame because it's the first thing that really ruins it. Slashing towing fees would go a long way to making the game better.","September 24, 2014","false","14.8"," 238 of 321 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","238","321","2","9"

So much so that I would consider it the spiritual successor to that fine game.  The ship docking is nearly identical, smaller feeder ships are more difficult to dock than the larger post panamax & larger ships that have side streamer jets that will allow much better maneuverability than the tiny ships.\nMany varied ports are available worldwide to sail into and each port has very unique feel to it.  Hamburg & Santos are especially technical and can be quite challenging and fun to sail into at full speed.  They have an option to pay a tug to skip the manual docking for a fee based on your ship size.  The fee can be quite a hit to the profitability of the runs... Which leads me to the Bad...\n\nTHE BAD:\nProfitability:  I have noticed that the smaller ships, while they carry much less cargo, and in some cases are significantly slower, are FAR more profitable than the larger ships.  Cargoes are 3 to 5 times more profitable per container than the larger ships.  THIS IS A COLOSSAL FLAW IMO, and a huge reason that my fleet of over 200 post panamax ships is starting to bog down my computer.  I refuse to make runs where the cargo value for my huge UCLV ship is equal to a post panamax ship 3 size classes smaller.\nI have found that there are ways to crock the game model by leaving feeder ships in the company contract ports to generate hordes of tiny highly profitable contracts meant for feeder ships, but this exploit should not be needed.  The value of the cargo should remain similar through all the ship classes to motivate players to want to get the giant ships (which are a blast to drive) because they are big money as well as big fun.  Instead I am forced to slog through thousands of port tug fees to remain profitable.  Which leads me to the UGLY...\n\nTHE UGLY:  The worst part of the campaign is the outright thievery of the investor.  The first several status upgrades come along at reasonable intervals and have logical milestones to nudge the player to create a shipping empire.  Once the player hits the Magnate level though, the game bogs down into mindnumbing repetition.  The game becomes a treadmill of completing company contract after company contract.  The fun "quests" of filling a whole slew of varied contracts to a specific city are no more.  The "driving quests" where you are tasked with parking several of each ship are gone.\nTycoon level is the worst though.  Your only goal is to gather enough money to buy out this thief, who wants roughly triple the value of your empire when you hit Tycoon.  That wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't spent the entirety of the game building up a world spanning empire.\nThe main problem is that the thief/investor comes in every 3 months and steals 25% of your cash!  This game mechanic alone is almost enough to stop even the most diehard players in their tracks.  I have found that after a point, it becomes nigh impossible to break through this crock of a game mechanic and actually succeed and "win" the game.\n\nAll in all I would give a thumbs up to the game as a whole, but not the campaign.  While the campaign starts out great, it ends like the Hindenburg explosion...  OH THE HUMANITY of repetition!\n\nI have read the previews for Transocean 2, and multiplayer mode sounds like great fun. For now though, I have to agree with may other reviewers.  Grab the game on sale, and enjoy it.  Very likely it will be cheaper per hour of entertainment  than a movie, and when you create your own conditions for victory, the non-campaign could be quite enjoyable indeed.","September 9, 2015","true","34.7"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","56","59","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed playing this game. Some people will enjoy the docking of the vessels in the various harbors. As you gain experience you will be able to get to and from the dock faster. Some ports are extremely easy (Lisbon), and others, quite challenging (get one of the larger boats in and out of Vancouver). So people looking for a game that builds your skills handling various ships you will likely enjoy this.\n\nThere may be some small issues with the underlying rules. For example, was surprised I could pickup cargo from NY for Havana. Suspect that isn't a realistic route.--more likely such goods travel to an intermediate port first (like Halifax). Also, not totally sure the rules follow the Jones Act. But one can really spend time figuring out how to keep the vessels as loaded as possible, and efficiently moving the most TEUs for the most money. I didn't like it when my ships had less than 50% of the capacity in use at any one time. I found this more challenging then moving the boats around, and therefore I would sometimes just let the game dock the ship to save time even though it negatively affected my reputation.\n\nAgain, not a gamer, but surprised how much time  I have spent playing and enjoying this game. If you like simulations, you'll probably find this entertaining, if not informative.\n","November 14, 2014","true","339.6"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","59","66","0","1"

I am certainly not disappointed.  So far, I have 10 hours in the game, and I feel addicted.\n\nThis is a fairly simple simulator/logistics game.  The game has a tutorial, and I'm playing through it.  However, if you played similar games, such as Cities in Motion or Railroad Tycoon, then you can probably figure this out.  You buy a ship, get a contract, and then deliver the goods.  You have investors, you can take out a loan, and your ship will need fuel and maintenance.  From that standpoint, it is very easy.  As you get more ships, you gain more capacity but lose some capability.  Eventually, you can create company specific contracts that require delivery of a certain good to a certain location; at this point the complexity starts to become apparent.  To keep it interesting, you also have to deal with storms, pirates, and fires at sea.\n\nWhile the game is fun to play, it still needs some polish.  I've had a few popup notifications remain on the screen.  I can play through them and sometimes get them to disappear, but its a bug.  While there are hazards, like storms and pirates, they purely random rather location specific, thus avoidable.  For example, I had a piracy near the Canaries, and I hit a storm with one vessel while another vessel sailed through the same area at the same time without the storm.  Personally, I find these oddities to be minor imperfections and potential room for growth in the development.  Overall the game is very solid platform and is good enough for this early release.\n\nA larger area for growth is the games focus on cargo container shipping.  I commented about this in relation to US ports on the forums.  I was happy to see the game designer respond within hours of my comments.  While my request won't go fulfilled for now, I'm satisfied knowing that they understand the issue.\n\nI'm definitely getting my money's worth from the game.  I think the game is playable for most ages.  If you are into sims like this, you'll love it.  If you prefer FPS games, then you'll probably hate this game as it is not meant for you.  I recommend this to all the simmers out there.","September 26, 2014","true","193.7"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","66","77","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimDogg/recommended/289930/","TimDogg","TimDogg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimDogg/","198 products in account","Recommended, but ONLY if, like me, you played Ports of Call on a dodgy DOS computer and couldn't get enough of expanding your fleet. As that is not likely to be the majority, I am not recommending it.\n\nThis game IS Ports of Call, there are a few additions and subtractions but the core of it is simple: Get the most out of your fleet. However, where PoC offered depth and complexity, in this it isn't difficult to achieve what you want to achieve, it is a fun(ish) time-waster for a few hours before you realise it is severely hampered by lack of depth. It is PoC but done half-hearted at points where it matters. I've just sent two ships off from New York to Algiers, loaded with medicine, to finish a contract off. Both ships for some mysterious reason left without their loads. In PoC I would turn them round and ignore the bug, here you can't: You cast-off, that is it.\n\nIn PoC part of the minigames was that you would manoeuver the ship in tricky situations, ice, reefs, castaways. Here you either damage your ship or have to wait for an unknown time. I am fine with the minigame element being gone, but now I haven't got a clue what determines how long you wait, it doesn't tell you (unlike PoC), but having a ship sail "round a reef" just of the Galician coast and it taking 12 days... It could have been in the Antarctic by that time. Some of these aspects feel like they've just been put in to slow down the player for no apparent reason.\n\nThe game is a lot easier. The upgrades to ships are a potentially nice addition, but instead are a sure-fire way to rolling in cash in no time. Once you unlock radioactive goods and weapons, you rake in the cash. I feel there is a massive missed opportunity here. They've introduced a reputation system, why not link it to that? Other goods are already linked to it, also - gaining rep should be A LOT harder, now it is linked to being on time a lot, which is the easiest thing to achieve, it should be linked to the state of your ships, quality of your crew-training, quality and quantity of subsidiaries, average cost per TEU. Reputation in turn should determine the quality of the contracts you can achieve, you begin hauling fish from Iceland to Germany for a few years, after demonstrating you can do that and keep your ship in good condition, you might get the opportunity to bid for another contract and so on.\n\nThis game COULD have been a brilliant and legit successor to the PoC throne, what it should have done was offer MORE depth, not less. The new additions really don't help and the fact that management of the fleet is now so simplified reduces its value even more. Instead of putting different goods-types central it should have gone down the route of: Container-ships/Bulk-carriers and contract-work only, you know, like the real world? It should have an AI, also bidding on contracts. Real life margins in this business are cut-throat, yet after playing a few hours in the sandbox on medium difficulty I have 15 top of the range ships and billions of dollars to instantly expand my fleet - but there is no reason to. All I do now is send ships from one radio-active port to another and rake in the cash.\n\nReal shame as it is a huge missed opportunity. Sims become great when they have more depth, not less. Look at Paradox games for an example of how to get that right.","February 5, 2015","false","9.6"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","54","60","0","0"

It's incredibly easy to make a huge amount of money, and for a supposed business game, many things (like staff wages, stock market, competition) are absent.\n\nThe graphics are quite pretty, and it's neat that each port is "unique", but you probably won't get to see most of them.  Not only is the port view extremely restricted, but very quickly you'll tire of manually docking and lauching the ships - there's not enough complexity in the "mini-game" to keep it interesting.  By the end of the first year, you'll most likely be auto-docking all your ships.  If not, you'd be docking HUNDREDS of times PER YEAR.\n\nSince there are no difficulty levels in the game, there's really no reason to replay the game once you've completed the career.  Freeplay is available, but it makes an easy game even easier.  The ships basically can't lose money (example: I'll often get a single delivery contract worth $25M.  The fuel costs for this trip are less than $1M.  Each ship can do this 2-3 times a month, so when you have multiple ships, well... unlimited money, if you have the patience to grind it). Ship upgrades are so cheap I just fully upgrade every new ship I buy (rendering the whole system kind of useless).\n\nInteresting concept, but they really needed to flesh out their game design in order to make it more fun to play.","September 29, 2014","false","15.1"," 66 of 88 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","66","88","0","3"

Where I would have expected the sucsessor to PoC go would be to expand on these minigames for getting through storms, pirates, customs inspections and so on and so forth.  Despite this the campaign adds some "depth" into the simulation though I'm not too sure if it has the same charm as PoC.\n\nI do wonder what is up with the optmisation of the graphics.  I expected some exceptional water physics and ship modelling, sadly its not quite anywhere near 2010 graphic standards let alone 2014.  Maybe more to follow in future patches and updates?\n\nI'll happily wait for the hard working Devs to throw us a bone now and then.  In the meantime I'll continue to bemuse my family at playing a game of pure Geekdom! and yet again make another attempt to park this 400m long monster of a ship and beat my best time without a nick in the paintwork!...I hope. ^^","November 6, 2014","true","58.4"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","6"

For those interested, Ports Of Call XXL is in development (www.portsofcall.de), and you can get versions of the classic game as well.\n\nhttp://www.metallicat95.com/?p=388 -- my review page\n\n\nTransOcean has all the nice elements for a trading game — transport cargo from port to port, trying to make the most money and boost your reputations in order to improve your shipping company. Travel to more ports, play the ship driving minigame to get in and out of the docks for more status (and to save money and see the nice scenery), buy more ships, complete company contracts, and get rich. Or go bankrupt if you fail, but the game is overall fairly easy to play.\nThis is a single player game, with a sequel with multiplayer and more features coming out in May 2016,\n\nAs such, my recommendation is to get this one on sale, unless you can’t wait to get your ship captain fix now. The polish of this game is a good sign for the future of its replacement, and I expect that you won’t get exactly the same sort of challenges and game play features in the sequel.  This original game does, though, contain the background story and missions which set up the campaign mode of its sequel, and may be a little easier to play (in single player).\n\nThere are two basic game modes, the campaign — a mission-driven game with an investor who gives you orders and wants to be paid back, with the ultimate goal to become a tycoon and take control of the company — and the free game, where you just run the shipping company however you want. The campaign can be a challenge to win, but also provides a nice tutorial on how to play.\n\nMuch of the joy of the game is making smart choices and watching your company and bank balance grow. You will spend most of your time watching your ships sail around the world, and making decisions when they reach ports. Refuel now, or wait for a cheaper location? Select cargos for the best pay, but take into account the chances of getting new valuable jobs at each destination. Repair or upgrade your ship as needed. Some cargos require upgrades in order to legally carry them — take them without and you risk customs inspections and fines. Time spent sitting in port costs money, so that is another hard choice.\n\nSome jobs have time deadlines. They pay better, increase your status if you are one time, but penalize you if you fail. The company contracts you can take give you a mission to deliver a specific kind of cargo from one specific port to another, with a time limit as well. They add another piece of depth, trading guaranteed work with a good payoff at the end (and more status) for a commitment which makes you miss out on valuable high-paying loads to other locations — or taking them, and risk failing the contract.\n\nAll the ships in this game are container cargo ships, and can carry multiple cargo loads as long as they fit on the ship. Sometimes you have enough to fill the ship and go to one destination, but often you must it several destinations in order to travel fully loaded. Each port docked at takes time and money.\n\nEarly in the game, you will dock manually and play a simple ship driving game to get into or out of the harbor. It isn’t hard to do being slow and patient, but most of us don’t want to wait too long, and so you take chances and risk damaging your ship. Succeeding boosts your status. Being Famous means you’ll get better deals and cargos than a small, Unknown company and captain.\n\nLater in the game, especially once you’ve seen all the ports in 3D, you’ll just pay the tug costs and skip this part of the game, as long as you have the money in the bank.\n\nThere are dangers which can affect your ship’s travel — storms at sea, fires, sickness, reefs, pirates, rescue missions — plus the risk of customs delays if your ship isn’t running legally. Taking the risky illegal goods (counterfeit and questionable merchandise) pays very well, but has much higher fines and delays if you are caught. Plus the illegal goods are confiscated, unlike loads where you aren’t compliant with regulations.\n\nMost trips, though, are uneventful for legal, properly maintained ships. You’ll spend your time making good choices each time a ship hits port, and when you cast off to send it to its next destination. The game proceeds in simulated real time (you can accelerate the clock, and will do so often in the early game). With more ships in play, you will have a lot on your mind, as you try to figure out the best way to make money and complete your missions.\n\nThe sequel adds competition -- AI and human multiplayer -- and expands a lot on this game.  But the basic elements seem similar enough, with, I hope, enough improvements to make it a really great game to enjoy with friends.","May 2","true","93.4"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","24","24","0","0"

The game is fun, for the first 5 hours or so. Unfortunately it suffers from repetitive gameplay and the tedious management of your ships. When you start to have more than a handful of ships to control the game becomes overwhelming. Your life becomes docking ships, reloading them, and setting them to be repaired. Manually docking is also enjoyable at first but something you'll soon be more than willing to pay a premium to avoid. On top of this, the banker and her loan will be with you for a long long time. In 10 hours of game play I was still not close to being able to pay her off due to the requirements.\n\nIt feels like there is potential here for the game to be better than it currently is. Right now it too quickly becomes a micro-management simulator. Even with the problems I'd still recommend the game as I feel like I got my money's worth out of it; just know what you're getting into before hand and only pick it up during a sale.","December 4, 2014","true","11.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

The game is fun to bring your ships into port and try to meet deadlines on contracts with your fleet of ships, however as the game progesses having to dock every single ship gets old fast.  However, if you like piloting ships into and out of port, then this game is for you.  I've gotten far enough into the game that I have ended up playing it more like Ocean Trader and using tugs when my ships have to dock.  I still enjoy relaxing and just racking up cash and expanding my fleet.\n\nEither way you play it, the game is quite the feat and well worth the money, especially if it's bought on sale.","December 4, 2014","true","36.6"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

I work for a container shipping company, so this game caught my eye a while ago. I expected something like the classic Railroad Tycoon series, but with ships. What I got was something different, but in a bad way. The game itself isn't horrid, but more something that is vastly inefficient. The mini-game of docking the ships manually when they call ports is tedious and just isn't worth it at almost any point in the game. The whole thing is pointless.\n\nThe business element is very lacking, and I was disappointed that the one of only ways they could think to make the game challenging was to vary the same starting scenario. The only thing that changes is the insane interest rate the player is required to pay to the angel investor, along with her ability to sign annoying shipping contracts with huge penalties without your consent. Starting capital should be something the player is in conrol of, or at least given some options. I haven't beaten the game yet, but so far the only risk is getting caught without proper liscense to carry goods and varying interest rates. All of the systematic risks associated with shipping, storms, fire, whatever are all completely random and don't even affect other ships on the same rotues. There is no political risk, market risk, exchange rate risk, or purchasing power risk. The game is supposed to be global, but has nothing global about the simulated economy nor is it dynamic in supply/demand.\n\nLast, and probably the biggest deal breaker, I don't enjoy the micro management required in this game. Having to approve every single ship when you call port is annoying, and it seems almost impossible to set up a static voyage using supply and demand or contracts. Every port you have to pick new goods based on what is available and then decide where the ship is to go next, and because goods cant be transferred at ports for a hub and spoke strategy, the only way to play is by having direct routes for every ship. In late game, you have so many shipts they are calling ports every 4 seconds so the gameplay never feels like it is going anywhere. Youre costantly being inturruped by having to agree to pay the docking fee, load more goods, and then choose the next port. The only way to keep ships in specific areas is to basically micromanage contracts, and have them sit in port waiting for a contract that keeps them from having to go from the EU to Asia, or float them completely empty to another port, which is again heavy micromanagement when you consider how many ships you have to track in late game, and not realistic at all.\n\nThese business simulators still have things to learn, and it makes you truely appreciate games which are very well done like the Railroad Tycoon seres. They are still amazing. The next installment of Transcean is out this summer, I hope it is a little better.","March 25","false","8.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","4"

The docking part of the game is quite fun but when you have 10+ ships can become very tedious to dock every ship. The advantage of actually docking yourself is you save the moring fee's and when it come to the most expensive ship in the game thats a lot of money especialy if you dock the ship and leave the port. So it comes in handy throughout the game and while you dont need to use it ever it can be useful (especialy if your ships is empty and you need to move to a different port and want to save some money), its also quite fun and challenging as some of the docks are very oddly shapped and possitioned. The graphics for the docking are nice clean and I expect will stand the test of time nicely.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is fun, if a bit repetative, however with the docking mini game you can vary it up and keep the fun alive. It does become very repetative nearing the end of the game as you are simply trying to buy out your investor and the money you need is huge and can take a little too long to reach, which is the only real downside to this entire game. I wold have liked to have seen a few other elements like competiton with other companies and the such but alas not in this game. If the game starts to feel repetative try taking on a contract that is restrictive or try and get a chain of contracts, there are many ways to keep your interest, you just need to look for them.\n\nThe tutorial is very good and is perfectly integrated into the main game so no need to stop and start. You follow the instructions and you start making money. My personal recomendayion is to always but the ship with the highest top speed and bigest hold, the distance it can travel is imaterial, especialy when you reach level 3 and 4 ships.\n\nPro's\nGraphics are simple and clean and will not feel dated in the years to come\nA number of different challenges throughout the game.\nPiloting the ships are fun and challenging, the latter ships with thrusters, makes piloting a dream.\nFinding the best routes to make money is a lot of fun.\n\n\nCon's\nCan be repetative, especialy later on.\nYou will hate how much the investor takes from you and can be annoying when you simply want to finish the game.\nBecomes a little to easy in the late game.\nWhen you have 15 + ships it still takes forever to buy out the investor\n\nConclusion, this is a fun game that will keep you occupied for many hours, however its not for everyone and you need to be a tycoon fan to get the most out of this game, and even then trying to end the game will annoy you.","February 21","true","42.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

As of now I have 4 hours of time played, and financially there seemed to be no difficulty even paying for tugs from the very start.  Right now the difficulty lies in manually docking, and not getting in over your head in taking on company contracts.\n\nTransOcean does hold potential to evolve into a great game, so long as the devs have programmed it so it can be adjusted.\n\nThe game features pop up events akin to the old game from the 90's called Ocean Trader.  In  Ocean Trader you would buy goods at a port, and then deliver them someplace else to sell them at a profit.  In TransOcean everything is contract based, so there's no risk in buying a bunch of goods you might get stuck with selling at a loss.\n\nI have been unable to get the game to run in Nvidia 3D vision which is a disappointment.\n\nThis game has a simplistic and relaxing feel similar to Farming Simulator, for that I would recommend it.

All aspects of the original wre preserved, enhanced for modern standards with a few additions here and there.\n\nHaving played the game for over 10 hours, I like it but there are a few things that I don't like.\n\nThe UI is REALLY REALLY bad:\n- Even in 2560x1440, you can't fit more than 8 ships in your ship list window\n- The ship list is utterly useless. It doesnt even summarize the container upgrades that were applied to each ship, which makes it a PAIN for you to know which should take care of what contracts (ie: food vs electronics)\n- Ship list also doesnt tell you which are being repaired/upgraded, how long it will take, even when you expand the list items.  Designers, please take a look at how Endless space or Endless legend  manages the list of cities/planets and do the same!\n- Even in large resolutions, you can't fit all your notifications in the viewport. Whetever doesnt fit goes away at the same pace and you miss out a lot of important info\n- The evelope icon is a useless decoration. I wish it at least brought back recent notifications\n\nBasic gameplay\n- Whenever you go back to world map, it unpauses the game. HAAARgh\n- Persistent notifications (ie: "become a tycoon", or "shipping line boss" stay on screen but they don't tell you the requirements for attaining them\n- There isn't a coundtoun for when that greedy b$#&ch investor will come get her millions.\n- Ports of call allowed you to take control mid-trip, to avoid a collision course, steer through a reef, etc, not only when docking in/out. Why take that out?\n- There isnt a notification for "some of your ships are idle" and the funky auto pausing/unpausing system will make you lose track of which ships are bein repaired, which are just waiting for better contracts, etc etc. It's hard to keep track of 12 ships, I can hardly imagine when I have 20+\n\nPlateau\n- The early game is awesome, but I'm experiencing a painful plateau to get the post panamax ships (shipping line)\n- I can only buy level two ships and yet I maxed out my reputation. I think it's a bit unrealisting and not engaging.\n- No AI competitors!\n- Encounters and mishaps are VERY repetitive. There should me more types, more ways to deal with them and more outcomes.\n- The economy never seems to fluctuate (apart from fuel prices and loan rates).\n- I'm currently stuck and can't advance to the lext level because the game says I need to build a subsidiary, yet when I try to do so (I already have one in south america) the game says I have no remaining subsidiaries.\n\nI like the game but for this price point I expect WAY more content, ships and variety. And I won't pay 10 bucks for a DLC that includes helpful UI, features and content that should be in a 30 USD game in the 1st place.  UI and gameplay problems make you feel like you're working in a inefficient company.\n\nBut yeah, I still recommend the game because the original concept's timelessness. I think the developpers could've paid a tiny bit of praise to Rolf-Dieter Klein and Martin Ulrich on their website because it's clear that the core qualities come from the original 1986 release.  It's preetier though and the ports look great.\n","September 30, 2014","true","15.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There are still minor bugs, but I haven't run into anything game-breaking or that couldn't be resolved without a quick restart.\n\nThe docking/undocking minigame is a fun diversion that lets you see the beautiful port cities. As some have mentioned the camera angle is somewhat limited denying you a full panorama, but it's not too terrible. You can zoom out further once you unlock bigger ships, but the camera is locked between about 45 degrees and straight top-down.\n\nThe rest of the game is pretty well balanced. There are some random events that provide enough risk/reward to gamble on transporting illegal goods for example, or good you don't own a license for. Sometimes you can get away with it and sometimes customs will seize your haul and hit you with a big fine.\n\nIt still remains profitable to keep your starter ships as well. Your $/ton scales depending on the size ship you have. Smaller ships have the highest $/ton while the largest have the smallest, making up for it in sheer bulk.\n\nThe campaign puts a progression track in while putting a wrench in the gears every so often to keep things interesting. You will get contracts you were forced to agree to from time to time that have a tight deadline and require a great deal of coordination to pull off.\n\nOverall, a very polished experience in this genre, and I would highly recommend it if you're a fan of the genre already. If you are a new player, give it a try. If you don't find your zen playing this type of repetitive game, this genre may not be for you, and that's ok!","September 30, 2014","true","26.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

While each port is beautifully rendered, they are poorly designed, often forcing ships to take odd routes, without a tug or bow/stern thrusters your ships are sometimes forced to take extra long routes or to take damage while docking or undocking; they also often have inconveniently placed obstacles like islands and landmarks, which wouldn't be so bad if the ships felt right. The ships feel like they slide around far to much, it's almost like they're turning from a point far forward of the actual rudder of the ship, additionally the top speed is 10 knots, less than 20 miles per hour, but looks to be about 100 miles per hour. All in all they just feel wrong and if they were tweaked a little would feel much better.\n\nThese facts are by no means dealbreakers, and the game is fantastic even with them. If I was to suggest some changes; in addition to fixing up the ship handling (turning should be tighter, speed should feel lower and all ships should have thrusters) and the port design; I would find a way to spice up the map view a bit, it's quite dull at the moment. I would also prefer some adjustments to how the map works, clicking ports in Europe can sometimes be a challenge once the full map opens up since the game never remembers your zoom level and the ports in Europe are so close. The map outside of Europe also feels quite empty, with very limited options in North and South America.\n\nHopefully this review doesn't sound too negative, but I find that negative points are often more useful in deciding if I want something or not. I recommend this game fully as a solid entry into any managment game fan's library.","December 27, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not one single hickup in 7 hours, thats nice coding. And i have not visited the forums for any help whatsoever - the game is quite intuitive and you pick things up fast.\n\nAt first i thought "Hey, its only a map of Europe", but after you visit each port in the Free game mode, the entire world unlocks. Like with Ports of call, there aren't enough things to buy for your money. The game designers have gone with the "Euro Truck Simulator 2" moneysink - Buildings in each town that do... errm...well, they make you feel good about yourself.\n\nLike with PoC you can command your own ships, i have done this a billion times in PoC on the Amiga and on the PC version and skipped that totally. Automatic docking fees may seem a bit high at first, but when you see how much money you make per trip it becomes small change.\n\nI really liked the ability to upgrade and somewhat specialise your ships (Cooling unit for chemicals or Anti-shake for electronics), but it would be nice to have some sort of template thing for this so you do not have to upgrade a billion ships every time you buy em. And you can take as much cargo as the ship can hold, which makes going from port to port to pick up additional cargo more essential to maximise your profits, at least early on before you get 20 mil for shipping some antique cargo containers in your Panamax ships.\n\nFor a PoC clone, some things are missing - there are no icebergs and you do not save sailors for status points, this subracts from the whole "ship simulation" feel. The music is well done and the graphics are.. sufficient. Overall, this is a good game, even if you missed out on PoC you may end up playing this ship business simulator for days.","February 14, 2015","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's been good value and good fun for me. Read on to see if it's for you.\n\nThis is a Tycoon game, not at all an accurate ship simulator. It's really more logistics oriented, and the financial aspects are weak. The simplistic mini-game of docking ships helps break the tedium, especially early on, but itself becomes tedious, particularly due to the lengthy loading times. I had no difficulties with the mini-game and I am decidedly not a twitch fast reflexes gamer. That said, casual or older gamers might not like the ship docking mini-game; fortunately it can mostly be skipped at the cost of some revenue. As the game progresses you'll likely be skipping it more and more.\n\nI'd like to say it accurately depicts running a shipping company, but it really doesn't. The financial side of the game is incredibly weak and simplistic, with poor tools (no concept of a balance sheet or even a proper income statement, and some very strange criteria for a successful quarter. (e.g. there's an effort to calculate return on investment, but little concept of the passage of time, so back-loaded heavy ship purchases make your quarter 'unsuccessful' and you lose reputation.)\n\nThat said, the logistics (while simplistic compared to a genuine shipping company) are a nice thing, and piecing together company contracts and profitable semi-sustainable routes can be enjoyable for those who like that kind of thing.\n\nRandom events can be pretty irritating with wildly disproportionate penalties. More frequent cargo inspections with lower penalties would make more sense from a gaming perspective; as it is, the user is just tempted to reload when a potentially company-destroying penalty is applied randomly every couple of hours.\n\nA couple of major downsides: some have reported major bugs, particularly in late game. While I've not yet encountered game-destroying bugs, I have encountered extreme slowdowns in the interface later in the game, especially with several ships in port. These lead me to suspect the coding to handle shipping consignments is at best weak and poorly optimized.\n\nThe final negative point is this, and why I cannot recommend paying full price. It's a quite good game for the first little bit, but the endgame feels very rough and unfinished. The tools to manage a large group of ships (50+) are quite poor, and the developers have indicated they are focusing all efforts on a version 2. At this point the game is more-or-less abandoned. This doesn't mean it's not worth buying; it does mean I don't believe its worth paying full price even if you love tycoon/financial/business games.\n\nTL;DR: Good if on sale and you like tycoon/financial games. Seems rough and unfinished late in the game. Very enjoyable for what it is.","May 26, 2015","true","361.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game basically just consists of loading crates on your ships and sending them from A to B. There is also a "minigame" where you can sail your own ships as they dock or leave the port.\n\nThe sailing minigame will not keep you entertained for hours, but it is fun to play now and again when you buy a new ship, and it will save you some in-game money when you play it, as well as grant you some achievements.\n\nThere are 5 classes of ships, all of which can have various upgrades installed, like better engines, water canons to fight back pirate attacks, or a license which allows you to transport juicy nuclear waste.\n\nThe rest of the game just consists of carefully choosing contracts of what merchandise to transport where, and it's up to you to find the route planning that will be the most lucrative. You can also transport drugs or contraband for extra cash, but risk losing all if inspected by coast guards.\n\nThere are also company contracts, which grant you substantial bonuses if you guarantee you will transport X amount of merchandise on a designated route in X amount of months. Fail to fulfil it and you will have to pay a big penalty.\nOne of the most fun I have found in this game is deliberately accepting a ludicrous amount of company contracts and then having fun struggling to complete everything in time!\n\nIn addition, as you level up, your antipathetic investor will throw some ridiculous contracts at you that you cannot refuse. These moments are the big highlights of the campaign.\n\nOnce you have fully leveled up, there is not much end-game, so TransOcean won't keep you entertained for ever, but all in all the campaign has a good 25 hours in it.\n\nTechnically it's well built, the interface is designed okay and I encountered very few bugs. The game comes with a set of elevator music tracks which I recommend you switch off from the beginnnig; then it just plays relaxing seaside sounds\n\nDefinitely one of the best tycoon style games out there.","June 26, 2015","true","47.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Within minutes I was on my way, accepting contracts and traveling to ports to cash them in.  This cycle, along with manually docking can get repetitive, but it's also very calming and stress-free (for right now, anyway).  I can't speak for the mid/late game as I'm not there yet.

TransOcean is becoming quite old after a couple of hours. Don't get me wrong, I am the type of gamer that can grind for hours on end, but there are so few gameplay elements within this game that it started to feel quite boring after a while. Still, this does not explain my urge to post a review for this, so why then? Because there are couple of things that, in my opinion, they should have been a must!\nThe first and the most important missing feature is that you cannot order a custom ship. You are only able to buy pre-defined ships from the shipyard. I truly believe that it wouldn't have take that much developing time to add a couple of new menu pages + the code behind them and the result it would have definitely improve the strategy factor for the gameplay. Also the only "type" of ship is container one. Where are the oil tankers or the passenger ships? I mean, even the ore is transported in container ships? From my knowledge it is not the case. And the last major thing that bugs me is the fact that you can only take transport contracts. No possibility to purchase something that the port produces and sell it somewhere else, just transport contracts.\nOther nice feature addition, would have been to have ships or cargo insurance, and having some kind of simulated stock exchange. Also, some AI competition during the campaign would have been nice.\nAbout the game, decent graphics, and the ports have their own identity and you can zoom out to see the landmarks in the port, which is cool. Still, you will "park" your boat during the first transport missions as you really are low on cash, but after a while you will find yourself just using the auto-doc regardless of the costs, as you will have more than enough money to afford the cost. I also encountered some bugs, even though I did not made any effort in looking for them. One would be that while manually docking in England's port (can't remember the name now), the FPS drops quite badly if there is any ship in the port. Also it seems that there are some broken mechanics in the company contracts, after loading a save, you will get contracts that are 20+ mil in rewards, but after half an hour of gameplay, even bigger contracts rarely have rewards that pass the 6 mil barrier.\nAll in all, I completed the campaign, I doubt I'll try the free play in the near feature, considering that I experienced a better similar game, this title will probably get lost in my library. If by any chance any developer will read this, please take an hour or so and play a 1997 game called Ocean Trader. It is a DOS game, and you will then probably understand why I cannot recommend this title.","October 4, 2014","false","36.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You improve ships performance and cargo abilities (engine, hull strength.. and soo on).\n\nAt first you will have to sail the ships into the harbour, which is great fun when you have 1 or 2 ships in the end where im at with 16 ships is just easyier to get the tug in to pull and pay 200K.\n\nI will say i do like ranking system, rank up you need to buy ports, make contracts with companys (ship there cargo around), Buy ships (better ships) once thats all done you move up the ranking sytem to unlock bigger and better ships.

I’m greedy so I decided that I’ll transport some contraband to Hamburg. The contract was €1.2M! So I loaded up and bravely set off for Hamburg … only to get stopped by the customs for an inspection of my cargo. Who said crime pays? It does not! I got a hefty fine of €2.3M, the cargo was confiscated and my ship was docked for 5 day – so docking fees are added to my punishment. It’s a pity I could not arm my ship with torpedoes.\nI have never played this type of game before and I must say I thoroughly enjoy it. The tutorial is adequate and the gameplay is not over complicated. You get to dock your ship in the harbours and can set best times. This is also applicable when casting off. As you progress new ships become available to purchase. Fuel must be purchased wisely because in some ports it is more expensive than in others. Your ship must be maintained in a seaworthy condition and you have decisions to risk and sail through storms or sail safely around it and hope your cargo can be delivered in time and hold thumbs that you have enough fuel to reach port. I would have liked to manage hiring and firing the crew but unfortunately that is not available. The graphics is not overly impressive but the game play very smooth and I did not notice any bugs either.\nSo, buy this game, buy a ship and don’t transport contraband. Crime does not pay!

Seriously, you can't establish liners services or anything; you're picking up one or two cargoes at best and essentially tramping. It's really not very complex, and the campaign is just a grind. The price of tug service doesn't make sense (It's about 50 to 1000 more than they cost in real life, seriously), and neither do the ship improvements - I have to stop a ship for two days to get a license to carry dangerous goods? Not only is firefighting gear an option, it's only available on the largest ships?\n\nIf you're looking for a remotely realistic simulation of the shipping business, give it a pass.\n\nThe ship simulation aspect is similarly basic... No transverse thrust on the propeller, only the larger ships have bow and stern thrusters, there's no wind or current and the ships don't have inertia. Seriously, the best way to make a dock perpendicular to the direction you started with is to speed up, then turn at the last minute and slide sideways into it, Dukes of Hazard style.\n\nGive it a pass, and be very careful when considering the new version.","July 21, 2015","false","33.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Otherwise, STAY AWAY!\n\nThis game is divided into difficulties of play:  "easy," "normal," "hard," etc.  When playing above the "easy" level this game can be very frustrating to play.  The experience is similiar to one playing a "rigged" game in the very few casinos that have them.  This game has three main characters:  the "investor;" the "assistant," and the "old captain."  The assistant is, basically, a tutorial device.  The information the "assistant" provides is useful.  The "old captain" will tell you if you did something wrong in docking at a port or sailing out of one.  The "old captain" also provides advice on how to maintain your ships.  The "investor" is a very sneeky and greedy individual.  The contract you are forced to sign with her (if playing in "normal" status or above) is so unfair that, in real life, an American court would probably rule such a contract to be void.  Without warning this "investor" is allowed to demand that you ship a list of goods to a port she has selected.  If you are unable to comply with this demand this "investor" can throw you out of the game.  Sometimes, however, this investor will let you off with a warning.\n\nThe "normal," and higher, categories of this game are sub-divided into various titles--"Consignor," "Ship Boss," etc.  The player reaches these titles after completing certain tasks.  These tasks can take up to 3 to 4 hours of playing time for each title.  The BIGGEST problem with this game is the secrecy and lack of information the developers have, either, intentionally built into the game, or, the developers have no desire to make corrections to make the game rules clearer and fairer to the player.  You can be kicked-out of this game for no apparent reason.  The worse part is this game is, obviously, designed to kick you out only after several hours of play.  You may have progressed (as I did) to the third title; have 8 to 10 ships; and have a balance of 130 million Euros.  Then, for no understandable reason, the calendar starts spinning wildly (and NOT responding to the "pause game" or "slow down" keys) and your balance, likewise, starts wildly dropping.  After about 10 to 15 seconds you get a message that your company is bankrupt--thus, you've been thrown out of the game.  Of course, you always have the option to start a new game--with no credit or assets from the game you just got thrown out of!","November 11, 2014","false","220.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I'm tempted to say they should do away with the manual docking completely and spent the time saved expanding the rest of the 'game'\n\nAfter 4 hours:\n\nI can confirm there is absolutely no need to manually dock/undock, there is no gain by doing so, on the starter ships it will cost you 100,000 to auto-dock, which is affordable on all but a couple of jobs.\n\nI've discovered that you can lose money, reefs will randomly appear where there wasn't one before (because that happens!!!), they appear to be the only way so far that I can lose money... except of course the investor taking her money at seemly random times.\n\nSo anyway, I got bored after the first 2 hours, but stuck at it and I can tell you that the game doesn't change, all that happens is you get bigger ships, and bigger distances to move things!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/halofrosty/recommended/289930/","halofrosty","HaloFrosty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/halofrosty/","73 products in account",""Great game", it's that simple. You start your adventure with a feeder, and every minutes you are planning in your mind which trade route to choose and where to stem your bunker with most economical price.\n\nNow you are getting more and more money, and expanding your fleet with regional traders, and eventually going up to those beatiful ladies - PPMX, NPMX and Ultra-Large Container Vessel. Oh! Now you are ready for a round-the-world service. Further to ocean trading, you can always berth / unberth the vessel on your own, and I would say this is the most interesting element of this game.\n\nThe difficulties...well, I guess it's hard to name your ships. With the fleet getting ever larger, I decide to simply pick a real world Liner Operator and name all my ships as per their's.\n\nAs I said, it's a great game. But there are always ways to further enhance the gaming experience:-\n\n1. Canal passage. It would be great if I have to pay my canal due for passage,  sail my ship through the Suez, or may be have to anchor my ship off Cristobal a day or two due to canal congestion.\n\n2. Larger scale of map when docking/undocking my ship. It's quite often I find it difficult to expect where will I berth my lady until I see it. And if possible, it would be great to have a "longer" sailing option before berthing/after unberthing.\n\n3. Some more "small contracts" - I find it hard to believe I am shipping some thousands TEU of Radioactive Materials to Hong Kong, or loads of weapons ex. US/Canada to Cuba...\n\n4. More realistic color of the Equipments (i.e. containers) - The Equipments are just too sharp and colorful.\n\n5. Players can draw the company logo in-game, and decide where to put the Operator's Color on the ship's hull.\n\n6. More real world events - e.g.: Pay for ice-breaker when approaching Gulf of St. Lawrence, stowaways sneaked onboard at West/South African countries, economic changes that affect the global bunker price SERIOUSLY...etc.\n\nThe trading mode is realistic only if the game is for General Cargo Carriers. For Container vessels, it appears more "real world" if we are to plan and maintain service routes across the globe...well may be it's just me thinking of this only.\n\nIf you like ships, go for it. If you like trading game, go for it. If you want to sail a vessel, go for it. There's no much choice where you can sail vessels from a 480TEU feeder to a ULCV with bow/stern thrusters.","December 20, 2014","true","59.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, there are some caveats to the recipe, the biggest one being that Deck13 seems to have wanted to do something extraordinary here, but after the release, realized that the current platform and tech cannot allow that. So they went back to the drawing board and stopped working on TO1, in order to bring out TO2 (ETA 2016) from scratch.\n\nThis is all fine, though, as the current version is *very* playable and addictive, and if you snatch it at 50% discount, like I did, it's worth every penny. But bear in mind that for this version, there will potentially be no other content update and no bugfixing (there are a few tiny bugs which are slightly annoying).","May 14, 2015","true","136.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is educational in terms of geograhical content and mathamatical content, ie working out how much cargo can be carried vs distance and speed restrictions but it also has some childish elements, ie fogging effects of ports and other ships trying to  race your ship or trying to block your ship from docking, also ships do not seem to do realistic speeds or have realistic stopping distances. It would be more appropriate to do away with the childish elements and make this into a good game by adding elements such as wind and tide effects when docking, weather conditions (calm, windy or rainy), night time docking conditions and proper shipping lanes with rules, ie speed limits, also  more realistic loading and unloading times along with a greater number of ports and types of ships which would enhance the game.","July 31, 2015","true","840.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What you are paying for here is worth half that, I would say $10.\n\nWell, let's just say Euro Truck Simulator did the act of transporting (driving/shipping) right and this game did it wrong. It absolutely sucks. Imagine there is a pencil resting on some ice and you have to move it to another chosen destination by blowing on it. Yeah, it's that awful/painful.\n\nThankfully you can choose to dock/undock your ship automatically for a small, mostly irrelevent fee (later in to the game at least). You are required to dock 10 total times to upgrade your status later in to the game which is really painful to do though.\n\nAlthough I will say the merchanting part of the game was really fun. Pretty simple; go to port, pick up most expensive contract, ship to somewhere else, and watch your net worth grow. You begin to get faster ships with more cargo space that can travel further on the map and as you upgrade your rank, soon enough you have a fleet of ships making money for you.\n\nAgain, would not recommend for the $30 price tag.","September 30, 2014","false","13.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You start the game, buy a ship at your home port and select one of the available contracts to ship goods across the globe. You watch a little graphic of your ship go from port to port and when you dock at the other end you earn your money (or not as the case may be), sound fun? Well I hope so because you're going to do that thousands and thousands of times. You buy more ships and bigger ships and upgrade ships to carry different cargo but it all boils down to selecting contracts, sending your ship to sea and watching the moeny roll in.\n\nI've sunk enough hours in to this that I've got my moneys worth (less than a pound per hours gameplay at time of writing) and whilst I certainly don't feel ripped off I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but the most die hard management/tycoon fan.\n\nOverall not bad but not interesting either.","February 9","false","6.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It is not going to be fun for everyone because the gameplay is very limited. Control of the ships themselves is actually considered to be a minigame and for a small price can be bypassed. At first bypassing is too expensive, but your larger ships can afford the cost.  After the minigame all there is to do is to take out loans, and manage contracts for a fleet of ships that you can somewhat custimize. I also experienced a bug which prevents me from naming new ships.\n\nEven after all of my problems the game was beautiful. After a hard day of trucking I relaxed to a easy game that was one of the most beautiful looking games that is not from a AAA company. I wished there were more features, more ship types, more ports from the world, more of everything. But for now I can play this game, but this game will not be for those who are looking for a challenge or a shipping update from older games close to this genre. TransOcean is what it is, a simple beautiful game with limited options. I love how it relaxes me, you may not like it.\n\nAlso the online portion of it is just you in sandbox mode and prices go up and down online. It actually makes it easier has some prices skyrocket up.","September 25, 2014","true","27.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There have been a lot of half-hearted continental simulations released recently and this definately doesn't fall in to that category!\nOk, graphically, the "driving sim" aspect of this title could be better... It's a little 2D feeling and has a tendancy to stutter when you go for maximum speed, but it's passable most of the time.\nHaving said that, this is, in my option, a solid micro-management sim.  You have good control over the day-to-day running of your shipping company, but can also comfortably out-source many of the more mundane tasks (albeit at a sigificant cost).\nPersonally, I'm ok with that... I think it should be a significant expense in the early days to outsource any substantial portion of your management role in these kind of titles.\n\nAfter 6 and a half hours (or so) of play I can tell you the following:\nPOSITIVES:\n* Storyline is ok, driven by solid tutorials... They are progressive and detailed enough to point you in the right direction without being condecending.\n* Graphics are better than anything else I have come across in this specific genre.\n* Controls are pretty instictive and as expected - camera controlled from mouse and helful auto-centering.\n* Sound - I've seen some negative postings, but, in general, I've been pretty impressed.  Music gets a little repetative in the world view as you spend a lot of time there, but each port is individualised and, overall, it's a pretty calming, uninvasive soundtrack.\n* Overall gameplay is going to keep genre fans entertained for some time... There's certainly enough variables to grab attention, but cost and development route are inevitable and welcome challenges!\n\nNEGATIVES:\n* It seemed to take an excessive amount of time to pass the first few story objectives. I imagine this is because this is many designed to be a "sandbox" title, but I'm hoping greater structure will be added in time.\n* On the subject of additions, the are many noteworthy european shipping ports which are currently missing... Let's hope this is remedied in any future updates!!!\n\nAll in all, a worthwhile spend... Enjoy!!!!!!","September 25, 2014","true","34.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The ports, the menu, the controls and the map are all great but the game heavily suffers from lack of depth. After one playthrough of the campaign you are pretty much done with the whole game. And even within that it gets repetitive fast. There is no way to build your shipping company differntly in the next playthrough, it's always the same: load ship with goods, sell goods, fuel and repair the ship - repeat - buy more ships. No crew, port or storage management at all. You just ship goods to make money to buy more ships to transport more goods. Maybe it would be fun if there was any type of endgame like buying out the competition (there is none), buying whole ports or investing in research.\n\nOne would think it gets more interesting when your company grows bigger but it only gets more tiring because there is no automation at all. You have to click everything manually for every single ship every time and you don't even have to think about it because it's too easy. The visualized ports are great but you only see them while docking manually which is fun at first but also gets old really fast.\n\nI can't really recommend this game.

The ships range from a tiny freighter to a Panamax to a UCLV (a really big ship) and you can ship goods from ore to counterfeit goods to weapons to and from countries in the world.\n\nGameplay wise, it's pretty simple and there is a mini game where you can dock and cast off. It does get repetitive after a while but if you play the game in bursts, it's fun. There are challenges where you can accept company contracts to ship a certain number of goods from one port to another in a certain time frame, which is rewarding in the end. There are also random events that pop up where you decide to avoid it or go through it, as well as customs checks from time to time (often on Hard difficulty). One neat feature I love about the game is there is online connectivity where players who play this game effect prices of goods if a port is visited often.\n\nHowever, what I do find is that when you start expanding, the amount of ships that you have to manage gets overwhelming and I wish there was a way to easily load your freighters at multiple ports.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game but remember to play it in bursts or it will get repeititive. Score wise, about a 8/10.","December 31, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some ports only allow for small boats this is fine. Because of this you have to take a very small boat accross huge distances.... poor boat is almost dead when it gets there and takes very long time..... They need to add a feature where you could meet another biger boat in your fleat at a biger port and swap the cargo even if you had to use money you earnt ingame to pay for it....\n\nthe other feature think needs to be added is to be able to ask to the ship to a differnt port after you have sent it to the next port. a couple of times i found i accidently sent a very slow ♥♥♥♥ to the wrong port and i couldnt do anything about it. in turn got huge penitilties in game....\n\nThe other thing i would like to see would be able to set indervidual ships tasks while you are doing a mission... so you could tell it to keep going back and foward between the two ports that required delivery or if you cleaver accept several missions and set the ships on a round circut type deal....\n\n\nFound that the pop up system stops working after you get about more than 10 boats so somtimes there are ships in port getting taxed for docking fees it can take some time to figure out where the ship is and to send it on its way...\n\nthis game needs some work for the price.....\n\nHowever seems to be a good remake of the old amega ports of call if that is what they were trying to do ... its almost identical with better graphics and better mission system.\n","January 2, 2015","false","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also I find the amount of highly unrealistic and extremely repetitive micro-management very boring. A true motivation killer.\n\nAll this is played through a "management" interface, which does not assist one jot in managing a multi-vessel fleet. On the contrary.\n\nThis game should be tagged "shallow simulation of a shallow trade-simulation". The docking-minigame likewise cannot be called a simulation, as is has nothing in common with handling a large vessel...in fact, not even of that of a 30ft sailboat. However, without it, this game would not even have the pretty graphics.\n\nNice for an average 12 year old.\n\nMost definitely not a title for enthusiats of trade and management sims. If you are looking for an interlectual challenge and some insights into the "real" world of cargo shipping, and big scale logistics, look elsewhere.\n\nThe proposed features for the announced version 2 of this title, do not seem to address these issues. Rather, it seems to take the existing version and expands it into a multiplayer version. A great pity, because the idea is great. There is no in-depth simulation of this genre to my knowledge...and there still isn't...and by the looks of it, version 2 won't change that.\n\nIn my opinion, the trading and management functions and interfaces require extensive improvements, before this title deserves to be called an exciting game and a simulation.\n\nI give 10 out of 10 for the idea, and a 5 out of 10 for execution.\n\nAll in all, in my view, yet another disappointment, and most definitely not worth the cost.

The mixed reviews made me skeptical about buying it, but as I'd been starved for a good business simulation, decided to take the gamble - and I'm pleased I did!\n\nIn the game you play the founder of a shipping company, whom takes on an investor to fund his company. Starting off with one small 'Feeder' ship, you have to accept contracts and weigh decisions over speed/fuel consumption to ensure that deliveries are made on time. The campaign aspect of the game provides extra challenge, allowing you to unlock larger vessels as you progress in rank and prestige, whilst constantly trying to ensure you have enough money to provide the investor her regular payments.\n\nShips can be docked and cast off manually, which offers you the chance to control your ship if you'd rather avoid paying the tug fees (automatic docking/cast off) in ports. This can provide a nice little break from the 'main map' game screen, which is where you'll spend most of your time. Eventually you'll have a fleet of different sized ships, and will need to juggle factors of tight deadlines, contract penalties and the various ship sizes permitted to dock in certain ports etc.\n\nDespite the fact that you spend so much time staring at the map screen, the challenge and reward of juggling everything around is thoroughly entertaining. It's a game that doesn't require too much thought and that you can play casually. I personally found the game addictive, but I appreciate that it won't appeal to everyone - I'm sure many would find the lack of variation a little tiresome/boring. If you're unsure whether you'd enjoy this game, do what I did and check a gameplay video online. There are many to watch, and will give you an accurate idea of how this game plays.","May 13, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no real company progress, just meet a few requirements and you unlock the next bigger ship; rinse and repeat. They did a job creating an investor that you'll grow a seething hatred for as she continues to leech your funds ever quarter whilst creating contracts that you can't complete without breaking the law [get product X from city Y; this city only allows the tiniest ships to dock at it, and you need an upgrade to lawfully carry product X - an upgrade that the tiniest ship cannot get]. The end game requires building up a very large amount of spare cash to free yourself from the investor; the amount is 2x the company's late-game value, so if you're punished if you like to have some spare cash on hand. Building a large fleet - which is required to buy out the company - generates a ton of busywork, as there's no sort of automation available. I really enjoy sim-management games, but this one punishes you unless you grind towards great profits; mainly, trying to keep your head above water as Ms. BS gouges you for 10% of your value every quarter [her name is Ms. Blythe-Smith, but maybe the initials were chosen intentionally]. I think I would have enjoyed TransOcean much more if it focused on managing the company rather than managing the minutia.\n\nThe ability to manually dock and cast off is fun, but it gets tedious considering how many shipping runs you must make; I think if you did every maneuver manually it'd about triple the amount of time played, and eventually feels a bit like busy work [the game forces you to do some maneuvers later game in order to progress, which may help some discover this bit they've been missing out on, but it also feels forced for those that want to focus on the management aspect].\n\nIt looks like a TO2 is in progress, and I'll probably check it out based on how it looks and the price. TO isn't a bad game, and I was on the fence about giving a 'No' recommendation. I'd probably give it a 7/10 overall - there are just many better games in genre to spend time on, especially ones that have better replay value.","March 20","false","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after measly 5h of playing in campaign mode I realized, that it's hard to grasp what's going on, if you have more than 3 ships. I know that the game is basically about planning, but it's hard to do that with this interface. One thing I can say for sure: If you want to spend a great masochistic time with TransOcean prepare some piece of paper and a pen, because otherwise you can get really lost in a grand scheme of multiple contracts.","March 18","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no real company progress, just meet a few requirements and you unlock the next bigger ship; rinse and repeat. They did a job creating an investor that you'll grow a seething hatred for as she continues to leech your funds ever quarter whilst creating contracts that you can't complete without breaking the law [get product X from city Y; this city only allows the tiniest ships to dock at it, and you need an upgrade to lawfully carry product X - an upgrade that the tiniest ship cannot get]. The end game requires building up a very large amount of spare cash to free yourself from the investor; the amount is 2x the company's late-game value, so if you're punished if you like to have some spare cash on hand. Building a large fleet - which is required to buy out the company - generates a ton of busywork, as there's no sort of automation available. I really enjoy sim-management games, but this one punishes you unless you grind towards great profits; mainly, trying to keep your head above water as Ms. BS gouges you for 10% of your value every quarter [her name is Ms. Blythe-Smith, but maybe the initials were chosen intentionally]. I think I would have enjoyed TransOcean much more if it focused on managing the company rather than managing the minutia.\n\nThe ability to manually dock and cast off is fun, but it gets tedious considering how many shipping runs you must make; I think if you did every maneuver manually it'd about triple the amount of time played, and eventually feels a bit like busy work [the game forces you to do some maneuvers later game in order to progress, which may help some discover this bit they've been missing out on, but it also feels forced for those that want to focus on the management aspect].\n\nIt looks like a TO2 is in progress, and I'll probably check it out based on how it looks and the price. TO isn't a bad game, and I was on the fence about giving a 'No' recommendation. I'd probably give it a 7/10 overall - there are just many better games in genre to spend time on, especially ones that have better replay value.","March 20","false","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are nearly identical, except graphics and engine is updated. For a while I had fun with manually shipping in and out harbours, but when you buy more and bigger ships you concentrate more on fright, routes and prices. A little annoying is your investor, which has ultimate rights to book frights for your company...so sometimes you have to hestitate to catch what she has ordered for you. Some ideas might need polishing, but devs decided to better invest in an updated version.\n\nNew version 2 is one step before release, so I catched a decent price. Fun to play for an adequate pricing.","March 21","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrenadeBait/recommended/289930/","GrenadeBait","GrenadeBait","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrenadeBait/","755 products in account","This game is a lot like any management game, like space empire building without the conflict of war. In this case your focus is on fleet building and freight management. They have put in a lot of antagonist elements that take the place of conflict-based issues of other games, like an investor that you have to buy out eventually, otherwise the ♥♥♥♥♥ keeps saddling you with difficult contracts (missions) that set you back. Also, her quarterly dividend is 10% of your company's holdings: So when I as at nearly a billion $ in the bank and many ships in my fleet, she came along and was taking nearly $200 million every quarter.\n\nThe game is primarily a management game at the strategic map level. There is a 3D mini-game where you can pilot your ships in and out of the ~60 ports, each rendered on actual ports. You don’t have to do the mini game, but it costs you harbour pilot fees to dock and undock, so I usualy pilot the big ships myself and let the harbour pilot do the smaller ones, because the fees for the big shps are crazy!\n\nThey could do so much more with this game though: The only online element is that the price of commodities you ship is driven by what all the other players are doing in their games (if you want true online multiplayer you need to buy TOSC: Rivals), otherwise it is a private single player experience; They could have also had a design and build your own ship element (currently you can only buy new or used predefined ship classes); They also could have had far more ports with greater variation in freight and range of commodities; I would have also like to see a 3D first person on the bridge feature to reallt challenge you in the mini-game.\n\nI have to admit that I am enjoying the management side of it as well as the gamification aspect of the quests/challenges/missions. However, I can see how after a while it will seem pointless and get boring. Maybe it would be different on a more diffilcut level, but the introductory 'easy' level is too easy, but that’s where the excelent tutorial and assistance feature sits, so that what I started with.\n\nI also have to admit that I am using Excel to help track things: I have a 4-sheet .xlsx that tracks the ports, freight, ships, routes, contracts, challenges, etc., becasue the in-game lists and tracking are not as effective at getting at ithout closing existing screens. It could have done the interface a lot better.","May 29","true","112.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
