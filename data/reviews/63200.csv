"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/63200/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","Monday Night Combat had a nice aesthetic that captured the feel of a sports show, with an intriguingly unnerving game world, and interesting if somewhat flawed gameplay that was at least worth a look.\n\nToo bad there is exactly one (1) dedicated server still running.\n\n\nThis game was basically a third-person shooter/MOBA hybrid with tower defense elements. (The free-to-play, pay-to-win sequel Super Monday Night Combat - which is currently only slightly less abandoned and which suffered from technical issues - was even more MOBA-like.)\n\nPlayers chose from one of six classes that each played different roles, and money collected on the battlefield or earned from kills could be used to build turrets and upgrade player abilities. The range of mechanics available to the player was a bit confusing for newcomers even if less complex than any actual MOBA, especially when veteran TPS/MOBA players found the game more intuitive.\n\nThe two main modes were Blitz, which saw you and your team defending your Moneyball against hordes of robots, and Crossfire, which pitted your team against another team in a 6v6 game to destroy the other team's Moneyball with the help of allied robots; more or less DotA as a shooter.\n\nThe tutorial was basic: it only taught the basics of gameplay and how to play one class. Players had to consult more in-depth guides in order to effectively learn about the game.\n\n\nMNC's world was briefly glimpsed yet revealing: it painted a picture of a totalitarian, consumerist society akin to the Roman Empire that hinted at darker aspects of our own world, where the downtrodden lower classes watched Monday Night Combat for cheap thrills.\n\nThe game's cartoony graphics weren't so stellar even when maxed out, but they served their purpose, and you wouldn't really have played this for the graphics anyway. Player customization was pretty good though, letting players choose outfits for the classes and pick a title to display gained from completing in-game achievements, such as killing a certain number of enemies. And the characters - the Pros - had some nice diversity going on: a Hawaiian, an African-American, and a woman comprised three of the six characters.\n\nOverall, despite some flaws, the game was fun enough to earn a decently sized playerbase back in the day.\n\n\nOkay, you're probably curious about my use of past tense, not to mention my implication that the game is dead. Well...\n\nOfficial servers were shut down in 2012. The playerbase relies on two Steam groups to gather players for matches either on the lone public server or temporary private ones, and you can bet that most of their small number are skilled enough to utterly stomp newer players.\n\nThere's single-player Blitz available, but there is no single-player Crossfire with AI players, which means that the Crossfire-related achievements are pretty much extremely difficult to get - and are practically no longer attainable without farming. And that's terrible.\n\n\nSo what happened to Monday Night Combat?\n\nLack of support is the most obvious problem. Microsoft wouldn't let developers Uber Entertainment update the 360 version, and they ran out of money to keep updating the PC version. The small team of devs had to jump through a lot of hoops just to get the game released. This led to disengagement from the community and an inability to address their concerns.\n\nPolygon ran an article[www.polygon.com] that illustrated these problems; it's worth reading if you're curious.\n\nTying into the inability to be engaged with and work on the game, MNC's balance wasn't all that good either from what I can tell. Skilled Snipers and Assaults were difficult to counter. Cheesy tactics abounded, such as excessive use of ricocheting weapons and sniping turrets from outside their range rendering them somewhat ineffective for point defense.\n\nThe ability for players to supercharge, and the use of what was basically a doomsday weapon located in the center of every arena, meant a losing team could effectively blunt the winning team's progress if they gained the upper hand. Hackers were a problem, the lack of community development tools/an SDK was a different problem; Tanks, Gunners and grapples were borderline overpowered off the bat, while the Assassin was apparently underpowered.\n\n\nThe only way you can really play this game now is to gather a group of friends and host your own server. I suppose that since this game originally came out in 2010, it could only have lasted for so long. It's a shame the devs didn't include player AI for Crossfire mode - even with its flaws, that's the one thing that would have ultimately saved this game from its ignoble death.\n\nAt least Uber Entertainment survived, and would go on to create large-scale RTS Planetary Annihilation - another flawed yet interesting game.\n\nThe little time I spent with Monday Night Combat was pretty fun, and it certainly had potential. The main menu song was pretty good, at any rate. But I really cannot recommend it.\n\nOh, well. The TF2 promo items were nice.","June 25, 2015","false","2.4"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","62","69","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/recommended/63200/","caleblives","Lead Shacks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/","255 products in account","There is a warning at the bottom of this review, I reccomend you read it after the rest of the review before purchasing.tl;dr: Amazing, funny, fun team based third person shooter with minor MOBA elements that's saddly very, very dead currently. If you have friends and they're all willing, it's a fantastic game though.\n\nI'll say this now, the original Monday Night Combat is one of my favorite games of all time.\nIt's a class based, PVP/PVE, team centric third person shooter set in a hilariously dark (but never seen) dystopian future where you compete as a group of clones fighting in a lethal sport in specially made and company branded arenas.\nGot all that?\nOh and there's also upgrading skills, bacon, a mascot you shoot to get money, dual miniguns, half of the classes have jetpacks, light tower defense mechanics, taunting is a way you earn money AND a sexy mascot who's also the one providing you turrets?\n\nThere's light twinges of MOBAs in Monday Night Combat, but if that makes you cringe from past experiences with MOBAs, set it aside because everything is easy enough to understand and nowhere near as punishing as your typical MOBA.\n\nThe game plays like this: There are two teams, with "bases" on each side of the symmetrical map, each base has several spots where you can place turrets and a "money ball" to defend with its own shield which has to be destroyed for the other team to win. Each base also spawns bots (which can be killed to get cash)Act, which meet at the middle of the map and clash, but without players helping them out, they won't get far. The trick is that each money ball has a shield, one that can only be broken if a friendly bot reaches the enemy money ball.\nThere's also the hilarious narrator who gives details about the setting and comments on how well you are playing. He doesn't really ever get old.\nThere's also a lot more I could talk about, like custom boost loadouts to be unlocked, each class has its own spawn-able bot type, chickey cantor... I could go on forever but I'll try to make this review short-er.\n\nThe good: It's funny, it's REALLY fun to play, it has a fantastic visual style, and the balancing is very good for the most part. It's just... really, really good. Also Chickey Cantor... gotta add at least a whole point on the review score for having a giant robotic chicken.\n\nThe bad: (Mostly nitpicks) Parts of it haven't aged so well, such as parts of the gunplay. The balance isn't perfect as that a few clases in the right hands can almost steamroll such as The Support and The Sniper. Losing isn't very fun, and sometimes you can get stuck in a losing game without much way of getting back up due to some bad investments.\n\nIt's overall a fantastic game.\nHOWEVER, WARNING\nHere's where the sad part of the review comes in... right now the multiplayer community is, except for a few groups who meet occasionally, pretty much dead. If you're wondering about my hours played being something like 1.6 or 1.9, it's because most of this game I played on the Xbox LIVE version, which had fewer maps and costumes but was still the same damn game you can buy here, and feels great with and without a controller.\nThere's also Super Monday Night Combat, the Free 2 play "sequel" is available, which more or less dumbed down the importance of the shooty bits and made it feel a bit more like a typical MOBA, but also added a whole new roster of characters and another announcer that makes it twice as funny as the original MNC. It's also dead, but you can unlock items for TF2 and vice-versa.\nAs for this game... most of what you can do now is join groups like  Hotshots Forever . Sad to see such a good game go.","August 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futil1ty/recommended/63200/","futil1ty","Futil1ty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futil1ty/","688 products in account","This game is AMAZING.\n\nI originally purchased it on Xbox 360 back in 2010 after I fell in love playing the trial version. (This was back when people actually played the game, and the servers weren't totally dead.) I think that was when the MOBA craze was just taking off, but this did something original with the formula that I hadn't seen anywhere before... It's a class-based shooter like TF2 but the game plays like League of Legends -- you protect your home base's "crystal" from the opposing team's minions (all different kinds of robots, in this case). What makes this formula even more interesting is that your "towers" (turrets) are selected and upgraded by YOU and your team using the "gold" you get from killing the enemy team and their minions. And to top this all off, it has a crazy, silly, cartoony atmosphere and art style, and it acts like it's a reality game show/sport (hence the title), complete with a witty announcer.\n\nI picked up a 4-pack for super cheap a few months ago to share with friends, but... Sadly, since no one really plays it anymore, all you're really left with is the 1-4 player "tower defense" co-op mode -- you choose your turrets to defend against waves of the different kinds of robots and defend your crystal.\n\nEventually, they released a sequel in 2012 (Super MNC), but it was a free-to-play, microtransaction mess only available on PC. It was awkward and boring with none of the charm of the original (read: hat simulator), and I don't think anyone plays that anymore either.\n\nReally, MNC is the predecessor to the likes of Smite, Minimum, and the next Orcs Must Die... If you can pick this game up for a buck or two, maybe you could get some friends together to play it, even if it's just the co-op mode. Sure, you didn't get to play it in its heyday, but you still get to play something different.","December 14, 2014","true","9.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","2"

Back when it was released on Xbox 360 Arcade, so many people jumped into this game and it was a HUGE success. Sadly, Uber Ent went and forgot about the Xbox 360 community and gave more attention to the PC version. They gave us only the Spunky Cola special DLC but never gave us the Uncle Tully's map and other DLCs they said we'd get. Eventually, they abandoned MNC on both sides, PC and Xbox and decided to make Super MNC. Community responded by not supporting Super MNC like they were hoping us to. Instead we enjoyed MNC for a much as would could until it slowly withered away.\n\nCurrently, this game is dead. The game itself is fun if people decide to jump in again and play. If Uber Ent would just drop the price of $5 and make it Free to play and just add some skins to customize your appearance WHICH DOES NOT ADD ANY STATS BOOSTS AND IS SOLELY FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES! Then they can get some money and MAYBE the community will slowly begin to revive itself. If you and some friends would like to play this game together and against each other for fun and laughs, go for it. They do have a co-op mode called Blitz. Blitz is pretty much a survival mode where you survive wave after wave of bots and you need to protect the Money Ball from getting destroyed. Blitz can be played offline. Crossfire is the multiplayer mode, it can be played offline but splitscreen, no AIs are allowed in this game for either game mode.\n\nHope this information helps anyone decide whether they want to spend money and try the game with friends, or wait until if it ever goes Free to Play.\n\nPS: I barely have hours on here because I mainly played back on Xbox 360 back in it's glory days.","January 20","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't bother. There's a good game in there but you can hardly play it. The first thing i noticed were input and settings related bugs. Then crashes. But worst of all, no servers and the inability to actually create a co-op room and invite you friends (remember, it was advertised to have this feature).\n\nIf you're lucky, you may still find a dedicated server, which most likely will be empty. If you create your own lobby, you will be unable to invite your friends and your friends won't be able to see it in the server browser (we tried it, multiple times and with multiple settings/solutions).\n\nThe only way to play this online, is to get into one of the two empty servers i have found and let your friend join them too. The downside is, you can't select the game mode or map and you most likely end up in opposing teams (1vs1 basically).\n\nIt's a shame, really, because the game itself promoses to be fun. I don't care if this was released on 2011. It's still sold and advertised on steam and i expect the advertised features to work.

The mode I always somehow end up playing is the one with robots. It's as if TF2's Mann vs Machine got refined and got some more modes of game play. For those of you not familiar with what I just reference, Mann vs Machine is a mode in TF2 where you battle robots of varying classes and once defeated drop money. If you successfully complete all 7 waves, you can then take the cash they drop to fund upgrades for whatever class you are playing. So the fact that this game is completely different but feels like another, I find very cool.\n\nAlso, maybe I'm just playing this game wrong.

The classic Blitz mode where you go up against waves of bots with up to 3 friends or randoms. Crossfire mode where you have to take out the enemy moneyball with your bots before they take out yours.

"If you brought your sniper rifle from home, than you could take some shots at Bullseye and get a few bucks off the field!"

I think this game's subtexts of tolerance and racism ring true to the world at large. It teaches us lessons like don't taunt the Assassin just because she is a woman, and don't scoff at robots just because they are blue and you are not, especially not the fast robots that love hugging. I think they're called huggers. Star Trek The Next Generation was good about this kind of thing, too. I bet Monday Night (who names his kid "Monday"?) took to heart Gene Roddenberry's deep meaningful messages, like how Geordi, a terrifying man-eating cyborg engineer, can befriend Data even though Data is a robot of a different colour from Geordi. But wait, no. The guys in Monday Night's Combat are enemies with their off-colour robotic counterparts! I don't get this at all.

MNC draws parallels to these events now alien to modern humans tamed with the domesticated and subdued format of what we now call "sports." In MNC, the combatants are not only supposed to mutilate one another, but also unautonomous "bots" on their way to glory.\n\nIn the background is the audience; in the most literal sense of what Guy Debord calls "the spectacle," we see the audience of MNC as mere shadows, replaced and defined instead by their fetish for the merciless spectacle of the arena. The overwhelming mass media advertising (so called "endorsements") of this future time reveals the financial underpinning and true consumerist nature of the event.\n\nMNC is a herald of a generation to come; warning of the lenghts to which rampant consumerism will go to ensure a profit.  In the world of MNC, the message is untimely.","January 30, 2011","true","87.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Gone are the massive servers crowded with dozens of players, opting instead for a 6 vs. 6 game where teamwork goes far towards winning the match. Matches are fast-paced and you'll find yourself running through half a dozen matches in a single sitting pretty quickly. It's easy to learn the basics but with a reward system that allows you to customize your characters abilities the more time you put in, you'll find yourself coming back with a new player design every chance you can.

Each class has 2 weapons and about 3 action skills (one is melee). The objective of the game is to have the opposing team's "Cash Ball" destroyed, and only your AI bots can do that. So your purpose is to kill opposing players, enemy bots (some are weak, some are buff), and enemy turrets. Everytime you win a round, cash goes into your account which you can spend on purchasing a custom class setup with alternate perks (aka endorsements). The maps are also dynamic, you can invest in upgrading defense turrets (like tower defense), activating jump pods, and purchasing specific bots to attack.\n\nCons: The announcer is annoying as ♥♥♥♥, the music sucks, the feel and control of the game is consolish, Sniper class feels clunky, and there isn't a tutorial except for the Assault class.\n\nIf you want an alternative to TF2, get this on sale.","June 22, 2011","true","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Let's be honest though, just about everyone on ♥♥♥♥ing Steam has Team Fortress 2, and I'm sure the first thing that pops up in your hat craving heads is that this looks like a total rip off.. But I can hoestly say this is not at all. There are a total of six classes to choose from, all with different abilities that you can level up through the gaining of money. You gain money by killing an enemy, a bot, a turret, shooting the money ball, etc. Leveling up upgrades, and sometimes adds new skills for your character. There are different game types you can play, but one of them is to destroy the other team's money ball. You're in an arena pretty much, and you are given the choice to spend your money on skills for yourself, bots to send over, turrets to protect, or them all. I'd definitely recommend you shell out the 15 bucks and quit being a stingy ♥♥♥♥♥. It'll take a little getting used to, but once you do, you'll very much enjoy it.","January 18, 2011","true","42.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

The technical aspects of the game mixed with its funny humor by characters and cartoony style make for a fun game. Monday Night Combat offers flexibility and humor in combination.","July 16, 2011","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The braying announcer welcomes you to a simplistic session of shooting mindless robots in a bland neon arena.  But if you push beyond the lackluster first impression, you'll find that those mindless robots are put to very good use in this surprisingly entertaining shooter. Monday Night Combat cleverly infuses the familiar dynamic of objective-based competitive play with tower defense mechanics to create a novel combat experience. The clever combat design and well-tuned class complexity make this a great online multiplayer class-and-team-based, third-person tower defense shooter. And if that's a bit wordy for you, then just call Monday Night Combat a very addictive and very entertaining game.","October 16, 2011","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smokindan/recommended/63200/","smokindan","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smokindan/","439 products in account","An absolutely fantastic 3rd person multiplayer shooter. Basically, it plays like Team Fortress 2, with it's mix of classes, combined with DoTA. You have bots which you must escort to the opposing team's base to destroy their Moneyball. You also have turrets to defend you Moneyball from the other team's atttack. This gives the game quite a frantic pace as you try to kill other players, kill bots and destroy turrents along with defending your own base.\n\nThe game has a fairly large learning curve, in that you'll need to spend some time learning one particular class to get into it. It's a little harsher than TF2 - probably because there are only 6 peeps per team in this game so can't be propped up as much by your teammates. Better players will also dominate you to begin with. Don't worry. Your K/D  ratio means nothing and you'll get there eventually.\n\nOnce you're past the curve it's a really fun MP game. There are still some issues with Blitz - the co-op mode. Hopefully that's fixed soon.","February 14, 2011","true","79.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I would describe it as Team Fortress 2 style gameplay and graphics combined with the strategy and teamwork necessary in League of Legends.  Class diversity and working together are essential to win, as each map is split into several "lanes" where your team's robots (as well as the other team's on their side) spawn, and have a specific route they go depending on their lane.  Your job is to clear the way, while watching out for enemy "Pro" players (the classes are called "Pros") and killing them if necessary, which it usually is.  But don't be fooled, this game is not all about racking up the kills!  You will want to lead the robots to the opposing team's "Money Ball," which can be considered the home base of their base, and have them attack it while you help.  The robots bring down the Money Ball's protective shield, but watch out for Turrets throughout the base!  If you find serious players who work together and talk, this game is VERY addicting!","February 6, 2011","true","55.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One other thing I didn't really like were the controls for the 3 powers each character has. They aren't mapped in a way that you can press them quickly without confusing yourself. I've had countless times where I pressed the wrong key. It's a fast paced game, and the buttons are color coded with a number, that's it. Yes, you can map the keys yourself, but you're missing the point. The developers chose this specific control scheme. But it just doesn't make any sense. I had rather seen buttons with the correct keys on them, or icons that show exactly what the buttons do. It's a small, but important thing. Still, if you love (ok, ok... - or like - your choice) team based third person shooters this might just be the game for you. Definately worth a few tries.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","July 6, 2011","true","5.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

After that you lay waste to it, but watch out for the base turrets! Five classes, each one can be upgraded with 4 skills, which cost money.

Monday Night Combat (better abbreviated as MNC) has been compared to the likes of Team Fortress 2 and Defense of the Ancients (DotA). The former, I don't really see, other than the fact that MNC uses classes. The latter seems like a more reasonable comparison.\n\nMNC pits you in a tug-of-war-like battle where teams, supported by AI controlled minions, attempt to push into their opponent's base to destroy the central structure, the "Moneyball". The combat system is akin to an RPG-FPS in that you level up as you kill enemy minions, players, or turrets. Leveling up grants you the ability to upgrade any one of three skills unique to each of the six classes.\n\nAll the while this is going on, an announcer will be making snide and crude comments which not only adds character to the game, but hilarity.

It plays and feels like an arena combat sports game where you are making a push towards the enemy money ball and with the help of your bots(creeps) you drop the shields and destroy it. The classes are a bit more hybridized that TF2. For instance there is a class that is like the medic and engy rolled together. You get to choose which stats to boost with money you earn through kills on bots and other players. You can also purchase and upgrade turret towers at fixed points in the map to slow the progress of the other team.

It plays and feels like an arena combat sports game where you are making a push towards the enemy money ball and with the help of your bots(creeps) you drop the shields and destroy it. The classes are a bit more hybridized that TF2. For instance there is a class that is like the medic and engy rolled together. You get to choose which stats to boost with money you earn through kills on bots and other players. You can also purchase and upgrade turret towers at fixed points in the map to slow the progress of the other team. It's a fun, cheap, sort of repatetive game that you can play when you want something a bit different.

Some people compare it to TF2 but other than some basic designs such as the class system I'd call that a lazy comparison. It plays and feels like an arena combat sports game where you are making a push towards the enemy money ball and with the help of your bots(creeps) you drop the shields and destroy it. The classes are a bit more hybridized that TF2. For instance there is a class that is like the medic and engy rolled together. You get to choose which stats to boost with money you earn through kills on bots and other players. You can also purchase and upgrade turret towers at fixed points in the map to slow the progress of the other team. It's a fun, cheap, sort of repatetive game that you can play when you want something a bit different. I'd recommend it but if you are looking for TF2 or some other shooter this one will feel different.","July 6, 2011","true","76.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a lot like TF2 with the characters, though the characters have different skills that can be upgraded by attacking more players and earning money from kills.  You have a different variety of turrets, and you have bots that aid you in attacking the other side.\n\nIt requires team work and skill. Depending on who you have on the arena and who you have on your team, you need to strategise which best tactic to go about attacking the other side. Do you defend more and build turrets, or do you upgrade as fast as you can and attack the enemy base straight away.\n\nIt is a fun game that is still a bit of a work in progress, but there is certainly more involved, has a few fun maps and the characters and their different skills, make it really really enjoyable to play.
