Had I known that it was incomplete, I would have at least waited until I could get the entire experience before playing this one. Don't get me wrong, doing chapter-by-chapter games can work, but only if you inform customers that the product itself is designed that way. Zero warning "To Be Continued" is not a promise of things to come, so much as a promise that things aren't yet. By the time a sequel comes out, I won't really remember this one anymore, nor will I care enough to come back and play it again.","October 19, 2015","false","4.1"," 134 of 155 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","134","155","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tohonas/recommended/339190/","Tohonas","Tohonas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tohonas/","554 products in account","A very solid first adventure game from Fictiorama studios. The subject matter (the eventual temporal death of everything) gives this game a much darker storyline than is common in this genre and in fact I was genuinely shocked by one or two set pieces.\n\nI played through a press copy of the game, and found the puzzles to be generally on point, except for one part where the solution was really subtle and I missed i completely for about an hour. The logic of the puzzles make sense for the most part.\n\nVoice acting is present throughout, there are a few characters which are 'misses' but in general it is very well done, and breathes life into the surroundings, and makes you care about the characters a lot more than if it was just text. The music is pretty cool too, a prog rock style that just about meshes with the surroundings, and the art style is very fresh, and unlike anything I've seen before.\n\nIf you're looking for a new, dark point and click that has obviously been made with a lot of love, you couldn't do much better than checking out Dead Synchronicity.\n\nIf you are interested, I made an interview with the devs about the process of making the game: http://www.goplaythat.com/2015/04/03/13-more-questions-with-fictiorama-studios/","April 10, 2015","true","8.6"," 69 of 79 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","69","79","6","0"

You play as a clean slate amnesiac waking up in an internment camp, attempting to piece together both your past and the nature of the global extinction level event.\n\nDead Synchronicity doesn't pull its punches. Featuring an oppressive, dystopian society with no safety nets left, the cruelties on display lend a grim, mundane realism to the environment. The story itself veers to a more fantastical direction, but remains grounded enough to keep itself interesting.\n\nThe puzzles are balanced nicely (only got stuck once), the graphics are stylish even with the sparse animation, and the length is quite nice for a game in this price range. However, there are some weak points.\n\nThe music and sound aren't terribly interesting and some of the voice acting is a bit subpar, but primarily I had issues with dialogue and characterization. The quality of writing varies wildly, and especially the internal monologue of the protagonist sometimes paints a picture of him as, well, kind of a prejudicious jerk.\n\nThis is a problem because the theme of Dead Synchronicity is all about attempting to cling onto your morality in a world where no-one else gives a damn. Sure, the hero is flawed and has to get his hands dirty during the proceedings, but his actions clearly take their toll on him and don't just get shrugged off. Therefore I found the scenes of the protagonist passing judgement on people he hadn't even talked with yet somewhat jarring.\n\nMy absolutely biggest gripe, however, is that Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today is not a complete game. The story eventually reaches a point where some light is finally shed on the reasons and scope of the catastrophe, you feel the tension ramping up and then - the credits roll. Nothing gets resolved. You're left with a huge cliffhanger and lots of plot threads swaying in the wind.\n\nThis really caught me by suprise. After re-checking the Kickstarter campaign and Steam store pages, sure enough, they do mention the game being a series, but I don't really think the fact has been communicated clearly enough in the marketing. I don't think there's even been any mention about when part two is going to be released. So if you're expecting for any kind of a resolution or even a bookend, know that you're not going to find it here.\n\nAnyhow, I do have to give the creators credit for creating an adventure game that stands out from the usual crime thrillers and Tolkien derivatives. I was left craving for more, and will surely be picking up the sequel. I just wish I'd have some kind of a clue when that time will arrive.","April 11, 2015","true","9.1"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","0"

Definately recommended.\n\nPros:\n- No bugs/glitches encountered\n- Intuitive, easy yet functional game mechanics\n- Very special story: interesting characters, good narrative (!)\n- Nice visuals / graphic design\n- Decent voice acting*\n- Getting stuck (not knowing what to do) is very rare\n\n\n*I just read a thread in the forums about the "terrible" voice acting of this game. I can definately not confirm that. Its maybe not the very best or special but absoluteley ok (both, the german and also the english voice acting, I played both).\n\n\nCons:\n- Relativeley short (my 11 hours come from multiple playthrough due to "achievement hunting" and not closing the game while doing something else for 3 or 4 hours or so): You can finish the game in three or four hours.\n- No hint-system, if you get stuck you need to look into a walkthrough (but thats rare)\n- Pretty easy. No puzzles or riddles at all, just the usual figuring out what to do /combine with what/use on what - and thats not really difficullt here, for me a little -too- easy.\n- Very sudden and open ending: It feels like the game ends in the middle of the story. Very unsatisfying and frustrating. But maybe there will be a sequel? In this case, this wouldnt be a con no longer of course but on the other hand the devs should inform the users that they have to buy (at least) a second game to get the full story - wouldnt be fair to keep something like that back. Thats an aspect I really dont like about this game... but in spite of that, its still a good game.\n\n\n\nOne thing is important to emphasise: This game gets its life from the story, the narrative > the dialogues and cutscenes. The gameplay is the less important (and shorter) part. If you would skip all dialogues and cutscenes and just do whats necessary this would probably take less than 45 min. I dont mean it as something negative, I really like story-rich games, but it is something you should know before buying this game. If you are rather bored of long dialogues and an elaborate storytelling and as much gameplay and action as possible is the most important thing for you, you could possibly consider this game a little lengthy.\n\n\nAt the same time this makes the game so intense and immersive. The story is very special und well transacted by the dialogues, the characters and so on. All thumbs up for the narrative!\n\n\n7/10 (would have been 8 if the story didnt stop suddenly without a real ending)\n\n\nConcidering that there will be a sequel (I cant believe that the story really ends this sudden and without an ending) and you have to pay for another game to get the complete story, grab it on 50% sale.\n\n\n\n___________\nEdit: Just typo mistakes, content havent been changed","November 30, 2015","true","11.8"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/339190/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","Story and look\nThe story of Dead Synchronicity takes place after a cataclysmic event has destroyed cities all around the world and replaced civilization with chaos. A gruesome pandemic gives the affected unexplainable visions, before they dissolve in a mess of pain and blood. In the midst of this, our protagonist Michael wakes up with no recollection of his past in a refugee camp on the outskirts of a city.\n\nYou soon start learning about the state of things in the new world, where most live in misery and everything is controlled by the military. Of the many unfortunate souls you encounter, the one that made the strongest impression on me was that of the disturbed and abused girl Rose, who is pimped out for money by a couple of lowlifes. Your journey to uncover your own past and try to find a cure to the pandemic puts you in several situations where you have to perform some unscrupulous actions to progress. One such situation is the defamation of a corpse, and though brutal, these circumstances very effectively add to the mood of the story.\n\nI'm not fit to judge the scientific basis of the underlying plot of the game, but as a casual consumer of science fiction I found it to be enjoyable, and the writing is good. The story had me hooked throughout and it was with no small amount of distress I reached the sudden end of the game after 7 hours, and realized I will have to wait a while for the conclusion. Don't get me wrong; the game is complete in its own right, but even more so than with the Deponia trilogy, you are left with a lot of unanswered questions after the first game. The twist at the end probably won't come as a surprise, but it left me a bit unsatisfied and yearning for more. I hope that the fact that Daedalic Entertainment is the publisher ensures that we'll see the continuation in a timely fashion.\n\nI really dig the style of this game. It nails the graphic novel look with its hand drawn backgrounds and comic book panel close ups. Cutscenes are done as a series of still frames where thick contours and a modest color palette expertly underscore the emotions of the characters. The voice acting is good, and the protagonist especially carries the story well, even through a few monologues that I felt were needlessly protracted. I also really liked the voice of Hunter, the bad guy head honcho, and found that his poised British sounding voice added something very menacing under the surface of his calm outward appearance. The score is good too, and it adds to the dystopian atmosphere of the game.\n\nPuzzles\nIf you like your puzzles on the harder end of the scale, you needn't worry. Dead Synchronicity puts the difficulty bar higher than most modern adventure games. There are many items to pick up and use, and several hotspots per location. And as you progress, you open up well over 20 locations, which are almost all accessible to the end of the game. This makes for a large number of possible permutations, and since the puzzles aren't always on the intuitive side, this adds to the challenge.\n\nSince there's no walling off and only minor inventory purges, this can make the pacing feel a bit uneven from time to time. There were a couple of occasions where I felt really stuck, like when I needed a light source and the game didn't even recognize my attempt to pick up the only portable source of light I could find. Another time I needed fuel, but had no idea how to trigger the events that would lead to me getting it, even though I knew where it was. I appreciate that the game doesn't give solutions away, but some feedback from the game could have made these moments feel less frustrating.\n\nConclusion\nThis is a Unity game, but apart from the initial resolution being wrong when I first started the game, I've had no issues with the Linux version of the game. What I did find a bit annoying is that you only have 10 save slots. As someone who likes to save often, it didn't take me long to fill them all. I ended up making a tarball of my first 10 saves to free up some slots.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and in spite of my few complaints with the writing and puzzle design, this is a very solid point-and-click adventure game. It is on the short side compared to Daedalic's own full length games, but it is not a game that is needlessly padded with cutscenes or minigames. If you don't mind the mentioned shortcomings and you're looking for a game that captures some of the essence of the LucasArts classic, with a striking new look, Dead Synchronicity is a game for you.\n\nNote, this is a small rewrite of a review I wrote for GamingOnLinux.com: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/dead-synchronicity-is-the-striking-new-pointandclick-from-fictiorama-studios-and-daedalic-entertainment.5225\n","April 12, 2015","true","6.8"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

Everything is logical. Difficulty is well balanced.\nPlenty of cutscenes.\nWell written with a good pace and tone, for the most part.\nCatchy music.\nSeamless transitions between standard and conversational views (zoom effect).\nAnd some of its weaker points:\nNon-ending; it's part 1 of the Dead Synchronicity series but it doesn't really complete an arc.\nClimax is predictable.\nSpends a lot of time setting up convoluted plot devices with insufficient pay off.\nConversations are often too verbose, and at the beginning, too close together.\nSometimes waxes poetic, slightly corny.\nOne of the horror scenes is rather gratuitous.\nAll told, DS:TCT is a very solid point & click. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best in Daedalic's catalogue, which is an impressive feat considering it's made by just 5 guys (Fictiorama Studios) who are mostly new to game development. I was an enthusiastic backer and beta tester on this and have zero regrets. Also, Fictiorama are really top guys.

Weird phenomenon appears in the sky any many people get fatally ill - getting hours of excruciating pain, with dying after that. Michael wakes up into the New World but he can't remember anything.\n\nThe shadow government and the army is trying to hold control even after the end of the old world, so Michael is held in the refugee camp that nobody can leave. There starts the depressing story about the loss of freedom inside the world full of people who died because of the illness, or because they commited suicide.\n\nThe game has pretty unique graphics style, with sharp edges of every object instead of classic round style - you can see that in the screenshots. That feels really great for the atmosphere on the game, it has only one flaw - it makes all women in the game look ugly. Also, while the environment looks great and detailed, most characters looks more simplified.\n\nDifficulty is not so hard, I haven't personally met any moment where I would get desperate enough to check walkthroughs, though there are definitely parts where you'll get stuck for a while. And meanwhile you'll be trying all possible combinations of items and objects, you might get a surprise achievement. That's because most of the Steam achievement are unlocked for trying silly usage of items, mostly in reference to popular culture.\n\nConclusion:Adventure published by Daedalic Entertainment usually shows a great promise, and Dead Synchronicity is no exception. It's not too much long and it offers a opportunity for possible sequel, but it's been a great play for several hours. If you find the story I've described interesting, think about buying the game.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 2","true","10.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Players take on the role of Michael who awakes in a nightmarish world of oppression and desperation with no memory of who he is or where he came from. The storyline has Michael solving situational logic puzzles (a trope of point and click adventure games) to further the search for his memories and to help provide both Michael and the player with details regarding the new world and why life seems to be deteriorating at a rapid pace.\n\nThe first notable thing in the game is the visual aesthetic. Bold lines and strokes mark somber expressions and downcast faces, while subdued browns, reds and grays fill the backdrops. There has never been a more desperate set of characters and locations. The "old world" has been torn down by a catastrophe of unknown origin, marked by a tear in the sky which seems to be unraveling threads from the tapestry of reality. People are falling ill to a mysterious sickness. Those afflicted are referred to as the "dissolved" since they quite literally <em>melt</em> to death.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vskjefst/recommended/339190/","vskjefst","vegard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vskjefst/","265 products in account","My game reviews are usually focusing on relatively old games. The main reason for this is that I buy most of my games on sale and games on sales donât tend to be recent releases. This time, however, we have an exception. The dystopian point and click adventure Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today was released under a month ago, and Iâve already managed to play my way through it. Hereâs my quick and dirty review.\n\nDead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today is developed by Fictiorama Studios, a Spanish indie game studio founded by 3 brothers; Mario, Alberto, and Luis OlivÃ¡n. They describe their game as âa dark point and click adventure [with] old-school 2D graphic adventure game featuring space-time distortions, a dystopian atmosphereâ¦ and a dark, bloodstained plotâ. About a year ago, Fictiorama Studios turned to Kickstarter for funding to complete the game, and thatâs where I noticed it and pledged. Iâm for some messed up reason drawn towards dystopian themed fiction, movies and game, so Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today was right up my alley. When the Kickstarter campaign ended, Fictiorama Studios had met their funding goal and even managed to raise enough money for their first stretch goal; 3 additional locations and 2 new characters.\n\nIn the game you play Michael, who wakes up in dark room with a bad case of amnesia. Not remembering a thing from the past is a classic way to start both adventure and role playing games since it makes it very easy for the developer to drop the player in the middle of the story without the need to provide a back story. You also get the immediate sense of mystery and adventure, since the player has to help the poor character figure out what happened. So the very beginning of the game is very regular, but thatâs pretty much the only part of the Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today story where youâll get the feeling that âsomeone else has done this beforeâ. As a whole, the gameâs narrative feels very original.\n\nMichael finds himself in a world where a terrible pandemic is turning all of humanity into the Dissolved, and illness that provide the infected with supernatural cognitive powers. But it also steer them towards a gruesome death. They simply dissolve. The root of this illness seems to be the Great Wave, an inexplicable chain of natural disasters that destroyed all energy sources and communications and plunged the world into a chaos ruthlessly controlled by both the authorities and the army alike. Many people have been put in a refugee camp and Michael soon finds out he is one of them. By helping individuals he comes across in the camp and in the nearby city, one more shady than the other, Michael is able to slowly piece his past back together.\n\nThe art style is a blend of dark, hand-drawn, dystopian backgrounds and rather rough, and very distinct character art. The rugged design of the characters really suit the game, and gives it a very recognizable style that Iâm curious to see if Fictiorama Studios will continue to use in their future games. Unlike many other adventure games, thereâs a lot of music in Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today. The main reason is probably that two of the studioâs brothers are in a band called Kovalski, which wrote the gameâs soundtrack. Even though the quality of the soundtrack is good, the use of it sometimes feels misplaced and forced. There are some parts of the game that could have easily worked better with the dialogue alone. If the compositions by Kovalski get too much for you, itâs possible to turn the music off, but that doesnât feel right either since there are parts of the story that are made even more dramatic by the music.\n\nEvery piece of dialogue in Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today is voice acted, even Michaelâs description of everything he sees around him. But the quality of the different voice actors goes from pretty good to cringeworthy. Some of the voice acting sounds like itâs simply being read from a piece of paper, which sort of leaves the âactingâ out of âvoice actingâ. Thankfully, the guy doing the main character Michael is quite good. But that the quality of the voice acting isnât prime across the board shouldnât come as a big surprise. Itâs a relatively low budget game, and my guess is that this is the first professional gig for many of the voice actors.\n\nIf you expect a lot of adventuring, you will be left disappointed. My impression is that the game is roughly 80% dialogue and interacting with other character, and 20% adventuring. Most of that 20% will be spent trying to figure out ways to use items in your inventory with the environment, or with other items youâve collected. In spite of Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Todayâs very helpful hint system â you simply press space and the game will highlight objects in the environment you can interact with â itâs often far from obvious what youâre supposed to do. At least thatâs how it felt to me, but then again, Iâm not exactly a top-notch adventure gamer. I did from time to time give up and looked at a video walkthrough I found online.\n\nIn the end, I spent 8 hours completing Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today. If I had not âcheatedâ and looked at the walkthrough, I probably could have added an additional two hours to my gameplay. But it would also have driven me to the brink of madness. The 8 hours I played include an hour I spent to collect all the Steam achievement, some of which require you to do things that thereâs a very good chance you wonât think of while playing the game â unless you try to use everything with everything.\n\nWithout spoiling anything form the story line, I can say that there is without doubt a possibility for a sequel to Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today. If we will ever see one or not is hard to say. Fictiorama Studios is a small indie developer, and even though the game is currently enjoying a 73/100 score on Metacritic and very positive reviews on Steam, we donât know anything about how well the game is doing financially.\n\nI, for one, will be happy to pledge again to any future Fictiorama Studios crowd funding campaigns, the developer has shown that it can deliver on their promises. So if the studio has to go the crowd funding route again to get a sequel released, Iâm all ears.\n\nThis review is also available on https://www.vegard.net/archives/11267/","April 29, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

When a game takes this route they need to stand out, and to say that Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today stood out would be an understatement. The story goes that the world has ended thanks to a âGreat Waveâ and people are âdissolving.â Your character Michael may have all the answers to what's going on, but the problem is he doesn't remember a thing and now has to adjust to this new world. A product of a successful Kickstarter by Fictiorama Studios and published by Daedalic Entertainment, Dead Synchronicity is an interesting take on the point-and-click genre. The story is the main focus of the game, rather than puzzles or the âput random item together' narrative that seems to be the staple of the genre. This leads to interesting results with the game's overall narrative and gameplay style.

That would mean that the complete game costs 40â¬ and with that it's more expensive than masterpieces like The Night of the Rabbit or Book of the Unwritten Tales 2, while it offers in every matter (especially graphics and size) way less then them.\nBut if you like thrillerish adventures with horror elements (like I do), I would recommend to buy it if it is on sale for at least 14,99â¬ or less.","May 14, 2015","false","9.1"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","16","29","0","0"

I seriously hate what they did in the end. The worst thing in this game is the ending. The game is ment to be in 2 parts so you will have to pay 20 euros once again to know how it ends.(Of course if they will actually make it). Voice acting isn't briliant to say the least. Most of the time there are no emotions in voices. Sometimes it even looks like actors were just reading their lines not knowing what's happening right now in the game.\nIn addition i didn't realy like main character who is just 'gray' in this brutal world. I'd rather like him to be good or evil not sometimes heroic just to in different situation act like the devil himself.\nYou could ask why you gave thumb up? Well, I really enjoyed this post-apocaliptic world with many well made characters like Hunter and Rose. Also quite a few dialoges were just really well written (like reference to World War II and concentration camps).

At this time, it is undetermined how many entries this series will have, or when the next one will arrive. Beware reviews that state that they were "uninformed" that this is an episodic point and click; that information is right on the store page.\n\nThe game revolves around a man named Michael, who is considered a "blankmind" since he woke in the new world with no recollection of his past. Throughout the story, you will uncover the details of what was significant in his past and you will also piece those together with what is going on in the present. As expected, being the initial entry into an episodic series, this title involves uncovering a lot of backstory. During the main timeline, an illness that turns people into "the Dissolved" is sweeping the land, and Michael is tasked with finding a cure for the son of the family who saved him. There are several plot twists, though the major one that comes at the end can easily be guessed during the early parts of the game; so it really comes as no huge surprise.\n\nThe dark expressionist artwork is exceedingly grim and blood soaked. There's a grand use of clashing warm and cool pastel colors that really sets off the dystopian vibe that this game has. The backgrounds are brilliantly drawn and painted, however I do feel that the characters, especially Michael, could have used a little more work. This latter point could also be due to the fact that I'm personally not a fan of the harsh, straight lines that expressionism is known for when it comes to homo-sapiens, but the characters seem much more bland in comparison to the world that they're roaming around in. Along with the fantastic artwork is an equally fantastic soundtrack. I'm not a big fan of indie music, but Kovalski did a great job of adding forlorn ambiance to the game. The music really brings out the overall mood of the title, although if you stay in an area too long the music will stop and it will fail to loop.\n\nThere are only a few gripes that anyone will have with Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today. For one, the game is $24.99 CAD, and it only lasts at best for 4 hours. Unlike many other Daedalic Entertainment point and clicks, the game isn't very complex or difficult to figure out either, so it's unlikely that it will provide a challenge for the seasoned point and click fan. Those who are not a fan of episodic games might as well wait until there's either a full collection available, or at least until we find out when the next title will come out. There's nothing exceptionally riveting in this initial installment, and especially not for the price point; the game has been terribly over-hyped. If you find it on sale for $5-10, it's definitely worth taking a look at, though.\n\nRating: 3.0/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 21","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's great!\nDid it manage to leave me with chills? Boy, from head to toes!\nIs it worth buying? Well...\nDeach Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today is a logical/puzzle point-and-click adventure game set in a post-apo atmosphere.\nIn other words, things are bongos in there. Really, just look at the first 30 minutes and you'll find:\n-Homicide,\n-Theft,\n-Lack of any trust or basic human decency whatsoever,\n- pedophilia and sexual abuse mentions, pimping - all in once!\n-Big talks about how monstrous human nature is, people are bad, evil, wild, the true enemy isn't walkers, Clementine  homo homini lupus est and whatnot\nWhat makes it so good? Art, man. The atmosphere is one-of-a-kind, everything's dirty and the way it's supposed to be. The soundtrack isn't what made this year's Grammy Awards Academy completely lose its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, but it never stands in the way of fun, and is actually enjoyable once you give it a good hear. Most of the people have their own personalities, there aren't many cliche things  (if you exclude the "Main Character Amnesia" trope and some other little rubbish) . Well, what makes it so bad that I won't recommend it to you, then?\nFirst off, voice acting. It's not terrible, but if it was average in general, it'd be okay. The thing is, it's either pretty damn good or veeery bad, no in-between. Poor job, Rod Atkinson and his wifey's voice actors, and kudos to the hobo, Hank and the main character's.\nSecondly, the plot. It's SO GOOD most of the time, but as you reach the end...  it feels as if you cheated on a Physics test in grade 7, and they employed you to CERN as a punishment. As if your mom made you the Nike manager just after teaching you how to tie your shoelaces when you were 4. Overstatement? The very last "puzzle" before the grand finale is just covering up a generator before it gets water poured on it (and to say more, that's a waste of a great concept of doing stuff across the past and the present). Then it jumps from gameplay to a bit of quantum physics/time philosophy (?), with an explanation that's a bit... ridiculous.\nAnd what's best? The "big thing" that explains what the hell the title means (it's explained, but the entire lecture feels made up on the go)... it's actually not there. An abrupt ending. Non. Nein. Niet. Nothing more. Finito. "You've been Playing [insert title here], thanks chump."\nThere's SUPPOSED TO BE a sequel, because for some reason (probably budget), it's an episode game. But one, nothing in the game hints at it, two, not really anything hints at it. The post where the dev said it'll all "be explained soon" was from a year ago. If they need time, fine, but I'm not going to say this game is recommendable unless it gets an ending that doesn't feel wrapped up in a hurry.\nAlso, puzzles. I have a really big problem with them, because on one side, they were mostly what puzzles are supposed to be - intuitive, or solvable once you give things a good thought. An the other side...\nI literally spent 30 minutes wandering around the game's several accessible locations because I missed some boards in the location where I originally though: "Okay, but... what now?"\nAnd some things are HARD to see. Like the boards, standing on a wooden shelf, not really looking alike anything else but background. Nitpicking, but! there's also another place when you have to take something out of somebody's hand, and the problem is that either you can't see the hand, or the hand is too similar to the background. A couple minutes spent on looking for the hand, yup.\nI won this game in a contest, so I can't say I had any expense in buying it, but I can't say I did nothing to get it either. All I can tell you: The devs made a great job with their experience and possibilities. They deserve support, but paradoxically, not by buying this game. In short: They deserve money to finish it, but... not really trough this game. For me, it's a very enjoyable experience, but seeing the price you'd have to pay not to even find out the entire story, I'd advice you to:\na) keep your money for better times (or other games)\nb) wait for a sale to buy it and make your own opinion\nCrazy, right?

The drawn characters with the music, the "film sequences" parts in the game, they are on spot. Perfect fit for the storyline.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game let's you keep playing. You feel part of this dystopian nightmare with really really dark pictures and scenes from time to time, you have to know, what's going on...\n\nIt's a classic point-n-click with a straight gameplay. There are no side-quests, there is only one quest per time solveable. The vast majority of this quests seemed logical to me. "Logical" + "only one quest solvable at a time" made it maybe a little bit too easy.\n\nThe ending is open and up to interpretation. I hope there will be a 2nd part for this fantastic storyline so far. For comparison: I played some hours of Deponia, another point-n-click game from Daedalic. I think Dead Synchronocity is far superior, it will give you 8-9 hours high entertainment.\n\nPlayed it on Linux without issues.","September 6, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are many overused tropes in this game, but the story twists in such delightful ways that you don't mind at all in the end. The music is very well done and works with the scenes and the sound effects always fit perfectly. The post-apocalyptic storyline was so good and they fleshed it out very well. I never felt wanting for more information because at some point during the game, they described everything I needed to know in great detail. I also liked that I could rewatch the cutscenes whenever I wanted by simply accessing the notebook.\n\nSome of the voice acting didn't fit the characters or the flow of the words 100% but it's still very well done.\nI also enjoyed the diversity of characters.\n\nBe warned that if you play this game, there are some very dark and horrifying things you have to do/witness/listen to in order to proceed with the game. Some might even consider them triggering in some instances.\n\nI was so intrigued by the puzzles and the plot that I basically could not stop the game once I started. I got stuck on a few puzzles, but I managed to always find my way through.\n\nThe only true downside to the game is the ending. It's a MASSIVE cliffhanger and I literally lept out of my chair because I was so frustrated. However, I still highly recommend this game and I will definitely be buying the sequel.\n","June 21, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wait, what!?\nYou apply it to the shoes !?\nAnd there where a few other similar points.\n\nThe shop page talks about "open world", but you will find yourself going back and forth around 20 panels, sometime not even seeing that there is an exit on a corner.\n\nAlso, as Siggy313 stated, I was surprised to see the "you have played Dead Synchronicity".\nI was not aware that the story would not be complete.\n\nThe writing do brings the story in a decent way, but as you don't have much to say in term of choices, I feel the "should I take this responsability, Should I do this, what kind of person am I" a bit monotonous...\nAltough the game made it very clear from the first dialogs "you do what you have to do" is the motto.\n\nSo in the end, yes, I enjoyed playing it, and it was a rainy day anyway.\nWould I play it again?

Oh no is right, that's what I was saying by about time three of the approximately one thousand times my game was interrupted and frozen to show me the exact same slight rearrangement of the environment and have me listen to to main character speak the same lines again.  Other than that frequent annoyance, there is so much talking in this game, none of it very interesting.  There are no branching conversations, just go down the list of conversation options and listen to characters give lengthy exposition with mostly mediocre voice acting.  Some of the accents are so weird that it I was puzzled for a while trying to place them.  Then I figured out that in some cases they were apparently the worst attempts at fake southern accents since Edward Norton.  The endless exposition makes this seem like more of a VN than at game at times.  Breaking up the long dialogs are some really bad "adventure game logic puzzles."  Use a car seat on a basement window?  Why the heck not?  It's really more a mercy when the game just suddenly ends right in the middle of the story.

To be critical though, the dialogue and story direction is often somewhat amateurish and on several occasions a discussion is laboured to the point where I got bored and clicked through until the conversation ended. A couple of scenes are well done and really fit in with the atmosphere and give you a "urgh that's awful" moment - which is what it's selling. Also, a couple of the characters are done very well (ref to the old guy waiting by the fire). The generic 'bad guy' who repeatedly calls you 'dude' on the other hand is a resounding swing-and-a-miss.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the conclusion of the story is unsatisfying. It plays like the end of a chapter and not the end of the game; it's predictable and isn't actually a conclusion. While this can be OK fin games, Dead Synchronicity is not sufficient in length to make that feel right. It's also quite clichÃ© particularly in referencing the protagonists so-called 'dark' past, and I think the point would have been better made if they'd eased off a little in that regard. The 'chapters' are also quite short, with [I think] the transition between Ch2 and 3 being only a few minutes to reach without rushing or using any kind of walkthrough.\n\nThere is a cool effect where the protagonists vision shifts in time, but except in one single scene (where you're free to manipulate what's happening when he shifts), it doesn't really add much overall - why can't I do things in every shift? Or at least more than one. The puzzles were reasonably in difficulty/obscurity as you would like to see in an adventure game.\n\nYes, this does represent a dark time when everything has gone to put, but somehow the dialogue and mixed voice acting detracts from feeling the full brunt of the desperation and immorality the designers were obviously trying to pitch.\n\nIf you don't mind a fairly short game that has a "dark" rather than truly dark story and leaves you feeling not particularly fulfilled with its faux conclusion then this isn't bad for the price. However, if you're more hardcore and want a full story with rich deep narrative then this just won't hit the spot.","May 20, 2015","false","4.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

This is because it had been designed as a two part series and the fact that it seems to no longer be continuing is heartbreaking.\n\nThe story is great and the gameplay is fun, though confusing at times like any point and click adventure, not knowing what to do with what or what goes where. My only complaint is that it kills off women characters before they have a chance to be apart of the story. There are three seperate of this, though one is actually fairly involved in the story and does help out, but is "killed" off in a mental break/trance/whatever near the end and is effectivey dead storywise. The other died at the beginning before the story even began, but seems that she would have had a more major role had the game's squel been a reality.\n\nI say that the squel is probably not coming any time soon, if at all, because the developer has seeming dropped it, not even making a a comment on Steam about anything since April 27, 2015. I also have not heard or found ANYTHING about the apparent squel "Dead Synchronicity: Underground Highways" besides the fact it was planned. No announcements, no kickstarters, nothing!\n\nIt's so disappointing because its such an interesting game that gave me hours of entertainment, but the fact it seems to be abondoned and ends in a cliffhanger that leaves a vast amount of questions unanswered and a story unfinished is why I do not reccomend this game and I'm bitter that there is a very unlikely chance I will be getting a refund due to my play time.","April 20","false","7.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However, over and over, bad writing and worse voice acting let it down.\n\nWriting and voice acting has always been a week spot for the studio, but this game really takes it to another level. At times, the writing feels deeply hokey and frustrating - it's as if the writer wants to remind you every other sentence how brutal life in the post-apocalyptic waste is. Asides mid-conversation from the protagonist will constantly pound you with comments about how this world isn't for the innocent any more, how back in his time people were kinder, etc - all in the most hammy ways.\n\nThe voice acting is often beyond terrible, too. This is a common feature to Daedelic games, but this one hits a new low. Several characters sound as though they are not native English speakers, and those that don't struggle with a convincing accent often sound as though they are reading the script for the first time. There's an English-sounding actor playing a gangster who ends every sentence with the most sarcastic '... dude' you will ever hear, several character who sound like saturday-morning-cartoon villains from the early 90s and inexperienced child voice actors who just sound.. wrong.\n\nThe whole experience is jarring and takes you away from what are some good concepts and, as usual, some great and satisfying puzzles.\n\nAll in all, you can buy better adventure games, and Daedelic have made some of 'em.

Maybe I couldn't get past the initial boring bit, but given the way it was playing out, I doubt it. The dialogue is long winded to the point of agonizing. You don't need to be told it's a wasteland five times when you can walk around and see that it's a wasteland. You don't need to be told you live in a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when you can look around and see that it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The storytelling is obvious, lazy, and cumbersome. Game play is clunky. The dialogue system forces you to read a selection, then when you click to ask the question, your character asks the thing you just read again.

I'm going to try out steam's new return option ASAP.","June 30, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","0"

Except maybe weird walking animation, and lack of face amination on close-up scenes (really, what is the point to make animated faces and not use it when you really showing mostly faces?) Sadly, there's nothing much more: puzzles are quite simple, locations are few, characters are scetchy and lack of any deep, and protagonist got... Well, very weird moral. Not really a guy I'd like to emphatize, No idea if it's like 1st episode or a complete game (~5 hours of gameplay), but I'm sure it's last for me: storyline isn't much facsinating or thrilling.","April 19, 2015","false","6.3"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"
