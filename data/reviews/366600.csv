Certainly not. From what I've played of it the combat, movement, and story are all quite solid. From the dashing mid-air, to the 'training' sword fights at the beginning, it's proved to be quite charming thus far.\n\nIt may be that I have a thing for platformers.. who knows?\nI've played quite a few, and I have definitely gotten my money's worth in enjoyment so far. :)\n\nCurrent score:(7/10)\n\nI will come back and edit this review the further into the story I get.","August 3, 2015","true","3.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","3"

There was a couple bad bugs but the dev is working hard to fix them/has fixed them and it is an otherwise great game. Great pixel graphics, solid and rather original controls/combat, cool characters and story. Hopefully more people give it a try.","August 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

It's quite open - and that is possibly it's downfall. That one guy who played it longer than me, hasn't successfully got any further than I did, so how can he recommend a game he can't complete? Seriously, it's a great looking game, the controls are odd, but you get used to them, and the story and humour is nice. If only it weren't for the fact you get stuck so "early" into the game.","May 23","false","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After following the story and picking up a key item in a room, going back to the room before it suddenly teleports you to a completely different one, when the room should be connected to a similar one. There are a few more examples like this, but this can quickly skip some content for you if you follow these maps too much. You can also get stuck on some platforms if you accidentally jump too high (which is another bug)\n\n- Combat and movement. Hard to tell when to block enemy and you cant for example go up a ladder while jumping.. generally the movement is just too jumpy.. its like you are controlling leaping frogs from that board game\n\n- Some of the music is too tingly\n\n- Lack of checkpoints when there are some bugs or areas coming up that you can't really be sure of how dangerous they are. for example, there might be a empty chasm in front of you and you try jumping down from it thinking there is another room, but you die instead and have to restart from last save (which can be pretty far and even behind extra dialogue).\n\n- Some of the setting/rooms not being very fitting\n\n- Lack of coin drops from enemies and other things and only being able to get a few coins at a time from things like bosses and breakable objects. Because of this you won't even have much money for upgrades and might have to grind (I'm not sure, because I'm gonna stop playing after getting cards).\n\n- "Prestige" achievements\n\n6/10 but I still recommend giving it a try as I think others might like it.","August 12, 2015","true","3.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hollow0n3/recommended/366600/","hollow0n3","hollow0n3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hollow0n3/","1445 products in account","ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW THE DIVIDE:\n\nI gave this a negative review first because bugs made the game near to fully unplayble at first.\nI promised to wait a week for the dev to bring out fixes and look at it again then.\nI just did that, here's what I conclude from that.\n\nIt seems the window/fullscreen bug that got the displayed area of the game limited to one corner of the actual screen it should show got fixed.\nSame for the lockup of keyboard and controller input that made me stop attempting to play previously.\n\nThis is a plattforrmer game with a story, you are a wind type fighter but you wont notice that much at first since you work in the library.\nThe control scheme is seemingly oldschool and awkward at the same time.\nYou press up to jump by default which makes jump dashing somewhat tricky, especially when using a joypad.\nMore about the controlls and the problems I found with them below..\n\nIf you explore a lot between story bits like me there is a chance that you will run into the first monster while having no way to defend yourself beside running.\n\nSome messages that are supposed to give tutorial hints vanish  too fast to be of much use.\nGraphics are okay for this type of plattformer, but have some weaknesses which are appearent while changing rooms/maps. The scrolling isnt as smooth as it could be especially when you are in a smaller room, which usally results in the map moving a noticeable bit before the room/map actually changes.\n\nControlling your character can be harder then it needs to be, since my xbox controller somehow uses all keys from all control shemes in the options at the same time.\nAs in, once I got a certain item that was supposed to make it easier to reach places previously not possible it did that, but at the same time brought the pause menu up.\nWhich.. made it a lot harder. Changing the controlls in the menu did have an effect, sadly still overlayed all controll shemes. The control display GUI in the upper right corner of the screen also reflects that after I kept an eye on it, it keeps changing back and forth between keyboard and controller button lables.\n\nI assume this will be fixed later on, if I could give this a neutral review I would. Unfortunally steam does not have that option. I played plattformer games since the original gianna sisters was new.\nI still play lots of them. This has some potential but awkward default controls make it hard to enjoy unless one is into that extra challenge caused by that.\n\nGraphics, solid for what the game tries to be, music and sound effects? Similar.\nFun, maybe for you, not so much for me. I stopped a bit after I got the third Item which caused me to notice the problem with current controls.\n\nSo, did I actually try this? Now that I could, I did for as far as I could stand right now.\nWhich isnt that much because of the problem with control shemes overlaping.\nThis tries to be a plattformer with story and metroidvania elements, it falls short for me personally.\nSo, I repeat, neutral review, this got good and bad parts. Decide for yourself.\n\n\n~~~ THIS IS THE DIVIDE ~~~\n\n\nWithin the first attempts to play this I encountered a bug that makes it impossible to properly set the graphic settings to window mode the first time.\nThen a bug that makes ALL controls unresponsive when loading a saved game.\n\nIn the current state this is not something anyone should attempt to play.\n*If* it gets fixed while I still have this installed I'll try again and maybe change my review.\n\nEDIT: The dev posted in my related thread that he will look into the bugs and hammer away at them.\nI'll leave the game installed for a week and check again then, it's also nice how many downvotes I get for mentioning problems the dev and other people recognise as real.","August 2, 2015","false","3.3"," 15 of 39 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","15","39","2","6"
