First, no multiplayer LAN/Steam capability(only local hotseat). Second, There are no extra gamemodes other than classic(no Capital Risk, no Same-Time Risk, no choice in 60%/80%/100% Domination, JUST CLASSIC.... ONLY CLASSIC). Third, the game just doesn't really articulate the battle sequence and will leave you wondering what just happened.\n\nIf you want to play Risk on your computer get Risk: Factions, this game is horribly incomplete. Alternatively, you can download Risk II on CNET but it is up to you to get a game to work with no support(just like this game I imagine).\n\nPost Sctiptum: Same-Time Risk, best way to play in my opinion.","January 5, 2014","false","0.1"," 132 of 143 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","132","143","0","4"

There is no online multiplayer but it does have local multiplayer.  It's good for someone like me who doesn't really care about online play for a game like this.  It also lets you play the game fast pace because you can quickly skip through the computers turns and then see what happened and make your move.  No more waiting for that one pesky player that just wont go, and no worried about someone online going AFK for long periods of time.  If this sounds like something you would desire from a game this is a good pick (I travel a lot for work and it is a nice game to play when I am sitting on a cramped air plane, I have even played with other passangers I meet sitting next to me).  If this game sounds like you I would also recommend picking up the game of monopoly on here that is also on steam, it is a very similar setup as this game. If you just want online play then your going to be disappointed and I would recommend avoiding this game.","November 29, 2014","true","59.9"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","37","44","5","0"

But you can only play against AI (which doesn't act remotely human), the virtual die rolls tend toward extreme results with implausible frequency, and even the interface is somewhat unreliable. I mean it about those die rolls - you can easily go from the only player with long-term control of defensible continents to the guy getting hosed off the map because the "dice" gave the AI a 10:1 kill ratio when it counted. Granted, this partly compensates for the awfulness of the AI, but it's still pretty aggravating. Oh, and it crashes or drops your current game from time to time, though they're getting a little better about patching it. But it's just a bad product.. Sadly, it's also one of the few of its kind I've found on Steam, hence my embarassingly huge play time.","January 10, 2015","false","55.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","1"

Your goal is to conquer the world. Achieving this won't be easy though. You'll have to be tactfull and keep an eye on your competition all the time.\n\nPro's:+ If you like the board game, you will like this version aswell.\n+ Nice graphics. Nothing too fancy, staying true to the original board, but with a new touch.\n+ AI is tactfull. AI will try to prevent oponents to gain/hold of a continent.\n+ Customization of your game. You can set a limited amount of options in order to customize your game.\n\nCons:- Very limited gameplay options. No missions, no on-line multiplayer.\n- Replayability is low. Ofcourse every game is different, but due to the limited amount of options it feels like repeating the same over an over very quickly.\n\nI can recommend the game for the true Risk fans. If it's on sale it's even nice to pick up if your relative new to the game. However else I'd save my money for something else. Mainly due to the limited options a no for Risk.

Antrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFantrider/","426 products in account","There are two games you want to win at when attending a party to really flash your nuts--prove that you got big ole steel ballz.  Of course, those would be Chess and Risk.  Ladies, I know you don't have ballz, but I know for a fact you kan dominate at Risk... so don't think I'm discriminating.  We'll just say if you have an iron cl*t... or something.  Why do we always measure dominance in ballz?  Anyways.....\n\nThis is a bare-bones version of Risk.  You can tweak a bit of the rules, but very little.  It's essentially classic Risk, like when it first came out.  It's single player, unfortunately... because EA doesn't have the money to throw down on figuring out how to make Risk f**king multiplayer.  But.... it is redeemed in its fast gameplay.  You can choose to auto battle or roll each turn.  Each game lasts me only about 10-30 minutes which is nice so you can sneak a quick game in once in awhile.  No mission cards, or tactical cards, which I very much like.  I think the original board was perfect in itself and enjoy this pure experience.  It's great to practice different strategies on since the games are so simple and quick.\n\nWORD TO THE WISE: Alright, really this game is kind of a giant load of sh*t.  Don't let the description by the developers fool you.  They could have made it a million times more immaculate. It IS a great alternative to all the shotty attempts at Risk knock-offs.  But it's also the same game, essentially, that is on Pogo.  So your money is probably better tossed there if you don't permanently want this in your steam library.  At least on Pogo you could play other people... you can't make alliances unless you pay money though.\n\nCaveat emptor~Risk works half the time on my computer and half the time just completely frizzes out in ridiculous ways I can't understand.  I am pretty sure this is a Win8 problem, but if you can tolerate the program freezing 50% of the time you try and play, it's worth it.  Try and get this game on sale, definitely.. unless you REALLY have that kraving for Risk.  I'll throw the specs for my laptop up on my profile if you want to compare... I suggest going to canirunit.com or whatever the hell that one site is when trying out games.","March 25, 2015","true","38.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

I rarely play any PC or console games at all. This met my hopes and expectations. I don't regret the purchase AT ALL! I will have much fun playing this classic with my family and friends. I don't like the online multi-player world but I love playing against family and friends and with this game you can do just that. I'm looking forward to doing the same thing with the golf game in my wish list, hopefully without all that upgrading clubs, equipment, clothes and skill level crap and without having to play LAN-style on separate computers in the same house like with WGT or Tiger Woods. I'm looking forward to more classic and popular modern board game adaptations becoming available too. The only thing that was a bit disappointing with this game was having to play it in the 4:3 aspect ratio. It was enjoyable enough but I would love to have it fill the screen in an update (or if I'm missing something, I would love to have someone explain to me what I'm doing wrong).

It appears to run, but then I can't select anything in the opening menu, it simply doesn't respond to the keyboard or mouse. My 9 minutes of "gameplay" was me just opening it several times and trying to get it to work.\nAn opportunity to view it elsewhere also left me unimpressed. I played an older version while growing up and that version puts this one to shame. I do not care much about the lack of multiplayer, as I was only looking for single player with AIs, the way I used to play, anyway. But the screen is awful (the game launches in a small window, and the so called "full screen" is a skinny view, running down the centre and leaving at least half the screen wasted to either side. It also appears to be far less attractive overall compared to the years-old game, has a terrible AI system, a complete lack of options before starting the game, crappy sound effects, no clear battle sequence, I could go on.\n\nHasbro should be ashamed of itself for releasing this version. It appears as if they did not care to release a game that could even be considered decent. A shame, considering how fun the original board game and computer version were.","October 13, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunatelly this edition from this developer doesn't offer party experience because it's in low graphic, full screen mode looks terrible and I just really with someone add that finish touch.

For this purpose, the game was very helpful.  I mastered the game concepts within a couple of games.\n\nOn the other hand, I found the computer to be a pretty easy opponent, only losing once after 6 or 7 rounds on the hardest difficulty level (keep in mind that I'm a complete beginner).  And there's no multiplayer, so there's no possibility of challenging myself further with this game.  I just bought it today and I already feel I'm close to squeezing out all the fun that I'm going to get out of this one.\n\nThe dealbreaker for me though, is I can't seem to get windowed mode to work.  I simply get an error message that says that my screen is not compatible with windowed mode.  This is a pretty cheap game with substandard graphics.  They couldn't have coded it well enough to make windows mode compatible with my screen?  That's pretty bizarre.\n\nAnother bad element is that there is only one game mode: Classic.\n\nBotttom line: I'd say this game would be better priced at 5 dollars (generously).  Regular Risk players probably shouldn't bother even at that price.  As is, I'll probably keep playing once in a while if I'm in the mood for Risk, but I feel I've overpaid for very bottom-of-the-barrel product.","December 5, 2015","false","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though I had fortified borders in the Middle East and Ukraine, the AI came all the way up through Indonesia and through Africa and South America. This seems to happen really often when you skip their turns, otherwise it's almost impossible for them to be able to muster enough units to attack my 20-man each borders.","December 22, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This version just feels depressing.\n\nStill a great job, just not my favorite PC version.","February 25","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
