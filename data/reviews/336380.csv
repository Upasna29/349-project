The game is $5, so I wouldn't expect a AAA title, but I also wouldn't expect what feels like a inexperienced teenager's personal game development project.\n\nCatmouth Island is an episodic 3D adventure where you play as Mia.\n\nThe game itself obviously had a lot of work put into it. Unfortunately, there's a fine line between "casual adventure" and "walking simulator." If you look around the store page or the Facebook, you will see a myriad of early supporters with an inside scoop on how to beat the game. If you aren't one of the close friends of the developers, you'll end up walking around in a complete daze searching for the game and the story, but again, apparently this is okay because it's all under the guise of "casual." Even more unfortunately, fans and developers of this title do not want to hear much criticism.\n\nControls are simple, click to walk, and you can even right click to see what objects you can interact with. While this is great, everything feels a little too spaced out. The game almost insults you by letting you walk around aimless then placing a sign that says "turn around" or "why are you here?" at the end of long, useless paths. It's funny when you only walked for 10 seconds, but when you spend 10 minutes looping around a mountain in search of anything useful, it's extremely aggravating. It comes across as "lazy design" instead of "hilarious easter egg"\n\nThere's too much useless text in conversation. Most are attempts at humor, but it falls short nearly every time. Most of the humor is like watching an awkward high school play. "Can I have your boat? Please? Why not?  Why can't you give it to me? Because? Because why?" It slows down the pace tremendously and makes the game cringey and boring. There are supposed to be "clues" in the dialogue, but because of how poorly-written it all is, they're nearly impossible to find if you aren't 100% invested in the game itself. Not everyone has their hearts bleeding for a game they've never played, so you can't expect too much from players outside your initial friend circle.\n\nOn the plus side, the world, style, and design are all very creative. I wish the game as a whole was more entertaining because I would've liked a world like that to explore.\n\nOverall, it's not terrible, but it's not very good at all either.\n\nSee my video of this game HERE.","January 2, 2015","false","1.1"," 126 of 166 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","126","166","8","0"

It's basically a long linear path along the coast of the island with vast spaces of nothing between easily missed key elements. Objects are thrown around with only a vague sense of hierarchy and never becoming greater than a sum of its parts. Exploring this wasteland becomes a very tedious task, which is reinforced by the fact that there are close to no camera controls. The third person camera never gives a good view of your surroundings on a path that is most of time wider than the edges of your screen.\n\nThe level design seems to confuse the concepts of 5th gen platformers with those old-school point-and-click adventure games and is the poorer for it.\n\nThe story path is very narrow, leaving all personality and charm to the NPC flavour text. You can tell an impressive amount of work went into writing this many lines, but it wasn't enough to breathe actual life into Catmouth Island. The style of humour also really wasn't for me.","March 14, 2015","false","5.2"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","0"

The. Camera. If it had a view from the back of the PC (or even a first-person view), it would be much more enjoyable. The author commented that it would impact performance, but maybe leave it to users to determine whether they mind it..? I mean, in ten years time, will it still have a performance impact? What about today's users with good machines? It's sad when a project built with love is also lacking in long-term sight.\nSeriously, unless some rendering tricks were used in the code (which really shouldn't be necessary), it would take at most an hour to add an optional camera view that would satisfy everyone (and, hint, change our recommendations on the entire game.)","August 9, 2015","false","2.5"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","1"

It's funny and charming and it effortlesly pulls off what many comedic adventure games try too hard to accomplish. It does some clever and some arguable tricks with controls and user interface, and to me personally it rather works than not. The game focuses mostly on exploration, finding the right objects and talking to people, while the use of inventory items is fully automatic, which made it interesting and easy to enjoy for me. I could go on about other details, like how it yet again shows that pleasant aesthetics trump polygon count, but they are just that, details.

Definitely recommended if the game acquires more episodes, which seems a possibility.","March 2, 2015","true","4.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

It's an abused demo.\n\nScale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=loved\n\nGame design: 2/5 Design-wise, everything looks great.  This game rocked those low count polygons.  Unfortunately the point and click interface is pretty combersome and the camera gets in the way a lot.  It doesn't help that the island is huge, and you pretty much have to talk to everyone before being able to know where to go to complete the quests.  It took me about 2 hours of needless exploring.  Pro tip: don't bother with the dozens of houses out on the water.  The interface makes it a very tedious game to play, but I don't know if that's a pro or a con considering that the game was obviously designed to be tedious.  This is not a point and click adventure.  There are no puzzles as advertised, there are only fetch quests.  Many of the fetch quests weren't even to obtain items but to get through certain character's speech scripts.  I'm am genuinely impressed with how so many characters can say the same thing again and again using different words.  This game should only take about 15 minutes to play except that it is so padded with fetch quests, and there is no motivation or reward to any of it.\n\nTone: 3/5 The game's atmosphere is it's most appealing factor.  You were probably sucked into it by the screen shots.  Everything is cute, energetic, and happy.  It's great.  The island, the characters, the music; it's all great, but it's all pointless.  Apparently the goal of the game is to see the top of a tall house.  Why?  The camera doesn't even let you get a hint of how tall this thing is supposed to be, and no motivation is given to go up the house other than the main character's random curiosity.  Only the very beginning and the very end of the game even mention the house, no one in town notices or is affected by it.  The island is full of ancient technology, violent sailing stories, and things that could be of real interest to the player, but no real development is given to them.  I imagine the overall story of future episodes will likely slowly revolve around the ancient mystery of the island, but for the first episode to have nothing to do with whatever the over arching story is going to be (I think it's pretty safe to say it has nothing to do with the overall story, because nothing actually happens in this game) it's just tedious.\n\nPersonal skew: 2/5 This series does have potential, but it suffers from some major structure issues.  I'd advise the devs to either come up with some actual game play, or just get on with a real story... preferrably both.  As it is, $5 is way too much for this demo of a game.","March 30, 2015","false","3.3"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

Graphics look simplistic but the game runs smoothly in 4K.\n\nUnfortunately two key problems make the game difficult to recommend.\n\nFirstly, the adventure guidance isn't very clear - this used to be fine back in the old days of adventure games where you couldn't just pull up a web page telling you where to go.   But now, being deliberately "abstract" and just hiding information from the player in an attempt to make the game more difficult is just annoying.\n\nSecondly, while you can zoom in and out, you can't change the camera angle.  Considering your first task is to climb a tall building, preventing the user from actually looking around for a tall building is just asinine.    What could have made quite a fun adventure game is sadly marred by technical and gameplay faults that could have been picked up within less than 10 minutes of gameplay testing.","May 22","false","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

No.\nIs it worth it at $0.24US? Yes.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, I tried to go into CI not expecting much but I couldn't help but hope.\n\nThe graphics while being low poly actually made a refreshing change. Not since Jak & Daxter have I been impressed at the depth of field in a game. Also interesting graphically are the puffs of smoke from the cursor and the way walls of entered buildings drop comically from the sky upon leaving.\n\nThere is a *lot* of walking in this game. While it does make the world seem actually big and possibly more realistic, it gets tedious very quickly. You are given a teleport option between sites but that takes little away from it. Coupled with the unusual camera angles that can only be rotated left and right and not up and down, it makes a short snacky game into a multiple visit affair. You can at least click on things far away and the pathfinding will take over for you, making treks down mountain paths a chance for a player break.\n\nAs a side note, I like how when you run for a long time, Mya gets out of breath.\n\nThe humour while not awful is mostly forgetable. It's like a family or PG movie in that there's quite a few adult humour bits that should fly over younglings heads. Plus, toilet humour (literally too)!\n\n[The store page said "There's occasional swearing and coarse language...Therefore it is not suitable for younger players" but I honestly can't remember anything that bad.]\n\nThe puzzle solving is a little odd. Most puzzles are solved for you if you have the correct item. So it's mostly just a bit of back-and-forth running about. Which does hurt you once you've forgotten where things are. There was one story puzzle that (AFAIK) involved trail-and-error.\n\nThere also seems to be a lot of things missing or at least alluded to. My guess is it's either teasers for the next episode but it could just be bad design.\n\nMy complaints:\nThe 2 mousebutton thing to see interactive objects is really annoying. Can't we have a keyboard shortcut?\nThere are no audio/volume controls.\nOnly one save slot available\nYou had to use the toilet twice to get the book?!?\nThe game is relatively short and there's a promise of sequels but I doubt any will exist anytime soon.\nThe ending took WAAAY too long that I missed the top of the house. I had to play a game on my phone to suffer thru it. I thought at the time it would have been perfect to play the credits over, so when the credits played straight afterwards, I was utterly disappointed.\n\nTo reiterate, if it gets down to 24c and you have the patience, pick this game up.

I find the low poly, cel shaded style graphics quite appealing, and it fits the game perfectly. Good use of music as well.\n\nIf there's one aspect pulling this game down, it's the camera, and the controls for it. You are able to zoom in and out, but only between two very different ranges. And while you could rotate the camera around Mya, the main character, there was no way to change the angle. These two things made the adventuring aspect of this game feel a bit cramped. It also would not have hurt being able to rotate the camera without the use of a keyboard, and going to the map should probably not have been the second step of zooming out.\n\nBut while the camera controls could have been a bit better, the game itself is well worth playing through. It's walking a fine line between hilariously strange and playfully serious; It doesn't take itself at all seriously, yet it doesn't try to shove jokes down your throat either. Instead you are led through surreal dialogues and strange choices of action as if they were completely normal. In many ways it makes me think of Suda51's "Flower, Sun and Rain" for the DS, but much more adventurous and fun!\n\nIf anything, I wish the game was longer. But as long as there will be sequel episodes, I will be playing them.

Platonically speaking, of course.\n\nI'm sure there's a story here someone, but the super creepy characters are way more interesting. Just met a hansome, muscular man with an astonishingly lovely chest who won't talk about his wife because his three kids are "home." Yeah, this is gonna be great :3\n\nOh and you can steal stuff too. Kleptomaniac's rejoice!\n\n(p.s.- yeah, the camera is a TAD on the garbage side, but once you figure out that you can use the arrow keys to move everything, it ain't that bad.)","January 8","true","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
