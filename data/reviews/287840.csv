(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","The perfect word that comes to mind with TY 4 is the same word for the Rocket Knight reboot: Bittersweet.\n\nIf you are a die-hard fan, you'll probably put up with this game's more glaring issues. This game is not bad; it's very derivative of the genre and mediocre as a result, which is sad because I am going to suggest some ideas that might have had better execution.\n\nAt the end of the day, people will ultimately forget TY 4 now that Krome has started remastering the first three games on Steam. Funding TY 1 - 3 is what the game will be remembered for what it did right.\n\nProof of claim: http://prntscr.com/8g2dog (In response to a post about an HD collection. TY 1 is now put through Early Access on Steam.)\n\nTY 4 Really Isn't the Next Sequel\nThis game was originally the Ty the Tasmanian Tiger (10th Anniv) on Windows 8's store and released in 2013. Why the devs decided to call this game the fourth game, I don't know. The cynic in me says hype and marketing.\n\nThey could've easily made this game a spin-off title. But that might confuse new people (and yet the plot and the title number 4 will confuse anyone who hasn't played the games). So, the only reason I can think of is because this game takes place after 3, thus it's called 4. (That or the GBA games.)\n\nLooks the Same, But Doesn't Feel the Same\nFirst off, I want to make this distinction: The art of Ty 4 is great, the animation is average. And I think a lot of the gameplay refinements are lacking because of the animation quality. Ty 4 keeps the aesthetics that fits the series.\n\nHowever, unlike say the spin-off 2D Rayman games, the animation is (or looks like) tweening (moving parts of a still image). This is why the animation looks stiff when you throw your boomerangs or when you swim your whole character moves up and down, not rotating. It makes the game feel stiff when the controls are decent. As a result, the game plays like something I'd find on a site like Newgrounds.\n\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about, compare Ty 4 to Rayman here: https://31.media.tumblr.com/3fd0792f9289cf903259dc5fa4e78cf5/tumblr_nk4ozy4YWs1tv9q1qo1_400.gif\n\nOf course UbiArt has a lot more production value behind them than Krome Studios nowadays. That is why the game was made in 2D. I'm not saying the game is bad because it's not pretty enough.\n\nMy point is that Ty 4 has competition that offers more visual fidelity, so if they want to grab people's attention they have to do something better, namely gameplay.\n\nA Dimension Lost, Nothing Gained\nWhich leads me to my biggest problem of the game, there's nothing innovative of its gameplay to warrant a 2D return. There are no unique 2D mechanics or gameplay elements added in to Ty's formula. You still play the same character with the same glide and throw abilities, just in another dimension.\n\nFor some fans, that's enough to buy the game; for newcomers, it'll feel like a shallow experience and this game shouldn't be your first exposure to the series.\n\nI don't want to keep mentioning Rayman, but I want to illustrate a point: When Rayman came back to 2D, they added in an ability he couldn't have in the 3D games, wall-running. Not only would that be a camera issue for 3D but it'd probably break the game as a result. In 2D, however, the mechanic was easily implented in the level-design.\n\nThis game needed to do something similar. Either new mechanics or make Ty fit a new genre to make his 2D re-debut familiar and interesting to fans, and something worth playing for new players. And what confuses me is that they didn't make this game into a Metroidvania title.\n\nTake, for example, the boomerang system. You are given three plot-specific boomerangs that are needed for the main-fetch quests (Fire, Ice and Shock). They are used to break down their opposite-elemental barrier or interact with an object, and even then they're more often for extra collectables.\n\nThe only time this mechanic ever becomes interesting is when you use the Blizzard Rang to freeze a log on a waterfall to make a platform. The game needed more creative uses for these plot-boomerangs, as well as the other ones, if they wanted to make them more enjoyable.\n\nBesides the given ones, there are also purchasable boomerangs (in-game purchases, not real) that give you some benefits. Some more useful than others, while others entirely useless.\n\nYou have four or five boomerangs for fighting. The Chaos Boomerang is my personal favorite as it explodes most annoying enemies and takes out multiple enemies with each throw. (It's also between Fire and Ice, which is easy to switch out.) Out of all of the bonus boomerangs, the Cryptic Boomerang is the only one you need to care about (if you want to 100% this game). It lets you find hidden platforms, which you cannot jump on without equiping them even if you know they are there.\n\nAll these boomerangs feel added in for flavoring, and you only need to buy them once. They're always in your inventory.\n\nBut imagine if the game had open-ended level-design on a 2D environment that required you to EARN those Boomerangs (like the Thundereggs in Ty 1) and then you needed to use those new boomerangs to unlock more with the rewards steadily getting better and more interesting. (Ex. Strider)\n\nOr what if those extra boomerangs were purchasable and you could choose which ones you wanted and it'd shape your experience every time you played, and they had not one or two uses but influenced the bosses you fought or created new types of platforms as a result (i.e. the frozen log)? (Ex. Mega Man or Shovel Knight)\n\nOr what if you had different playable characters (not skins for fans) that had unique abilities and the game required synergy between the team to get through tough obstacles or challenges, which could also be used to traverse the 2D open landscape? (Ex. Castlevania 3) [By the way, I liked all the skins they included; it's cool to have options, I just wished they added replayability.]\n\nAll of these ideas are off the top of my head, and any one of them could've made this game more memorable or worth the transition.\n\nA Platformer By Any Other Name\nI wasn't expecting anything genre-breaking or the second coming from this game, but I expected something to keep me going besides my nostalgia alone.\n\nThe game is a platformer without real punishment. You have infinite lives, you can take multiple hits, you get tons of spawn-points, and there's not even a score-system for superficial punishment. The only thing you lose is time, and the game likes to pad itself out in that regards.\n\nThe levels are always "Do Something" three times as separate areas with meaningless side-objectives and extra collectibles for only bragging rights. The collectibles do not unlock anything special, and they're not required unless it's the main objective.\n\nThe boss-fights are just there. First one had me stuck because I forgot about the power-attack, but the rest were more obvious. (That final room where you fight Cass is annoying because as the screen rotates you can't easily tell if you can stand where you are or if you'll just fall to the other side of the screen).\n\nI won't touch on the story because it makes no sense to someone who has played only the first game. (Why does Boss Cass hire Kangeroos if he wants to destroy all mammals?)\n\nNeeds More PolishTy's hitbox is unclear at times. (Especially on the whale)\nStiff movement\nIf the platform moves fast enough, Ty will slide off his own.\nWhen you pick stuff up, Ty can still be hit.\nEnemies go through the walls on land and sea, sometimes hidden in the background. (Like NES games.) Your attacks do not.\nSFX on Boomerangs and enemies can be ear-grating. (Same sound effect)\nCrickey, Ty gets more knockback than me!","September 20, 2015","false","5.1"," 172 of 215 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","172","215","8","14"

However it's a very fun and beautiful platformer with a good little story. The background music is awesome as always. The controls are solid, the movements are nice and smooth. It's only crashed once for me, and besides that, no there have been no bugs that I've seen.\n\nI've got about 12 hours on record, which is how long it took me to complete the overall story, then go back and get all collectables and achievements.\n\nThe art in this game is very nicely done. I love the art style. This is the reason I want to work with art in game design, because you can create endearing worlds and characters such as this.\n\nI would recommend playing it, even if you're not a huge Ty fan or haven't heard of him.

While keeping a very tongue in cheek nature, it's everything you might love about Australia. From crazy slang to key-taring Blue Tongue Lizards, Robot-Sharks and everything in between. It's not the 3d platformer you might recall but that doesn't stop it from being an absolute blast. Consider the transition Rayman made from 3d -> 2d, presentation and gameplay is close.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_nm14pwQ5Y\nScreen resolution scales up to 4k+ while the hand drawn graphics stay crisp. Both kb+mouse & gamepad controls were responsive and all keys remappable. Entire game is spread across several acts containing larger levels with multiple segments, complete each and continue onward or leave and spend gems. Gems can used to obtain new boomerangs or different costumes & characters. One playthrough won't be enough, levels contain many hidden areas to discover and the game provided alternate modes of play such as time-attack.\n\nBiggest downfall is the difficulty, little on the easier side and maybe aimed more at the younger generation. With it's uniquely Australian visuals and sound, decent amount of content and great price point, TY 4 gets an easy recommendation and a big thumbs up.\n\n@Devs\nIssues with 120hz panels that requires a fix.\nWill stall progress on some levels. eg, end of video.","September 17, 2015","true","4.2"," 49 of 64 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","49","64","2","7"

As a result, everyone looks back at those games with a nostalgic smile.  Many of those games are widely loved by nearly everyone.\n\nBut not by me.  I never played any of those.\n\nWhat I did have was Ty.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I've been the type of gamer who plays a small number of games a lot rather than a large number of games a little.  An early memory I have is being in the game store.  I could only get one game, but I held two in my hands.  Rayman, and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger.  Eventually, I got Ty.  No surprises there.\n\nI absolutely loved it.  It was one of my first games, and was my favorite game.  I even got my friends across the street into it.  I eventually beat it, though I have to admit, it was with the help of cheat codes.  I was little, give me a break!\n\nThen I got the second one.  Played it a ton, and loved it just as much.  I was too young to fully comprehend the way open world games work at the time, too, so I progressed through the game just by wandering around, doing whatever missions I stumbled into.  However, I never finished it.  After a while, I just got tired of it and stopped playing.  I moved on, played other games, different consoles, and all that kind of stuff.\n\nThen last summer I decided to boot it up again.  It was time to beat it.  Now that I actually understood the way open world games worked, I easily found the remaining missions.  How many were there, you ask?  Two.  TWO!  I had wandered around so much that I had only left 2 missions uncompleted!  I don't remember the mission's name, but then the final Boss Cass fight.  I wanted to make it a summer project, of sorts, to replay both Ty1 and Ty2 from start to finish during the summer, but unfortunately, it never happened.\n\nAs far as the third game goes, I unfortunately never owned it.  My friends did, though I barely played it.\n\nThen, I recently noticed this game on Steam.  I had all but forgotten about Ty, but man, did it awake nostalga, especially the video of Ty playing his theme.  How could I resist buying it, regardless of it being 2D instead of 3D?\n\n\n--End of Nostalga--\n\n--Begin Review--\n\nTo the game itself, it's great, but a bit short, in my opinion.  I beat it in about 5 hours, though I didn't do all of the side quests, get all the collectibles, etc...  though I did take care of most of them.\n\nThe Good:\n+Ty!\n+Great soundtrack\n+Great level design\n+Combat is fair, 95% of the time I take damage, I know its my fault.\n+Good assortment of boomerangs, all with their pros and cons.\n+All of the elements from the 3D games still work really well in 2D.\n\nThe Bad:\n-No voice acting.  I mean, yeah, I rememer most of the voices and can do that bit in my head, but it's not the same for obvious reasons.\n-With some 'rangs, the pros drastically outweigh the cons.  This makes some useless aside from utility.  Why would I use the flamerang, which can one shot enemies that normally take two, if I can use ones that freaking EXPLODE?  Though it still takes 2 hits, the splash damage is more than a worthy trade off.  I'd like to see uses in all of them, even the default.\n-Somewhat tedious to switch between 'rang types quickly.  This would likely not be a problem if we are able to arrange the order the 'rangs are in the menu manually to get a custom lineup rather than be stuck with the order we got them in.  The ability to switch to specific 'rangs with a custom keybind would be even better.\n\nThe Ugly:\n+-Underwater flamethrowers?  Really?  I can't decide if that's hilarious or downright stupid.  I honestly can't.\n+-Yeah, that's about it, really.  I just had to put that bit about underwater flamethrowers somewhere.\n\nConclusion:\nThough I listed numerous downsides, they are minor, and don't detract from the game very much.  All in all, I rate this 9/10!  That's really saying something, as I'm not much of one for 2D platformers.\n\nSo yeah, if you're a fan of Ty, or just really like 2D platformers, give this game a shot!\n\nIf Krome makes enough money on this to be able to port the first 3 games, you bet your FACE I'm buying all three!","September 21, 2015","true","11.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","0"

What makes this game amazing, is the name.  Krome managed to hang on to the rights and finally after many of us were begging for a 4th title we get the game.  Anyone who's played the first 3, don't be worried about the 2D sidescrolling.  It's different, but the game flows well (although linear) and the story continues!  This isn't a rehash reimagining, this is a direct 4th title.  Ony wish they had the original voice actors instead of plain text, but I'll take the text over new actors.\n\nAlso worth mentioning how Krome has actually brought their game to steam in the first place.  Consoles games have a tendancy--especially anything during the PS2/Gamecube/Xbox era to stay on consoles almost exclusivly--regardless of rights and licensing.  For Krome to actually bring their game to the PC platform is a huge step for previously console developers.  I hope to see more titles, from Krome and other developers, migrate away from their old dusty consoles and find life anew among the thousands of steam games.\n\nWell done Krome, hang in there!

Yes, the original three games back on the xbox and PS2 between 2002 and 2006! This was one of those games that was hidden somewhere in my childhood and was on the brink to be forgotten with time. Luckily though, Krome Studios were awrsome enough to make a 4th game and get it up on Steam!\n\nThe game is really sweet, albeit very short, and for a good reason. This was made in hopes that Krome can get funding big enough to help port the original three games to PC on Steam! If you would like to see them port the three masterpieces to PC and play them for yourself, you can help these guys by getting Ty 4, and perhaps even the artbook and soundtrack!\n\nNow on to the actual review of the game itself.\n\nThe gameplay is very smooth and swift. It's a 2D platformer with a hefty focus on adventuring, completing objectives and mini-games, beating others to the high-score. The original cast is back, with characters across all three games featured and all of them playable(as costumes Ty can wear). The movement and actions Ty does are all familiar moves from the original games and bring a sense of nostalgia to those who have experienced em'.\n\nThe graphics are well made and nice! The game runs at a perfect matched fps depending on your monitor, giving it a nice and buttery smooth experience. The controls complement this nicely as well. The art-style itself matches the way it was in the previous titles(most notably the first in the series).\n\nThe sound and music is top-notch. Throwing the boomerangs, hitting the enemies or objects, it all sounds great(although throwing a power-shot can be a bit anticlimactic :P). The music is very reminiscent of the very memorable banjo-plucking tunes you hear from the first game and it follows the same style over here.\n\nGameplay time avarage at about 4-5 hours, depending on how much you speed through the game at first or look for collectibles/farm for opals. The replay value revolves around getting all the collectible items and rangs, additionally the costumes if that fancies your taste!\n\nNow I'm gonna say this one more time. If you would like to experience the amazingness that is Ty 1-3 fully ported for the PC, support them by getting this game! Ty is one of the few mascots back in the PS2 era that still have the living licenses of today(compared to other titles).

Yeah, there are still plenty of concerns about whether this game will be good or not, or the ponderers who will criticize Krome for breaking the style of the game. Technically, they already did that with that Game Boy Advance port for Bush Rescue (Ty 2), which, while I never played [that version] myself, I know it was a 2D game.\n\nBut again, I understand the questions and concerns. Yes, all the characters—and more—are here, with a bit more to their personalites and such. They have evolved, such as how Dennis the Tree Frog is no longer just obsesed with those crazy Thunder Eggs; as now he's his passion for them has gotten him into the study of them and other things like it (I'm so embarrassed that I forget what the actual word is). It's like all the characters have aged well during those nine years, so it feels like a GREAT reunion. I'd personally say that that alone is well worth buying this game, and later finding out that you'll love it. Yeah, it's a WHOLE lot different; like, well, ANY game that's in a cartoony, super animated 2D style, and of course, it's got the signature Ty/Zelda/maybe even Mario style collectibles that require you to have a certain item to get to new areas in older levels, and that kind of gameplay in itself is one great reason for me to be in love with this series as much as I am (I'd have much more time on it if Borderlands 2 hadn't come up xD)\n\nAnd for the newer players who haven't played these games before, This IS a direct sequel to the previous game, Night of the Quinkan, and it seems to be intended for veteran players of the series. Straight from the get-go, you have lots of options before you even start the game. You'll have no Opals (currency), but you'd be able to buy 20+ costumes for Ty (from older games) and the option to purchase skins (play the game as other characters), and you can also take a look at some of the other kind of boomerangs you can buy when you acquire some Opals. However No spoilers here, I'm still wondering how a little something could be going on myself. It's just about six dollars USD, and I took that risk with Abyss Odyssey. I still haven't played that game either, but now that I have it, I am convinced I will like it.\n\nAnd that's the thing: It's the six dollars that get in the way of you seeing if you'll like this. That, or you can go to youtube and look up a gameplay video, but you get my point.\n\nI will always love this franchise, and if it'd help port the ealier games here, I'd pay for the for game for a few people personally. I love it THAT much.","October 9, 2015","true","16.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Like now! I say this because this game is amazing! It runs smoothly, and the cartoony graphics are fairly nice. Although it lacks in the fact it's a 2D platformer, instead of a 3D platformer, it's still amazing. There's also a lot of replayability from what I can tell, due to that some sections of the levels can only be accessed if you have a certain rang, and things like that. Also the sound track is amazing and brings back a lot of memories from the first three game's soundtrack. While that is all perfect, there are some things that can be improved, like the price of the rangs for example. You get the fire rang after the prolouge, and if you just stick to that for a couple missions, you'll have enough rupples for the rang that blows up (the doom rang i think? the one made by sly) sooo yeah. And the difficulty could be bumped up a little. But other than that, this game is amazing! And hopefully by purchasing it, we'll be able to let Krome know that there are still fans out there and they may make more, or like how others have been saying, port the original trilogy to PC.

Reminds me a lot of the good ol' days, when I played games like Crash Bandicoot and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger on my good old Xbox. I really wasn't expecting any new TY game anymore. Ever. I didn't even know the original creators (Krome Studio) still existed. The old three Ty games were 3D platformers, but this one has the graphics and gameplay style of games like Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends, where Rayman also got a make-over from his classic 3D platform gameplay. I have to say, I love the graphics and music in this game, it's very beautiful and everything runs smoothly on 60FPS. Also there's a lot of content in this game, that will keep you busy for a pretty long time. There's 40 levels, but these are all very big and well developed levels, which takes you about 10 minutes to complete for each level, if you just rush through them. Then there's also hidden collectibles you can find scattered through every level. And on top of that there's also minigames hidden in each level like Time Attack or "Kill as many enemies as quickly as possible". There's also a currency in the game (opals) which you can exchange for new boomerangs with special powers, or a dozen of skins/characters to play with. This game will surely keep you busy for a while, and I can say it's definitely worth that 5-6 euros! I would even pay 15 or 20 for it. Now, let's hope for the return of the first three games on Steam, especially my favorite, the second one. :)","September 18, 2015","true","0.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

But I think that the spark has been lit. Lets make it a bonfire...","September 24, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tayloralan/recommended/287840/","tayloralan","FORCE LIKE OBI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tayloralan/","67 products in account",""Ty the Tasmanian Tiger" was my first PS2 game back in the day. Playing this and hearing all the sound effects from back then was like a blast from the past. I was a bit worried about it being a side-scroller, but let me tell you it doesn't take anything away from the gameplay. This game is totally fun, and full of secrets that can be a little challenging to unlock. Below I will list a few Pros, and Cons that the game has.......P.S. Mostly Pros!\n\nPros- You can customize Ty's costumes, by collecting opals. And also customize which Rangs you can play, you can do this at the main menu after each area is complete. It's very cool, and makes it more your style!\n-The graphics are very nice looking.\n-Game runs flawlessly, devs did amazing!\n-Old fun characters are back in their elements!\n-Levels are very fun, and also challenging.\n\nCons: There's no voice acting, it would be nice.\n\nOverall the game is incredible for being on sale right now for $5.39, if you don't have this in your library you need to have it. Absolutely worth every penny.","September 22, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

TY has always been one of my favorite childhood games (being the first game I had on Xbox). Although the game takes the 2D perspective compared to the 3D design of the three previous games, that doesn't mean it isn't as fun. It is just as fun as the predecessors. Gameplay is fun and it's great to see all the original characters back but is kind of disappointing with the lack of voice actors. Still, a very fun game for those who have played the previous games and those new to the series. Hopefully, Krome Studios will make the HD Colleciton of the first 3 games that we have been waiting for.","September 18, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The TY series was a big part of my childhood and this just took a big dump all over it.\n\nFirst off, most of the art is nice. Some characters have some crazy pixelization going on. The animation, however, is uninspired and boring. Even Ty looks bored throughout the entire game.\n\nThe story serves no purpose other than to put you back in the same three stages repeatedly.\n\nThe costumes are neat.\n\nThe final boomerang you can purchase (the doomerang) is garbage as most enemies require one of the 4 special boomerangs the game automatically gives to you. Only the Chaosrang is worth buying so you don't have to use a charge attack all the time. Speaking of which, the charge attack drains some of your currency.\n\nThere are plenty of side quests and collectables. Unfortunately, both of those things award you with nothing.\n\nA large portion of the game takes place in water with sharks, crocodiles, and thrown rocks that come at you from off screen or inside the walls giving you no time to react.\n\nLike most games when falling, you can move right or left and change direction as you please. Unlike most games, you can not fall straight down.\n\nThere is no voice acting aside from Ty's girly voice when you revive.\n\nAnd then there's Dennis. Dennis acts so flamboyant that it makes me feel uncomfortable being gay.","February 27","false","3.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Ty the tazmanian tiger for the xbox was, and still is, my favorite video game of all time. So needless to say that I was very hyped for this game, that being said, I will try to leave as much nostalgia and bias out of this review as I can.  So for any Ty fan who is concerned that because this game is 2D it's "Not a Ty game"...don't worry, this game is still a Ty game, and chances are, if you liked the originals, you'll like Ty 4.  Ok so first off, the story. As much as I miss the voice actors and cutseens from the first games, the cool comic book style of cutseens work fine and I enjoyed them. I also enjoyed the characters and their personalities. As for the actuall story itself, it's not absolutely amazing, but I still thought it was enjoyable, something goes wrong somewhere and Ty has to come and help. I did however find the twists and turns about a few select characters, such as Sly and "I thought you were dead!" Fluffy where really cool. They were nice supprises. I did feel that the ending kinda came out of nowhere and the final boss was just a bit too easy, but it was still fun.  As for the gameplay, it works absolutely fine IMO. The controls felt solid and I had a blast with it, you never feel like your slow or slippery. and the platforming is fun because of that. My only SLIGHT nitpick is that gliding feels a bit nerfed from the other games and you lose altitude  at a much faster rate,and whenever Ty is in the air you are always moving forward,which made it to where I had to tap left and right a bunch to land where I wanted to, but again, it's really no big deal, and rarely ever gave me a problem. Now as for the soundtrack, Ty 1 has one of my favorite, if not my number one favorite soundtrack in any video game, and in general, I was happy with this games music, especially since compared to todays ost's for video games, this game has some seriously good tunes that should be listend to even when not playing it, I loved most of them, thought some where just alright, and only disliked one. The level design and the music always complement each other nicely, and each one felt just right for it's level. I ESPECIALLY loved the remixs from past games.  So to sum this review up, if your a fan of Ty, you should ABSOLUTLY buy this game, I can almost guarantee you will have an absolute bonzer of a time! And for those who are new to the series, I would seriously recomend you get this game, its a super fun 2d platformer collectothon, with some great characters,levels,and music, do yourself a favor and buy this little beauty of a game.  And who knows, we may even see a Ty 1-3 port or Ty5 in the future, which would be a dream come true for me, anywho hope you have a bonzer of a time with this awesome game!!","January 23","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

TY 1 and 2 are the only games that I could play because the third game wasn't released in Europe due to Kromes budget and resources. Then about 9 years later they released TY4 for Windows 8 (Win store). I was happy that they released a new TY game after all these years but I hate Windows 8 so I never played it until they released it on Steam. (They also made an ios game)\n\nOh boy oh boy was the wait worth it. I am very pleased and satisfied with this game.\nTY is originally a 3D game but the 2D works really well. Krome implemented the gameplay, rangs, attack etc. very well from a 3d style to 2d. It runs on a good solid 60fps, good refreshing style and graphics. Gameplay is fantastic and fun considering the prev games were 3d. This game will give you many hours of entertainment. If you are a TY fan you should already have bought it!! BUT if you are new then you will definitely fall in love with the series!! Trust me!\n\nI want to support the developers at Krome Studios. They are amazing at their jobs and deliver great games. I hope that this game does great so that their is a chance that the other 3 games (original trilogy) will be brought back to life for PC. I know that there are many TY fans out there, new or old, that want to relive those moments.","September 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will enjoy it. It's light-hearted, silly, anthropomorphic animal fun. That being said, I look forward to the day when Ty gets a proper, 3D sequel. As it is, this can barely be called a spin-off. There is no voice acting to speak of, which sucks given that the voice acting in the previous games is what really gave the games their personality, selling me on the Australian Outback theme. The animations almost make me feel like I'm playing Scribblenauts, what with each character being a puppet whose pieces animate mostly by rotating. There are skins to collect and different weapons to purchase. Jumping feels floaty, and the story feels very light, but there are a ton of collectables strewn about each level. That being said, the game isn't very challenging in terms of puzzles or platforming challenges, and if you get killed you will instantly respawn at your last Porta-potty.\n\nThat being said, in a world oversaturated with shooters and retro indie games, it was nice to see an old franchise pop up out of the blue.","September 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have fond memories of the first one (which is on steam in the form of early access) and of course once I saw that we had a 4th installment on steam I just had to pick it up. It is way to simplistic obviously geared towards younger players, the art is a little odd for certain characters who look nothing like they used to from the first game itself. I find that Ty does not translate well to a 2D platformer though in the end I do not regret my purchase as I hope the funds given can go towards putting the previous games on Steam as well as possibly funding the next full 3D installment.

While it does sound fun, it doesn't seem to work all that well. The features you have in Ty 4 aren't much to offer. You can glide, throw boomerangs, use different types of boomerangs, swim, and bite stuff. Pretty much it. It isn't as enjoyable to do all of these things on a 2D platformer either.\n\nThe gameplay feels pathetic. Nearly every enemy takes one or two hits to defeat, and it's just way too easy, and too BORING. Once you take out an enemy, you're NOT going to see it ever again. They don't respawn, so once you've cleared out everythiing, the whole maps are going to be a barren wasteland, filled with Ty's nasty urine across the ground saying "Ty was here." There's not much in it for you when you get defeated, because once you respawn, you're basically just teleporting back to a checkpoint, with nothing restarted. All it feels like is just you did everything, and when you die, you get your health refilled. Yeah, that's how it feels.\n\nThe game has different types of challenges that are sort of fun to do, as well as collectables scattered around the map. They are cool to try and find out where they are. You can also buy different costumes for Ty to try out. It is fun to play dress-up with Ty, no joke!\n\nThe artwork is nice, but the animation is bland. It doesn't feel like much love was put into their poses.\n\nI just couldn't last too long playing this game, though. Each level felt boring and repitive that I got so bored, hoping to play something else while I was playing Ty 4. It's not worth the buy. Just stay away, and find a better platformer to buy.

It's just... slow and clunky and awkward. As much as I wanted to enjoy it based off of my previous experience with the Ty series (I loved Ty 1), this is just an unpleasant platformer to play. The gliding ability is slow, the jumping can be imprecise because for whatever reason the game won't register my jumping onto certain platforms, lots of times I'd be catapulted by different enemy attacks into the arms of other waiting enemies, and Ty's attacks, which used to be really satisfying in previous games (like that wonderful bite, for instance) felt too easy to execute and degraded the gameplay into a drab 'move forward and spam attack' affair (when you weren't dealing with the slow platforming).\n\nThe music, voice acting and overall whimsicality of the world was what I most enjoyed about Ty. Because there is no voice acting or exploring an open hub world, this game just feels kind of... empty. Almost without personality.

That's literally all this game has going for it: it bleeds Australia from every orifice like it's some continent-specific hemmorhagic fever, and it's a much, much worse Blade Kitten mechanically, probably because it's a port of a Windows Phone game. The exact instant I gave up on the game was when something I assumed to be background (because I had used it as a platform already) blew up and killed me when I fell back down and touched it.

The game is so short, and if I wasnt lost on how to kill the crabs to beat a level (you have to use power attack to stun them, then attack them to finish them) I would have finished the game in 4 hours.\n\nThe game is pretty fun and nostalgic, however you are probably looking to get 3-5 hours on this game to beat the story. There are several bugs and quality of life changes that they could have made to make the experience better.\n\n1) When dashing under water, when you rise to the top you will dash in the direction that you are looking and you will be stopped for around 2 seconds and are unable to do anything.\n\n2) Not sure if this is intended or not, but you can spam your power attack in the air while moving to basically move in a horizontal line, this is different from the intended slow fall mechanic in the game.\n\n3) Clipping onto ledges and dropping down from platforms feels very clunky and could be improved upon.\n\n4) Most of the mobs are one-hit-one-kill, and I did not see a difficulty option. The game was way too easy to just run through and just spam your boomerangs just one shotting everything.\n\n5) The objectives to actually complete the level arent stated anywhere other than in the text at the beginning of the level, which most people skip anyways. If you press escape it shows you the bonus objectives that you can complete, but not the main objective that you must complete to go on to the next level. Going along with this, the quest objectives where you go and turn the generators on shows you the path that the game wishes for you to take, and it does not adjust if you have already gotten the generators. It will point you in the direction of a generator that you have already found. The arrows that appear over your head in this situation will point in the completely wrong direction and it is quite frustrating.\n\nI was wondering why they made this game a platformer, and after the countless hours of fun that I had playing it when I was younger on the ps2, I'm left to be disappointed by the lack of gameplay that there is in this game.\n\nI would say if you want to spend 6 dollars for around five hours of fun, then go ahead, but I wish that I had not.","September 27, 2015","false","5.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

If you aren't looking for a hard-as-balls (or even challenging) platformer because even I (terrible at platformers) had a fairly easy time with this game then you may like this game. If you're actually familiar with TY then the nostalgia may also be worth it. Besides that I can only really recommend this to younger gamers. For someone like me who has never even heard of the series this game neither has the plot nor the challenge required to keep me invested.\n\nOptions and controls: Fairly barebones menu, you have a couple basic options and the ability to change resolutions. There is no real way of adjusting the game quality besides a single button which lets you choose between the nicer looking default and a lower quality one for weak pcs but I honestly doubt that even most low end machines built anywhere in the last few years would need it. The game does offer full controller support and doesn't break like some other games do meaning that you can start off using the keyboard and mouse and switch to controller whenever you want unlike some games where if you accidentally click with the mouse and it registers you'd have to restart the entire game.\n\nGameplay: The game controls fairly well no matter what you use but this is one of the only platformers I'd recommend using the mouse and keyboard for because of 2 reasons. The first, less important one, is that using a controller doesn't offer any actual benefits because there's no sensitivity in the movement, the speed is the same whether it's a slight tilt of your joystick or if you have the joystick jammed all the way. The second being that the game is too damn easy on controller. Granted, even with the mouse and keyboard it's still pretty easy but at least you have to somewhat aim. With a controller the boomerangs are auto-aim meaning you just have to spam the crap out of the attack button for most of the game (with the exception of rare boss battles, immune enemies, and enemies that are too strong for early game boomerangs). Most enemies are very easy to kill and have a set aggro range where if you leave it they'll walk right back to where they were so you can kill most of them without ever having to take damage. The game is also very slow, there is no run or dash button (excluding a sonic flying dash-esque ability where you hit multiple targets to get somewhere) and the levels are straightforward making for little challenge. There's some very basic platforming for the most part on large maps with a lot of side paths but these paths are only really for collectibles which don't matter besides the eggs which are used to unlock the epilogue of the game. The rest is just for the purposes of 100% the game and are a bit tedious to get. As you have an unlimited amount of lives and the enemies that you've killed before dying remain dead there will rarely be times in the game where you have to put in much effort besides fetch-quests where the only challenge really comes from having to actually explore the map. Main quests that aren't the fetch type even have big yellow arrows telling you where to go.\n\nPlot: As someone who has not played this series before the plot seems very weak. As I am not familiar with the characters it's hard to feel anything towards any of them and the nature of the plot resembles a childrens cartoon in that it's very all over the place from section to section without much of a larger coherent plot going on (there is one but it has barely any impact and rarely even comes up). Again, if I had played the series as a kid I would have probably enjoyed this much more. A bit of voice acting for the major points may have helped people new to the series to know the personalities of the characters.\n\nAudio: The music is alright, kinda funky but the pacing of the music is strange. It's a bit too calm and relaxing for platforming and also sometimes speeds up for no reason for a single riff (whether or not you're in battle or just walking around). The sound effects are quite nice and would be much more satisfying if the game was more challenging and thus you'd hear some of the sounds (rewards, dying enemies, etc.) less.\n\nOverall impressions: An okay game for me. It's not amazing but it's not a bad game either, there just isn't a real challenge even with manual aiming. Not recommended if you are unfamiliar with the series or want a challenge. Possibly recommend if you grew up with the series and want a nostalgia trip (after all it's quite cheap) or have a young gamer in the family who would like a colourful and easy platformer. There was also a crash at one point in my 3 hours playing the game but it was minor and no real data was lost besides the weapon I had just purchased.\n\nThere will be a longer video review up by tomorrow hopefull at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9I_hGc1N7uT4a2G2mwja4g/about","September 18, 2015","false","6.0"," 6 of 25 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","6","25","0","2"

This game is amazing, while the original trilogy was 3D, this 2D platformer is incredibly fun and exciting and fresh to play as it isn't following the trend of the latest indie 2D platformers. The sound and music is superb, animation is a bit stiff, but it's not too bad. Unlike the 2nd and 3rd games in the series, the story is simple and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is really nice and enjoyable to see, however the writing is still fairly good. This game is well worth your money, especially because supporting this game supports Krome Studios, which in turn supports the first 3 games being ported to Steam and possibly modern day consoles! Keep it up Krome! It's great to see Ty again!","November 25, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But if you're a newcomer to the series the charming visuals and funky australian music will probably attract you. If not it's the rayman origins-esque style of platforming. If not those then I don't really know. The shiny opals maybe.\n\nOverall, for fans of the series (there's dozens of us, DOZENS!) and newcomers this is a great platforming experience that's sadly quite underrated (and that goes for the entire series too).","December 15, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Never had a chance to play the 3d trilogy, but I played TY2 on gameboy, so this brings back good memories for me.  The Soundtrack, animation, art and gameplay overall work tight together.  KROME studios have gone from top to bottom and back again and I think they've done a brilliant job.  If they can port both the original 3D trilogy and the 2D handheld ones then that would make me very happy but if they could get the rights to port the two legend of spyro games they worked on, I'd be through the roof.  If you're wondering about getting this then I would go for it.  Plenty to keep you going for a while.","December 6, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, if you only plan on running through the main game, from points a to  b, sure, it's pretty easy. But if you want to complete all the sidequests, it's quite challenging. And as there is no guide on here, so far, that is a bit of a tricky task.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty smooth. Controls are responsive. The game looks great, plays like a playstation 1 or 2 era platformer (as it should), and has a wonderful soundtrack. While it was short (I arrived at the final boss at what seemed to be out of the blue) the replay value is relatively high: there are plenty of sidequests and items to find, minigames, leaderboards, and an assortment of suits and rangs to buy, so really you can't go wrong with the price for this one.\n\nI found Ty to be a relaxing game--only as hard as you want it to be. I would definitely recommend it to fans of the series or fans of the old Spyro and Crash titles, but it may not deliever as much to the Steam crowd who likes extremely difficult games that turn old conventions on their head. Still, I had a great time. Big thumbs up.","December 12, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
