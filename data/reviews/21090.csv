Firefights explode in a shower of particles and dust quite unmatched in most other games. You will rend various levels apart with bullets as you play as The Point Man, a member of First Encounter Assault Recon, and each encounter will have a level of cinematic mayhem that time has yet to have dulled. The inclusion of a bullet time mode really makes this shine as the chaos unfolds in slow motion, as well as being a useful tool in the games later, more challenging levels.\n\nThe game's AI is fiercely on-point, something which evokes Half Life 1 most strongly of all. Enemy soldiers will communicate with one another and actively work together to seek you out, relaying your position over radio and reacting to your strategies in compelling and exciting ways. This is a game with better AI than most modern shooters.\n\nThe horror elements of F.E.A.R are a little on the nose - sudden flashing images of a corpse are not exactly ways that the game 'earns' its jumps - but for each cheap shot it takes in this regard it generally more than makes up with a tense, often surreal, atmosphere and a solid number of "gotcha!" moments that aren't cheap at all. Alma has become quite the icon in horror gaming, and she does her part in providing the occasional terrifying moment.\n\nWith rock solid shooting, wonderfully dramatic effects - including great ragdoll physics - and servicable story, it's hard not to recommend F.E.A.R. Its quality and attention to detail set a high benchmark for its sequels, and indeed all other action titles.","November 25, 2013","true","12.4"," 180 of 187 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","180","187","0","0"

Over the course of the game, the player becomes desensitized to it, having to repeatedly encounter zombies and monsters across the span of 7-10 hours.\n\nF.E.A.R. on the other hand is a game of build-up. It doesn’t start out especially scary, but as I kept playing it, it very gradually started to creep me out. I would hesitate to say that it outright scared me, because it takes a lot for a game to legitimately scare me. But as you creep around its desolate office complex, an unsettling feeling begins to seep in to your brain. It’s like being in a supermarket after hours - a place so obviously bustling with people and noise and life, now empty. You can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong and you really, really shouldn’t be here. Everything’s too quiet and you feel a little vulnerable.\n\nEventually the tension mounts and the creepy atmosphere pays off. The end of the game could’ve had a bigger finale with some sort of climactic boss encounter, but ultimately it doesn’t need one. The ending is unforgettable even without a big scary monster to kill - and maybe that’s for the best. I’d complain that F.E.A.R. ends on something of a cliffhanger, but all the best horror movies do, and so too does F.E.A.R.","October 25, 2014","true","11.7"," 183 of 191 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","183","191","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/21090/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon, is a first-person shooter (FPS) survival game developed by Monolith Productions (known for such games as Shadow of Mordor and the Condemned series) and published by Vivendi back in 2005. During its time, it was one of the most graphically and system intensive game overshadowed only by the release of Crysis (1) two years later. F.E.A.R. features a unique game play mechanic which makes use of what it calls the 'Reflex' ability or more popularly known to players as 'slow-mo'.  It also features advanced enemy AI, and a story that blends Japanese style horror with intense FPS action in a single gaming experience.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The F.E.A.R. Team was sent in to investigate and eliminate Paxton Fettel, a psychic military commander who, using an army of clone soldiers known as the Replica Army, started an uprising against Armacham Technology Corporation (Umbrella Group of Companies). The player takes on the role of 'Point Man' (whose real name was never revealed), a new member of the 'First Encounter Assault Recon' (F.E.A.R.) Team.\n\nPROS:+ Graphics that aged well\n+ Great Atmosphere (Lighting, Sound Effects, Particle Effects, Soundtracks and overall presentation)\n+ Game Mechanic (Reflex skill and varying melee attacks)\n+ Good overall voice acting\n+ Fairly expansive levels which maintain their linearity while at the same time allowing for exploration for...(See next PRO)\n+ Collectibles that enhances the player (Increase in health or reflex)\n+ Great gun play\n+ Advanced AI that knows how to employ basic tactics (Flanking, suppressing fire, grenade flushes, covering fire etc.)\n+ Great story with good lore, backstory and world building\n+ Good game time (around 7-9 hours depending on playstyle)\n\nCONS:- Physics (Physx), lights, and particle effects can sometimes be glitched\n- Multiplayer is no longer available\n- Combat may feel repetitive\n- Too much ammo, health and armor lying around. It is in my opinion that horror games should encourage caution which would add to the scare element of the game\n- No weapon mode switching: Most weapons are burst fire for some reason\n\nNEUTRAL:+/- The game features a 'one shot kill' mechanic if the enemy was unaware of your presence.  Personally I feel that this made the game easier than it should have been, but then again, other people might like the idea.\n+/- Intro cinematic is completely glitched with low resolution quality if the game resolution is set to, or higher than 1080p. (not game breaking since the only 'pre-rendered' cinematic is on the intro sequence.)\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. F.E.A.R. is a game that offers a great first-person experience that blends both horror and action in one perfect match. Overall, despite its age, F.E.A.R. is as fun as it was 10 years ago (2005).\n\nWORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price since its only $9.99 or your regional equivalent with the added bonus of the non-canon alternate universe expansion packs 'Extraction Point' and 'Perseus Mandate' which are also good games in their own right.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Halloween night.\n\nYou stretch and boot up the computer as\nyou yawn. Close to two months without\nyour girlfriend, Ms. Novocaine. But the\nthought of your classmate, a beautiful\ngothic girl by the name of Summer-Rain\nlingers in your mind's eye.\n\nSteam has now queued up a selection\nof Halloween-themed games one can\nplay, and a shooter from your past stares\nat you, a game called\n\nF.E.A.R.\n\nYou stare at it, remembering through\na dream haze of when you played it\nyears ago, in the heyday of 2005,\nwhen it was the horror equivalent of\nthe previous generation's Crysis.\n\nNostalgia and curiosity overtake your\nsense of reasoning, and you make the\npurhase of F.E.A.R. which includes its\ntwo expansion packs, the first being\nExtraction Point, which ramps up the\nHorror factor 21 out of a scale of 10\nand Perseus Mandate, a parallel\nadventure to the main story that stars\nthe equally-silent protagonist of the\nF.E.A.R. Sergeant as compared to the\nseries' main Point Man.\n\nTo your shock, you already own the\ngame(s), despite having no memory\nor recollection of ever buying it. You\nblink for a moment, before your the\nhairs on the back of your neck stand\non end. You download the entirety\nof F.E.A.R. and you expect it to\nfinish within an hour. F.E.A.R. is\nalready downloaded, the logical\nexplanation be damned.\n\nSuddenly, your phone rings. At 2am on\nHalloween night? You answer.\nStatic greets you before a familiar voice,\nsweet as honey, gives you a warning.\n\n"...she's watching you."\n\nYour eyes widen as the line goes dead.\nF.E.A.R. stares back at you, when you\nhear a soft giggle. Spinning round, you\nsee nothing, but the scent of Ms.\nNovocaine's sweet musk has overtaken\nyou.\n\nThe light in your room goes out on its\nown. You click 'Play.'\n\nImmediately, you now remember why\nF.E.A.R. takes the cake for one of the\nmost immersive shooters of not just\nthe early generation, but any\ngeneration. Although badly rendered\nand quite horrible-looking from a\ngraphical standpoint today, the\nimmersion, ambience and dynamic\nlighting of F.E.A.R. still holds up after\nall these years.\n\nThe audio is stellar. Guns sound like\nthey are discharged next to you and\nyou swear you smell the gunpowder\nand scraping metal. The enemies of\nthe game, Replica Soldiers, have\nsome of the most complex AI in any\ngame, adapting to your tactics and\ntrying to outflank and outgun you at\nevery turn. Tables are flipped\nand doors barricaded as you\nattempt to mow down their own\nranks with a mixture of gunplay\nand melee strikes, with F.E.A.R.\nbeing the only FPS you've seen\nutilize scissor and roundhouse\nkicks in its game engine.\n\nBut F.E.A.R. sets the mood early\nbefore the action with its pervasive\nHorror element, with jumpscares and\ntwitch imagery galore. The girl in the\nred dress, Alma, serves as some\nsort of overarching, supernatural\npresence throughout the game.\n\nThe story of F.E.A.R. is a strange\nbut refreshing mix of both western\naction and military movies along\nwith eastern-influenced horror.\nSome gaps in logic or pacing\naside, the game's story on its\nown is solid B-movie fare, but\nthe infusion of its clearly asian\nhorror roots bring a welcome\nnew element to the regular\nformula of grey and drab FPS\nin corridors and sewers.\n\nF.E.A.R. is constructed around 12\nlevels, but by Level 6, you feel tired\nand spent by the sheer amount of\nmental energy required to prepare you\nfor the scares and horror which have\nbecome taxing. With the gunplay and\naction having made you feel fulfilled,\nyou turn off the computer when you\nhear muffled whispering from outside\nyour window.\n\nYou peer through the blinds and see\na bloodied girl in a red dress staring\nback at you, Ms. Novocaine's eyes\nleak blood as she opens her mouth\nto speak. Everything goes black.\n\nAfter a time, you feel the warm\ntouch of someone ruffling your\nhair, the smell of strawberries\ntogether with a soft light which\nfeels reassuring.\n\nYour eyes open slightly and you\nrealize that it's dawn, November\n1st. You're in your room and\nthe sun's rays shine in from the\nopen window, while a girl in black\npetticoat and apple-green accents\ngreets your view. She looks lovely,\nand even lovelier is how your head\nis in her lap. Your eyes widen in\ndisbelief.\n\n"Hey. You're awake..." Summer-Rain\nsays, sliding her hand down your\nface and holding your cheek.\nYour eyes half-close in bliss as\nthe scent of strawberries\novertake you.\n\n"W-what happened...?" You ask,\nand Summer-Rain tells you that\nwhen you didn't turn up for the\nmorning class, she huffed to your\nhouse, broke in through the open\nwindow and found you on the floor,\nout cold, door ajar and sweating\nprofusely.\n\n"Didn't know you cared." You start,\nas she pouts and looks away,\nblushing fiercely while\nsnapping at you. "I couldn't\nleave you like that, even if I wanted\nto. I thought you might've died."\n\nYou smile and thank Summer-Rain,\nbefore apologizing to her for making\nher skip the morning class with her\nbeing here. You offer to buy her\nbreakfast but her hand stops you\nfrom leaving her lap, while her other\nhand still holds your head steady.\n\n"Summer...?" you begin, realizing\nthat she's looking down at you with\na pensive, serious expression.\nHer voice is hushed now, sweet as\nhoney. "Tell me something." She\nbegins, and you are instantly\nenraptured, enamoured with her\neven more.\n\n"...anything. What is it?"\n\nSummer-Rain glances at the doorway\nof your room to see the bloodied\nMs. Novocaine vanish out of sight,\nbefore looking back to you and\nsmiling her signature smile,\nreassuring you like no one ever has.\n\n"What do you fear?"","October 31, 2015","true","3.1"," 154 of 190 people (81%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","81","154","190","45","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/21090/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","F.E.A.R is a first person horror shooter that was released in late 2005 and is the first game in the F.E.A.R series. The game's story is set around a supernatural phenomenon, which a special forces team is brought in to deal with. You play the role of the team's pointman, you have super human reflexes yourself as well!\n\nThe gameplay in F.E.A.R while has no new and creative elements to the shooting genre, it is easily one of the most satisfying shooters I have played. All of the guns feel as if they are perfectly balanced, there is a good mixture of guns too; from the non-fictional type in pistols and sub-machine guns, right the way to the fictional weapons, such as laser beams. The way the game feels as you play it just ticks all the boxes.  The super human reflexes act as like a 'bullet-time', giving you the chance to setup a couple of head shots while also running back to cover; it is very useful at times in tricky situations.  There are also times when you actually can use melee to take down your enemies, normally melee in fps games causes you more problems than it's worth, but in F.E.A.R if done correctly, melee will instantly kill enemies.\n\nEven though this game was released little over ten years ago; you would never be able to tell from the graphics on show. You are able to play the game in full resolution, at a perfectly smooth 60 frames per second (most of the time...). It looks amazing; the lighting is again key in horror games and it is done very well here.\n\nEven though F.E.A.R is supposed to be a horror game; I unfortunately have to say that I was not scared at all when playing, and I am normally a bigger wimp than a little girl. There are very little if any at all jump scares; all the scenes which you expect to be scary are predictable so you loose the shock value from them.\n\nWe have a number of different difficulty levels that you can play on here; so you can choose how hard you want to play the game; I have played through twice now, the first on easy mode, and I didn't die once so I wouldn't recommend that if you are looking for a true experience/challenge.\n\nAll of the 12 levels in F.E.A.R are perfectly designed, all of them can end up being a maze if you don't concentrate on where you are going, and some of the latter levels actually have some tricky puzzles to work out. There are tons and tons of rooms to explore for ammo, medipacks, increased health pool and bullet-time packs, and new weapons. As well as the laptops which you can hack, and phone voice mail messages to listen to, so you can flesh out the plot even more.\n\nA full playthrough of F.E.A.R on a regular difficulty took me roughly thirteen hours to complete; I also spent a lot of time finding all of the power-ups, finding the extra story bits as well. After you play it through once though, other than playing again on a higher difficulty; there is no real need to playthrough again. The story is linear and will always end up being the same.\n\nI had a couple of technical issues while playing; the smallest would be the auto save feature. When you get to a check point in the level, the game will auto-save, this can sometimes take 3 or 4 seconds, while this doesn't sound like much, it really impedes on the gameplay - you get no warning that it's coming and it really knocks you out of the immersion.\nSecondly, is an issue which had my puzzled for a while; every so often my frame rate would tank to single figures, obviously I knew this wasn't right - so I was checking nothing could be causing any problems in the background and there was nothing running. After a little digging around online I found this article on the Steam forums that fixed the drops in frame rates - I would recommend anyone wanting to play the game implement this fix before they start. (I don't have a Logitek keyboard, and it still fixed the issue).\n\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1279444\n\nF.E.A.R is in my opinion, one of the best shooters out there and one that everyone needs to experience. I can safely say I enjoyed it from start to finish and will be looking forward to playing the extra  (DLC?) packs as well as the rest of the series.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only buy when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I completed the storyline (for the 10th, at least, time) and it's time for me to write a review.  To be honest, the only reason i started playing again, is that i am a nostalgic guy, and after so many years i wanted to play this game again. But now i think about it again, and i figure that this is the most irrelevant reason to play it  ;)\n\nStory(No Spoilers)\nThe protagonist is the "Point Man" (no real name) of F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon),a secret unit of the US Government, specializing in dealing with paranormal threats. The mission is to take down Paxton Fettel, and his clone army, known as Replica.\n\nGame Time\nIt takes about 8-10 hours to complete the campaign (depending on the difficulty)\n\nIn detail\nIf you get this game, it wont be about the kickass graphics or its realistic gameplay, If you expect something like that, i bet you will be disappointed. However the atmospheric gameplay, created by the well-designed maps and the awesome light-shade effects, the enemy AI, which is far more advanced than even some today's FPS and the great storyline totally compensate the game's drawbacks.\nAdditionally, the multiplayer was awesome and made me spend many hours playing. When i found out that MP doesnt' work anymore i got sad.\n\nPros\n+ Great graphics at the time of release\n+ Atmospheric gameplay created by the lighting and shade effects, with the addition of even greater sound effets\n+ Advanced enemy A.I. which can make the game challenging\n+ Interesting storyline and plot similar to an action-horror movie. The well created cutscenes add to that.\n+ Variety of weapons and grenades\n\nCons\n- No multiplayer ( T.T )\n- Some glitches may occur due to specific graphic combos.\n- Usually repititive\n\nConcluding, worth buying it since it's considered a classic!\n\n10.0 / 10.0\n\n1.

Everyone must play this game at least once because in my book, this game is one of the best games ever made.\n\nIts atmosphere is its greatest strength and the devs absolutely nailed it. The whole atmosphere of the buildings, offices, corridors, lighting, level design, enemies, and sounds perfectly creates a great feeling of DREAD, ISOLATION, and FEAR that keeps you on the edge and hooked to complete the game. Its atmosphere was way far ahead for its time and it still currently holds up as one of the greatest atmospheres in video game history along with Bioshock, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., and Layers of Fear.\n\nAnother huge plus about this game is the A.I. of all the enemies. They are one of the best programmed and intelligent enemies I have ever seen. The combination of the A.I. and bullet time manipulation is insanely bonkers which provides you some of the greatest gameplay experiences in gaming.\n\nThe execution of using sounds and music with the action and well-written story was perfectly well done which gave me a tremendous feeling of terror. I cannot figure out how the heck the devs managed to do this part so well. You need to play this game to fully understand that.\n\nOverall, the game is a must play and is my second favorite game of all time.\n\n9.8 out of 10","January 21","true","64.5"," 40 of 40 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","40","40","0","1"

When you think about it, there are no real horror like enemies in the game. No weird monsters or mutated freaks. Just Replica Soldiers. But god the atmosphere in this game, along with the audio can be so thick that you can cut it with a knife. The environments are dark and sometimes in states of complete ruin. The noises you hear are just terrifying, and ugh, don't get me started on the late game stuff.\n\nYou can sorta put this game into two parts.\n\nThe first is the action part. Where you're shooting enemies and trying to stay alive. Whilst it's mostly standard shooting stuff, you have a feature called Reflex, witch pretty much acts like bullet time from Max Payne. And like Max Payne, it helps to elevate this game, and even the odds against your enemies. Plus they actually give you a story reason for having it!\n\nThe second part is exploration. This is where the game gets scary. When the music and ambiance ramp up, and that little comm symbol in the corner displays a flickering "Unknown signal". You know that you're in for some freaky stuff. This is where the FEAR shines. I was legit hesitant to move on because of how much I was scared and worried about what was to happen. Even if I knew that I was in no danger.\n\nNow I mentioned that there are no "Monster" type enemies in the game, but that's kind of a lie. In certain segments, and parts near the end, you fight aparition like monsters. But like I said, they're kept for very specific parts and for a short while.\n\nIf the main game wasn't enough, however, it also comes with the two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for absolutely free, adding another 5 hours each to an already 8 hour game.\n\nExtraction point is a direct (But non canon) sequel to the first game, taking place where it left off. Due to events at the end of the first game, the area you were in has been devestated, and the supernatural anomolies which were mostly contained are running in full force.\n\nThis expansion I would almost say is even scarier than the main game, mostly for the fact that, like mentioned, the supernatural is now in full force. You'll be fighting some more creepier enemies, and going through a lot more scary ♥♥♥♥ than the main game. Along with the newly added weapons, this is the best out of the two expansions.\n\nThe main problem with the second, Perseus Mandate, is that it feel like more of the same. Non of the new weapons from Extraction point appear, and the only thing they add are a new enemy or two. It's still creepy, and still fun, but not as good as the other two parts. I'd suggest playing this one first if not for story reasons.\n\nBut overal, F.E.A.R is more than worth getting. The online feature doesn't work anymore but, it is still a great, and horrifying single player experience.","October 25, 2014","true","9.0"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","38","42","4","1"

You'd soon uncover that it was more than just a mission, it was a date with destiny.\n\nI loved the concept of the story, but in my opinion, fell short on the story-telling factor. There were times that felt like fillers just to make the game seem longer and some times where I was confused at who was who. Even with all that, the story is pretty solid for an FPS.\n\nThe visuals are a bit dated today, but they did a damn good job at that time. The game doesn't rely on jumpscares to freak people out, but the way they build up the tension e.g. flickering lights, suspense music, things moving on their own etc. basically things that'll make your hair stand on edge, and the game did it well.\n\nThe gameplay in F.E.A.R. is honestly one of the funnest experience I've had in First-Person Shooters. Think Half-Life meets Max Payne with awesome ragdoll physics. The Slow-Mo ability partnered with the shotgun can be OP at times, but I'm not complaining :D I also love that it has a health bar, collectibles to upgrade your health and reflexes, and medkits which you can use to heal yourself at will.\n\nOverall Experience: I love this game so much and is my favorite in the franchise. Plus, the ending is just awesome and will leave you wanting more. After beating the entire trilogy, I was kinda disappointed that the 3rd one took on a more generic approach. This game ironically managed to make me tolerate horror games, with the exception of Amnesia, Slender, Outlast and basically horror games that leave you defenseless T_T","February 16, 2014","true","6.2"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","32","34","0","3"

And its not just smart, but realistic too! the enemy will remain oblivious to your presence unless something gives your position away, like your flashlight, your gunfire, your footsteps, or one of the enemy soldiers alerting his comrades about your presence, and even after they see you they can lose track of you, shooting for a while to your last confirmed position and looking for you. The game also makes intelligent use of the enemy comm chatter, enemies will constantly report their situation to each other through radio, this helps the player know when there are enemies waiting to ambush nearby or when they lose track of the player or are about to toss a grenade. there are different types of enemies each with their own AI tough being perfectly honest enemy variety isnt one of the game strongest points, considering the good AI keeps the enemy encounters fresh and the game lasts just enough to avoid these encounters becoming stale, this is hardly a problem\n\nalso this is going to sound a bit weird, but despite the game being 8 years old by the time of writing, it still looks pretty damn good, is not crysis 3 or battlefield 4, but the game uses its visual effects in great ways to enhance the atmosphere, stuff like dinamic shadows and such, is rare to see a game that actually uses graphics technology to enhance the gameplay and not just look shiny. also the animations are just top notch, for both the player and enemies, shooting enemies is so much fun, in part due to the great gunplay, with weapons having some meaty feeling thanks to great sound and recoil, but also thanks to the huge array of animations enemy soldiers have, they react realistically to shots, will often fall to the ground and try very hardly to get back up on their feed, they will sometimes limp around after receiving too much damage and when they die they will sometimes keep the trigger pressed, spraying the room with stray bullets. the player movements are faithfully replicated by the main character, climbing, kicking, puching and firing have a very heavy and realistic feeling\n\nthe gunplay as i mentioned is great, guns have some good recoil and damage, they are also very varied, the game has a lean mechanic which is crucial to survive agaisnt the great enemy AI, the game also thankfully makes no use of stupid regenerative health, instead you have to look out for health pickups and health upgrades, as well as "reflex" upgrades across the levels, your "reflex" is used to enter an amazing slow mo mode that allows you to easily and stylishly take out challenging foes, the fantastic ragdolls of this game just make taking out foes even more satisfying, even the melee feels great!\n\nanother high note is the games atmosphere, using horror elements to set a believable spooky atmosphere, is not a survival horror game by any means, but you will easily be fooled during its most unnerving parts\n\nthe game has few but very noticeable flaws, the main one is that the environments are very samey and close quarters, its very easy to lose track and end up going in circles, is not that the levels are complex, they simply all look the same, also the same close quarters setup make firefights somewhat predictable, tough the game does make some efforts to provide engagements in more open areas, these are however the exception rather than the rule. Also while the atmosphere was great, i found the story to be merely ok, competent but nothing special with very few memorable characters\n\nit took me 8-9 hours to complete the game, a very respectable amount","December 22, 2013","true","9.1"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","3"

For I had not yet joined the darkside.\n\nSo being such a highly regarded game I felt I needed to go back and get familiar about this era for PC shooters. I was not disappointed.\n\nIn this game you play as a grizzled special ops agent dubbed point-man and little is known about your character up front. All that is known is that he can slow down time however its explained pretty early on that this is because he has extremely good reflexes. Being the pointman of First Encounter Assault Recon or F.E.A.R. you are tasked with investigating a company for questionable practices and finding and extracting a few people.\n\nThis is a horror game and it definitely has its moments. Not entirely relying on jump scares but atmospheric tension as well.\n\nThe game actually ages rather well if I do say so myself. Given a few grievances and lack of basic modern conveniences its still very playable. Health packs are still a thing and no iron sights. However this is replaced by storming into a room turning on reflex mode and mowing the entire room down with a shotgun.\n\nThe story is also pretty interesting. I knew some things going in but the story is still engaging enough to see it through for additional exposition.\n\nAll in all, I'm really glad I went back and played through something deemed “classic” and it held up over 10 years later. If you've not played this I HIGHLY recommend you go back and do so.

Especially now when comparing the rig I had back in the day, and this now where the game is going smooth at locked 60 fps, and being played how its creators have envisioned.\n\nBesides, other memories are tied to majority of my friends, who were like "Dude, this sick s**t... I'm not even... I mean what the... This little girl, and.. dark and... I just couldn't. Start>>>uninstall after 10 mins in..." I don't know but, personally, I didn't find it THAT scary. Maybe I'm weird, or maybe I had Doom3 in the year before, where it trained me well with its cheap-as* tricks with monsters spawning behind your backs,  who knows.\n\nSo, yeah, the game is called F.E.A.R. Nice play of words which also stands for First Encounter Assault and Recon, special unit made for investigating and battling paranormal activities. You were just transferred into it, nameless protagonist referred simply as "Point Man", a dude whos inhuman reflexes earned him his place there, which are presented in-game as a slo-mo, or bullet time. Previously seen in Max Payne games, but found a great place in a FPS game as well.\n\nWith the help of unknown forces, Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander (also a canibal who enjoys human flesh...) escapes from his confinement, and has a command over a whole battalion of telepathically controlled military clones. Its up to you to stop him, and investigate the ties with the Armacham Corporation, and the little girl known as Alma (who's ghostly presence is here for scary moments), while collecting the pieces of the puzzle by advancing through the chapters and listening to the voice messages or hacking computers.\n\nMajority of the game you'll spend battling Fettel's Replica Forces, or occasional Armacham security personel, which doesn't make much of a difference, except for the different models used. Of course, its not some scary experience unless you are playing alone (the lesson which FEAR3 maybe didn't learn), so you won't see any use of your FEAR colleagues, or DELTA Force companions. You may arrive with some of them at the scene, but soon you'll venture alone to pull some switch, just to find them lying in pieces in the lake of blood after getting back...\n\nAction in this game is just stellar. Awesome sound design, fires and explosions are looking amazing, particles and sparcles bursting around when highly destructable terrain comes under fire, holes leaving on concrete surfaces (this game is just rich with those) bursting in dust coulds when fired upon, grenades shaking ground and causing nearby light sources to blink, or enemies to lose the balance (if not killed by those),... There's a variety of weapons and grenade types, but my personal favorite is the SMG. Effects and sounds this weapon is producing are so sweet, its such a shame that I have to stop shooting sometimes to reload it. Out of ammo already? But I don't want to use anything else... Oh well, whatever works, I guess.\n\nAI is still better than what 99% of other games can muster. Enemies are even reacting to your flashlight, and as soon as they spot you their first reaction is diving into closest cover available. Heck, if there's no cover at all they'll make it by turning the furniture, or try to block your way with those. If you flank them they'll try to minimize the effect of it by running backwards to the next available cover while still shooting at you. In fact, Replicas are even more scary than Alma's freaks (which you'll face occasionaly every 30 mins of hard boilled action). Nothing causes a jump scare like stumbling upon them around the corner, or surprisingly after opening some door. Is he going to shotgun my face? M I going to eat his foot or his grenade? Fighting 3 of them without using slo-mo grants you quick death, even with full body armor and health (moderate difficulty level). Slo-mo serves like a cheat mode which gives you the edge over them. How much AI is smart you can see by activating the slo-mo, they immediately figure out that they are screwed over while yelling "Oh shieeeee...", or "Oh fuuuuu..."...\n\nThey love throwing grenades so much. Camp in the cover for too long and you can be sure you'll eat it. He is falling down, but ba*tard still managed to throw one down to your nose with his last breath. Boom, back to checkpoint. God help you if you forgot to quicksave since checkpoints are so far away, nothing kills your mood to play further like these things. But AI isn't perfect by any means. You can clearly hear your footseps since you are threading like an elephant, but they can't, so you can just walk to them and melee if you see their backs. Sometimes they are killed by their own grenade for hitting accidentally a part of some fence (physics in this game goes so far that even rocket launcher projectiles are colliding mid air, including with bullets). At least they can taste their own medicine sometimes, and so can you when your own grenade explodes in your face for being shot mid air with gun fire.\n\nTheir reaction to your shots is very realistic, followed by sounds of every bullet hitting their body armor. But while they are "dancing" under fire they'll still try hard to hit you or shoot you, depending on your stance. You'll also have issues with aiming yourself when being shot at. Pretty much everything you can do to them they can do to you. Melee attacks in this game are very deadly, especially your own jump kick which will one hit every regular unit. There's also a special type of cloacked clone combating without any weaponry.\n\nGraphics are very detailed even by today's standards, special reward goes to the shadows and their relationship with light sources. They are often overused, hiding low textures here and there. Shadows are so deep you have a feeling that shooting will leave holes in them. There's no much of variety in level design, very linear game full of offices and concrete surfaces. Still, there are some hidden spots, and snooping around pays off for finding reflex and health boosters, while backtracking is mostly minimized. You can see your whole body including legs, and when using variety of melee attacks, while sounds which your equipment is producing while moving/fighting are giving a better feel of weight to the whole thing.\n\nThere's not much to say about multiplayer since its servers were shut down long ago, while music is almost non-existent and plays occasionaly during larger fights, or longer nightmares caused by Alma.\n\nFor some reason, I don't seem to be able to review expansion packs separately, so I have to use external links to those.\n\nExtraction Point review: http://pastebin.com/7u4a7FXP\n\nPerseus Mandate review: http://pastebin.com/7FxpVkd4","March 19, 2015","true","8.1"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","2"

It was my friend, who iintroduced me to this classic. He bought it as a bundle with his new PS3. He said the reason he picked it up was beecause the cover looks cool, and it looks like "some fun action FPS game where he can turn his brain off and relax". until that is he played it and some quite creepy stuffs happening at first 30 minutes, looked back to the box art and realized there is a ghostly figure on top. and be like "Well, damn, I guess I'm going to invite my friends, we're in for a thriling ride".\n\nAnd well, there I was, with 3 others, playing this game regularly on weekend, and I must say it was one of the most memorable and "fun" game I've ever played, all the screams, pauses, controller-dropping, and "taking-a-fresh-air" moments definitely leave a mark.\n\nNow, 9 years later, revisiting the game. I'm surprised that F.E.A.R still managed to surprise me, not just with the horror part, but also the fact that it aged really well. It is still one of the scariest game ever, and the tightest, most solid shooting mechanic. And uh.. I'm out of introductory words, and it becomes quite lengthly at this point, so let's jump in.\n\nStory (9/10)\n\nThe story follows F.E.A.R, a special force, countering supernatural activity. In this operation, you are the Point Man, tasked to neutralize a psychic commander and his army who is gone rogue. Well, that's it. That's the  main plot throughout the entire game, and it remained it focus until the end. It's as simple as other action FPS, it doesn't try to be all grandiose, dramtic, and stuff, and that makes FEAR have a tight grip on it's story, focused, and well paced, carefully building up tension so it can reach a maximum impact at the end/\n\nGameplay (9.5/10)\n\nA perfect blend between psychological horror, heavily influenced by Japanese horrors (or eastern horror in general). relying on disturbing imaginery and constant feel of uneasiness, and a really satisfying and tight shooting mechanic / action sequence, that combined with a REALLY intellegent A.I which will make combat feels more intense, tactical, and "epic" battles. The guns is your standard old school FPS arsenal: One type of handgun, shotgun, rifle  SMG, and some unique weapons. I particularly like The Penetrator, because reasons. Oh, and how can we forget SloMow / Reflex? One word. Badass. It's not just a gimmick. it's an esssential feature, the fast paced action sequence, mixed with numbers of enemies and level design that put you on disadvantage at later stages, you'll find yourself  on situations where you just have to go out of your cover and bicycle kick those fellas and blast the other ones' head with a shotgun afterward,\n\nSound (9/10)\n\nGreat voice acting, awesome soundtrack, and overall great sound design. Now, why I rate it so high despite my very minimal explanation? Because it's all comes down to this..\n\nGraphic (9.5/10)\n\nIf you feel like I left out many things on previous aspects, you are right, I do. Because everything comes down to this. Graphic, or more precisely atmosphere, this is what ties all aspects of FEAR together, the thing that makes it regarded as a classic. The atmosphere on FEAR is pitch perfect. Story, gameplay, sound, level design, all of it is build around atmosphere. And until this day, it's atmosphere is the one that makes it holds up even after 11 years. I will break down several aspect of it:\n- ]Visual: The lighting was (and is) fantastic, great contrast between light and dark. The lighting alone is pretty unsettling, and with it's attenttion of detail and well thought out level design make even a well lit and neat offices doesn't  feel less disturbing than it's more messed up counterpart. And then we have the hallucination, which is simply mind♥♥♥♥ery and downright mental. Also, F.E.A.R might have what I like to call "Half Life-tier level transition", it's varied, smooth, and feelss natural. It also has a very nice stylized gore and slow-mo effects, it makes shooting someone with a shotgun in the head more satisfying (especially with the guns recoil, and sounds, make the weapons deliver a real punch when it hits)\n\n- Sound: Cracking walls, child's laugher, rattling metal, and any sound effeccts that will plays out in the right place and time, that makes you question your sanity. Oh, can you guess how many times I got a mini heart attack when I accidentally kicking a soda can? It's 4. I counted.\n\n- Story: As you progress through, you'll find voice mails and intels scattered around ATC, and this is why I score the story highly. It's immersive, they told you only what you need to know at the moment, progressively revealing darker and more disturbing side of the story, as you moved to  the core of Armacham.\n\nOverall (9.5/10)\n\nFEAR and it's classic status is well deserved. A game that so ahead at it's time. A horror game that will send chill down your spine, that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares (I don't say there are none, it has it's moment of course, even that is quite clever), an action FPS game that make your adrenaline rushing, and a tactical game that actually demand you to think and plan before you drop your first bullet. A seemingly linear game by design, but it actually encourage some exploration to get some boosters (HP and reflex) and tactical advantage over enemies. Overall a timeless classic that even it's sequel fails to emulate.\n\nShort DLC Review:\n\nExtraction Point (8/10):\n- Story: "I know, it doesn't make sense. Not much does anymore." - Paxton Fettel.\n- Gameplay: Same, fun gunfight, more gory, and more mental hallucination, especially the fifth interval, oh God the fifth interval. The new weapons are cool. Less explorable maps, and mostly a rearranged version of the first half maps of the base game.\n\nPerseus Mandate  (6.5/10)\nUninspired. Could've been a really interesting side story, if it wasn't for the bland writing Why do it feels like I'm going through the last few intervals of the base game and the first few areas of Extraction Point again?","May 2","true","12.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It was released on October 18, 2005.\n\nF.E.A.R. puts you in the shoes of "The Point man", a secret special ops group of the U.S. government specialized in dealing with paranormal threats, When the game begins, the player witnesses a man named Paxton Fettel taking command of a battalion of telepathically controlled clone supersoldiers, seizing control of Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, and killing all its occupants. A strong atmospheric shooter, FEAR does so many things right, but fails in some categories drastically. While the shooting is top notch, dynamic lighting and a solid soundtrack makes this an enjoyable shooter, the lack of enemy variety and repetitive nature of the leves might turn off some players. You are equiped with a fairly diverse arsenal from the basic pistol to more advanced weapons like the Type-7 Particle weapon and many other. The bullet time is superb, the amount of enviromental destruction is here aswel, as particles and walls shatter after you shoot them. It's a briliant showcase of how a shooting something should behave. Not many games offer this level of detailt, to be honest, and this one is quite old. The story is quite nice, a bit generic with the whole *experiment gone wrong theme* and some of the plot elements are delivered via phone calls or debriefed during loadtimes. Nothing too over the top, it gets the job done and keeps the player interested. Overall this game has much to offer, and falls into the category of "old-school PC shooting games", reminescent of the goldern era of shooters (1994-2004) with health pick-ups, no cover system, just plain balls to the walls action. Lastly, I'd like to talk about the AI, which has received much praise, and it deserves it. Your enemies use tactics and commands to adapt to certain situations you put them into, responding adequately, making them feel more human than just lines of code. When you shoot them, they react in a realistic manner, thanks to some great physics in the game, overall they perform well enough.\n\nI'll list specifically what I loved about the game and disliked about it\n\nThe good:\nSolid gunplay\nGreat amosphere\nGood sound/music design\nChallenging enemy AI\nDestructive enviroments, awesome lighting effects, cool death animations\nSense of dread and solitude throughout the campaign\nExploration is rewardedThe bad:\nRepetitive level design\nLack of enemy variety\nStory is delivered poorly and not developed enough\nShort lenght for the campaign\nToo many health pick-ups and ammo, not too challenging\nDead multiplayer\n\nThis is a 7/10 for me, short of a 9 because of the level design being so primitive at times.

This game will make you jump out of your chair, and always when you least expect it.\n\nYou play as the Point Man of the First Encounter Assault Recon, a secret United States organization that investigates and deals with paranormal phenomena. You get called into action after you are informed that Paxton Vettel, a Psychic Commander has seized the headquarters of Armachan Technologies and killed everyone there. His reasons are unknown at first, and it's up to you to discover why. He controls an army of clones, and you have to fight and investigate your way through the mess that was created.\n\nThe story is more than meets the eye. It is not predictable, and it is told to you in subtle ways. You have to explore your surroundings, listen to voice recordings and pay attention to certain laptops to find out what is going on and the reasons behind the disturbing events. The way the story is told is brilliant, because each player will fill in certain gaps in any way they want, and experience the game in a very personal way. The overall story line however, is well crafted and some points in the plot are completely unpredictable.\n\nF.E.A.R. is a horror experience like no other. The mood is everything in this game, and the way the lighting, sound, hallucinations and Alma (more on her later) combine to the feeling of isolation and fear, it's almost certain this game will make the hair in the back of your neck stand up, you will never take a hallway, a room or even an open setting for granted. You will never feel safe in this game, both from enemies and from hallucinations, it will creep you out. It takes elements of Japanese horror, where the mood, sound and shadows create the bulk of the atmosphere, and in this type of game, less is certainly more.\n\nAlma is part of why this game will scare you at times. It is hard to imagine that the apparition of a little girl can be scary, but in this case it is extremely effective. Every single time Alma shows herself, in badly lit areas combined with the game's excellent sound effects, it WILL leave you breathless. These moments are tense and completely unexpected. Forget everything you know about creepy games. F.E.A.R. rewrites what a creepy game is all about. The best way to see why Alma is a character that is often quoted as one of the creepiest ones in gaming, is to play this game and see for yourself.\n\nThe game's visuals are still quite good, despite this being a game with quite a few years. The textures and lighting effects are well done, and feel realistic. The most impressive aspect about the visuals are the particle effects, which really come alive in slow motion. The game offers you the option to engage firefights in a slow motion type of way, called Reflex Booster in the game, allowing you to slow down time and make easy some complicated situations. It is usefull against several enemies who attack you at once, and you will need this gameplay aspect, the AI in this game is probably the most intelligent I have ever faced in a video game. Enemies will call for backup, try to pin you down with supressive fire while another one flanks you, use the environment to create cover and even ignore orders not to get in harm's way. They are really challenging, and it's a big part of why this game as aged so well, nothing comes close on modern first person shooters. There is a good variety of weapons as well, some of them extremely rewarding to use. The one thing all have in common, is that no weapon feels too weak, they all have their use even later in the game. Finding out which ones to take with you is part of the experience, as the game limits the amount you can carry, 3 is the maximum. Firefights can be brutal. Depending on which weapon you use, you will see body parts flying and blood spilling quite a lot, it is not for the faint of heart.\n\nF.E.AR. is a must buy. It manages to be an amazing horror/creepy game and a superb first person shooter with a very good story. It will scare you and make you feel helpless at times, but it is an experience you will never forget.\n\nThe Good\n\n-Creepy Atmosphere\n-Amazing story\n-Visuals, Sound and Particle system\n-Alma is the creepiest little girl ever put into video games\n-Enemy AI is brilliant\n-Good selection of weapons\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Game might feel a little short to some, takes about 13 hours to finish without rushing\n-Could have used a little more variety in the environments\n\n9.5/10","August 24, 2014","true","13.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

One of the key elements that make Fear so unique is purely the gameplay segments, for it's time monolith did something that was truly impressive and admiring. The plot is very interesting & in a way pretty rational, mystery elements are strong and they definitely differ from the rest of the fps horror titles.Fear draws it's inspiration from the hot action packed Chinese movie "Hard Boiled" and Japanese horror style themes and environments. The action sequences between the player and enemies are dynamic, fun and challenging. There are so many different approaches that a player can take judging from the situation he is currently in. Replayability value is also there, adding to the overall quality of the product.\n\nConclusion: Fear is ultimately one of the best horror-actionpack-adventure games ever made. This masterpiece comes once in a ten to fifteen years, easily. And it's one of the most well made horror titles that deliver different experience. It has some flaws but Fear's nature and design are so complelling that you'll surely bypass all the negative pieces of the game.

I loved it.\n\nIt's a First Person Shooter with some horror elements, it mixes the 'bullet-time' features of the Max Payne franchise, with some dark, twisted horror images from Fatal Frame. The story is pretty straight-forward (much like the corridors you'll spend most of your time walking through), but does it's best to be mysterious as it dripfeeds news and information to you via laptops and answering machine messages left behind.\nIn truth the story isn't really the hook for the game, or at least it wasn't for me. I was drawn in by the bullet-time mechanic where you can slow down time and rip carnage into the enemies who try to stop you as you hunt down Paxton Fettel. There was some strangely satisfying about turning a corner in slow-motion, and blasting your cannon like shotgun into the soldiers and heavily armed troops. The red mist of blood, and the giblets of limbs and organs spraying, slowly and awkwardly across the room. I'm not crazy or anything, but the visuals and warped audio mix just gave the feature 'something', something extra to Max Payne which is perhaps best known for it's bullet-time.\nBesides, I'm a total sucker for insane ragdoll physic deaths... you know what; I'm not doing a good job of painting myself as a mentally sane, upstanding member of society here, am I.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288504762\n\nMoving on.\n\nVisually the game has held up since it's release in 2005, even if I did mistakenly start playing without checking the graphic settings (which were all on LOW to begin with). So do yourself a favour and ramp all the settings up to maximum if your rig can handle it. If not, don't worry it'll still look decent for a 10 year old game.\nThe only real issue I had was with the audio, which seemed strangely unbalanced and left you feeling like your guy had the loudest footsteps in the world. However, in saying that (and I'm no expert) the guns made a great noise, and the bullet cases/shells hitting the floor was pretty satisfying too.\n\nIn short, F.E.A.R was a fun, FPS game with a few jump scares based around it's 2000 era horror drawn inspiration. A very linear game made memorable be a few setplays, shotguns and bullet-time. Don't wait a decade to play this game like I did.","July 22, 2014","true","11.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Thought Process","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980884019/","354 products in account","While Half-Life back in 1998 hypnotized the stagnated first-person-shooter genre with groundbreaking narrative, enhanced puzzle elements, immersed atmosphere within cinematic settings and intelligent artificial intelligence, F.E.A.R. expertly continued to elevate the modern shooter in 2005, primary from an outstanding cinematic standpoint. Although essentially recapturing the spirit of creative Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, the sci-fi classic The Matrix and terrifying The Ring remake, developer Monolith ambitiously established an intriguing original concept as well as an iconic figure no matter the various influences.\n\nThe first-rate atmosphere became apparent immediately as the newest member (that would be you) of the First Encounter Assault Recon is set to carry out a classified objective within a military task force that deals with paranormal circumstances. Apparently, a mad military commander has become a liability after taking command of a secret army of cloned soldiers that are telepathically linked to him, causing mayhem within a restricted area in an unspoken American city in order to acquire something unknown. The F.E.A.R. team along with a Delta Force unit obviously issue a respond to this threat. Strengthened by frequent voice mails and radio news reports, the twisted story of the commander and the mysterious appearance of Alma unfold engaging and dramatic.\n\nA hectic blend of dynamic action and suspenseful horror was presented. Distinguished gun battles were downright spectacular to witness, creating stunning particle effects that in combination with the finest bursts of exciting slow-motion provided dramatically beautiful and wickedly entertaining action sequences in remarkably bloody repercussions. The lighting and shadowing model kept high class in bringing the mood, and so did the excellent music and solid voice-over. The movement patterns and animations of the enemies were well-made, but were obviously not as talked-about as their strikingly sharp artificial intelligence. Encountering these aggressive and tactically oriented opponents was challenging and incredibly unpredictable; they took advantage of the game’s physics system by knocking over objects to create cover, they fiercely reacted to your presence and actively communicated with one another. The weapons at your disposal, though only capable of carrying three at a time, were versatile, relatively equally efficient (if approached correctly) and actually dangerous, providing powerful punches to both enemies and surroundings, meaning they were implemented for a reason since you were as vulnerable as the enemy.\n\nAlthough the spiritual follow-up of Half-Life came out strong on so many levels, F.E.A.R. clearly fell short on some of them. The mention of repetitive environments that basically consisted of an industrial area and an office complex could not be ignored; at times the second-rate variety made progression jaded which fuelled a negative impression that the levels lasted too long. While the atmosphere was strong and coherent, the actual horror aspect came out less effective. The imagery was certainly on several occasions unsettling, showing off a few successful jump scares, but the scare tactics became slightly familiar over time and the pattern of predictability indisputable. However, just like Doom 3 at that time, certain tension brought out from the atmosphere was consistent enough to keep you alert and that quality somewhat redeemed the mentioned predictability. While particle effects, lighting and sound were astounding, the level design and textures were less complex and kind of mediocre looking. In addition, some of the character models felt wooden and appeared like plastic dolls.\n\nEssentially innovative and distinctly competent, F.E.A.R. elevated the modern shooter in spectacular proportions, which reasonably ended with an explosive cliff hanger. While combining action and horror, the incredibly beautiful and dynamic action portion - intensified by outstanding bullet time and amazingly clever opponents - clearly surpassed (and even to some extent neutralized) the fairly weakened horror note. Still, the unshakable lack of variety associated with the environments and level design had a significant impact on the general impression. All things considered, F.E.A.R. was and still is a skilful and relevant yet slightly jaded and overrated contribution of first-person-shooter history.\n\n7, 5 / 10\n","May 18, 2014","true","13.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/x-st/recommended/21090/","x-st","x-st","http://steamcommunity.com/id/x-st/","447 products in account","When it comes down to it, the main reason you’re reading this is to determine whether F.E.A.R and its expansions are worth your time. Can a game which is over a decade old still hold up to today’s standards?\n\nFEAR (from this point on I’m ignoring the punctuated form) wants you to believe that it’s a horror slash first person shooter combo. Heck, the name, plot synopsis and cover art lead you to believe that you’ll be afraid to play it if you’re left alone in a dark room. Being generous FEAR comes across as a FPS punctuated with horror elements....things glimpsed out of the corner of your eye, a jump scare here and there and creepy monologues from the antagonist. The reason that it doesn’t truly convey the dread that it wants to is because plot wise FEAR feel s slightly empty. Initially it has atmosphere, but after the umpteenth generic corridor, followed by the same old office cubicles, that sense of foreboding begins to wear thin. Environmentally FEAR is repetitive with a capital R....at times mind numbingly so.\nStory wise, Paxton Fettel, our antagonistic psychic terrorist, has escaped captivity and taken control of a small army of clone soldiers. He has then proceeded to aggressively takeover Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC), annihilate a Special Forces team and put on a special performance of Macbeth for his hostages(ok, maybe I was fibbing about of those things). And like it or lump it the FEAR team, or rather you, are given the task of eliminating that threat.\n\nThe plot is mainly relayed through telephone voice mail messages and laptops scattered throughout the building, creating a fragmented picture of what is actually going on. Radio’s broadcast ongoing news of the attack and your team gradually fills you in on the patchwork of information that they have uncovered as the game progresses. The main problem with this is that it’s actually quite difficult to obtain a deeper insight into the back-story beyond the obvious plot thread (no spoilers here, but I had to read around the subject to learn more about what actually happened that were only had briefly hinted at in-game). In fact contrary to popular opinion, the most immersive point in the game (story wise), was a pseudo-escort section.....the most reviled of all gameplay devices actually makes the player feel connected to the game! Who’d a thunk it!!!\n\nHowever, what FEAR lacks in environmental variety and Shakespearean intrigue it makes up for in spades with its gunplay, SloMo mechanic and the enemy encounters. Whilst there is little in the way of breathtaking spectacle, FEAR’s encounters are memorable primarily because your enemies, the Replica Soldiers, display a degree of AI probably not expected in a game of this pedigree. Rather than blindly running into the fray, they cautiously engage and to underestimate them is to end up dead rather quickly. Their radio chatter adds to the sense of menace, and whilst after a while you’ll have hear d most of it more than a few times, the foes in FEAR actually go some way in creating that sense of jeopardy. Then there’s FEAR’s “unique” Max Payneian mechanic – SloMo. Our nameless protagonist has heightened reflexes that allow him to slow the world around him down to a crawl, whilst he is free to wreak havoc. “Point Man” can’t move faster, but he can aim and shoot whilst his opponents slow to a snail’s pace, and more often than not, toggling the SloMo on and off to create a balletic path of destruction will yield maximum results. In fact SloMo is strangely addictive, jumping up to flying kick a soldier and then shooting his partner with your shotgun, as you then spin to decimate the rest of the group is satisfying in a marvelously visceral way. And it’s there that FEAR holds its trump card. The gunplay borders on sublime....assault rifles actually feel like they pack a punch, dual wielding pistols is curiously fun, the sniper rifle feels deadly and the shotgun.....oh the shotgun. FEAR’s shotgun is a work of art...enemy’s blossom into clouds of red mist, splitting into pieces as you run like a crazy person into their number. FEAR’s weaponry feels just right, and your opposition don’t just soak up damage never to fall....these guns actually pack a punch (although conversely don’t expect to be let off making a mistake as you’re liable to die very quickly if caught out in the open).   And then there’s the environmental destruction, walls become pockmarked, blood sprays everywhere, grenades emit a visible blast zone. It almost becomes fun to see how much damage you can cause with your weapons during each face-off.\n\nSo, great gunplay, good enemy AI, nice long campaign which is a bit repetitive and a running undercurrent of plot.....does it hold up today? Probably; if you can tolerate a bit of repetition then FEAR is definitely worth a run through. But hold that thought, as that’s excluding the expansions that you’ll also receive as part of this package. The first, Extraction Point, is a straight on continuation of the main game (non-canon however as these expansions were handled by different developer, TimeGate Studios rather than Monolith). Taking the final sequence of FEAR and running with it ultimately it’s more of the same with the addition of a couple of new weapons. Does it break anything? No. Does it significantly add or change anything? Again, no. So if the main game worked for you and you were after more of the same then Extraction Point will fill that need. The plot is an interesting sideline but ultimately you know what you’re getting.  Perseus Mandate mixes things up a little with a different protagonist (not that you’d notice of course) enhanced enemies, more use of companion characters (Steve Blum, loving your work!) and more new weapons. It actually boasts a couple of creepy moments that seemed more absent from Extraction Point, and rounds out some of the finer plot details. Added to that the game features some bonus time attack arenas to give the player a tad more challenge, and as a result Perseus Mandate actually feels like a solid way to end the first FEAR “series”.\n\nGiven that you understand the shortcomings of a set of games that are around a decade old, FEAR and its two add-ons are around 20 hours of fun. At times yet another grey corridor/office room will make you want to scream, but persevere and you’ll experience the joys of one of the best shotguns ever conceived in game form.\n","April 14","true","15.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

The AI is truly one of the most enjoyable to play against in gaming and my expectations of one of the best AI in gaming was certainly met, it will flank, flush, sneak, hide and will go the whole 9 yards to surprise you in unexpected ways.   The expectational atmosphere and story however is what clearly separates itself from others in the FPS/Horror genre, it does not abuse jump scares but rather creates a tense environment that is truly frighting.

FEAR puts you in the pants of some spec-op guy who's trying to figure out what happened to a secret military compound. Your team gets in, and then...well let's just say that things go bad. Real bad. Highly-trained soldiers come at you and you gotta defend yourself fast.\n\nGenre: FPS (Doom-like)/supernatural themes. For a game this "old" it's still a very solid shooter.\n\nAI: quite good (sometimes enemy flankers try to encircle you while others are suppressing).\n\nDifficulty: intermediate (due to the presence of "free" bullet-time).\n\nPlot: not bad, but in my opinion it's not central, for it's rather stale. It doesn't really drive you towards the finale (actually it does but as for me it's not as good as the Half-Life saga), it's more a tell-tale of evil experiments (rather cliche).\n\nAtmosphere: definitely dark and makes you feel like walking inside a (suprise) huge haunted house.\n\nGraphics:  While it would surely need a graphics-boost straight away, visuals are still appearing good.\n\nAudio: In my opinion it's one of the core factors in determining the eerie atmosphere that grows darker and darker as the game progresses.\n\nFUN FACTOR: crazy shootouts and major firefights with bad guys (as you may imagine) it's the core of this game.\nConclusion: although the plot is rather mild, graphics are slightly dated, the gunfights are still fun today. Definitely worth a playthrough if you're into supernatural shooters that focus on "decaying" atmosphere and, I dare say, a little claustrophobic at times.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 15","true","9.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Good sound effect truly makes a different in horror games. The gun blazing sound effect in slow-mo is beautiful just like in the movie Matrix.\n\nThe game features some of the best supernatural horror sequences and firefights in traditional FPS. The enemy AI is one of the best in gaming history, and it makes the singleplayer so much more fun to play. The enemy reponds to your action very intelligently, but even on extreme difficulty, with help of slow-mo and proper positioning, you can still win most fights without too much effort. Unlike the bots in Call of Duty Veteran difficulty, the super soldiers in F.E.A.R. don't have superhuman reflex and aims, you can stealth kill a lot of them if you are careful enough. The enemy AI is smart but never cheat, it makes the game fun but never frustrating.\n\nGood selection of weapons, all the weapons even the pistols are useful and feels powerful. It features one of the most powerful shotguns in FPS: good range, fast reload time, plenty of ammo, and powerful enough to one shot most soldier to pieces (literally) at point-blank. At bit overpowered in singleplayer, but it is a lot of fun.\n\nThe story is actually quite good for a FPS.\n\nBottom line, if you like blood (lots of blood) and dismemberment, then you will like this game. These over the top gore effect are very exaggerated and can be rather hilarious at times, but entertaining nonetheless.\n\n\nI had fond memories of this game back in 2005. I replayed it again and in my opinion, it still holds up pretty well against mordern FPS.

While the graphics are undeniably dated, F.E.A.R. still manages to pull you in to a dark tale that revolves around an cannibal convict, a creepy little girl, and a horrible secret. You play as Point-Man, a silent protaganist, and newest member of the First Encounter Assualt and Recon team and as your first mission you are charged with the responsibility of tracking down and apprehending violent murderer, Paxton Fettel. Though Fettel is just one man, capturing him will prove to be difficult as he is escorted by an army of replica soldiers (clones). Why are there clones, you ask? I'd love to tell you but the story is a little convoluted as are many in the horror genre, though this is eventually explained, it's sometimes hard to understand whats going on in the story if your not paying close attention (though there are recordings and the like that provide a more detailed backstory). As interesting as the story is, most will remember the vivid dream sequences and the constant dread that F.E.A.R.'s atmosphere provides. A moment that stood out to me involved a dark office space where the shadows always seemed to stalk you, barely audible whispers, a ringing phone and a bloody ceiling.\n\nIn addition to being host of a powerful atmosphere, F.E.A.R. happens to be a really fun shooter. Your enemies display a degree of independace that is still uncommon today. Replica soldiers will notice you if you are loud or forget to turn off your flashlight. When in battle, replica forces will often create cover, communicate with each other and flank you. Your enemies are also very accurate and provide a healthy challenge for experienced shooter fans. While F.E.A.R. offers the standard shooter arsenal of shotgun, rifle and smg and a few interesting novelties (one weapon turns people into bloody skeletons with a single hit) the slo-mo mechanic ensures that there is much fun. voices are distorted, bodies fall into crumpled heaps, and body parts fly in a symphony of blood and gore.\n\nThough the game looks old and lacks any multiplayer component, It's still a well done shooter that provides gripping chills, adrenaline soaked firefights and a story you wont soon forget and at ten dollars, it's a steal.","November 25, 2013","true","11.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

In this the game does feel it's age, and the final 30 minutes of the game feels somewhat rushed to it's conclusion.\nHaving said this, the atmosphere the game creates is pretty claustrophobic, and there are plenty of jump scare moments to keep you on your toes....and of course the all out action is second to none.\nNow to move on to the expansions and further games in the series...which, if I am led to believe, should be a huge disapointment for me.","April 7, 2014","true","10.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

While not really scary, the game has lots of subtle ambiance-type inclusions that make subsequent playthroughs really fulfilling.\n\nAlso, the level of detail is astounding.\n\nI wish modern FPS games were half as good as F.E.A.R.

The gameplay is good but sometimes repetitive, the strong point is the enemy AI, very good and challenging, enemies seek every moment to take advantage of the numerical superiority with efficient combat tactics.\n\nThe plot is what is best in the game, although I have not really liked the combination of sci-fi with horror, the story is solid and well built. The negative feature is the level design, scenarios are repetitive and sometimes make the game boring, I often had the impression of walking the same places I've been before.\n\n7/10\n\nF.E.A.R. Extraction Point: The first expansions, does not add much to the plot of the game and is just an extension of the final. The game remains predominantly action, there is the addition of some new weapons and enemies, as well as improving the AI. The level design is still repetitive and poorly explored, especially in this expansion.\n\n6/10\n\nF.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate: An expansion in which the events take place parallel to the game and other expansion. Not much to be revealed in a matter of plot. The positive is the inclusion of more terrifying situations I had not seen before. There are new enemies and the AI is further best and challenging. In overall I liked most of this expansion.\n\n7/10\n\nOverall I would recommend to play, it's a classic from FPS genre, but would not recommend playing the expansions right after the base game, I did it and felt bored with them because they become repetitive.","March 16, 2014","true","6.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

The reason why I love FEAR so much and it's one of my top 5 games of all time is because it knows what it wants to do and does an amazing job at that: being an amazing action shooter with some creepy supernatural elements in between.\nGood:\n-Graphics, sound and the like: FEAR still looks pretty nice despite being nearly nine years old today and the sound design is as solid as ever. God, I love the gunfire in this game, it really sounds threatening. And don't get me started on the delicious Voice Acting by the Replica Soliders, that sounds extremely menacing.\n-Gunplay and combatt in general: the game perfectly balances between being a realistic and tactical FPS and being not too supa dupa serious guise. Even the 'normal' weapons like the SMG or shotgun still feel great because you really feel like they pack a punch, especially the shotgun, that destroys anything that comes in your way. And then you still have the more fancy weapons, like the repeating cannon, the nail gun (god, nailing enemies to walls never gets old for me) and the particle gun, or as I like to call it, the skeleton gun (because it vaporizes (is that even a word?) any foe you hit with it, leaving nothing but some dust and bones). Melee feels great too and it's really satisfying to give a Replica Soldier a slowmo kungu kick to the face. Said slowmotion works great and is necessary if you want to survive, because..\n-The AI: everybody has heard of FEAR's great AI by now. And while it's also the combination of good level design and intelligent scripting, the Replica Forces you'll encounter in the game really feel like smart and dangerous opponents that will destroy you if you don't use your wits, especially on higher difficulty, where it becomes 'kill or be killed'. These guys will, thanks to their awesome voice acting, insanely well co-ordinated teamwork and despite being clones still having personality, always carry a very special place in my heart.\n-The horror: FEAR is inspired by japanese horror and it shows. Surrealistic and disturbing imagery, darkness and silence to drive you slowly insane, 'did I just see anything or was it just my imagination', all that. The game does have a few 'jumpscares' but nothing in the likes of 'spooky face appears with loud noise'.\n-The story: FEAR tells it story through clever use of voicemail messages, date on laptops and the like. You'll really want to find out the truth behind project origin near the end of the game.\n-TECHNOLOGY: objects that don't just stand there and get bullet holes when you shoot/melee/blow them up, the ability to see your legs, reflections in puddles of water, FEAR's got it all. Suck it, Bioshock Infinite, this nine year old game beats you here without any effort.\nBad:\n-Dislikeable characters: some characters in FEAR (TALKING TO YOU, NORTON) aren't really likeable and you'd wish they'd just shut up so you can go and slowmokungfukick some more cloned soldiers. It's not really an issue, though, and more a matter of having something I dislike so people don't call me a fanboy that can't give negative criticism.\n-Linear and repetitive scenery sometimes: you'll be fighting a lot of the times in the same type of buildings, though I didn't mind too much and this problem gets solved near the end of the game. There's still plenty of variation to make it bearable.\nOveral, I give FEAR a 9/10. The same score I give to its two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, who are in my opinion the true 'sequels' to this amazing game and add some interesting weaponry, areas and enemies while keeping the amazing formula that makes FEAR so damn great.","August 18, 2014","true","32.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Pick it up if you like shooters, you won't regret it. The later installments are a bit iffy from what I've read, but the game that started the franchise still holds up today as a solid experience.\n\nWhen FEAR was new, it changed up the classic arena shooter formulas by introducing melee attacks (jump kicks, slide kicks, etc...) and limiting the number of weapons you could carry to 3, but the biggest feature was the bullet-time mechanic which has been used in a lot of games since. I'm not going to get into a long discussion here, but hitscan (projectiles you can't dodge in mid-flight, as opposed to say a Doom imp's fireballs) weaponry is difficult to implement in games because you can't dodge it, you can only either soak the hits (unrealistic) or hide from it behind chest high walls (not fun). FEAR neatly solved this problem with bullet-time by allowing you to move so much faster than your enemies you could dispatch them without needing to soak up hits or hide for very long (only if you ran out of bullet-time).\n\nIf you like this I highly recommend the two expansions, Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point. They are full games and essentially more of the same, but there is nothing wrong with that when the game play is this good.","December 28, 2013","true","0.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

To be fair, the game it´s good mainly because of the fire-fight, and not because of the horror. The combat system was made perfectly, with the slow-mo ability and how the enviornment around you reacts with bullets and explosions.\n\nThe expansions are better than the original in some aspects: Extraction Point has much more scarier and bigger horror sequences, while Perseus Mandate is more dedicated to the action and is more challenging, with you having to face a new type of enemy which is more powerfull and agressive. The bad thing about them is that the story of those expansions are kinda silly, even thougth they are still better stories than the cannonical games (F.E.A.R. 2 and F.E.A.R. 3), which have more silly stories and who are games that are not scary at all.\n\nScore: 8.5 out of 10.","September 23, 2015","true","6.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Perseus Mandate on the other hand is just bland, with a cast of characters that don't matter and with Alma and Fettel just kinda thrown in there because PLOT. The combat doesn't feel nearly as fun due to certain enemies just feeling like complete bullet sponges, and with spooks that aren't nearly as well paced or as well done in general as either the base game or EP. In my opinion Perseus Mandate is completely worth skipping while Extraction Point is definitely worth playing through at least once after the main game of course.","August 9, 2015","true","11.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gzalzi/recommended/21090/","Gzalzi","Tralan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gzalzi/","549 products in account","When I first rented Monolith Productions’ F.E.A.R. on Xbox 360 back in 2007, I was very impressed with the singleplayer campaign. Despite not being able to complete F.E.A.R. before I had to return it to the video store, it left a lasting impression on me and I considered it a modern classic. The recent inclusion of the game as part of the Humble WB Bundle provided the perfect opportunity to re-experience the game and see if my initial impression of it holds to my more refined standards of today.\n\nOne element of F.E.A.R. that impresses more than even most newly released games is its beautiful visual effects and physics. Just about everything smaller than entire desks and tables, from office telephones and spinning desk chairs, to paintings on the walls, are physics based. Occasionally, this causes some issues (most of which exist in all games with lots of physics-based objects) such as corpses becoming embedded in walls and floors or clutter bouncing around when they should not, but for the most part lends itself greatly to the experience. It can be terrifying when you are walking down a dark hallway, trying to sneak up on an enemy, when you accidentally walk over a soda can, kicking it down the hall with a silence-breaking twang. The first time you enter a large firefight, enable SloMo, and begin exchanging fire with the Replica soldiers is breathtaking: dust fills the air as bullets impact nearby walls, creating actual holes in the walls rather than just placing a decal; stray bullets knock boxes of papers and electronics off shelves, breaking them; a grenade goes off nearby, knocking the hanging lights around, the game’s marvelous dynamic lighting and shadows changing the entire look of the battlefield; and the opposing forces’ soldiers react realistically, with custom animations dependent on where they are hit that are integrated well with ragdoll physics. Another soldier, panicking, runs away but stumbles and falls over while he attempts to call squad for backup. While these sorts of features are not a new creation for F.E.A.R., they are all used extremely effectively together to create impressive and satisfying scenes that leave a lasting impression, defining F.E.A.R. and setting it apart from other games in people’s minds.\n\nWhile F.E.A.R. manages to wow with its impressive physics, lighting, and effects; intense soundtrack and Japanese-horror inspired ambience; and solid gunplay and fair difficulty, F.E.A.R. is not a perfect game and many of its elements and tropes undermine the level of immersion needed to truly be disturbed by a horror game. There are a significant amount of attempted jump scares that are ineffective and cheap feeling. The enemies, unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty, lack the power to instill a fear of death in you. Because of this playing on the hardest difficulty is an absolute must, even on a first playthrough. The highest difficulty is the only one that has fair and interesting feelings gunplay, since on lower difficulties enemies are just too weak and easy to kill. The improved gunplay and stronger enemies add both enjoyable skill-based gameplay and intense ambience that greatly improves the overall feel of the game.\n\nOverall, F.E.A.R. is an overall great game that I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys first person games. Despite its age, it is of much higher quality than much newer first person and horror games. F.E.A.R. is a classic that everyone should experience as an important part of the history of modern gaming, regardless of your interest in the genres.","May 10, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustyblue/recommended/21090/","dustyblue","DustyBlue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustyblue/","2247 products in account","One of my favorite FPSs to play just because of how awesomely the slow-motion goes with the gunplay. All the weapons are very fun to use too, and, of course, the game is pretty dang scary. It's also a fairly long game as far as FPS go, at least to me. I just wish I could have played the multiplayer, since apparently they managed to make slow-motion work in that. Pretty amazing if you ask me. I think this was the first game to make that happen too. But anyway, F.E.A.R. is one of the most fun FPSs out there, and with excellent atmosphere and scares. Also, the enemy AI is a wonder to behold, even now, approaching a decade later. This game is probably the best mix of action and horror I've seen done in video games, with neither being sacrificed for the other, all while managing to be deliciously challenging the whole way through. This game really hit the sweet spot on so many levels. Monolith Productions just doesn't get quite enough credit.\n\nThe two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, are also very fun, naturally, and certainly worth playing as well. Mutha♥♥♥♥in' minigun and laser cannon and lightning gun, ♥♥♥♥♥es!\n\nApparently they're not canon though. I don't see why they shouldn't be, honestly. Sort of a Half-life: Blue Shift and Opposing Force situation with the expansions, except Blue Shift and Opposing Force are technically canon, or at least it's ambiguous and has still not been denied by Valve. Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate are apparently just not canon, under the grounds that F.E.A.R. 2 doesn't mention the events in those (Just like Blue Shift and Opposing Force! And those are canon!) and because it wasn't developed by Monolith Productions (Just like F.E.A.R. 3! And that's canon! [... unfortunately]).\n\nSo I say they might as well be canon, Extraction Point, Perseus Mandate, Blue  Shift and Opposing Force AND Dragon Ball GT. Could Half-life and F.E.A.R. take  place in the same universe?! And how does Dragon Ball fit into this?!\n\nI guess we'll never know...","November 5, 2013","true","23.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Aside from the basic replica soldier with different skins and HP/armor (skins look good), there are about 5 other enemy types: heavy soldiers, mechs, flying mechanical things that shoot lasers, stealth kung fu commandos, and ghosts. Minus the regular replica soldiers, all the other enemies numbers, individually, are in the single digits, save the ghosts, but youll only see them once.\n- More environmental interaction would be preferable personally. You are basically limited to opening and closing doors, breaking things like glass, and pushing the button that advances the story.\n\nI played this game through when it was released, but never got the expansions or sequals. I got the bundle of all of them on sale, and am glad I played through the original again. Being almost 10 years now since I originally played it, I can now really appreciate how good the AI actually is. FEAR's AI was revolutionary at the time, and remains as a high standard that few FPS games get to (mention some if you can, Id like to know of more games with impressive AI like this).\n\nAs the player, you are as vulnerable to bullets as the enemies, and more so on higher difficulty levels. To be good at countering the AI, a person cannot approach the enemies as they would a normal FPS, meaning you cannot charge into combat and hop around a lot, or jump out into the open with guns blazing, with a little adadadadadadadadad dancing here and there. Try that, and even on medium, youll get torn to pieces.\n\nYou also cannot wait for the soldiers to come to you; if you do, youll be waiting a loooong time. You must actively engage the majority of them as they use cover to wait for you.\n\nCover and leaning around corners is essential, especially on hard difficulty, and without question necessary on extreme difficulty. Expose your body for more than just a second (and sometimes not even), and youll take damage. Stay uncovered and in LOS to multiple enemies, and youre sure to die.\n\n"Reflex Time", or bullet time, is slow mo that can be activated for short periods at will. It is not really necessary to use it unless playing extreme difficulty, but is a lot of fun at times, allowing you set up some impressive moves.\n\nThe combat AI and battles with it is where this game shines, and remains truly impressive, even a decade later. While there are some shortcomings to FEAR, the stellar AI mitigates much of their effect.\n\nHighly recommended.","July 13, 2014","true","34.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Note: I was playing with everything maxed out but it still speaks to how good the game is. The lighting is equally impressive.\n\n+The particle effects are fantastic. Every gun battle truly feels like you just finished an epic showdown, with debris, dust ,blood and other effects flying everywhere\n\n+When the game was released it was noted for having great AI. This is still the case, and in some regards better than most games today. Enemies will flank you, try to run away when injured and in general try to work together to take you down.\n\n+Any first person shooter should have a good sense of weapons and feel to them and this game doesn't disappoint. Every gun feels unique and offers a certain strategy to how you play. The shotgun in this game is extremely satisfying to use. Slow down time, blast an enemy with the shotgun, watch debris fly everywhere, move on...\n\n+ Throughout the game, horror elements are present, I have played the game numerous times and there are still segments of the game that make me jump.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- IF the graphics are great technically, then artistically the graphics are pretty bland.\n\n-On that same point the environments can feel very 'cut and paste' giving you the feeling like your running through the same areas over and over again. There are a few times where it can get confusing where to go because everything looks so similar.\n\n-Multiplayer is dead\n\n-The games story is pretty decent and serves only as a backdrop for you kill things but what really brings it down is that stupid characters that act completely illogical to the circumstances.\n\nConclusions\nI have played this game many times in the past and recently finishing the game shows me how well this game holds up despite its problems.  Despite its problems it really deserves to be played at least for the shotgun alone.\n","August 21, 2014","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Having played the demo version years ago I thought it would be nice to try out the full game especially considering some of the positive reviews that others have given it.\n\nDespite being an older game the campaign was fairly decent and was packed full of action in each chapter/interval. The enemy AI in particular was rather challenging at times which is excellent, definately better AI than some of the newer games, including F.E.A.R 2 and F3AR. Obviously being an older game means the graphics are a bit dated but when maxed out they are comparable to some of the cheaper or F2P games on steam. This is also be a good thing for people that don't have amazing PC specs or are laptop users as pretty much any modern machine from 2010 or later can play this game on medium graphics (some higher intergrated GPUs such as the Intel HD 4000 or the AMD hd 6550d can max out the settings on this game).\n\nThis game does have some basic jumpscares (it is called FEAR for a reason after all) so be wary about buying this game if you are prone to easily getting scared, however most people should have no problem playing this.\n\nI recommend this game to users who are looking for a fun game packed with action. The game itself is fairly cheap already at £6.99 but I often see it at £3.49 ( sometimes less) during the sales. F.E.A.R is one game definately worth picking up.","June 25, 2014","true","13.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And they succeeded! It's been almost 10 years and playing FEAR is still fun. Slow-motion is imperative for survival and it does make the gameplay exciting. All the particle effects accompanying this effect still stand out, even with today's standards.\n\nWhile full of action, FEAR is mainly a psychological horror. Between the action sequences supernatural encounters are common and your main antagonist is someone of that nature. Your are keen on finding out more of this phenomenon you are after and the story has some surprises for you along the way.\n\nExtraction Point was the follow-up expansion pack for the game which takes places exactly where the main story leaves us in the original game. Interestingly, the same studio that developed this expansion pack released another one two years later. Perseus Mandate was longer, more difficult and more action-packed - too bad the story was rather unoriginal and we already new a sequel would come out. Also, the story told by Perseus Mandate is not considered canon in this franchise.\n\nAlthough lacking the multiplayer component (check the message on the game's store page), FEAR's single player content is still very original and can be entertaining in 2014.

The game at its core is a very solid and competetent FPS, the shooting feels great, the guns feel really authentic with a decent amount of recoil on each one and a decent variety of guns to choose which I really like. Besides the gunplay the combat gets some variety with the melee combat, which consists of punching and kicking while moving or standing and I think this one is a real plus because when you use a melee attack the animation looks really nice and gives it a certain "style" not only that but you can use a slow motion "mode" that has a certain timer to it which allows you to aim better and pick your targets more easily.

On your mission you often hear about a girl called Alma. Who is that? You even meet here several times in your paranormal visions. And the game is horror indeed. Often you are in levels where you are hunted by Fettels and Almas paranormal visions. Persons who die in front of you eyes and who die because of having their flesh removed from their bones. Thats totally normal. And that is not even all. You are always hunted by the dark... It can wait behind every corner. But who is Fettel and Alma actually? One thing is clear, you are bound with them but you cant tell how. That is your mission to find out.\n\nThe game has nice graphics especially for the fact its from 2005. I doubt that there was anything better looking back then, not even Far Cry from 2004 looked that great. If you ask me at least. Nearly everything is demolishable and the physics are great. What I really love is the bullet time that you can start anytime you want, but its limited and needs to recharge sometimes. You also have a flashlight but this one needs to recharge too. Dont waste your flashlight because you will need it. The play with the light and the dark is really amazing in this game.\n\nI played the multiplayer once, it was ok and can make some fun.\nBUT. The official multiplayer is done. There is F.E.A.R. Combat though, the multiplayer of F.E.A.R. that has been published by the community and is still supported. Works without problems. You should try it, its free. Just google for their website.\n\nThe Steam version also has both released addons for free!\nBoth are NOT considered canon by the official developers Monolith. Its fiction.\nMeans things that happened in them are not covered by FEAR 1, 2, 3.\nExtraction Point tells the story what happened after the main game ending.\nIts nice and it still had those Horror shocker. I really liked this addon.\nOnly downside is that for some reason its not supporting widescreen out of the box.\nWeirdly the main game and Perseus Mandate does... However, you can easily edit a ini to get your desired widescreen resolutions, google it.\nPerseus Mandate on the other hand wasnt really my taste.\nYou are a whole different character trying to uncover mission perseus.\nThe horror shockers in this addon are nearly non existent if you ask me.\nAlso its mostly about shooting yourself through corridors flooded with replicants.\nI died very often because it was way too difficult, even on normal compared to the other games.\nIt was frustrating and a little bit boring, especially at the end.\nBoth addons were developed by another developer named Timegate Studios.\n\nThe maingame will take up to 10 hours to finish.\nThe addons each around 5 hours.\n\nThe Steam version comes only in English!\nThere are several language packs available as Steam guides and also in the web.\nI also added a German UNCUT language pack for those who like to play the games in German.\nIts in the guide section.\n\nAlso I want to say that F.E.A.R. and its addons suffer from FPS problems on most modern rigs.\nThis is due to the engine having problems with several HID devices like mouse, keyboard, controller.\nAll systems starting with Vista can have this problem. The fix is to disable several HID devices. Google it. This is actually really annoying. There are some more problems. EAX does not work on all modern systems starting with Vista. Some can still enable it with soundcard driver programs. Or use a tool called directsound to activate basic EAX support. I should note that Windows XP fixes actually both issues. Also the game itself is not able to activate soft shadows and anti aliasing at the same time. To do so you have to use Nvidia inspector and a online tutorial to add proper anti aliasing support. Just disable the ingame AA but leave soft shadows on. Works fine then. I dont know if there is a AMD way to do this.\n\nPositive:\n- Bullet time\n- Good graphics (2005)\n- Good Story\n- Big amount of options ingame\n- Alma is one of the best game characters ever\n- No health regeneration!\n- Great play with the dark and shadows\n- Good and fitting unique soundtrack\n- Good Enemy AI\n- Shooting is a lot of fun\n\nNeutral:\n- Multiplayer is ok but dead, use community mod to fix it\n- Not available in the German Steam store\n\nNegative:\n- High Difficulty\n- Mostly simple and kinda boring level designs\n- Technical problems with modern systems\n- Some questionable key settings, changeable\n\nReplayability: Medium\n\nI really liked the story of it and the atmosphere, also the bullettime.\nAlma was one of the creepiest and most interesting characters I have ever met in a videogame.\nThe addon Extraction Point was just as good as the main game.\nPerseus Mandate wasnt good though.\nI would give 8.5/10 points for the maingame and the extraction point addon.\nPerseus Mandate wont get more than 5/10.\n\nI also reviewed the other F.E.A.R. games.","October 18, 2014","true","17.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

At launch FEAR PC requirements were staggering. Today the engine still puts out some impressive graphics, lighting and shadows.  One would be hard pressed to find better combat even in modern shooters.  A nice variety of guns and melee techiques are at the players disposal.  Animation is over the top with tremondous unprecedented detail given to how enemies react to bullets, grenades and melee damage. The engine paints their blood on surfaces with a liberal brush and blows their bodies apart better than any other I can remember.  Excellent sound, a well implemented slo motion mechanic (that you can disable, good luck) and good physics compliment a wonderful combat engine.  Correctly criticized for repetive level design however FEAR leads with communications that tell a horrific tale of psychological horror.  The combat never gets old and there's that need to see what's around the next corner.","December 25, 2011","true","21.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

If you are a true FPS or horror game admirer, do not miss out on playing this game.\nNothing beats a mad fearguy shooting through a horde of replica soldiers, on his mission to reach Paxton Fettel.\nThe story is simple and so is your goal, but it doesn’t have to be anything complex, it works and I may go as far to say that it adds a bit to the atmosphere.\n\nGraphic, controls, performance, & sound:\n\nThe combat/controls are very decent and so is the graphics of a 2005 game. Exploding bodies with a single shot from shooty is one of the things that always made me giggle in a rather cruel way. I especially like the graphical details of; weapon skins, bullet detail, explosives and fire in general.\nNever had performance issues with this game, but again it’s from 2005; a nowadays low-end pc with a medium-end graphic card shouldn’t have too much trouble running this game.\nThere is a good amount of sound detail in this game that helps to trick and mislead you in situations of scares. The weapon sound is quality and the combat background music fits in nicely.\n\nArtificial Intelligence:\n\nThe AI technology in this game is absolutely amazing; those replica soldiers will run, hide and kite you, like their life were at stake, eh I guess it is against a mad fearguy on the loose!\n\nOverall:\n\nMy only dislike was the very similar level stages, but compared to the overall experience and long playtime value, it didn’t really matter to me.\nI played this on the PS3. I plan to play it on the PC sometime in the future again on a harder mode. I personally prefer FPS on the PC and would recommend it over playing it on the PS3 - if you’re used to play FPS on the PC.\n\n\nF.E.A.R. Extraction Point:\n\nI didn’t expect much from this expansion first time I tried it, but color me surprised! It’s more spot on compared to the first one regarding scares, which I found to my liking.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first F.E.A.R. and felt like you didn’t get quite enough scares, this one may satisfy your desire on that point.\n\nAlma also takes a larger role in this game as well and may aid you if the situation counts for it.\n\nThe weapon armory is very similar compared to F.E.A.R., which I didn’t mind at all, since I like most of the weapons.\n\nThe levels were great! A lot of fun and strange stages- Alma playing tricks on you and all that sort of stuff. The playtime value is also decent 6-8 hours depends on how long you spend on looking for goodies.","January 2, 2013","true","19.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Maybe it's time.\n\nF.E.A.R. is a FPS game, but more importantly a survival horror.\nPlaying as the Point Man, part of a First Encounter Assault Recon team, your job is to locate and eliminate Paxton Fettel, a psychic able to control a battalion of Replicas. What seems to be a classic spec-ops mission will actually turn into a nightmare, that will put your enhanced reflexes at heavy use.\nThrough this game, you fight smart enemy soldiers, you dig into Armacham's story, you help funny and frail survivors... But you can't expect how good this game is at scaring you, nor how bad things can turn to.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGn-8Go_hnY\n\nI find this game a good choice in order to begin survival horror games, specially if you are used to FPS ones. I suggest continuing with its first DLC, Extraction Point, which starts right when the main game stops, and puts you in an even worst nightmare than before.\nI also suggest stopping before the second DLC, Perseus Mandate.

For some reason, Steam bundled the first game along with the 2 standalone expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate together into a massive 17 gigabyte installation. This is weird since the 2 expansions are so similar to the base game (in graphics and gameplay) that they probably should have just shared most of the same data files and shrunk the size considerably. The three games have different Steam entries too, so once F.E.A.R is installed, just choose to “install” Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate and it will pretty much instantly install them.\n\nYou play the part of an unnamed First Encounter Assault Recon soldier, though they refer to you a few times as the point man for the team. Your squad has about 4-5 people but you get separated from them right away so there’s no squad based gameplay. Your primary mission in the game is to take down Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander created by the Armacham private military contractor. Psychic commanders are supposed to control “replica soldiers” who are basically genetically engineered clone soldiers. Fettel went insane for some reason and his replica forces are tearing the place up. As the story progresses you find hints about Armacham projects called Perseus and Origin, which are somehow related to Fettel’s creation. Throughout the game you also see visions of a little girl who appears out of nowhere and vanishes when you get close. There are a lot of “dream sequence” type hallucinations where you learn about Alma, the little girl, and what they did to her at Armacham.\n\nFear is a first person shooter with a slow motion “power” that you can activate with the push of a button. It’s explained in the story as your character having off the chart reflexes, and you can use it to give yourself an advantage in battle. In reality though, it’s not as useful as you might think. You’re not actually moving faster in slow-mo, it’s mostly just to give you more time to aim your shots (you can’t dodge bullets like Neo). Reloading and aim correction from weapon recoil still slow you down. The thing that really sets Fear apart from other games at the time was its advanced enemy AI. The replica soldiers actually behave like real human players a lot of the time. They throw grenades if you’re under cover and they try to circle around you. Most importantly though, they don’t sit still in combat, making it a little harder for you to flank them. Fear uses a health/armor system where you have both a health number and an armor number and constantly find armors lying around in the levels. You can carry up to 10 med kits which you use manually by pressing a button. You can carry up to 3 weapons and can switch them around by taking the stuff your enemies drop.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent enemy combat AI\n+A bunch of scares thrown in when Alma pops up or hallucinations occur\n+Immersive storyline\n\nCons:\n-The game’s graphics are pretty dated now. I don’t think you can get more than 1280 x 1024 resolution. And it’s a large download for such an old game.\n-No real “boss fights” which are usually fun in first person shooters\n-The enemies have great aim. It seems like they can hit you no matter how far away they are.\n\nMini reviews for the 2 standalone expansions:\n*FEAR Extraction Point:\nThis is a non-canon continuation of the story. That means that it if you play the sequels, FEAR 2 & 3 will ignore what happens in the FEAR Extraction Point story. The game is standalone, which means you don’t keep all the upgrades and gear that you found in the base game. There really isn’t anything new in Extraction Point except maybe 1 or 2 weapons that you only use for a few minutes.\n\n*FEAR Perseus Mandate:\nA few new weapons appear which actually make it into the sequel FEAR 2. So even if the story isn’t “official” they were clearly paying attention to this game.  This one has some pretty mean new enemies including a difficult boss fight. Definitely better than Extraction Point. Perseus Mandate’s story is separate from the original game. You play a different person in a different FEAR squad, though there are a lot of references to events in the base game happening at the same time.\n\nOverall I’d give FEAR a thumbs up if you can handle the large download and don’t mind some poor (by today’s standards) graphics. You cannot just download the base game; you automatically download all three at the same time (FEAR + Extraction Point + Perseus Mandate). If you could pick and choose, I’d recommend you skip Extraction Point. The experience is better if you play in the dark.\n","September 9, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although being so powerful diminishes horror, the non-combat sections could have been scary or tense if they weren't so rigidly divorced from the rest of the game and entirely predictable. Alma had potential, but you quickly realize she poses no threat. The hallucinitory segments are visually striking but unintercative and poorly presented. At times the atmosphere works, but F.E.A.R. is just afraid to commit to fear.\n\nWorse than that though, is the environment design. Do you like gray? This is your game. Do you like office buildings, water treatment facilities, and warehouses? Have at it, friend. With such drab and repetitive environments, the linearity sticks out like a sore thumb. It's as if they had a binder of environmental designs, but lost most of it in a fire except the most boring parts, and didn't have time to make any more. For a game with such great lighting effects, the endless labyrinths of grey and off-white are shameful.\n\nFor all of that negativity, the game has one saving grace. The shooting. It's rare to play a game where guns feel so powerful. A shotgun at close range is likely to straight up tear weaker enemies in half; enemies jerk about under hails of assault rifle fire; the HLV Penetrator (fun fact, for a long time, thanks to the game's font I thought it was the HIV Penetrator), which is basically the Stake Gun from Painkiller, nails enemies to the walls; unlike in most games, explosions leave parts of enemies throughou the room. Bullets leave craters on the walls and floors, papers go flying,  windows shatter, and hanging lamps flicker and swing from the force of explosions. Every weapon feels, well, like a deadly weapon should.\n\nHowever, the enemies in F.E.A.R. are surprisingly smart. They will try to flank you, throw grenades to get you out of cover, and move quickly if under fire. Every encounter is intense as you die quickly, and you will have to use health packs and armor wisely since none of it regenerates. Most fights have at least two routes of approach, so your postioning matters. Really your only advantage is the slow motion, which besides letting you see every visceral detail, gives you time to aim and think. Most shooters could learn a thing or two from F.E.A.R. about combat.\n\nOh and there's a story too, but very little actually happens, and I rarely had any reason to think about it\n\nUnfortunately, F.E.A.R.  suffers from the boring environmental design and the noticably segmented gameplay, which is a crying shame, since its gleefully visceral combat and consistently intelligent enemies are light years above and beyond any thing most games offer. If you can put up with those problems this is definitely worth you money. 10/10 for combat, 5/10 for everthing else.","March 29, 2015","true","11.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's never scary (maybe shocking, definitely spooky, but not scary), but the horror atmosphere lends a terse, exciting atmosphere to it that's rarely found in its contemporaries, going only to further boost the fun of gun combat that is among the cream of the genre's crop.\n\nSkeletons, psychic soldiers, seeping pools of blood and wild hallucinations all feature, as well as cannibals and The Grudge/The Ring, but they don't really ever frighten so much as spook. It's more akin to a theme park haunted house (or, day I say it, a Hideo Kojima title); it's surprising and strange, but behind every sincere scream is a laugh, because none of it is dangerous - it's mere window dressing. But it is a fabulously entertaining window dressing - it means that the horror gore has been ramped to 11 - so you have weapons like, say, shotguns that blow enemies into mist, or rail guns that decapitate heads and leave them pinned into walls. Also, bizarrely - and fantastically - the combat includes a fairly robust and stupidly ridiculous melee system, with flying bicycle kicks and sliding kicks all available at the press of a button, as well as a slo-mo bullet time ability. It controls less like a horror shooter and more like The freaking Matrix, and that's absolutely a positive.\n\nIt might not be scary (and for a game called "F.E.A.R." that might be a bigger problem than I'm making it out to be), but my god. The gunplay is superb, the enemy AI is just cunning enough to be a challenge while just stupid enough to not be an annoyance (it's not quite a "tactical" shooter, but it has that kind of grounding to its gunfights). It's chunky and powerful, but it isn't slow-paced, and the level design is freaking fantastic. It all combines to create a genuinely satisfying and wholly entertaining shooter, and the horror, while absolutely failed, adds an enjoyable twist to the formula that means the game rarely feels familiar. It's just a really great FPS, and if you like first-person shooters, I'd say this is one you need to play. Everything in it adds enough spice to it that the flavour is... well, it's not wildly divergent, but it's satisfyingly unique. There's nothing else quite like it, even its sequels, so, yeah. Huge thumbs up from me.","March 11, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/recommended/21090/","jbaketkd","Vash(88)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/","787 products in account","Extremely fun shooter with a unique style and some good scares!  The guns all feel as though they belong in the game, and the atmosphere, when not in a firefight, is intense.  For being made in 2005, the graphics are outstanding!  Some bland textures will be noticed, but the particle affects and fire animations are a splendid sight.\n\nThe combat is rough at first.  The player is given a slow-mo ability, "bullet time," that takes a little getting used to.  Once the player has a better understanding of the AI and the use of the bullet time, things will start to get interesting, and by "interesting" I mean out of control!  Watching the chaos unfold in slow-motion is a lot of fun, and the ability will be VERY important in the late game fights.\n\nThe characters are all well made and the voice actors are good as well.  The game does a great job making the player feel isolated from the rest of the friendly NPCs.  It wouldn't be very scary if a team of bots came along for the ride.  Just like Gordon Freeman, the main character has no input to the events around him, which seems a bit odd considering some of the ♥♥♥♥ that unfolds.\n\nThe weapons themselves work well for the game, but they were far from my favorite part.  Apart from the pistols and a small number of other guns, almost every weapon in the game is burst fire, even the sniper rifle and rocket launcher, and that was a bit frustrating.  As the game progresses, some additional weapons, that are not burst fire, will be found: the shotgun and a type of bolt thrower are awesome.\n\nThe scary portions of the game seemed a little skewed at times, and at others, some of the best in an FPS.  Even though the use of a loud screeching sound was over-used, a lot of the spooks came from deep within -- that voice and feeling in the back of the player's mind that does not agree with what's on screen; unfortunately, the placement of these scares were a little off some times.  There were a number of scares that I missed and had to reload a section to see what happened due to a misjudgment of the player's actions.\n\nThe balance of action with tension was great.  Even if it was a mite predictable at times, there were plenty of moments that had me jumping out of my seat!  Worth every penny.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=245486865\n\nF.E.A.R.: Extraction point review below:\n\nThe follow-up dlc for F.E.A.R, aka Extraction point, picks up right where F.E.A.R. leaves off.  F1 leaves the player with an amazing ending to the game and choosing for the dlc to work as a conclusion is a grand idea!\n\nThe dlc starts out fast and wastes no time throwing the player right back into the mix; unfortunately, if the two games are played back to back, the combat can and will become extremely repetitive!  The  first two thirds of the game are top notch.  The combat is more furious than the first game, and there is no need to slowly work the player into the tension.  The cards are on the table and Alma is out of the bag --  so to speak.\n\nPersonally, the horror moments of Extraction point are better than it's predecessor's; however, like it was mentioned already, after the first half of the game or so, the horror segments and hallucinations become the only thing worth working towards.\n\nThe combat fails towards the end due to the fact that the same tactic works for the whole game!  On top of that, the longer the point man (your character) makes his way through the city, the less and less it makes sense that there has been ZERO military or police response to the numerous explosions happening though-out the subway and surround buildings.  A one man army scenario can work, Gordon Freeman, but the setting has to make sense.  Gordon was stuck in a city that was controlled by the same people attempting to kill him.  In extraction point, it just feels like the world has forgotten about you.\n\nLastly, there's the silent hero gig...  It worked for Gordon because he was never actually put into a situation where his lack of response didn't some how "work" with the dialog.  In Extraction point, the point man simply ignores the people talking to him even when it's a desperate plea for help or acknowledgment.  Friendly NPCs die because it.\n\nIf you plan on playing Extraction point, do not play it right after F1, do yourself that favor.  It's a fun and tense game, but it can be really frustrating.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=250011069","April 7, 2014","true","17.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The shooting mechanics are in-depth and satisfying, with the slow-mo ability adding an intense, if unoriginal, tactical advantage. The ability to use a variety of melee attacks is also incredibly addictive, perhaps overpowered since it can kill an enemy in one hit, but this is mitigated by how easy it is to take damage if not played carefully. Great level design rewards players who move slowly and explore, and also enables the complex AI to provide a competent challenge as they flank, use grenades, communicate and ambush the player.\n\nBeyond the gameplay, this still remains one of the best horror and story-based games as well. The scare-tactics are a bit "in your face" compared to some recent gems in the field of horror, but it still has a deeply disturbing atmosphere and a low-key ambient soundtrack adds to the tension.\nThe story is a sickening descent into the horrors unleashed by mankind's wickedness, the desire to play god, and monsters who destroy their makers.","February 18, 2015","true","15.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I praise this game for it's horror moments and overly creative use of physics and scenory manipulated by pure horror, having the world change around you in such a spetacular matter is intoxicating. I don't get scared of much but I'm sure some people would be freaked out by this.\n\nThis game is  right up there with half life, doom, duke nukem, perfect dark, golden eye, time splitters and other amazing games. There are 2 things I can say bad about it, the first being the character walk speed which is okay because it benifits the tactical nature of the game, this is one of the most tactical shooters you will play outside of half life, it has many acrobatic moves to sweep, cut balance and and out right stun your enemy, and it pairs with the gun combat so well. This is one of the only shooters I find forgiving in the character walk speed department. The second being the story, it's good until the ending where I feel follows a clacay Friday the 13th did what happen just happen. However the story has many twist and is overall great.\n\nThe expansion packs are simply more fear, there story is meh but the game play is a nice popsicle true fans can lick who simply die for my fear.","September 25, 2014","true","17.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It doesn't hurt the gameplay. The battlesystem is nice, with great AI behaviour, though enemies are a bit more challlenging than in F.E.A.R.3. It takes 3-4 shots before you are killed on normal difficulty. So, you should be really careful. But with slow-mos and covers it's managable and, leaving those piles of corpses behind you, makes you feel like a mass murderer.\n\nThere are a lot of surprises in terms of enemy spawning, which adds up for a nice challenge. You don't get bored, because as soon as you get used to enemies and start to think "meh, this is too easy", something new pops in, requiring you to adapt to the new level of difficulty.\n\nThere is not much of a story in terms of dialogues and cut-scenes. But what you have is a rather direct experience, and the story reveals itself, as you advance through enemies and levels. The sound and special effects adds up nice tension to the gameplay.\n\nSo, as a result, you get a really good semi-horror first person shooter with a nice polish. I recommend it to all players, especially, if you have played and like such games as Return to Castle Wolfenstein and F.E.A.R.3.\n\nEXTRACTION POINT expansion: F.E.A.R. at its best. Includes more paranormal content and horror elements, engaging in very, very tense, almost psychologically tormenting, yet addicting gameplay. The enemies are more difficult, too, ranging from regular soldiers to armored units, mechs and phantoms, that will slice you up in no time.\n\nPERSEUS MANDATE expansion: after completing Extraction Point, it will feel like a casual game. In this game you play as Pointman from the second F.E.A.R. team. There's not much of horror in this game, the focus is on different guns. Still, it is a satisfying game. 3 unlockable bonus missions included (kill all the enemies in the clinic; survive the arena; and sprint trough enemy lines).\n\nMy overall rating: 9/10\n\nNote. There are many players saying that F.E.A.R.3. ruined the series, because there wasn't a lot of horror in it. But I liked F.E.A.R.3 better, because you could play with two characters and there is a co-op mode in it. Sure, the first game is more emotionally involving, but just a bit. It's not a big deal from me. And who gets scared by a video game anyway?","February 13, 2015","true","6.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Tinha achado legal pacaraio, mas com cenários meio repetitivos. Resolvi tirar a poeira do jogo e ir até o final e ver se minha visão do jogo mudava.\n\nAo contrário de jogos como Doom 3 e Half-Life 2, graficamente o jogo não envelheceu bem. A engine não é legal. Deus Ex 1 com Unreal Engine envelheceu melhor, e a sensação é que FEAR foi lançado em 2003, ou algo assim. Sombras duras e ambientes escuros demais te forçam a usar uma lanterna que ilumina só a curta distância. Sons ambientes são processados de forma estranha também, e o jogo no geral é bem silencioso.\n\nNa época ele competiu com Quake 4 e a grande vantagem dele, q deu toda a atenção, foi a Inteligencia Artificial. Ela é ♥♥♥♥. Ela faz bom uso do level design q em áreas de batalha possuem mais de um caminho, te deixando tenso sobre onde olhar, te forçando a jogar de forma mais tática. A IA é capaz de te flanquaer, pular catwalks, parapeitos e até janelas quebradas, usar cover e lean pra se proteger dos seus tiros enquanto atira, e as vezes só colocar o braço pra fora da cobertura pra atirar. ♥♥♥♥. Ainda to pra ver IA melhor em jogos FPS.\n\nCombate é dificil e você toma muito dano com pouco tiro, e o jogo equilibra colocando sempre muito medkit e armor em locais de combate. Isso meio que quebra a surpresa de certos combates pq vc passa numa área com esses itens e sabe q a coisa vai ficar preta. Eu preferiria que o jogo tivesse equilibrado melhor os danos e colocado menos medkit. Por outro lado, quando você passa de um combate e não precisa usar medkit nem repor seu armor você se sente ♥♥♥♥ e q sua tática foi boa.\n\nA história é interessante e ao mesmo tempo não. Eu não curto o quase plágio do filme O Chamado (q eu curto bastante) com a história da menina, mas no final das contas ela até q se desenvolve de forma interessante apesar de bem previsível. O jogo te dá uns sustos legítimos, principalmente nas expansões. Acho que tomei mais susto aqui do que no Outlast.\n\nLevel Design é bom, o q ajuda a IA a funcionar, pois áreas de combate geralmente tem dois caminhos. Mas o cenário se repete muito. Você passa muito tempo dentro de um prédio onde é tudo muito igual. Corredores, escritórios, copas, mais corredores, escritórios... Sem muita variedade. Nas expansões isso melhora muito.\n\nSobre as expansões: a primeira, Extraction Point, é continuação direta do jogo original, acaba sendo um pouco mais do mesmo, e prolonga um pouco a história do jogo que é meio curto. Foram 8hs pra terminar o original e mais 5 pra terminar a primeira expansão.\n\nA segunda, Perseus Mandate, é bem melhor e na minha opinião obrigatória jogar se você curte o jogo. É uma história paralela muito bem encaixada com o original, mostrando eventos sobre outro angulo. As vezes lembra um pouco Half-Life, q ele se esforça pra ser, mas não chega a tanto. Foram mais 8hs de jogo que valeram muito a pena. Além dos cenários variados, eles melhoraram um pouco o engine com o lance das sombras cruas, e aqui os ambientes são um pouco mais claros e a sombras mais suaves.\n\nSe você curte FPS e tiver o jogo empoeirado e não tiver terminado ainda, jogue, com as expansões. Se jogou o jogo original, jogue as expansões, pelo menos o Perseus Mandate.","January 2, 2015","true","7.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

And what I remember is a constant feeling of uneasiness. This game no frightens you, it gives you feeling of being misplaced. Like "what am I doing here?", "why again I'm all alone and should attack dozens of heavily-armored intelligent soldiers?". Or even "Why my mother is such a ♥♥♥♥♥?"\nSo, remembering all that uncomfortable stuff along with the point it is a railroaded FPS with stupid and logically inconsistent story... and it's not only railroaded, but keeps you in dark and narrow corridors of industrial premises... Usually it's pretty obvious for me at that point that the game is sucks.\n\nNot this one, though. Yeah, about it's story - the less you know, the better. Don't bother looking some evidences, or reading any briefing info - it's only make you more uncomprehending.\n\nIt's all about visuals and behavior of your enemies. About whom "story" tells you as of mindless puppets, controlling remotely by the main villain. Wrong point. Not only those soldiers acting together, like covering each other with fire and outmaneuvering you, skirting from different angles. They are, in fact, assess the situation and act correspondingly. They even show some emotions! Like answering "no way!" when they are few, and their commander urges them "Forward!".\n\nAnd for visuals part... I'm not into all that technological stuff about particles, shadows and so on. Usually. It is irrelevant for me basically. But there, in those narrow corridors of industrial premises - when I'm shoot and when I'm shooting at - I see clouds of dust and crumbs when bullets hit the walls, and it feels so realistic that I don't remember any of so praised FPS later, which gives you so natural experience from the middle of shootout.\n\nYou know, I've started this game to write a turning down review. I'm strongly not liking the game plot, its cutscenes, voices from the answering machines - all connected with the story. But the game mechanics in F.E.A.R. makes me retreat in awe. It is a masterpiece, which stands proudly above the endless railroaded FPS games like the Call of Duty series.\nYeah, multiplayer part of the F.E.A.R. is no more, so the only reason to buy the game now - is to feel how much plainer and stupid modern shooters are.\nBut it is well worth it's price. 7.5/10 (only for lack of decent story, gameplay is second to none).","July 26, 2015","true","22.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

The FPS part is super fun though. The weapons are brutal and the enemies work together to try and anahilate you. The game is hard at times but never unfair, it makes sure to never baby you and let you work things out yourself. The greatest thing about this game is probably the enemies, they shout out commands to their squad and their squad will respond in turn. If you try to ambush them and one hears you knock something over he'll tell the others, if one goes silent they'll go into search mode, if one gets pinned down or sees you flanking he'll tell the others and they will react in turn. People who like dark themes bordering on paranormal, tactical fps games, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up, or enjoy a good (but not too intense) scare will usually love this game. In other words most people will love this game.","October 12, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is F.E.A.R., an immersive first person action experience that makes you feel like a absolute badass... until 'she' appears.\n\nF.E.A.R. is set in the near future, around a spec ops group made for fighting paranormal threats known as the First Encounter Assault Recon (abbrieviated F.E.A.R.). Their Mission in the game is to eliminate a telepathic criminal called Paxton Fettel who is able to control an army of telepathy-controlled clone soldiers. You play as the F.E.A.R. group's Point Man, whom of which has very sharp reflexes, a major part of the gameplay (I'll talk about that soon). As you play through the game, you will discover some darker things in the story, and you will see that maybe Paxton and his army are not the only threat. At certain points of the game, you will see a little girl dressed in red. You will think, 'Who is this girl?, What does she want? Why is she around in a middle of a spec ops operation?'\n\nOne thing is for sure though: she aint a sweet little thing, after seeing what she does to your team at the near beginning of the game...\n\nF.E.A.R.'s story is wonderfully complex and dark, making you question what the hell is going on, and the twists and turns are great to see. And the ending was more than fitting for such a dark game.\n\nOne thing about F.E.A.R. is that, unlike many other FPS's, its a very moody game. The lighting is dark, the soundtrack and ambience is subtle and creepy, the camera suddenly gets some blurry filters now and then and you will usually find yourself isolated, all alone without the company of your allies from your radio or even your enemies. At certain points of the game, F.E.A.R breaks away from it's epic gunplay (I'll get to that later) and decides to give you little moments of isolated terror. As soon as you hear your radio emanate static, you will get the feeling of dread. At times like this, you may think you are all on your lonesome... but you will always get that feeling like something is watching you. Suddenly all sorts of bizzare things start to appear as you walk through the darkness, sometimes the scenery starts to change with no real warning. These typs of  cutscenes definately do not feel like filler and make the game feel more alive, not to mention are incredibly well made and its an awesome way to break away from the action and build up atmosphere. What's more, they get scarier and more surreal as the game progresses, and they are worth playing all the way through just to see the outcome.\n\nOK, now for gameplay. As you may already know, F.E.A.R. is a First Person Shooter, and it has a hell of a lot of trick up its sleeve. You are able to carry up to three weapons and there are three grenade types. Healthkits are avaliable too, but it's not like you pick one up and automatically get some health out of it. They have to be used manually, so you can heal yourself when you are in the midst of combat. Think of it as health regen, but more controllable. But what sets this game apart from many other FPS's is its niche: The Point Man's Reflexes. You have a small bar at the bottom of the screen which is to display how long you can use these reflexes. When you activate this, everything goes slow. Bullets become more visible, enemies slow down and your weapons fire with less recoil.\n\nYes, this is awesome.\n\nWhats more is that you will NEED to use this. The weapons in the game are so strong enemy soldiers will rip you up within seconds. Even pistols are deadly! Not to mention the AI itself is incredible, another one of F.E.A.R.'s strong points. The Three Weapon Limit may seem demeening at first, but as I already said, the weapons are powerful, and are made even better with the reflexes. If they gave the player the incentive to use the slo-mo without a three weapon restriction, the game may be too easy. Weapons range from a pistol (which can be dual wielded), submachine gun, assault rifle, precision rifle, nail gun, shotgun, a rather messy rail gun that can burn all the skin of a poor guy's body and tons more. Each weapon feels different and can be used for many situation and none of them are useless. Choosing which weapon to take with you isn't a question of "Which is a better weapon?" but of "Which weapon do I like more?" I myself kept the handguns with me all the way, because  I liked how strong and fast they were. What is also great is that you can carry three different grenade types at once, being Frag grenades, Proximity mines and Remote bombs. Althoguh they are limited in quantity, they can be devastating. The player can also Melee attack, which isn't limited to just hitting things with the stock of a gun; you can also slide kick and bicycle kick, plus Melee attacks can kill most enemies with one hit. Despite having only acress to three weapons, the player has enough options in combat anyway thanks to powerful and agile melee combat and the unique Slo-mo Reflex ability, allowing strategic play. Health Kits themselves are very plentiful  - a good thing since you will find yourself on low health very often. And aside from guns, grenades, and first aid kits there are also Upgrades to boost your health and reflexes, usually hidden in the levels. Collecting these is vital, as they will help you stand a chance in the more chaotic, intense fights. Exploring for secrets is something that Modern shooters barely ever do and, while FEAR isn't technically a Modern shooter, it shows that such a thing can work as a rewarding element in a shooter. The level design itself it fantastic, with wide open areas providong some badass slo-mo run n' gun action as well as some really tight corridors with numerous routes of approach and things for the player and the enemy AI to hide behind. I think I should emphasise a bit more on the enemy AI: It can asses the situation, try to flush you out, flank you, stick fighting defensively when it can and soldiers can synergise incredibly well, keeping close to each other and backing each other up. It made me feel like I was actually fighting well trained soldiers. Combine powerful weapons, abilities with great potential, threatening enemies and grand level design and you can get some beautifully orchastrated gunfights... possibly some of the best ever.\n\nGraphicly the game is... slightly dated? The game looked the part for its time, but I don't think the textures look as great as they used to be. But hell there are a load of other noteworthy things about the graphics. The character models are terrific and FEAR has to have some of the best particle effects I have ever seen in a game. Effects during the more atmospheric scenes are impresive too, such as sudden transitions to different places.\n\nI'll further emphasise in the audio: the game sounds incredible. The loud volume of the guns complement their power, the voiceacting is stellar, the sountrack ranges from gritty and action packed tracks to more forboading, subtle ambient tracks which suit the mood and atmosphere for the game perfectly. And the ambience is incredible, especially during those atmospheric scenes.\n\nJust so anyone reading this knows, if you buy F.E.A.R. from Steam, you will get its expansion games, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for free! Both of which offer some neat new weapons and enemies and are both great.\n\nF.E.A.R. sadly isn't a perfect game. While the level design is great, it seems to be a bit... linear. Through most of the game you seem to be going in one direction which can be a bit mind numbingly dull at times, but when it's during the more creepy scenes of the game it fits well though, as if you are taking a ghost train ride.\n\nOverall F.E.A.R is a well written, heart pounding shooter that knows how to balance it's incredible action segments with it's more disturbing and atmospheric moments. Highly recommended for gamers looking for something that rewards skill with thrills.","August 7, 2014","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The player also has access to a skill called "reflexes" which allows the player to effectively slow down time to either initiate an assault on a fortified position, allow an escape from a dangerous situation or to simply take in the hilarious ragdolls from a dated engine. Exploration of the maps gives the player opportunities to find boosters to increase their max health and the size of their reflex bar, making them a greater threat to their enemies.\nF.E.A.R.'s gore system, given the game's age, is very impressive and hardly any games I've seen recently come close to comparing to it. From simply dismembering enemies by shooting off limbs/heads to reducing them to red mist or a charred skeleton to even sawing them clean in half with a mothertrucking shotgun. Not many games I've seen can allow you to turn your enemies into a red puddle by blasting them point-blank with a buckshot. SMOD is the only other game I can think of, and it's only a mod for Half-Life 2.\nEnemies in the game start off as the tried and true generic gas-mask soldier, the likes of which have been seen in other games like Half-Life 2 and Mass Effect 3. As the player progresses new enemies are added to the mix, forcing the player to adapt their strategies and keep the experience fresh. You might be doing an amazing push when suddenly a heavily armored tank soldier wielding a rocket launcher comes at you, forcing you to fall back and lay the path with grenades. Or a group of invisible ninja-esque soldiers can appear forcing you to go on the defensive.\nThe game's story I must admit leaves a bit to be admired, the characters feel two-dimensional and are difficult to care about, and the player will often find themselves annoyed by the slow-paced Alma scare scenes meant to advance the story. But if you have the capacity to pay attention to the story then at the end of the credits you'll be rewarded with a twist and a cliffhanger for the sequel.\nF.E.A.R. also suffers from some irritating bugs caused by all the recent updates to Steam's UI. By simply holding down the W key, Steam takes a screenshot every 2.5 seconds, resulting in a flooded screenshots folder than needs to be cleared out regularilty. It's like playing Pokemon Snap on the N64 with the A button taped down.\nIn conclusion, despite it's software compatability hiccups and it's forgettable storyline, F.E.A.R.'s gameplay is unique and highly enjoyable. If you have the capacity to work around the screenshot bug then I definately recommend this game.","June 14, 2013","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrizSteam/recommended/21090/","FrizSteam","Friz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrizSteam/","203 products in account","One of my favorite FPS games that I have ever played. It is a horror game, so expect a lot of gore, creepy moments, and jumpscares. The combat in this game feels and looks amazing. You have a slow motion ability that gives you the edge on your enemies. It makes the gunfights look very cool when you have bullets whizzing by your head and you are running up to things to deliver a shotgun blast into them and they explode into pieces. The grenade effects are one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in a game. When they explode (especially in slow motion), the particle effects from the blast look awesome. Try throwing them in a group of enemies with lots of destroyable objects around them and watch the eye candy.\n\nThe A.I. in this game is one of the best ever created. Your opponents will be constantly calling out different tactics to deal with you and then executing them in the middle of a gunfight with you. They constantly try to flank you, send multiple formations at you, throw grenades at you behind cover, and lots of other methods. Good thing you have that slow motion ability to deal with them.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game is that it is a corridor shooter. You run through a lot of enclosed areas and a most of them are the same thing over and over while going through the storyline. The 'scary' moments are a hit or miss for people. I think it did a great job for the time that it came out in delivering a scary experience. Even after playing through the game multiple times, that 'ladder scene' still gets me every single time!\n\nThe main game is about 8 hours long, depending on how much you explore and listen to the audio recordings scattered throughout the levels. The Extraction Point DLC is worth getting too. It's about a 4 hour long DLC, that continues where this game left off. It still has all the great elements that made the main game so good. The only other thing I will say about it is, Holiday didn't deserve that :( Avoid the other DLC. It's terrible.","January 27, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game. I played the retail version back in March 2008 and it is really enjoyable with a great balance of suspense/horror and the stylized firefights. As I had done with World in Conflict, the Steam version of F.E.A.R is another great collection to the Steam library. The storyline in the game is rather mediocre, but who cares. Solid gameplay hours of 12-15 hours with highlighted horror and "John Woo" killing signatures shine out the most to any gamer. In most honesty, this game (aka the first F.E.A.R) is actually the best out of the trilogy. This is a must buy to anybody who never brought it before.

I had fond memories of the game and thought it time to revisit it. I’m glad I did. The game has a wonderfully spooky and tense atmosphere and outdoes many more recent titles in this respect (it still startled me on several occasions). The graphics are pretty good given the game’s age. It comes from the era when FPSs were commonly set in research facilities, abandoned factories, and office buildings, and this lack of diversity in the environments is one of the game’s weaknesses. As is the lack of humour -- there are no laughs here. But the game’s strengths lie in the atmosphere and in the combat. There is a palpable sense of apprehension as you sneak along the corridors under the flickering lights. The AI is crafty and the combat is always fun, especially when using the slo-mo, or bullet-time, ability, which is flawlessly implemented. If you like a good old-fashioned FPS with loads of atmosphere and plenty of exhilarating combat you can’t go far wrong with this classic.\n4/5","March 15, 2015","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I remember back in 2005 getting my brand new PC with an AMD FX-57 CPU(Which I won in a competition), Dual Nvidia 7600GTs and 2GB of RAM. I was on a lull with PC gaming between 2000 - 2005 because I wasnt old enough to get a job and my Dad who was always into PCs for flight simulators he tended to have the latest and greatest hardware of the time but then lost interest in PCs so he wasnt really willing to keep upgrading.\n\nAfter I got the money for a new PC this was one of the first games I got with it and almost instantly I feel in love with it. It reminded me of the old 90s shooters I would play, it was fast, looked good, sounded good, guns felt great to fire and it was fun. Admittedly the game is showing its age but the gun fights are still vicious, the sound design is still top notch and the AI is alot smarter than most AI in more modern shooters.\n\nIt's an outstanding game that is up there with the FPS greats like Duke 3D, Half Life, Quake etc. It's a shame the later games went for more mass appeal and were terrible in comparison to this, the later games lost everything that the first game done so well.\n\nYou don't get shooters like this any more and if you love shooters and horror then get this game.","June 27, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The problem is that Fettel contains special psychic abilities that allows him to control an army of super soldiers called replicas. From there you are left to discover the dark secret behind the PMC Armacham and the truth behind Pointman.\n\nThere are a large variety of guns to chose, from the traditional assault rifle to a more futuristic sniper rifle that burns the flesh off of an enemy. Pointman has the power to use "bullet-time" that adds a whole new layer to the game as you use to flank enemies or even shoot your own grenades out of the air. The AI is extremely smart and makes it a real challenge on higher difficulties.\n\nThe biggest draw of F.E.A.R is, well, fear. The game is very scary and instead of cheap jumpscares, the game takes the approach of a more psychological horror game. Even after playing the game over and over again, I still get chills every time something happens.\n\nAmazing story, outstanding gameplay, and the best horror experience since Silent Hill 2, F.E.A.R is a must have game.

F.E.A.R, a first person shooter, was by no means the first game to mix horror with action, but it was released to considerable hype and acclaim. When I play games like this, it is for the atmosphere and story, but would I get it?\n\nArmacham Corporation, the creators of a small army of psychically controlled soldiers. The intended commander, the unhinged Paxton Fettel, has gone rogue. The First Encounter Assault Recon team, a special forces group that deals with the paranormal, is sent in to kill Fettel and end his control over the soldiers. But as the new Point Man of F.E.A.R delves deeper and deeper into the mystery, they’ll soon uncover the sins of the past that Armacham are trying to cover up. Sins that link Fettel, the Point Man, and a mysterious girl called Alma Wade…\n\nI like games with a good story, and the one in F.E.A.R is enjoyable. It’s not quite as involving or as in-depth as, say, Alan Wake, and a lot of the background and story elements are easily missed, being in overt but optional phone messages and laptops you can find out more from. A few of the characters, particular Mapes and Alice, are somewhat irritating and, in the case of the latter, hard to get much sympathy for that is badly needed. But it’s still good for what it is, and genuinely unsettling.\n\nThe graphics probably were top of the line back when this was released, and while there are some minor problems here and there, it’s quite good. The character models for many of the NPCs don’t look as good as many latest ones, but the graphics overall contribute well to the atmosphere, and it’s clear that this is where much of the massive 17 Gigabyte download went.\n\nSound-wise, well, it’s fine enough. The normal music isn’t particularly noteworthy, doing the job that it does. So too does the voice acting, though that is somewhat better. However, the eerie sound effects, and the stings that they have, do help add to the atmosphere of the game immensely.\n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint is about the gameplay. It’s a very short game, which I finished in 7 hours, and a lot of the FPS action is repetitive and tedious. The restriction to 3 weapons, particularly in situations where you need more than one heavy weapon, is a pain in the posterior, and there’s a distinct lack of variety in enemies. The slo-mo mechanic does help with the gameplay, but it also feels like it is barely beyond a gimmick. A few of the weapons are fun, if you have a sadistic streak. There’s a stake-firing gun that allows you to pin enemies to walls like butterflies in a collection, and there’s a death-ray that makes me feel like a Dalek. But ultimately, I was left wanting more, and not from the expansion packs.\n\nOverall, F.E.A.R was enjoyable enough. I may one day peruse the immediate sequel (rather than the expansion packs), but for now, I’m done with this game.\n\nRATING: ***½\n","May 31, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zwagoth/recommended/21090/","Zwagoth","Zwagoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zwagoth/","239 products in account","I must have played this game fifteen times now and I still enjoy it every time I play it. The combat is tight, the sound is top notch, the guns feel powerful and are fun to use, and the AI gives you a nice challenge. This review is for single player only, because gamespy no longer exists, and you cannot play the multiplayer section of the game anymore.\n\nI'm going to split this up into a few distinct sections because there is a lot to talk about in this game.\n\nThe game came out right when first person shooters were getting popular again, and it shows heavily in the design. There are obvious influences of Half-Life 2, Doom 3 and Halo/Halo 2 across the board, but it manages to combine some of the better aspects of each of these games together into a cohesive product. You have limited weapon slots and health kits, but it takes the route of giving you slow motion and allowing you to store the health kits to modernize the gameplay aspects.\n\nThe graphics style and technology has aged fairly well, and has a distinct "Doom 3" look to it with sharp shadows, dark environments and fairly rough polygonal models, but still manages to capture what the developers were going for. Texture resolution is fairly good, and there are a lot of fine details that you can pull in if you look around. I really love the bullet decals and the way they utilized parallax mapping to make it look like chunks of the wall are missing. It comes out very natural.\n\nThe environments are not very varied and it shows that the engine was not well optimized with open areas, leading to the feeling of wandering through endless corridors without much variety. They tried to spice things up by changing locations every so often, but this is one of the bigger complaints you'll find with the game. Most of the events take place inside warehouses, office buildings, and the occasional "sewer".\n\nThe sound in this game is top notch. Weapon sounds are sharp and booming, and compliment the visual look of the weapons perfectly. Enemies and allies are all well voice acted and have a large number of lines they can pick from situationally. The music is well produced and compliments the scenes taking place within the game, leaving you immersed but helping to hype you up for what is going on. The environmental effects fit well, and none of the sounds stand out as feeling off or out of place. Even the spooky scary sounds have their place, and feel well integrated. Monolith has always excelled here and this game is no exception.\n\nThe weapons are fun to use and feel powerful, both in your hands and in those of the enemies. The shotgun is easily one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in a game in a long time, capable of literally blowing people to a fine mist at close range, and cutting them into chunks at moderate range. The penetrator shoots massive metal spikes that will nail people to walls in the most insane poses. There are also akimbo pistols.\n\nCombat is intense and thrilling, and when combined with the startlingly good AI and the slow motion it just comes with you feeling like a bad ♥♥♥, while still being challenging and fun. The developers said they wanted it to feel like the opening scene to Hard Boiled, and they were 100% successful, sparks, dust and debris everywhere. With how reactive and varied the AI can be during a fight you get a decent amount of variety out of the fights.\n\nThe game has fairly good pacing, and a reasonable difficulty curve with various little spikes of difficulty scattered through to keep things interesting. Monolith knew that combat wasn't interesting if it was all you did, and so added in a bit of exploration and toned back sections to let you recover from the high intensity fighting. The game expects you to begin using your weapons more effectively, and to use the tactics you've learned and the environments to your advantage, so you never feel like things quite settle down.\n\nI want to give the AI in this game a special mention, because it is particularly well done. Combining a dynamic squad system, flanking tactics and staggered reload pinning techniques, the AI is surprisingly lifelike. It has a fairly advanced sense system, and the individual enemies have a brain of information they retain and can share using verbal call outs, and will often react to stale information in surprisingly realistic ways. Each enemy can be scared, demoralized and manipulated, leading to unique behaviors. The only problem with this is that combat is typically too short to see a lot of this behavior emerge unless you are at a higher difficulty level. It shows that the developer put a lot of love into the AI.\n\nThis game is supposed to be scary, or maybe just creepy, and it is usually successful on the first play through. With a clever combination of supernatural powers, disturbing imagery, jump scares and sound hits, you're kept on edge. The sometimes predictable scares lose their impact as the game goes on,, but there is still plenty to love about the game even without this aspect. If you absolutely hate scary games, this is not for you.\n\nI strongly suggest that you at least give the game a try if you enjoyed one of the games that helped to shape this game(Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Halo). For the price, it's hard to go wrong. If on sale, it's even harder to go wrong!\n\nP.S. The expansion packs for this game will likely leave you wondering where the magic went. They don't have the same polish or enjoyment factor. The review is focused on the main game only.","February 22, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not because they scare the $%!& out of me, but because they never can, and watching a horror movie without the horror makes it either a great comedy or a great bore to me.

F.E.A.R. takes all those classic/overused tropes and elements of both horror and action movies and utilizes them so perfectly that it achieves a constant state of "unpredictable predictability", catching you off-guard at the absolute perfect moments while driving you insane when nothing happens while you're on your guard.\nThe pacing, the plot progression, the combat, the scares, the theming, the levels, and the atmosphere (ESPECIALLY THE ATMOSPHERE) are all so excellently designed that it somehow manages to brilliantly encapsulate you in the moment; you'll find yourself acting and reacting like you would in a similar real-life scenario. And at times, when scares and combat sequences play out just right, it genuinely feels like you're playing through the perfect action/horror movie. I could go on and on but I'll end here by saying this: It's one HELL of a joyride from start to finish. The first F.E.A.R. is a diamond in the rough that deserves far more fame than some other games of yore...\n","August 6, 2013","true","11.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Honeslty for a game made in 2006 it still blows the ♥♥♥♥ out of some franchises *looks at Call of Duty*. The visuals are meh since this is old. However the physics and lighting are quite impressive even today. The audio is also excellently done. What really impresses me is the AI. It takes cover. Makes cover. Actually has good movement through the different levels. It EVEN flanks you.\nI wish another developer would come along and say "This is a wonderful implementation and a great engine." "Lets take this and update it and put it in our game." Quite frankly shooters of today are generally terrible. If developers would stop copying Call of Duty and make thier own game. The genre as a whole could only benefit. I've seen shooters since the days of Quake and Halo. I'm tired of seeing this genre ♥♥♥♥♥ed on by lazy developers.

I remember back in 2005 getting my brand new PC with an AMD FX-57 CPU(Which I won in a competition), Dual Nvidia 7600GTs and 2GB of RAM. I was on a lull with PC gaming between 2000 - 2005 because I wasnt old enough to get a job and my Dad who was always into PCs for flight simulators he tended to have the latest and greatest hardware of the time but then lost interest in PCs so he wasnt really willing to keep upgrading.\n\nAfter I got the money for a new PC this was one of the first games I got with it and almost instantly I feel in love with it. It reminded me of the old 90s shooters I would play, it was fast, looked good, sounded good, guns felt great to fire and it was fun. Admittedly the game is showing its age but the gun fights are still vicious, the sound design is still top notch and the AI is alot smarter than most AI in more modern shooters.\n\nIt's an outstanding game that is up there with the FPS greats like Duke 3D, Half Life, Quake etc. It's a shame the later games went for more mass appeal and were terrible in comparison to this, the later games lost everything that the first game done so well.\n\nYou don't get shooters like this any more and if you love shooters and horror then get this game.","June 27, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(subsequently just called FEAR) is a horror game, which is not quite right. The term which I find most appropriate to describe FEAR would be "a military themed sci-fi/horror FPS".\n\nFEAR and its two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, stand at the pinnacle of the FPS genre. Admittedly, FEAR lacks some variety in environment and enemy design. You'll spend most of your time shooting at enemy soldiers in offices and warehouses. But what FEAR is weak at is easily overshadowed by what it is good at, because everything else about this game is just so good.\n\nThe game takes a serious and realistic approach with a tight atmosphere, and is consistent with it. At one time, it handles like a military shooter where you fight against enemy squads, and at other times you'll be stuck in nightmarishly visions or surrounded by supernatural beings, which is done so well that it never really feels out of place.\n\nAll the weapons sound and feel amazing. From the dual pistols, which are a lot stronger than they look, to the futuristic Particle Weapon and Repeating Cannon, there's not a single weapon that is boring or not fun to use. The shotgun is one of the best in history of computer games.\n\nThe enemies aren't that rich in variety, but make it up with their behaviour. For a major part of the game, you'll battle the Replica Soldiers. Even now, 11 years after release, FEAR is heralded as the game with the best artifical intelligence thanks to these guys. They can crouch through tight spots, jump through windows and move furniture to use as cover, not as part of scripted events, but as their natural behaviour. Replay one particular fight, and it will never turn out the same way. These guys are just so much fun to fight. What's more is that you can really see and feel how your attacks affect them. Shooting a soldier will make him stumble and throw off his aim, while nearby explosions will throw enemies off their feet and may knock them down. Replica Soldiers' behaviour, actions and reactions make them incredibly satisfying to fight.\n\nThe level design doesn't offer much varied environments either. Yet it's incredibly well done with love to the detail. You will almost always have multiple ways to reach certain places. You can run along a corridor and take enemies head on, or crouch through the vent and ambush them from behind. Despite spending a lot of time in offices and warehouses, you'll still visit some amazing and incredibly atmospheric places, especially in the expansions. A futuristic cloning facility here, a creepy hospital there, these places are memorable and well crafted.\n\nWhen you're not fighting enemy squads, you're usually in the horror part of the level. Sometimes you'll experience this through some kind of dreams or visions sent to you by Alma, who acts as the main antagonistic force in this game. Other times you have to fend off otherworldly beings that appear through portals. FEAR offers frequent jumpscares as well as drawn out segments with tight and creepy atmosphere.\n\nBoth expansions are outstanding. Extraction Point is essentially more of the same, while Perseus Mandate cuts back somewhat on the horror parts while giving you more heated firefights in return.\n\nFEAR and its two expansions represent some of the best the FPS genre has to offer, and easily make it into the top 5 best singleplayer FPS ever made. It is a must-have for anyone interested in the genre.","January 12","true","19.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Я даже признаю, что врагам часто удавалось меня обхитрить.\nПротивники переговариваются между собой, что одновремнно делает их более живыми и облегчает игру.\nПули - не лазеры, как, например, в CS:GO (первое, что в голову пришло). Они действительно летят, и от них можно увернуться в SlowMo.\nРефлексы (режим SlowMo) позволяют слоупокам типа меня мгновенно убить всех в комнате. Звучит это не так круто, как чувствуется в игре.\nГрафон намного лучше, чем можно ожидать от игр 2005 года. Ну серьёзно, я офигевал от графона, когда впервые запустил игру.\nИдеальная совместимость с Windows 10.Конечно же, есть и плохая сторона. Но я её не нашёл. Может только то, что игра короткая.

Overall fun A.I, the story is best in this Fear, finding the recorded messages also adds more depth, the scares are 50/50, it depends on the kind of person, you either really freak out to jumpscares or not, the game is more creepy than full horror, i guess psychological, regardless if its your first time playing it, you will feel the atmosphere creep you out despite the repetitive levels, the shadow play in this game is fairly decent. I'd definitely recommend this game when on sale, this one and its sequel which is not quite as good as the first but still decent are fair enough games to have a good time if what you are seeking is a single player game, i can't speak much for fear 3 as to me that game is honestly far worse than its predecessors in my opinion.","December 26, 2015","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the game's visuals have dated horrendously, it's overall gameplay has aged incredibly well. There's also a unique blend of action and horror on display in the game's narrative, balancing and even mixing both effectively and memorably. The game's action is brutal and relentless, though thankfully, the game's frenetic, lengthy, and heavily stylized firefights are broken up by short breather sections in-between, so the action never feels tiring. It also never becomes repetetive. Also, fear is the name of the game, both literally and figuratively, and the game features high amounts of genuine creepiness before, after, and even during it's insane action sequences. In fact, the game seems to pay homage to Japanese horror with it's atmosphere and it's chief antagonist resembling Samara from "The Ring." And thankfully, the game's creepiness relies more on the building of atmosphere instead of cheap "jump" scares, though, admittedly, whatever of these scares there are in the game are very well-timed.\n\nOverall, F.E.A.R. boasts a unique blend of action and horror that combines seamlessly and effortlessly into one unique and memorable package that still delivers.\n\n9/10","February 24","true","21.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story and the gameplay is just fantastic. Ive really enjoyed playing  F.E.A.R and its stand-alone expansion packs.  I love it when you can dive in these action scenes  and finish off  the replica soldiers, mercs, nightcrawlers etc in style, as if you are a well-trained supersoldier.  For a fairly old game it does have clever enemies. For instance  if the enemies  see you they scatter arround the place. Some enemies find cover and try to flush you out or keep you pinned down  so that others try to flank you.\n\nThen you have this horror-movie like atmosphere in these games where you enter a bloody building and you dont know who or what is waiting for you around the corner on every floor.  To be honest i didnt feel like  F.E.A.R and  F.E.A.R Extraction point was scary.  F.E.A.R Perseus mandate did have a pretty good scary atmosphere and there were a  few parts in it that scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me, like for instance one time when i was  loading stuff in to my inventory and I didnt realize that something was waiting behind me for me to turn around.\n\nIve spotted two minor issues but they are not so critical or anything. When you enter a scene and intense audio sound starts to play, this gives the player the signal that there is going to be a battle. when you win the battle the intense audio keeps playing and this is kinda confusing because it gives me the idea that there are some additional enemies who are going to barge in any moment when there arent any. The intense audio sound stops when you enter a diffrent area and this issue happend only a few times in the games.\nThe second small issue is , there was one time when the game is done loading  the next level, it knocked me back to the main menu with an message "server disconnected". I dont know why it did that but this happend in my experience only once in the games extraction point and perseus mandate. Luckily you can bypass this problem by lowering your game settings and re-configure them back when the next level is loaded.\n\nLike i said before F.E.A.R. and its stand-alone expansion packs are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Its worth the money and  im glad i have them in my library.\n\n","January 17","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The shooting feels tight, the slo-mo is oh-so satisfying to use, the guns feel like they have incredible punch to them, and everything gets destroyed. Just about everything in the game either has crazy physics or emits a particle effect when hit, so entire building floors become decimated as you work your way through the game. The A.I. employed by the enemies is miles above most modern FPS games. Fights end up feeling so dynamic that repeat playthroughs just to see "what if I do this..." are highly encouraged.\n\nNot everything is perfect; environments and enemies lack visual and mechanical variety, some of the in-game textures and artwork are clearly stuck in 2005, and I found the environments a bit confusing to navigate at times. Regardless of these complaints, F.E.A.R. is something everyone should experience at some point.","February 29","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is thanks to weapons that feel and sound impactful while also being incredibly fun to use; combined with the numerous amount of visual effects, an ideal bullet time feature and a satiating gore system to provide gleeful carnage of the highest calibre. The horror elements mesh with the rest of the game quite fittingly and serve up a few intense moments. Sadly, it isn't without its faults, mowing down droves of the exact same enemy type through excruciatingly dull and repetitive environments is an effective way to deafen the positive notes of your game.\n\nAs for the expansion packs, they are monotonous and unimaginative, only recommended for hard-core F.E.A.R. fans.\n\n7/10","March 8","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It's almost the perfect shooter really if it wasn't for interval 11 and the tedium of shooting the waves of paranormal crossing over during your escape. Despite the shortcomings which are few, this is the best gameplay in a first person shooter I've played.  It all just feels so great and really does make you feel like "a god among men" as Harlan Wade put it to Pointman. All of the guns feel powerful the way they impact the enemies and the enviroment which coupled with the amazing sound design of them leads to firefights that leave you feeling like a complete bad ♥♥♥ looking over the carnage you just inflicted. The game gets a lot of praise for its ai and rightfully so as the enemies reactions are always impressive as long as you give them time to react before killing them. I especially like how they might be taking cover from you and one shouts out that he's in cover then another replicant will tell him to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up. Also really like how F.E.A.R. has an explanation for why there are so many bad guys to kill. I know it's just a video game but it always bugs me anyway when a game prided on its narrative just throws random bad guys at you (Uncharted). It's especially cool in this game considering the replicant forces context. Speaking of the narrative I think F.E.A.R. has a very interesting one and all it's just a little weird that your team was formed to combat the paranormal and supernatural and yet every time Fettel's signal disapears nobody knows whats up or the Armacham problem is written off at first as a "gas leak" not expected paranormal activity but when you find delta force teams flayed corpses nobody bats an eye. Still the story is properly spooky and keeps the ball rolling. Again shortcomings aside this is one of my favorite shooters. Probably my favorite shooter of the last generation and some might argue the best. I cant recommend it enough.","October 26, 2015","true","12.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

If you are isolated and cannot predict what is around a corner, there will be suspenseful music. Otherwise, a fierce firefight will make your blood pump faster and the music won't disappoint.\n\nThe A.I. for the enemies, specifically the Replica forces, will not bore you. They are unpredicatable and vicious for they only serve to complete the main antagonist of the game. In other words, the movement of the Replicas are well coordinated and they tend to flank. In harder difficulties, their attacks are more devastating thus forcing you to avoid confronting more than a couple of these soldiers. Each Replica unit is unique and I find most of their voices, interactions with their squad and the given environment, and the way they assess threats very realistic.\n\nThere are a ton of weapons , ranging from the usualy pistol and shotgun, to a futuristic particle weapon that can sear the flesh off a living being.\n\nThanks to "Slow-mo', the one ability in this game that makes a difference, F.E.A.R. allows you to see your inflicted destruction on targets in a "beautiful" way. This is what gives you the ultimate power over your enemies.\n\nAlthough I do like this game, its existence is not without cons unfortunately. F.E.A.R. was heavily focused on action and left other parts of the game underdevelopd.\n\nThe plot is scarcely detailed and relies too much on listening to mundane laptops , voice mails, and some news reports. These are easily skipped and it's a waste of time to listen to them.\n\nOverall, most of the characters are forgettable and they don't have that much interaction with each other.\n\nSome of the transitions between suspense, horror, and action seem quite "choppy". In greater detail, if you leave an area after a fight, you're almost immediately pulled into a terrifying scene. This will make a lot of players more confused than scared.\n\nAs for the expansion packs, they are acceptable to play. Be warned though, that Extraction Point is more horror oriented, has more jumpscares, and the plot is even thinner. After playing it for a while, you will lose your interest if you favor action. On the other hand, Perseus Mandate seems like a ripoff of F.E.A.R. and its aforementioned expansion pack. There may be some new enemies, weapons, and 3 "bonus missions" that can test your skill but this game will leave you more upset if you're a loyal fan. In my case, the most hated part of the game for me was the music.

Your opponents, the Replicant soldiers created by Armachan and the Armachan private army both have excellent AI. They behave very intelligently under the circumstances and coordinate well as squads.\n\nThe storyline engrossed me completely even though it wasn't deep. It was disturbing, dark, and thrilling as you put together the picture. Overall the game feels satisfying. There's nothing quite as satisfying as ambushing an enemy squad then while in slow-motion wipe them all out in less then a second (in game time).\n\nMost surprisingly the graphics hold up better than its sequel, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. Now nearly 10 years after its original release F.E.A.R.'s graphics are visually interesting and highly functional. The enemy units come in variety and all are fascinating to look at. The sequel's graphics while most advanced are simply dull and remind one of Call of Duty.\n\nUltimately, I recommend this to any member of the gaming community to play. Be wary of the sequels, they are unimpressive but fun at best. They're downright terrible if you want more of the original flavor.","November 22, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The levels in the first half are samey, featuring dull and bland-looking industrial environments that aren't helped by its aged graphics. Mission objectives are uninspired. The scares wear off quickly, especially when they happen while you're looking in the wrong direction. Story is meh. Frankly, the only positive thing about the game is the combat, and the combat alone is what makes this game a classic. Bloody combat, vicious weapons, impressive enemy AI and cool visual effects make each battle an event to look forward to. Include the slow-mo ability and the battles become a thing of beauty: Grenade distortions rippling through the air, the vicious "thump, thump, thump" of your assault rifle, enemies dying in glorious sprays of blood, seeing a Replica sailing stylishly through the air after receiving a flying kick...\nIn short, F.E.A.R. has some of the most impressive FPS combat ever, and you should definitely experience it.","November 23, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For nothing.\n\n(If you're too lazy to read this review, just buy the game).\n\nFEAR is a first-person shooter game that swaps between throwing baddies with guns at you, to throwing a scary little girl and some really frightening hallucinations at you. This game made me deathly afraid of ladders for the entire playthrough, from just one hallucination early on.\n\nBasically, the story is a little goofy and feels goofier when all the characters take it so seriously, but you are a member of the "First Encounter Assault Recon" task squad (nevermind that Assault and Recon are two entirely different things) and are assigned with bringing down a man named Paxton Fettel, who is a psychic commander to a secret clone army (I said it was goofy) and out of nowhere an evil little girl ghostie-goo is haunting you and killing people. Despite it's goofiness, the story gets better as it goes, and ends up becoming really awesome.\n\nThe gameplay is broken into segments of exploration and light puzzle solving, to crazy fun combat, and getting the poop scared out of you by the mysterious ghostie girl. The exploration and puzzles aren't really anything new, if you've played Half-Life 2 it's like that, but with none of those dumb see-saw puzzles. The scary moments are, well, scary and well done, however they begin to get a little predictable near the end of the game, but for the first 70% of the game people will disintegrate around you, you'll be teleported to different locations, and the little girl will try to kill you, and you'll be scared. Not horrified, but scared and probably asking, "What the #@^%$?," multiplie times. Where the game truly shines though is in it's combat. The combat is fast paced and brutal, and bullets tear chunks out of walls and objects and spray particles into the air. A simple office shootout becomes mayhem as dust fills the air as shrapnel flies off walls, computers explode in bright flashes of light, and paper flutters around the air as enemies hunt for any sign of you, whether it's your flashlight or a sound you make in game. And these enemies are smart, they have the best AI I've seen in a game. They constantly hunt you down, flanking and calling orders to each other, quickly detecting you if you get to close  to their field of vision, spot your flashlight, call for reinforcements. This makes it feel like you're fighting a true army of highly trained soldiers and makes the combat shine, as each individual fight will play out completely different ways each time you play. You also have a bullet-time feature which you can trigger whenever you'd like, and it turns any combat situation into the lobby scene from The Matrix. Bullets cut through the air, leaving little ripples behind them, dust slowly explodes from damaged walls as you and your enemies shoot and jump kick each other to death in slow-motion. It's incredibly fun, and gives you the killers edge you need against the intelligent AI, and also ties into the story nicely.\n\nThe game was a real blast to play through, and when things become a little too boring it introduces new things, such as hallucinations that will try and kill you, or invisible, wall climbing ninjas that will make you jump and scream and spray your bullets wildly. When these newer features get old (the ninjas never do, there were too few of them actually), the game gives you one of the best video game finales you will ever see.\n\nI rate this game a 5 for Amazeballs, it is the highest rating I can give, and it means you should buy it like right now. I'm waiting. No seriously, stop fooling around. Buy it.","December 11, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a lot of things to love about this game but the thing that still stands out is the AI. Sure, it’s all smoke and mirrors but it does a decent job of creating the illusion that you are fighting actual people who would like to survive their encounters with you. This illusion is maintained through little details like how enemy troops panic when you lob a grenade at their feet, or push over tables to make improvised cover, and travel through adjourning rooms in an attempt to flank you.

F.E.A.R at first glance looks fairly standard shooter fair and for the most part it is. However it's a well made standard shooter with the shooting feeling pretty solid. Also the slow-motion reflex ability greatly enhances the fun of the game, however some people may find issue with it as there's an over reliance on this mechanic. Only a handful of times did I engage enemies without the slo-motion ability and that was due to not being able to wait for it to recharge.  The AI stands out as being rather intelligible compared to other shooters as they try to flank you, flush you out and navigate cover fairly well. Whilst the horror elements are fairly nice and creepy, they don't really elevate beyond that and never really become scary. Also the level design is bland and uninspired with the majority of the game being set in either a warehouse or an office area. But overcome it's shortcomings and you can enjoy it as a solid and fun first person shooter.","December 19, 2011","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story evolves around a member of First Encounter Assault Recon (which has to be one of the most forced acronyms on video game history) who is pursuing a guy called Paxton Fettel who is being a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and commanding cloned super soldiers to kill people through telepathic abilities.\n\nFEAR really plays like 'Hollywood Shootout: The Game'. Everything that is shot seems to break, or take a ridiculous amount of damage, and the player has the ability to use slow motion. This really feels awesome, and makes every shoot out feel badass.\n\nAlso helping the gunplay is the AI. The AI is willing to flank, retreat, throw grenades, and even just push your position. What most modern game AI can't seem to do on hard, these guys can breeze through on normal difficulty. This game is at least challenging which is a great change from most games of today. You also tend to only take on squads of 3-4 at a time, and this really works. The combat is challenging without relying on having a bunch of dudes bum-rush you.\n\nWeapons all feel good. You've got the standard assault rifle, SMG and pistol. The shotgun is gutsy as hell and will tear things up. You also get the penetrator, which is like a slow, powerful assault rifle, a burst firing scoped rifle, a particle rifle which can strip the flesh from most enemies in one hit (basically acting as a sniper rifle), an automatic cannon, and a burst firing rocket launcher. Some of these later weapons don't have a lot of ammo around, which is a shame as they are fun as hell to use.\n\nMy biggest gripe about this game is the horror. It's honestly not scary, it's just annoying. A little girl staring at you is only a little spooky to begin with. Eventually I found myself just wanting to skip the flashbacks and wanting to kill guys again. The game is also quite repetitive with it's environments, but the firefights are so good that I honestly wasn't too bothered by it.\n\nThe base game is easily worth $10. I'd give it an 8/10.","June 30, 2014","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The normal points of critique are not really where FEAR excels. The graphics aren't spectacular, even for their age (though there are about a billion particle effects), character facial models look like they're made of clay.  The level design isn't particularly inspired, mostly taking place in industrial complexes or office environments.  There are generally side-paths you can take to locate goodies or flank enemies, but it isn't as open as, say, Crysis.  Bullet time is well-implemented and something of a necessity to deal with the rather intelligent enemy AI, but it's nothing new.  The horror mostly amounts to jump scares, though there are some tense moments (and disturbing ones, for the faint of heart).  The story is pretty cheesey, and is really nothing more than an excuse for the rather bizarre collection of sci-fi elements: clone supersoldiers, psychics, reflex-induced bullet time, guns that nail people to walls or roast them into charred skeletons or explode them into a fine red mist.\n\nOh yeah, there's those.  While the gunplay isn't stellar, the weapon selection is actually pretty enjoyable. You start off with a semi-auto pistol (which you can dual-wield), a decent SMG that you're nonetheleses going to want to ditch, and an assault rifle with a double-drum magazine. These are the boring guns. As you progress, you find a seemingly-ordinary SPAS-12 knockoff that is capable of reducing mooks to a fine red mist at point-blank range in one or two shots and is so ridiculously common and has such a massive reserve ammo capacity you'll never need to discard it, a pneumatic rifle that fires 10mm spikes, capable of ragdolling mooks on death and nailing them to any nearby surface (think the crossbow from Half-Life 2, but with a magazine and an automatic firing mode), a particle beam that reduces enemies to skeletons when they die, a tri-barrel rocket launcher like something out of Quake or Unreal Tournament, and at least half a dozen more. Each has its uses and plays really well with the bullet-time mechanic, allowing you to pretty much wreck anything you come across, provided you have the right selection, and a sharp mind.  Combine that with some kung-fu moves, and you're like an action hero.\n\nWhich is really what the game is, and why I love it. It's not some complex and deep BioWare-esque world or storyline.  It's a silly 90s action movie that, while it isn't really self-aware, nonetheless doesn't try to take itself too seriously.  You show up, blow off the heads of masked clones with your superhuman reflexes and martial prowess, and save the day from the psycho-terrorist.  Not a smart game, but nonetheless made of awesome.  If nothing else, it's a good way to kill a weekend.","April 18, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

F.E.A.R has the perfect combination of a FPS and jumpscare/horrorgame.\n\nIn one moment you find youself fighting 10 (Doesn't sound too hard) Replica soldiers, and in the other moment you get scared until death by a little girl (No spoilers).

Despite the obvious flaws, it's one of the few first person shooters.. well games in general, that I keep coming back even now, many years after my first playthrough.\n\nI'll get the negative points out of the way first. Yes, the majority of the game takes place in the same bland office building. And yes, a large portion of the story is presented through boring audio files scattered throughout each area. But what makes F.E.A.R. such a special game is the combat. It is absolutely phenomenal. I still cannot believe this game arrived in late 2005. The majority of shooters these days don't even come close to the level of quality presented in F.E.A.R.'s engaging combat scenarios. The enemy AI is among the most intelligent i've ever faced off against in a shooter. They actively work to outsmart the player, going as far as to take alternate routes completely out of their way in an effort to sneak up on the player's flank for an easy kill. They're fast, and deadly accurate. On the harder difficulties, every mistake is quickly punished leading to a near instant death. This is all partly to balance the slow-motion reflex system, which does more to add real tactical depth to the combat rather than a crutch. Enemies can and will still hit you even with reflexes engaged and with its relatively short duration, every use must be carefully planned out to ensure success.\n\nThe difficulty of the combat is what makes this game so rewarding, and why I continue to come back to it after all these years. I've played this game to completion at least a half dozen times on several difficulty settings and it still feels fresh. The graphics are extremely dated. It looks downright ugly most of the time.. but the gameplay more than makes up for it. I always found the story interesting, even if it wasn't presented in a very consistant and informative manner. F.E.A.R. does offer some legitimate scares as well, but at times they feel like more of a distraction. These moments do add mystery and a sense of forboding to the game though, and helps to set the atmosphere more than any combat scenario does.\n\nI'm currently playing through this game again on the Extreme difficulty, and I'm loving almost every moment. The brutal efficiency of the enemy AI makes every combat scenario a tactical engagement, with the threat of a quick death ever present. Easily one of my favorite first-person shooters of all time. And in my opinion much better than the sequels.","April 6, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I still remember looking at the pre-order box in the shop and saying "1GB OF RAM REQUIRED? ARE YOU INSANE!?" like it was yesterday.  But yep, next year F.E.A.R. will 10 years old.  So now is the time to sit down and ask: "Is F.E.A.R. still a good game that holds up"?  And the answer is "Yes."  Yes, F.E.A.R. is still a good game that holds up.  It sits firmly inbetween older fashioned shooters and newer shooters, not unlike its brethren (And at the time, competition) Doom 3 and Half-Life 2.  It's more linear, story focused, and the like than old school shooters but it still had navigational environments, a health bar, and other nice things that I miss.  For the time, F.E.A.R.'s technology was keen, and while aspects of it haven't aged as well as the previously mentioned Doom 3 & Half-Life 2 (Mainly the environments, plus some character models have visible seams down their faces and its weird.)  other aspects of the engine still remain pretty damn impressive and paradoxically, superior to the games own sequels and many other games today.  The bouncing particles, whizz-bang sparks, and the way each bullet creates light all around it still make for some damn cool scenes that please the eye.\n\nThe atmosphere is also pretty solid, and while the scares didn't get to me like they once did, I still got chills here and there and admittedly if you are a first time player the scares might get you good.  I've hardened to them mainly because I'm currently on my 4th playthrough.\n\nThe A.I. is also pretty spectacular, smart, and dynamic.  The weapons feel powerful and every bullet makes an impact on you and the enemies, and the combat animation is superb and packed with lots of satisfying bloodshed.\n\nThe story is also interesting, flawed, but interesting and it must have taken some talent to pull the story off considering that it was trying to be a Sci-fi horror story inspired by The Ring, The Matrix, and Kung-Fu movies.  Not a mix that makes a lot of sense, but somehow comes together surprisingly well considering all of those things are from completely different planets.\n\nFor 10 bucks, you get the original game and its expansions - and while "Perseus Mandate" is really only the quality of a fan made mod, it feels like its thrown in for free since the core game and "Extraction Point" are both pretty solid and will last you awhile.  And feel free to stop on by online, there's still folks playing - and its damn fun.\n\nIn short, F.E.A.R. has Guns, Grenades, Ghost Girls & is Gory, Grisly, Gritty, & Grim.  Mmm, alliteration.","March 10, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good.\n\nThis is a an extremely creepy game that stays fairly creepy throughout. True, this game is full of jump-scares but they are all well done. The jump-scares are not usually the loud, annoying kind but the kind which give you quiet glimpses into a seemingly other world (or rather, mind). If you take the time to look at everything carefully and listen to every answering machine message you can find the game's mysterious plot gets explained quite thoroughly as well. The controls are good, the sound is adequate and the lighting and graphics, while fairly simple and minimalistic by today's standards, are clean. The enemy types do not have a great deal of variety (though there is some and this game features the most potentially realistic looking power-armor design I have ever seen in any game).\n\nThis game is short and the plot is highly linear (which limits its replayability severely) but the story that is told is fascinating and thought-provoking while the gameplay is tense and creepy throughout. The enemy AI is frighteningly clever (far superior to Half Life 2's soldier AI) with soldiers who will flank, ambush, flush you out with grenades and often refuse to get tricked into being piled up in bottle-necked doorways. 80% of this game takes place in-doors (mostly in after-hours night time office spaces (which I think is a cool idea and is a setting I haven't seen since the early part of Half Life 1) so as a result the enemy AI (and the graphics and lighting) doesn't have to deal with as much complexity as it might have otherwise.\n\nMuch of this game reminded me of the first Die Hard movie in terms of action (due to the night-time, largely abandoned office building environment) but in all the best ways. In many ways this game's style is like an even cross between the action and environment of Die Hard I and the creeping horror of The Ring (if you can imagine it). This made for a great combination. The ending is a bit of a cliff hanger but is suitably shocking and horrific (in the extreme) while still paying homage to The Ring (which is where the game has clearly borrowed most of its horror style). The music is strange but well suited to the game but I found only 3 songs I really liked (the main opening theme and two action themes they were).","September 17, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I saw this on the Humble Indie WB Bundle, I jumped on it. F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a first person shooter with some interesting horror elmets thrown in. You play as Pointman, your typical mute hero (as many were during the dawn of the Xbox 360, which is where I first played this game) who has been transferred to the F.E.A.R. Unit and is tasked with hunting down Fettel, a phsycic warrior who is able to link his mind to Cloned soldiers and issue them orders. All the while you do this there is something more sinister behind the curtain, a small girl known as Alma. Who is she? What is Fettel up to? All those answers can be found within the chapters of the game. Gameplay isn't realy innovative, point and shoot is pretty much all you do, but it's the complex and dark story that keeps you sitting in your chair. My only real "beef" with the game is the lack of proper controller support. I know what your going to say, but i was a console baby so playing FPS's with a mouse doesn't come natural to me, not to mention i'm playing on a laptop. A must have for any fan of both action and horror.","November 25, 2013","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It isn’t long before the player is thrust headlong in to the midst of a paranormal nightmare, as all of his squad mates are slaughtered in the blink of an eye by some unexplained malevolent force. And this is only the beginning of the game too – the pace picks up from there as there are many action-packed gunfights (enhanced by slow motion) with extremely intelligent and intimidating enemies to be had, and supernatural creatures – some that can’t be killed by conventional means – to face off against, and not to mention there are plenty of scares.\n\nThis isn’t a Doom 3 type game where there are monsters hiding in a closet waiting to pounce on you. This involves the player embarking on a dark, twisted, psychologically tormenting journey in to a brilliantly crafted world where they will strive to put the pieces of a much larger story together.\n\nThere are several inspirations evident in F.E.A.R. as it draws from famed horror films such as The Ring, and by extension the Japanese film it was based upon, Ringu. This is easily the best in the series, and Monolith shows its mastery when it comes to the horror genre.\n\nThe only real gripe I have with the game – and it’s a very minor one at that – was perhaps the sound effects, particularly the weapons, which I found to be a little flat sounding, although there is a wonderfully fitting soundtrack composed by Nathan Griggs that more than makes up for it.","December 8, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

It is what fps should be, not what they have now become. It is sometimes hard to review an older game as its graphics and sound are of such a lower quality, however at the time of release it was the best graphical game out there. Besides that let’s get into it. The map design is nice and allows for a limited, but still present, multiple pathways systems that help you beat enemies and find hidden items, like med packs etc. However the environments are sometimes repeated to often and enemy spawn and triggers become quite obvious. The story, although hard to follow and riddled with holes is still interesting enough to keep you interested in the main story. One way to fix the holes is listening to phone messages and finding laptops which give you, sometimes vague, insights into the story. The gameplay is actually the best part of this game. Guns feel responsive and enemies take damage well and ragdolls are fully utilised, the wide array of weapons also helps this. The slowdown time ability is the funniest and fun thing in the game. The ability allows you to slow down time, so you can enter a room in slow motion and kill everyone without getting damaged; it leads to fun and creative gunplay. The mood of this game is creepy and horrifying, but doesn't fully rely on jump scares to create this mood. The game constantly creates an eerie and scary mood that follows you throughout the campaign and keeps you on your toes. The vivid hallucinations created by the main villains are creepy and horrifying. The game blends horror and combat well; however it is quite obvious when the game quickly changes tone from a fast paced shooter, to a horror. The game also comes with two expansions packs which should be entertaining and practically the same. The game also lacks the multiplayer that the original game had.\n\n8.5/10- An incredibly fun game with great combat and horror elements that blend well together. The story is interesting although filled with plot holes and the environment is creepy and eerie....have fun.","December 17, 2013","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not the prettiest to look at, but fun from start to finish. Some of the most amazing AI ever created. Probably worth $5 at most.\n\nGRAPHICS 3/5\nThe game is from 2005 and it shows. However I believe they have aged well, especially if you crank up all the feature to the max, since it never really becomes bothersome, although a bit repetitive on it's color plate. Even when it was originally released, graphics where never meant to take the forefront though, so don't expect a big 2005 showcase. They are simply OK.\n\nSTORY 2/5\nAgain, for the time, mixing horror with military FPS was a bit of an inovation. The story also simply serves the bigger game picture, providing a good excuse to mow down clone soldiers, get a scare or two out of the player, and come up with some weird scenarios. However, you can't help but feel the story never reaches it's full potential, being content with only feeding you bits here and there. Even worse, a good chunk of explanations are left to audio recordings which are barely audible and force you to simply stand and listen when you are all pumped up and want to continue.\n\nMUSIC AND SOUND 2/5\nNot much music to talk about. It's creepy and barely noticible. Never stands out but subtly sets the atmosphere for either creepiness or action. Sounds simply fitts as it should, guns sound the way guns doo and some shrieks here and there can be chilling to the bone (but only the first couple of times).\n\nGAMEPLAY 4/5\nIf anything, this is where the game shines the most. The controls are tight and the actual shooting is as satisying as shooting could be. The graphics, sound effects, animation and everything in general come nicely together so every shoot has the appropiate punch behind it. There's some good weapon variety and destructible stuff littered around to make firefights more flashy. AI is one of the best I've ever seen for a game though, and was years beyonf it's time. Enemies coordinate, use actual attack tactics and react as a human player would. So good is the AI that even at the lowest difficulty level, where enemies are weaker, have poor aiming and you can apparently take more damage, you can STILL be surprised by the AI and die.\n\nREPLAYABILITY 1/5\nNot much to do once you beat it except trying to do it again at a higher difficulty level. I'm not much for multiplayer so once I finished it I didn't touch it again.","February 2, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not the prettiest to look at, but fun from start to finish. Some of the most amazing AI ever created. Probably worth $5 at most.\n\nGRAPHICS 3/5\nThe game is from 2005 and it shows. However I believe they have aged well, especially if you crank up all the feature to the max, since it never really becomes bothersome, although a bit repetitive on it's color plate. Even when it was originally released, graphics where never meant to take the forefront though, so don't expect a big 2005 showcase. They are simply OK.\n\nSTORY 2/5\nAgain, for the time, mixing horror with military FPS was a bit of an inovation. The story also simply serves the bigger game picture, providing a good excuse to mow down clone soldiers, get a scare or two out of the player, and come up with some weird scenarios. However, you can't help but feel the story never reaches it's full potential, being content with only feeding you bits here and there. Even worse, a good chunk of explanations are left to audio recordings which are barely audible and force you to simply stand and listen when you are all pumped up and want to continue.\n\nMUSIC AND SOUND 2/5\nNot much music to talk about. It's creepy and barely noticible. Never stands out but subtly sets the atmosphere for either creepiness or action. Sounds simply fitts as it should, guns sound the way guns doo and some shrieks here and there can be chilling to the bone (but only the first couple of times).\n\nGAMEPLAY 4/5\nIf anything, this is where the game shines the most. The controls are tight and the actual shooting is as satisying as shooting could be. The graphics, sound effects, animation and everything in general come nicely together so every shoot has the appropiate punch behind it. There's some good weapon variety and destructible stuff littered around to make firefights more flashy. AI is one of the best I've ever seen for a game though, and was years beyonf it's time. Enemies coordinate, use actual attack tactics and react as a human player would. So good is the AI that even at the lowest difficulty level, where enemies are weaker, have poor aiming and you can apparently take more damage, you can STILL be surprised by the AI and die.\n\nREPLAYABILITY 1/5\nNot much to do once you beat it except trying to do it again at a higher difficulty level. I'm not much for multiplayer so once I finished it I didn't touch it again.","February 2, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For nothing.\n\n(If you're too lazy to read this review, just buy the game).\n\nFEAR is a first-person shooter game that swaps between throwing baddies with guns at you, to throwing a scary little girl and some really frightening hallucinations at you. This game made me deathly afraid of ladders for the entire playthrough, from just one hallucination early on.\n\nBasically, the story is a little goofy and feels goofier when all the characters take it so seriously, but you are a member of the "First Encounter Assault Recon" task squad (nevermind that Assault and Recon are two entirely different things) and are assigned with bringing down a man named Paxton Fettel, who is a psychic commander to a secret clone army (I said it was goofy) and out of nowhere an evil little girl ghostie-goo is haunting you and killing people. Despite it's goofiness, the story gets better as it goes, and ends up becoming really awesome.\n\nThe gameplay is broken into segments of exploration and light puzzle solving, to crazy fun combat, and getting the poop scared out of you by the mysterious ghostie girl. The exploration and puzzles aren't really anything new, if you've played Half-Life 2 it's like that, but with none of those dumb see-saw puzzles. The scary moments are, well, scary and well done, however they begin to get a little predictable near the end of the game, but for the first 70% of the game people will disintegrate around you, you'll be teleported to different locations, and the little girl will try to kill you, and you'll be scared. Not horrified, but scared and probably asking, "What the #@^%$?," multiplie times. Where the game truly shines though is in it's combat. The combat is fast paced and brutal, and bullets tear chunks out of walls and objects and spray particles into the air. A simple office shootout becomes mayhem as dust fills the air as shrapnel flies off walls, computers explode in bright flashes of light, and paper flutters around the air as enemies hunt for any sign of you, whether it's your flashlight or a sound you make in game. And these enemies are smart, they have the best AI I've seen in a game. They constantly hunt you down, flanking and calling orders to each other, quickly detecting you if you get to close  to their field of vision, spot your flashlight, call for reinforcements. This makes it feel like you're fighting a true army of highly trained soldiers and makes the combat shine, as each individual fight will play out completely different ways each time you play. You also have a bullet-time feature which you can trigger whenever you'd like, and it turns any combat situation into the lobby scene from The Matrix. Bullets cut through the air, leaving little ripples behind them, dust slowly explodes from damaged walls as you and your enemies shoot and jump kick each other to death in slow-motion. It's incredibly fun, and gives you the killers edge you need against the intelligent AI, and also ties into the story nicely.\n\nThe game was a real blast to play through, and when things become a little too boring it introduces new things, such as hallucinations that will try and kill you, or invisible, wall climbing ninjas that will make you jump and scream and spray your bullets wildly. When these newer features get old (the ninjas never do, there were too few of them actually), the game gives you one of the best video game finales you will ever see.\n\nI rate this game a 5 for Amazeballs, it is the highest rating I can give, and it means you should buy it like right now. I'm waiting. No seriously, stop fooling around. Buy it.","December 11, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your opponents, the Replicant soldiers created by Armachan and the Armachan private army both have excellent AI. They behave very intelligently under the circumstances and coordinate well as squads.\n\nThe storyline engrossed me completely even though it wasn't deep. It was disturbing, dark, and thrilling as you put together the picture. Overall the game feels satisfying. There's nothing quite as satisfying as ambushing an enemy squad then while in slow-motion wipe them all out in less then a second (in game time).\n\nMost surprisingly the graphics hold up better than its sequel, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. Now nearly 10 years after its original release F.E.A.R.'s graphics are visually interesting and highly functional. The enemy units come in variety and all are fascinating to look at. The sequel's graphics while most advanced are simply dull and remind one of Call of Duty.\n\nUltimately, I recommend this to any member of the gaming community to play. Be wary of the sequels, they are unimpressive but fun at best. They're downright terrible if you want more of the original flavor.","November 22, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bringing a unquie blend of horror met with a John Woo film.\n\nWhy do I hold it on such a high regard? Offering a odd & condeluted story, but well above the average shooter story offering for atleast being interesting while entertaining for what it is. Dated visuals at this point, but holds up with wonderful particul effects for gun envirment dammage & physic's. High production sound design. with fitting soundtrack & great combat/ enviromental sound effects (Many of said effects sound unusally similar to another great Monalith title, Condemned.) Then finally the stellar gunplay,  that's the main reason for price of admission. The top notch combat of this game could warrent a review dedicated to that aspect alone, but lets run it down. Tight old school shooter controls, terrific enemy A.I thats the penniacle of enemy intelligence I hold shooters to this day, met with right kind of fun weaponary needed for the job (Shotgun & Rail Gun are a overpowered blast, pun not intended) All stacked onto a enjoyable yet very tactical slo mo drenched 'gun fu'  John Woo inspired thrill ride.\n\nIn short, it may not pack the same quality story telling nor characters some more renowned shooters may have. Plus brought down with some medicore horror that is there more or less to do no more than give a break of pace from its frantic combat.

The game utilizes new graphics and visual effects even though it was made in 2005. The dust particles, and the fact that i can actually see my legs is one really cool aspect to this game cause some games now dont have that feature. Enemy AI is wonderful (Way better than COD) xD but seriously the soldiers even try playing dead to make you think you killed em. The slow-mo is EPIC. I played this game on the retail version before, and it was so good that I had to buy it again on steam. (Plus I just wanted to play extraction point cause I only have perseus mandate retail).

Although unfortunately the download is humongous (16 FREAKING GIGABYTES FOR A GAME FROM 2005!!!), and the enemy variety is a bit...not varied...that should not be enough to deter you from this excellent horror first-person shooter from the folks at Monolith.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","Take the linearity of Half-Life, but create a game that's actually fun and you have FEAR. Actually, this game is more linear than Half-Life, if that's even possible. It's entirely understandable if you grow tired of corridors and start to feel like you're just going down a conveyor belt with enemies ocassionaly popping out of the darkness in front of you. It's telling when even in a vehicle during the game's intro you're going down an incredibly narrow path whereby there's barely any space between the car and the walls. It's as if the developers refused to have any sort of open areas present in even the most sensible of places.\n\nBut linearity isn't bad. In fact, this game is a strong showcase of how linearity can be used to craft a strong single-player experience. While the corridors may make you feel constricted, at the same time they are conducive to brilliant enemy ai that knows its surroundings and moves accordingly. Linearity also allows a developer to craft an experience that ensures certain events are experienced a particular way and come about in proper order. Linear progression in level design means that you are strapped to a roller coaster and ride through all events in a manner that leaves no doubt in the creator's mind that you got the specific emotional ride he/she was looking to put you through.\n\nThe game is littered with many events where something 2spooky happens which is only possible through a constricted experience whereby the developer knows you are looking a particular way or going down a particular path. While getting the exact reaction out of you is only possible through linearity, it's a positive that quickly falls back down to neutral due to the negatives that weigh it down. You see, because all the 'scares' are crafted in a linear experience, you can often see them coming. It doesn't help that you get a little 'UNKNOWN SIGNAL' prompt at the top left of the screen whenever the little girl appears somewhere in the map trying to scare you. It aids in letting you know that an event is occuring and you might miss it, but that defeats the purpose of surprising/scaring you.\n\nNot that the 'fear factor' in the game is that great anyway. Personally I wasn't frightened by the title, but it does do a fantastic job at crafting some good atmosphere. Remember: you don't actually have to succeed at scaring people to create an atmosphere that is eerie. Theres excellent use of lighting throughout and great pacing between the game's more hectic moments that leaves you wondering if a firefight is afoot or a 'jump scare'. Trying to create an FPS that is also horror-based is a tough balancing act, and this game pulled off that tight rope walk admirably.\n\nIt's a shame that the plot itself couldn't have more meat to it. It feels a little bare-bones, with the story feeling more like justification for the little girl character and all the creepy shenanigans. It's as if they created the game and characters first, and then realized they needed a plot to tie it together; story came towards the end of development, essentially. But something tells me they had the plot down, and then got down to level creation and just kept on creating more and more until they had to stretch the already thin plot even thinner to last through the constant stream of levels. So I guess it's excusable, if not a shame. After all, gameplay comes first, even if plot is the motivator for me to keep progressing.\n\nAll said, if you don't mind linearity and a rather simple plot it's a great experience that is held up by its atmosphere and enemy ai that is carefully balanced between eerieness and enjoyable firefights.","June 17, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The environments not only compliment the way the AI thinks but, the exploration / item stashes are top notch.\nCore gameplay consists mostly of pop n shoot cover mechanics. There are usually 2+ paths you can take to tackle enemies so, each encounter feels dynamic. Theres a nice supply of guns throughout the game and they all have their uses in different situations. You can stealth to an extent but, youll mostly be making sure your foes dont surround you.\nWhats the snaziest thing you can do in this game though? The slow motion, in any situation you can fluently slow time to a crawl for precision aiming. Not only is the effect dazzling, it will keep you alive, minimal bs deaths (although i wouldnt mind beating the game without it).\nThe graphics and music are practically timeless. The atmosphere immerses you right away. Theres havock physics as well and that just puts the icing one everything else.\nThe story is interesting but, nothing that will make you think for hours after playing it. The characters however are very entertaining. Online is down however something leaves me to believe that theres still a way to host privately...\n\n10 out of 10 bullet times","April 19, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enemies tend to use cover and I like how they communicate with each other and act on the orders they are given via radio, but there are only like 5 different types of enemies and the maps don’t change much either. In the end you are just wishing for it to end, because you’ve visited that same place (or at least a very similar one) just in the last mission. As you can expect, the graphics are old and what is supposed to be its greatest feature, its story, is really not that much interesting until the last bit.  By that time, however, you have probably guessed the ending and the only exciting thing about it is making sure you were right the whole time.\n\nOh, and seriously, they could have come up with something better than: “We’ll regroup later, you go alone first” in every single mission. Gets tiring pretty soon. Other than that, the slow motion mechanic is quite cool, but don’t expect the game to scare you too much. I don’t know. In most cases I probably wouldn’t recommend playing it, but since it’s not too long and it was quite a game back in its day, I suppose it couldn’t hurt to give the game a try. Just be ready to experience a really repetitive game until the very last stage.\n","June 22, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has some of the smartest AI I've ever seen, with a game length of, oh, 12 hours or more?

The gameplay is all time Best. The sound is ♥♥♥♥ing sp00py and as stupid as it sounds in F.E.A.R I've jumped at my shadows a few times thinking it was that lil Girl. The guns ar balanced and go with power to ammo, Such as if you want an amazing gun ammo is scarce and it has it's doubts ,but if you want a balanced gun ammo is balanced to the power! Im scared of little girls now, I was having fun saying this game isn't scary pfft, I was wrong went in the Sewer to get Health Upgrade turn around and she's there checking me out. Shot her, quit game and thought bout how scury this games is...My review doesn't make since and if you've read this far great! I would rate this game in graphics 8/10, Gameplay 10/10, bugs there aren't any in the game unless it's your software, and sp00ky is 10/10 super sp00py!","July 14, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even years later this game still looks amazing.  The brilliantly designed lighting and shadows make  this game an immersive experience and certainly add to the spooky atmosphere in a way that a few jump scares never could. Finally, the amazing physics engine makes it immensely satisfying to run up behind a hapless guard and turn them into chunks with a shotgun or pin them to a wall with the aptly named "Penetrator."

Good.\n\nThis is a an extremely creepy game that stays fairly creepy throughout. True, this game is full of jump-scares but they are all well done. The jump-scares are not usually the loud, annoying kind but the kind which give you quiet glimpses into a seemingly other world (or rather, mind). If you take the time to look at everything carefully and listen to every answering machine message you can find the game's mysterious plot gets explained quite thoroughly as well. The controls are good, the sound is adequate and the lighting and graphics, while fairly simple and minimalistic by today's standards, are clean. The enemy types do not have a great deal of variety (though there is some and this game features the most potentially realistic looking power-armor design I have ever seen in any game).\n\nThis game is short and the plot is highly linear (which limits its replayability severely) but the story that is told is fascinating and thought-provoking while the gameplay is tense and creepy throughout. The enemy AI is frighteningly clever (far superior to Half Life 2's soldier AI) with soldiers who will flank, ambush, flush you out with grenades and often refuse to get tricked into being piled up in bottle-necked doorways. 80% of this game takes place in-doors (mostly in after-hours night time office spaces (which I think is a cool idea and is a setting I haven't seen since the early part of Half Life 1) so as a result the enemy AI (and the graphics and lighting) doesn't have to deal with as much complexity as it might have otherwise.\n\nMuch of this game reminded me of the first Die Hard movie in terms of action (due to the night-time, largely abandoned office building environment) but in all the best ways. In many ways this game's style is like an even cross between the action and environment of Die Hard I and the creeping horror of The Ring (if you can imagine it). This made for a great combination. The ending is a bit of a cliff hanger but is suitably shocking and horrific (in the extreme) while still paying homage to The Ring (which is where the game has clearly borrowed most of its horror style). The music is strange but well suited to the game but I found only 3 songs I really liked (the main opening theme and two action themes they were).","September 17, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can always hear enemies chatting before you see them, and when they're all dead, the music gets quiet and stops, so you always know when you should have your finger on the trigger.\n\nHorror and action elements are kept pretty separate. Horror elements NEVER involve monster closets opening behind you (only the occation vision when you turn around), and at all points, the games plays very fair with allowing you to see enemies before they see you.\n\nThe game is very linear, but there are enough secrets that lead to either slight powerups or creepy horror visuals that there's just enough exploration to scratch that itch.\n\nPhysics are pretty basic and exaggerated, but only in a way that increases the fun. Enemies' heads and limbs really fly, but not too far.\n\nWeapons are all useful and balanced (except maybe the crappy submachine gun) in terms of ammo capacity, accuracy, damage and availability, and chopping off heads with the laser cutter and pinning enemies to walls with the nailgun are both among the best shooting experiences across the entire genre.\n\nThe only real faults I have with F.E.A.R and and its expansions are that there's not enough environmental and enemy variety, and that the story is crappy and not very well presented. But the gameplay more than makes up for that.\n\nEach expansion adds a couple new enemy types and a couple new guns. That means Perseus Mandate is by far the most varied gameplay-wise, but by that point, you might be a bit burned out. Main game takes around 10-14 hours to play through while each expansion is around 4-6 hours. Perseus mandate involves a different character than base game and extraction point, so after the first game, if you're feeling a bit burnt out, I'd actually recommend playing perseus first since it's better than Extraction point.\n\nNOTE: Neither expansion is "canon" to the series, so if you plan on playing FEAR2, you won't miss anything by skipping them.","June 3, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhouston/recommended/21090/","samhouston","Sam Houston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhouston/","224 products in account","FEAR has aged remarkably well. Graphics don't look dated, AI feels fresh even in 2015, sound and art design mean the game feels modern even if it's almost a decade old at this point. The physics engine also lends a hand to this impression, enemies fly when killed with a shotgun and ragdolls create an incredibly visceral experience.\n\nGunplay is similarly satisfying. Even on the higher levels of difficulty, shotguns (my favorite weapon) and other weapons do appropriate amounts of damage. Difficulty isn't ramped up by turning the enemies in to bullet sponges, instead, it makes enemies' weaponry more dangerous to you. Instead of having to pump shot after shot into the head of a Monolith trooper, you have to stay nimble and approach battles from a more tactical perspective to minimize time spent in enemy crossfire.\n\nAs far as horror elements go, FEAR is clearly influenced by The Ring and other Japanese horror themes. Jump scares don't feel as cheap as they do in other games, but FEAR isn't primarily a horror game so much as a shooter with horror elements. The ambience is great with darkly lit levels that can be temporarily lit up with your rechargeable flashlight. However, it's hard to be properly scared when equipped with a set of grenades and the ability to slow time. My approach to battles was to pick off outlying/particulary dangerous enemies with long range weapons before closing the gap using the slow time ability and eviscerating the remaining foes with my shotgun.\n\nIf you're looking to be scared, this probably shouldn't be your top choice. The cutscenes and pseudo-quicktime events with Alma are creepy, invisible enemies will make you jump, but nothing is too terribly terrifying. On the other hand, if you're looking for a solid FPS with excellent atmosphere, FEAR is a perfect choice.","April 8, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level design and environmental puzzles come straight out of Half-Life, but the over-the-top shooting and meathead soldier enemies resemble Crysis or the new Wolfenstein games. Ten years on, FEAR seems like it's having an identity crisis. Of course, in 2005, it probably didn't seem so strange to mix these elements together, and thankfully, in this case, it works.\n\nIt's also supposedly a "horror" game, though it mostly fails on this front. The plot involves secret cloning experience and it features occasional jumpscares, but the actual gameplay is all 100% classic shooter. Ever the famous "ladder moment" didn't make much of an impression on me; I actually don't even remember encountering it in the game.\n\nWhat really makes FEAR shine is the AI. Most of the battles are against enemy troopers, and the way they try to flank you and out-maneuver you is really second to none in shooter games. This is one game where the soldiers won't just run at you spraying wildly. Their hunting and survival instincts are advanced, but the player has a balancing weapon in the form of the bullet time mechanic. It's great that they decided to add that, as I think it's probably what prevents the game from getting needlessly frustrating like Far Cry 1.","December 10, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The weapons and gunplay in general are satisfying, and  enemy AI is quite good--far better in fact than what we've grown used to in SP FPSs, and it has an engrossing and haunting story that gradually reveals itself as the game progresses.  Levels do get a bit repetitive, though, which may hurt replayability.\n\nIt does have some cheesy jump scares at times, but the overall atmosphere is very tense and creepy, in no small part due to the surprisingly restrained but genuinely unnerving sightings of Alma, the psychic spectres of her former victims, vivid and disturbing hallucinations that the player experiences, and the poorly lit environs crawling with mercs and other, less human monsters that most of the game plays out in.\n\nYou'll definitely want to explore at least a bit, though, as a fair amount of narrative context is conveyed through voicemails, laptops, and overheard conversations that you'd miss if you're speed-running through the levels.  The plot, while good by FPS standards, is still incomplete and requires the completion of FEAR2 and FEAR3 to fully comprehend, which is disappointing since both of those games (story-wise) don't measure up to the original by a long shot.\n\nIf you like atmospheric, story-driven horror FPS with smart AI, look no further.  This is a new classic for good reason.\n\nOh, and the ending--so perfect.","October 30, 2014","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately for the gamers of today, Monolith Productions forgot to implement any art style or set pieces what so ever. The most fearful thing about this game is how cold and sterile the world seems, rather than its imitation of Samara from The Ring. Thanks to said girl, the game was also commended on living up to its name, thanks to scripted sequences involving corridors of blood à la The Shining, and cheap jump scares. I’m not really sure what all the fuss was about, considering horror masterpieces Resident Evil (2002) and Silent Hills 1 (1999), 2 (2001) and 3 (2003) had long been on the market. The ‘spooky sequences’ played out as little more than a predictable ghost train, and couldn’t actually harm the player. Sure, they broke down the repetitive battles, but to any seasoned horror game fan, they felt shallow. Condemned: Criminal Origins (2005) did a far greater job of striking fear into players in a first person perspective, and using the very same engine as F.E.A.R.\nMy other major complaint about the title is that while starting out solidly enough, the cliché story becomes vague and muddled throughout the campaign, and although their back stories are vaguely revealed, the characters entirely fail to develop.\n\nYet despite these major flaws, I would recommend this game (or it’s first expansion pack) to fans of the FPS genera in a heartbeat, thanks to some of the best gunplay I have seen in games, even to date. Whilst the weapons might be neither realistic nor visually interesting, the kinaesthetic feedback from a firefight is uncannily satisfying. Be it a pistol, shotgun, smg or rifle, the ricochets, plaster chips and dust clouds that get kicked into the air are immensely satisfying in a way that the game’s sequels never managed to replicate. In addition to this, the enemy AI is still some of the best I have seen, so gunning down waves of clones as they squeal in fear over their radios  never out stays its welcome, despite the frequency of battles.\nIf you enjoy shooing things from a first person perspective and have any interest in games that predate a couple of years, you owe it to yourself to play F.E.A.R\n\nSpoooookyvision out of Ten.\n","November 26, 2013","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It had the issue for it being in an FPS game, which unless you are in an character-rpg is a tad silly.\n\nThe story goes... Oh damn, it's a bit hard to explain. Something about breeding supersoldiers, goverment programs, creepy skinny motherf*cker  (Who i heard in the later games has that very agenda in mind..)   and a creepy little girl in a red dress. Oh and something, else, that is, extremely relevant..\n\nHonestly guys, the story is good, i'l give it that. The problem is, as said, it is in an FPS-Game and that is my main issue with it.\n\nThe game plays like your standart, sort-of-tactical-not-really-cover-based-style shooter, with a bullet-time mechanic that is a wee-bit overpowered. Honestly, most of my playthrough i had a shotgun and i was spamming headshots with it every time i had enough bullet-time charge.. I should disclose i played the game on normal, not hard, maybe i should go and play it again someday, but right now i can't be bothered.\n\nBut for some reason i cannot give the game a negative review, i don't know why.. Maybe, even with it's shortcomings the game was very enjoyable. Some of the little scaredy-moments were good enough to cause me to bang my knee to the bottom of the desk, but because it happened only a few times in the whole game. I cannot really base that as worth of a dislike.\n\nThe shooting (even with being a bit easy to exploit) was in total, rather good. There were only few instances where i was forced to take a more tactical aproach, picking off certain enemies before taking on the other. Oh and the shotgun is a must, because it is a right beast..\n\nNow, the one thing that kills the games mood. Is the somewhat awkward little segments where i felt the pacing could have been better. I felt this a few times during the expansions as well.. I cannot really place it, but i remember noticing it several times.\n\n\nTo summarize this rather tired, not realy on the point review:\n\n+ Good shooting.\n+ Mostly consistent atmosphere.\n+ Graphics hold up rather nicely.\n\n- Awkward little segments.\n- Mostly consistent atmosphere.\n- Few annoying fights.","November 14, 2014","true","13.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

On paper, I'm sure none of this would've made much sense: Let's make a high-octane action game/first-person shooter, keep it MOSTLY straight, but with a constant HINT of something altogether spookier going on, with only the occasional foray into full-blown "horror".  And somehow STILL manage to be one of the tensest and spookiest games ever made.  Loonie tunes, right?  Except that they PULLED IT OFF.\n\nIt's hard to say how or why, but for some odd reason this game FEELS like a horror game almost the entire time, despite the fact of you spending the vast majority of the time running about maps shooting, well, dudes.  "Super-soldiers" they may be, but they're still relatively ordinary DUDES.   But herein lies the game's genius, as you really just don't know WHEN the ♥♥♥♥ the supernatural is going to invade the otherwise relatively familiar - if admittedly still atmospheric - "action" trappings, and temporarily turn the game into something else altogether.  Then, just as suddenly as it came, the weirdness disappears for a while again and you can safely get back to shootin' bad guys (at least until the very, very end, where the horror takes more fully over).  What this all means is that the game is genuinely UNPREDICTABLE, and arguably all the more effective as a "scary" game than most other horror games where you just KNOW there's gonna be some weird-♥♥♥ monster or what-not lurking just around the next corner.  If you're still dubious as to how this could all possibly work...PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING THING.\n\nOh, and F.E.A.R. teaches you another valuable life lesson: DON'T TRUST FAT PEOPLE.  The NPC in question is at least twice as evil as the character played by that Newman actor in Jurassic Park.  NOTHING is what it seems in this game.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\nVerdict: 10/10.\n\n\n\n(Oh, and PS...the "slow-mo" function of this game is simply AWESOME, and again, must be seen to be believed.)","October 20, 2014","true","16.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theflerix15/recommended/21090/","theflerix15","achievment wh0re","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theflerix15/","122 products in account","So as of writing this review, I just finished the game less than five minutes ago AND OH MY GOD. OH. MY. GOD. You would not believe what an adventure it was. If you don't want to read the full review, then, here it is. 9/10. Masterpiece in the horror genre. Masterpiece in the FPS-Action genre. The graphics are a bit outdated tho, as of 2015 but it doesn't disturb (atleast) me much, and would fall into the decade of half-life 2 graphics. So if you don't care about flexing your PC's muscles then it's no prob for you, but if you want to experience a horrifying adventure that will haunt your dreams for months after you had uninstalled it, then go. What are you waiting for!\n\nok, now let's talk more detailly about each category.\n\nGraphics:\n\nYes, as I said, the graphics are a bit outdated. The game was released almost ten years ago as of now, but it does not change the story and gameplay of this game. If you have a super-hyper-mega-epic gtx 970 i7 4790k build then you can play this game on 4K ultra, and get way over 200fps. If you have a less powerful build, like say a 760 with an i5 or something like that then you won't have any problems playing this game at 60+ fps either, but still i wouldn't recommend going 4K. Also, there's plenty of mods out there to fix the lighting, the reflections, etc, but I personally prefer to play the game like it is given to me (pronounce: I was too lazy to install any mods).\n\nGameplay:\n\nI remember hearing that Valve once said, that in their Half-Life series, they value gameplay over story (even tho both are important). In my opinion this game perfectly nailed the Half-Life feel and even overdid it. As we know Half-Life was meant as a Light-Horror-Shooter-Puzzle-game. Well F.E.A.R. in our case is FULL-HORROR-Shooter-with some puzzle in it. For me personally the puzzles were not that interesting (go to the furthest away room, press a button, return to start, proceed to now opened gate), but at least they added diversity to the gameplay, different from CoD. The shooting factor in this game was really good in my opinion. If you're a beginner at shooters you'll have a fun time exploding the heads of Fettel's private army, but if you're an FPS veteran like me, you'll beat the game on extreme difficulty with just enough effort for the game to seem a little-tiny bit hard at moments. Also what I really liked was the time freeze button. Loved peeking around the corner then pressing U (I binded it to U) and shooting unsuspecting troops in the head with a plasma gun and seeing them throw their weapon away and turn into a skeleton. So satisfiying. Oh and did I tell you, you can completely remove the crosshair? Definetely gonna be a plus for those who are seeking realism in games and want to try their skill. And Lastly the spooky-spooks. When I started playing it, the last time i had played a horror game was over a year ago. It literally went like this: Walk out of the car. Go inside an abandoned building. Try open the door, it falls down. got me creeped but I kept going. Walk on the second floor, and see a cloud of smoke coming my way. BOOM. A BLOODY FACE COVERING THE WHOLE SCREEN. I ran out of the building, tried to get back in the car, closed the game, started laughing at myself, told my friends so they could laugh too, started crying, and went to get icecream. After a couple jumpscares i got used to them, but still thinking it all through keeping the lore in mind will get you pretty disturbed.\n\nAnd last but not least the story:\n\nWithout spoiling much, you are a marine, who got sent to remove a military commander (or something) who has gone crazy, and while chasing him you start to uncover some supernatural $hit. And a girl following and jumpscaring you everywhere. Like G-MAN but creepier. Time to time she and the crazy supernatural guy talk some creepy stuff to you in between fighting hordes of soldiers. I won't go deeper into the lore, for you to still have something to discover, but the ending... Right when I had let my guard down thinking: it is finally over, but JUMPSCARE-PLOT TWIST.\n\nAnyway this game is a definite 9/10 and would have gotten better from me if I had bought it in the gold days of Half-Life 2, but i still definetely recommend you to play it.\n\n\n\nP.S. Not that I want to say something bad about our great lord and savior, Gaben, but this game (or rather the collection, because you also get two dlcs to continiue the story that you wouldn't have gotten otherwhise) rarely goes on sale and is still pretty expensive then. Call me cheeky, but in my opinion 60 bucks for 3 games and dlc is a tad too much for my wallet to afford. Grab this game during the next winter/summer sale and prepare for having an awesomly creepy and creepily awesome adventure.\n\nP.S.2 I do know I had left a whole bunch of typos and mistakes in this long-a$$ text, feel free to point them out to me and make my life easier.","September 18, 2015","true","24.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

For added fun, there's also melee attacks such as a slide kick, a flying kick, and a roundhouse kick which deal massive damage to enemies if you can land them, the tradeoff being that you have to be at point-blank range. These elements combine into some really interesting firefights and scenarios.\n\nIf you buy this game, buy it for the gameplay, not because it's not really all that scary.","November 28, 2013","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My feelings are generally positive, though I probably should not have played all the three games in the package (the original and the two expansions) at once: when FEAR itself was over, I was excited, after finishing Extraction Point I was interested, and by the end of Perseus Mandate I was exhausted.\nIt's my first thriller, and I'm certainly not disappointed. The expansion packs deserve separate recognition: they are quite the way such additions should be. Perseus Mandate, for example, is in fact a yet another game, as lengthy as FEAR itself, and having a slightly different approach to storyline (which is, I dare say, generally better than the original).\nThere's mostly nothing to complain about, except for some issues with walls, doors, and other obstacles (especially corners): it's very, very annoying when you are completely covered by these, but bullets sometimes still go through and hit you. Except for that, the game gave pleasant experience.\nTake caution if you have weak nerves. There are rivers of blood and many fearsome visions inside the game. Even I was frightened once or twice, though I'm very resistant to such things.","July 1, 2013","true","40.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It wasn't scary, not in the slightest. The short synopsis for this is that the iconic little girl, Alma, was tested on. She had powers that others wanted. She died, I guess? She was put into a coma, impregnanted, and forced into labor. Until she died at 8 years old after her captors ( and father?) pulled the plug. Now she wants revenge? That is what I made of it anyway. There were a few glitches I encountered along the way. Falling off the world was one, and loss of all weapons is another. Cheats are useful, for when these events happen. I myself used two.  Godmode, which proved semi-useful, and kfa (restores all ammo and health). For the many times a glitch caused me to start over. Apparently, from my research, this game is the best in the series. Although the DLC is non-canon. Made by another company. I am yet to try PMandate and Extraction point out.

The game is noteworthy for its great AI, and while a part of it is just smoke and mirrors, it is still a lot better than what evenmost modern shooters are able to put out. It has some compatibility issues these days, particularly with Logitech peripherals, but they can be fixed with a few google searches, and once you get past the issues FEAR is overall a great shooter. It also comes with two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, and while they're considered non-canon by the sequels, they're both pretty fun additions, despite what you would expect since they were made by Timegate Studios, which is now only known for butchering Aliens: Colonial Marines.","July 13, 2015","true","20.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

Scratch that, any gamer whatsoever.\n\nF.E.A.R. is a fast-paced, frantic first person shooter developed by Monolith. It tells the story of a silent protagonist known as Point Man who was recently transferred to the top secret First Encounter Assault Recon division because of his inhuman reflexes. The division deals with paranormal threats to the USA, and Point Man is quickly sent on a mission to execute Paxton Fettel, a military experiment gone haywire. But, it turns out there's more to the story when a strange black-haired girl starts showing up out of nowhere.\nThe game itself is fantastic. It's got everything; the action, the thrilling story, fine-tuned mechanics, smart AI, great level design etc. One of F.E.A.R.'s main trumps is the action that can sometimes prove to be too fast for the player to enjoy; because of that, Monolith gave the player a limited slow-motion ability which proved to be the most well-executed slow motion in gaming to date. The enemies aren't diverse, there are about 5 types you'll encounter, but the artificial intelligence is amazing. Each squadmember knows his role, whether that be flanking, covering, storming in, sniping or otherwise. The story unfolds at a relatively slow pace, but that isn't a problem, as the game knows how to keep you interested. The general atmosphere is another one of F.E.A.R.'s high points; by combining bloody scenes and ambiental music, Monolith managed to create a genuinely creepy experience I'd be happy to go back to in a year or so.","September 16, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Throughout the game, I can safely say I only jumped once or twice.  Where FEAR really delivers, however, is its tense atmosphere that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout most of the game.  The dripping of blood and the unnaturally loud noise of knocking something over makes you want to slow down and peek around the corner to make sure Alma isn't waiting.  Which she often is.  The enemies are pretty repetitive, and there are only about five or six variations throughout the story.  The reflex ability partially alleviates this, making the fights far more interesting.

Cross","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028390148/","85 products in account","Fear was the system hog of its time. It was also touted as one of the best FPS titles of its time. Does it hold up to both those titles today.\n\nWell, yes and no. Yes it's one of the best FPS titles of its time (and still an impressive shooter nowadays), no it's no longer a system hog. Let's look deeper into that.\n\nFEAR puts you in control of Point Man, the newest member of a government team meant to combat paranormal threats. You're sent out to stop a crazed cannibalistic solider who's taken telepathic command of an army of clone soldiers. Meanwhile, there's this creepy girl stalking you through the whole thing and making people explode into meat splatters with her telepathic abilities. The whole game is pretty much you tracking down the cannibal freak, killing clone soldiers, investigating the situation's backstory, and discovering all the dirty little secrets. It's a mildly intriguing story, but i'll admit it's never really hooked me. The gameplay on the other hand...\n\nWoo boy. This game has some of the best shooting i've ever come across, even by today's standards. If you've ever watched a John Woo film, you know what you're gonna get here. the gunfights here are cinematic, frenetic, fast-paced encounters where bullets tear chunks out of concrete, glass windows are shattered, bodies fly around like ragdolls, blood splatters, smoke emanates from gun barrels, dust clouds your vision, and furniture is obliterated. Despite the near complete lack of enemy variety (they're all literally clones), the action never gets old. All this is made even better by the smart enemy AI. Clones pin you down, shout orders to their squad mates, flank you while the others keep you in cover with gunfire, throw grenades your way, jump over ledges to avoid your bullets, run away from your grenades, take defensive positions, crawl under tables for cover, notice your flashlight, and even hear your footsteps if you don't crouch. The AI here was ahead of its time and still impresses today.\n\nThe game's also pretty scary and atmospheric too. I wouldn't call it terrifyin, but I will say it managed to give me the chills and jolt me many, many times. Disturbing hallucinations, that creepy ghost girl stalking you, chilling music, and things moving on their own all work together to unsettle you whenever you're not locked in a fierce firefight with enemies.\n\nLike I said though, the graphics have already been eclipsed tons of times in the years following this game's release. It simply isn't all that demanding anymore. On a mid-range laptop, you can easily run it at max settings with 60 frames per seconds. The visuals themselves are very sharp at max settings, but not exactly impressive. Textures are... all right. Water effects are fairly basic. The two places the graphics are still fairly impressive are in the lighting effects and, especially, the particles. Remember what I said about how the environments just come apart when you're in gunfights? Yeah, the particle effects actually add to the gameplay here and turning them down deals a serious blow to the enjoyment in my opinion.\n\nOverall: recommended. It's a solid, exciting shooter worth your time and money. Not for the graphics enthusiasts (though the game isn't what you'd call ugly), but definitely for shooter fans and anyone who wants to see some terrific AI at work.\n\nPros:\nFrenetic, intense, satisying combat\nImpressively smart AI\nGreat music and sound effects\nGenuinely chilling\nNot hard to run nowadays\n\nCons:\nVisuals aren't all that impressive anymore\n\n\n","July 30, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I rushed back to my college dorm to play it and proceeded to freak out to the edge-of-your-seat gameplay and creepy atmosphere. This was before I knew about Steam. I was not able to buy physical copies of the DLC and I was really bummed about that...until I saw they were included with F.E.A.R on Steam! I paid full price for F.E.A.R just so I could get those DLC and I am glad that I did.\nThe game is now 10 years old, and it looks it. However, the gameplay and the story more than make up for the older graphics. The combat is intense, forcing you to fight through tons of soldiers by yourself in order to reach your target. The AI can be pretty annoying sometime since they can figure your tactics, and also freak out when they have realized you took out an entire squad. There is strong language throughout the game. The gore can be intense. Carnage and blood is everywhere and not just from bullets. After the firefights, Alma shows up.\nThe story that surrounds Alma is the reason I recommend this game. This is what I feel sets this game apart from all other FPS's. You have military combat gameplay team up with a seriously creepy and supernatural storyline. It's a terrifying combination. She may be inspired by The Ring and countless other scary movies with little girls with black hair, but she is so original, you won't have any trouble singling her out as one of the scariest forces in video games. FEAR ALMA.\nNow for the DLC. They are not necessary but they are fun to play. Both are similar in length. Each one took me six hours to complete. They are not considered canon but you do learn some interesting things about the Perseus Project and Armacham.\nThis was a great game to play and it got my psyched for the sequel, Thought I have not played an extensive list of FPS's, I believe that this one stands apart for merging a military FPS with psychological horror.","February 4, 2015","true","8.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The atmosphere in this game is absolutely terrifying; dark, gloomy, flickering lights and eerie whispers coming from behind every door and corner you approach. To top it all off, the creepy visions depicting a demonic little girl will give anyone chills. On the other side of things, the creepy atmosphere comes well complimented by a very interesting approach to the shooter-type game. With a myriad of weapons and countless enemies to blow to pieces, and the unique Slo-mo feature, this game blends violence and terror phenomenally, and sometimes both are present simultaneously. My only criticism of the game is it's graphics as it appears quite dated compared to games from its time.

Overall it's a great series to pick up if you enjoy FPS games and want something really cool to play through and enjoy while you do. Unless you are the one single stupid fk who downvoted this because he probably has no idea what a real ♥♥♥♥ing game is nor what the touch of a woman feels like.","June 24, 2013","true","5.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its very fun to run after the last man left and have him flipping out over being the last out of his small group alive. Or to peak around a corner, toss a nade, and watch the AI go into searching and attempt to flank you if your location is known. THe AI love to flank you and sneak up on you. As appose to Bioshock Infinite where the AIs most interesting tactics rely upon running directly at you or just strafing and shooting. To make a point unlike how the AI in that game don't really follow any rules, the AI in FEAR follow a set of rules that make for predictable, repeatable, and interesting scenarios because the AI can't just 360 instantly and start running around shooting. They react realistically and will attempt to gain cover or a flanking position. Predicting that a guy would come through a hallway and then blasting him is extremely pleasant and lets you use tactics back on the enemies. In Binfinite the AI is unpredictable, random, and just a mess in general. Fights don't feel good when you cannot understand and just run around shooting brainless AI until you win.  The AI arn't "smart" in the way some AI are and they cheat, they follow rules and respond to you. That alone is just sooo goood.\n\nIf you like gameplay, FEAR is the type of game you need to play. Its just a classic thats not better objectively than todays games unless you value production value and flash more than actually having fun and enjoyment out of your own on screen actions.\n\nIts a horror game, but its not terribly scary. A few scares scared me, but nothing I would be legit scared for more than a few seconds about. The horror and pschylogical thriller are really just back drops to the great shooting and gameplay and really assist in taking you from area to area without getting bored and while making the game in general more interesting.\n\nIf you don't own FEAR on something whether that be PS3 or PC this is one of the few games you should just play. It really gives you some aspect on how todays games arn't actually made for "Gamers" or people who actually want to play games so much as mainstream casual sheep that wan't to be handed fun points and story and don't understand much more than go from point A to B and shoot all the guys who stand there. I can only imagine there shock when the FEAR AI would come and bring the fight behind them instead of just standing there and letting the player kill them like in todays "Triple A" mastershitpeices.\n\nTL:DR\nIts a fabulous game with terrific AI that dousn't drone on but stays fresh for the entire length while having designs that still trump games a decade nearly after release.","June 3, 2014","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My only complains is that the mutiplayer dosent work but is fixed with Fear Combat. Another issue is that even though it has great atmosphere and very effective soundtrack, the actual horror can sometimes not be scary and some of the horror gags get really old. Its hard to tell which horror element can kill you and they are scripted so if you miss them, you miss them. But this is made up by the game`s DLC Extraction Point.

I'm not going to pretend it's perfect, never really achieving scary and instead settling for something more around "Spookhouse". But the story is what makes it, being a genuinely disturbing tale on a personal level, and being a highly feasible (albeit with psychics) warning about big company politics.\n\nOne of its biggest highlights and at the same time greatest hamperings is its gunplay. Tight, accurate, fun, and blisteringly fast compared to the average FPS it’s just pure good times, and the slo-mo mechanic is probably the best ever implemented. However, the fact that you feel like a walking god is one of the aspects that goes a long way to draining the, er...fear out of the game.\n\nNot the best horror title in the world, but still swings towards "eerie" enough to count, and easily comparable gameplay to many modern shooters.

If you're not good with horror, it's obviously not something I can recommend whatsoever. However, if you play this game for the first time, try to immerse yourself, and you'll hopefully be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I sure was, the first time at least.\n\nConsidering the time it was made, it has held up very well in all aspects, except for visually, but it is generally only noticeable in cutscenes.\n\nThe shooting in this game is very solid, with a few very entertaining weapons, and quite decent expansion packs even. From what I've seen of others playing it, if you have no sense of direction, you will get lost as there is no map or anything obvious pointing you in the right direction. But generally, if nothing has happened or a while, you're probably not going the right way, as F.E.A.R. has minor things happening constantly to keep you alert and informed that you're going the right way.\n\nI'm having a hard time to say anything bad about this game, that's how good it is. But, if you're going into F.E.A.R. expecting a horror masterpiece, sure it's better than the later installments, you will probably not be too impressed. F.E.A.R.  is a very solid first person shooter, with a horror setting, not a horror game with FPS elements.","April 19, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay itself is explosive, so much that you almost always be surprised by the enemy hiding around the corner waiting for you.\n\nThe game transitions well from scene to scene. You could be walking through a dark corridor, haunted by demons and ghosts, and as soon as you turn the next corner, there is a squad of enemy soldiers waiting to open fire on you. The story itself is excellent as it takes you through the game and reveals the history behind what occured before you arrived there.\n\nThis is a solid first person shooter, through and through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/recommended/21090/","Theraintransformed","In-Game DOGG™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/","412 products in account","First Encounter Assault Recon is one of the finest first-person shooters I've ever played, as well as one of my favorite games of all time. The level of distinction in F.E.A.R. cannot be overstated enough, so I'll have no-holds-barred in this review when it comes to praise.\nF.E.A.R. was originally released on PC in 2005, and was later re-released on Steam in 2010 alongside its expansion packs and some other bonus content not present in the original release. The success of the game's original release eventually lead to it being ported to the Xbox 360 in 2006, and to the Playstation 3 in 2007. The game also received two expansion packs after its release, and spawned an entire first-person shooter series, with the latest release being the inauspicious F.E.A.R. 3 in 2011.\nF.E.A.R., named after the similarly-titled emotion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear) is a primarily single-player FPS. However, it had a multiplayer component which unfortunately is now defunct, as Gamespy (the basis of the game's multiplayer service) was shut down in 2013, with the system's game servers going down for good on May 31, 2014. Still though, multiplayer for F.E.A.R. continues through a fan-made network of servers, based here http://www.fearcombat.org/\nAs you may have deduced from the game's title and the review before this point, FEAR is a first-person shooter with psychological horror elements. While the game is not very strong strictly from a horror point of view, FEAR still has a very unique and well-implemented atmosphere, and the horror aspects play a big role in what constitutes FEAR as a whole package, and are part of what makes the game such a distinctive experience.\nNevertheless, FEAR's gameplay is that of a first-person shooter, and plays entirely through a first-person perspective. There are very little if any survival horror or similar non-FPS mechanics in this game, and the use horror does not rely on making the player helpless or vulnerable as in traditional horror games. The primary purpose of FEAR's strong atmosphere is to make the player feel paranoid, as if the threat is something internalized, rather than simply an external force threatening them. To that end, the player has full control of their character throughout the entire game, and is never restricted from fighting normally. FEAR does a good job of getting under the player's skin at many points, and scenarios where the player shoots at perceived noises or things that aren't there ("jumping at shadows", for lack of a better term) are common throughout FEAR. Even if this game doesn't scare you entirely, you'll still be treated quite a number of very neat-looking, well-designed set pieces that serve as bridges between the game's more intense shooting sections. My personal favorite is this one hallway where the ceiling starts bleeding, and the player is killed if the downwardly-expanding river of blood touches them before they reach the exit.\nPerhaps the most impressive part of FEAR (besides the gameplay itself) is the very detailed use of physics and special effects in the game. FEAR is a very high-technology game, even more so given that it was released in 2005. The grand majority of games released today aren't nearly this well-detailed. Objects will react when shot or when in the midst of explosions; lighting will change when light sources are broken; and pieces of walls and cover can be damaged from gunfire, to say the least. The player's body is also present 100% of the time, in all animations, whether they're climbing a ladder, slide-kicking into an enemy, or simply looking downwards. Such a simple feature as being able to see your own body shouldn't be such an impressive feature by today's standards, but unfortunately, very many modern games have a definite lack of detail and effort put into them. FEAR is not one such title.\nNow, as for the gameplay itself: FEAR is a relatively fast-paced first-person shooter, somewhere in-between an arena shooter and something like Half-Life in terms of speed. The player can hold up to three weapons, which they can switch between/swap for other weapons at any point, and they can hold a number of health packs which they can use at any point to heal, as well as a collection of throw-able explosives, including grenades and landmines. The player also has access to a neat albeit somewhat tricky to use melee system, where the player character will do a variety of martial arts moves that can very rapidly disable standard enemies. The most important mechanic in FEAR, as well as one of its main selling points is the ability of the player to slow time at will. This mechanic, aptly called "reflex time", is instrumental to getting through firefights successfully, and provides an excellent context for the player to notice the game's considerable amount of detail in its ballistics and decals even while fighting. Reflex time is also a great help when it comes to getting the upper hand on enemies, as the artificial intelligence in FEAR is extremely advanced. FEAR has been touted as having some of the most advanced AI in video gaming, and this is difficult to question after observing them in actual gameplay.\n"Whoa." - Keanu Reeves on FEAR\nThe way that FEAR relays information and backstory to the player is impressive, as well as a refreshing break from the way most modern games handle storytelling, with large exposition dumps involving poorly-developed, confusingly-motivated characters. To that end, nothing in FEAR is spoon-fed to the player, in neither gameplay nor story. If the player is interested in understanding the story, they need to listen and pay attention to various messages left behind by characters throughout the game, sort of how journal entries work in other games. Everything in this game is given an explanation or history of some sort, and there are few plot holes to be found. Aspects of the story even complement the game at large and make sense when put together with the gameplay or atmosphere, rather than serving as something useless or inconsequential. For example, the main enemies the player fights in the game are made more intelligent and more aware of what they do as on top of being clones of each other, they are also psychically linked to each other.\nPsychic powers are a major theme through FEAR. The majority of the horror set pieces are caused by them, and they're the cause of the game's plot at large. The player has frequent encounters with Alma, the psychic antagonist of the game. Unfortunately though, the player is never given any psychic abilities of their own. They do, however, become a mechanic in later FEAR games, but that's another story.\nAnyway, FEAR is an amazing game from all angles, and I recommend it to everyone, especially people who are looking for a challenging, intense, and unique experience compared to what most games offer. The only bad part is that you never get to kill the fat baѕtard character. Fortunately though, he appears in one of the expansion packs and the player is free to kill him there, so justice IS eventually served.","June 19, 2014","true","39.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I'd describe the overall experience of the game to be pretty poor. It's incredibly linear, featuring corridor after corridor after corridor filled with office props and sick-♥♥♥ dynamic lighting. I've always heard about FEAR having stellar gameplay due to the gunplay mechanics and smart AI but here's how the gameplay usually goes: you walk through corridors, press some switch, walk some more and hear the occasional "kill the bad guy" on your comm link and then maybe you fight some enemy grunts and walk some more. There is a level where you're supposed to run after some annoying fat guy and it was literally corridors - turret - corridors - turret - corridors - two turrets - end of segment. I understand the reasoning behind your character running at an extremely slow speed with no sprinting as it sets a specific horror-ish pace for the game however the entire "horror" aspect of the story seems to be a couple of spooky things happening (which seem to completely go away mid-way through the game). Adding to that, there's no survival horror involved, you always have plenty of ammo and are always maxed out on health kits. That being said, you can still be killed in seconds in a firefight. Speaking of fights, I can't figure out why people are praising the AI so bad in FEAR, 90% of the enemies you encounter are grunts wielding the same guns as you and their behavior reminded me of the soldiers in the first Half-Life who would try to flank you or flush you out with nades and sometimes run away from the fight for their own sake. Usually you would just enable slow-mo and mow most of them down and then deal with the rest with the arsenal available to you. The game also completely lacks music at some points and it may take away some of the joy from shootouts.\nOverall, FEAR is and should be mostly praised for its gameplay as its other aspects are downright horrible apart from the visuals (although they mostly consist of the same environments), if praised at all. In my opinion the gameplay could be improved so much if Monolith completely ditched the plot narrative, uninteresting story and cardboard characters. If you're attempting to create John Woo-styled gunplay mechanics then make the movement faster and add more "run and gun" options for people to play around with.\nIMO: FEAR is still worth checking out for its dirt cheap price despite its flaws and problems.","October 25, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

F.E.A.R. 3 was interesting but I wasn't as immersed within the plot as compared to this game.

Not in the sense thats its a bad game but because its the first and there are a few issues i'd like to address that would determine wether or not you buy this game. First of all the amount of time it takes to beat this game on normal is around i'd say 5 hours if youre truly speed running and not exploring the levels or dying. The main reason why I disliked this game and preferred fear 2 is it feels like a movie thats dragging on for too long and your bored (Batman vs Superman am I right?) This is a game you should play off and on when you feel like to full immerse yourself into the atmosphere of the dark corridors and paranormal encounters. Secondly  the gameplay is fairly decent and the enemy AI is pretty smart and they've got some humorous voice chatter; Though there are times you will die from a bunch of enemys swarming  you and the limited amount of supplies you're given (this brings another issue) The main problem with fear is the gameplay mechanics are annoying and somewhat limited: There are some melee moves and cool kicks you can do, but it felt like there should have been more punching moves or silent finishers instead just knocking someone in the back of the head with your gun. Another problem is the annoying armor system in this game and how it barley protects you and also the limited amount they give you in some chapters. This can all be changed though with slow motion, because of its ability to help you get to cover and do other cool things such as upgrading the duration. The flashlight is horrindously bad because of the really short lifespan, now ill give it credit because of the horror aspect but it doesnt really do anything because of the not so scary jump scares, there were only two that got me mostly due to good placement and the atmospheric music putting me on edge(the not so scary jumpscares are fault because of the dated graphics, if I played this in 2005 maybe it would have surprised me but in 2016 it doesn't do anything.) The weapons are decent by far and are the only thing that breathes life into killing the same enemies over and over again but once you findthem all it gets boring. Lastly the story isnt as bad as some other reviewers would say, yes its cheesy because it feels like one of those generic sci fi movies but i'd put the plot above most generic shooters because this game was made in a different year. Its ok but it really improves in fear 2. What the game does right is provide an atmosphere that keeps you on your gaurd the whole time and really consider wether or not you want to take cover or run it and gun it, and the new enemie types do put stress on you while trying to figure out how to quickly kill it; Though once the technique is figured out it loses that. The replayablity isnt there though because of how long this game is even on normal but its something good to come back too if your in the mood spending awhile playing this. Like I said in the beginning its better to buy this on sale, plus it comes with two other games; one is just another mission which serves as a prequel to fear 2 and the other is a different squad you play in.","May 22","true","8.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

One of my first horror games to the Xbox 360 when it was released back in 2006. What I remember is that I never dared to complete the game. But now, eight years later, I finally picked up the F.E.A.R. Collection to embark on a nostalgia trip. Before giving the full review I recommend buying each game individually and skip the colleciton. You save a few pennies by this.\n\nF.E.A.R. is a very old school shooter; the days when shooters still was quite new and shiny compared to modern shooters of today. To be aged, the game is actually quite acceptable to today's standards. Even though the melee can be a little slow at times the reflex-system, or adrenaline system makes up to any flaws. What is better than to be able to slow down time for a few seconds to see the enemy flying backwards in a wave of gore? And the shooting in general feels very fluid; I would rate the shooting in F.E.A.R. to have much higher standard than your regular Call of Duty game out there. Just enough variation in the choice of weapons. But bare in mind you can only carry up to three weapons, so choose wisely.\n\nOverall level design and atmosphere is the icing on the cake for F.E.A.R. They have managed to get in the perfect moments for something bizarre to happen. This game is indeed focusing alot on the scare factor and contain tons of scare tactics not for the player with a weak heart. To be honest the intimidation factor is not extremely high as in some modern horror titles. But it contains just enough horror for you to be paranoid around every corner. They did a fantastic job of designing the main antagonist Alma Wade. She will jump at you a dozen times. The only negative factor I can think of kind of ruining the atmosphere from time to time is the A.I. They can sometimes create some hilarious glitches and just be weird in general. But that's probably the price we must take to play an old game.\n\nAll in all this is a great experience. Not for the faint of heart. Old school classic shooter with very well designed scare and horror factors. The visuals are unexpectedly good for a game of this age and live way over some of today's shooters. I think all horror and shooter gamers will very likely love this series.","September 22, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

In addition the main character is not too much of a super hero yet so you have roughly the same hitpoints as the soldiers you kill. It's fun, it's creepy, it's FEAR. The main game will run you 7-10 hours, EP 1 about 5 and I have not gone though EP 2 yet.\n\nThe expansions are deemed Noncanon by the company that went on to make Fear 2 and 3; Characters that die in the expansions continue to appear in the series. Though I was told if I ignore the deathes for the most part the expansions still apply.\n\nAlma. That is the name of the creepy girl that you will see often throughout the series. Like any rage-stricken ghost her motives in the first game are completely nonsensical. Sometimes she kills good guys, sometimes badguys. Sometimes she makes things worse, sometimes better. Some times she wants to protect you, the next thing you know specters are trying to rip out your intenstines. In the first expansion pack she even seemed to be temporarily at peace after bombarding the player with hellish visions, what triggered the peace still confuses me as all the player does is traverse to the other side of a morgue.\n\nI only have two complaints. Complaint one is: There is no contractor in the world good enough at his job not getting fired for the monstrocity that is the floor planning of every single building in Auburn. Kitchens become bathrooms become dining halls become maturnity wards and suddenly you may even drop into a sewer or elevator. This often left me disjointed and confused in terms of what direction I should be going even though I never seemed to get stuck enough to warrant a walkthrough. FEAR Obeys 90's shooter laws. Climbing into Vents is often a brilliant and eerily safe idea, side rooms typically have loot, and red valves are usable.\n\nSecond complaint. It's hinted throughout the game that the Point Man is more or less safe from Alma's outbursts. Of course she can and will kill you a few times but she has her reasons. But this seriously undermines her presence after completing FEAR and moving on to the first expansion.  The second expansion and Fear 2 have a different protagonist so this is more of a gripe about expansion 1's design.","January 7, 2014","true","9.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

This is a review meant to evaluate the modern day take on this game, and how it functions on modern hardware.\n\nFirst Encounter Assault Recon, better known as F.E.A.R., is a cult classic title that is now over a decade old. Originally released in 2006 on Xbox 360, 2007 on Playstation 3, and 2005 on PC DVD, the game puts you in the role of a nameless F.E.A.R. Operative who is assigned the task of evaluating how, and why, the team that was sent in previous to infiltrate an aerospace compound was obliterated. Little did anyone know that such a malevolent, paranormal force would be the root cause. This title was finally released on Steam in 2010, much to the excitement of its cult following.\n\nWith over 3,000 positive reviews on Steam alone, it's impossible to deny that the game is a real hit with audiences. I remember back in 2006 when the game first released, I had a difficult time finding a physical copy for my 360; when I finally found one, housed in a battered case and without a booklet, I felt like I had found a holy grail of some sort. I popped it into my console, and had to stop only a few levels in due to just how badly the game scared me despite having played games such as Silent Hill 2 and 3, and many of the Resident Evil titles. I never finished it back then, so I set out to do so now, and to see how much the horror stacked up with today's standards.\n\nThe main story centers around a small girl of about 8 years old named Alma Wade. You discover her origins, along with your own, throughout the campaign. However, the narrative is hard to follow at times and can become quite confusing until much later in the 12 chapters, known as Intervals, that you will play through. There are phones throughout the game that you can check for voicemails, as well as laptops that are scattered about which house bits and pieces of information that is essential to piece together the primary plot. Your character will also be subjected to hallucinations, which are the primary source of terror in this action-horror hybrid.\n\nF.E.A.R. has this overwhelming atmosphere to it, and it's primarily driven by both the dynamic, eerie lighting effects and creepy, unsettling soundtrack. As far as horror games are concerned, this one has one of the absolute best soundtracks that I can recall. The musical score ranges from subtle ambiance, cinema quality horrorscapes, and rushing, adrenaline infused beats. It changes as consistently as the tone of the game itself, which can go from slow terror to fast action in the blink of an eye. However, that fact can also be used as the only real downfall of the game. Each time you are set up for a truly terrifying experience, the title turns around and throws a slew of enemies at you right afterward instead of letting you enjoy the scares.\n\nThe game does have its fair share of gore driven, blood soaked sections that will cause your heart beat to increase, but by today's standards of horror, the actual scare factor of F.E.A.R. has not aged well. While I remember white-knuckling the controller back in 2006, I have to admit that I didn't feel anything but the intensity of the action sections ten years later. I also recognized so many areas where they could have utilized the horror aspect of this game, where instead they chose to have either nothing or a small army of foes. Graphically, the game has aged incredibly well; it even looks better than a lot of indie titles that came out just last week. Two of the major selling points for F.E.A.R. back in 2006 were the dramatic lighting effects, which are still gorgeous to look at today, and the well-boasted about enemy A.I. Surprisingly enough, I'd forgotten how in-depth the enemy A.I. is in this game, and it has also held up well over the years and even surpasses many current gen titles.\n\nDuring this modern age, F.E.A.R. has unfortunately ran into a slew of performance issues, which is why I am giving this PC version a thumbs down. During my 5 hour playthrough, I had to restart my game every 8-11 minutes because the framerate would drop from 200+ (or 60, if I had V-Sync enabled), to 11-12. The game would stay at this low rate until it was rebooted. I also had to turn off Steam Overlay to even achieve more than 12 FPS. Other people are experiencing crashing issues, although the only one that I had was when the game initially booted up and tried to auto-configure performance options. Other than these major issues which have obviously come with OS and software advancement, the game runs great and is flawlessly optimized; it'll even run at 4K resolution without a hitch.\n\nAll in all, F.E.A.R. has aged like a fine wine or whiskey, and it's still definitely worth playing today; just not on PC if you want to get the most out of the immersion it has to offer. If you don't mind dealing with restarting the game every 10 minutes, or the possibility that you may be one of the many who are now experiencing crashing, then I'd recommend picking this one up during a Summer or Holiday sale. Otherwise, scour the bargain bins or local used game shops to find it on your console of choice. As well, don't go in expecting to be scared stiff, as us gamers have experienced far scarier titles in the last decade. The action, immersion, and story are still well worth being ensnared by.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 13","false","5.2"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","8","21","0","6"

But it certainly isn't one of the better games I've played. I went into F.E.A.R. with high expectations, because almost everyone was saying that this game was amazing. But, and I'm NOT sorry to say, I was rather disappointed with this game.\n\nThe gameplay isn't anything special. The gunplay is actually pretty bad. There are games much older than this, such as the Half-Life games, with much better gunplay, and the slow-motion just gets repetitive after a while. Put simply, walking through corridors and shooting the same soldiers in slow-mo every few minutes gets old pretty fast.\n\nThe level design is some of the laziest I've ever seen. Nothing but dimly-lit grey corridors. And that's your lot!\n\nThen, there's the story... Or lack thereof. Throughout the game, I had no freaking clue what was going on or what I was fighting for. The game makes no clear explanation as to what you're doing, or why. You're just placed in these random places and shoot ♥♥♥♥, with the occasional paranormal... thingie that comes out of nowhere. There is ZERO narrative!\n\nNone of the characters were even remotely memorable. Most of them only make appearances that last mere minutes. I only remember one name, Norton Mapes. As for the main character, he was just some generic mute. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nAlso, this game is pretty short! I managed to beat it in less than ten hours. And this was a full-priced game at launch? Inexcusable.\n\nThe one thing I give this game credit for though is the enemy AI. For a game from 2005, the enemy AI is top tier. The soldiers react almost instantly to your presence, even at small things like your flashlight, and their accuracy is pixel-perfect. They don't miss a single shot at all! But that's just about the only thing this game has going for it, really.\n\nOverall, I think this game is seriously overrated. It's gameplay wasn't anything special, the story was crap, and it was ridiculously short. But I have played worse. It isn't horrible, but it certainly hasn't aged well and I wouldn't play it again.","March 18","false","9.7"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","5","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jzayn/recommended/21090/","Jzayn","Mantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jzayn/","38 products in account","F.E.A.R. is a standard first-person shooter that uses bullet time—that’s honestly all it is—which came as quite a surprise to me after reading the widespread reviews lauding it as one of the greatest shooters of all time. The plot is the typical what-has-science-done, with an Evil Corporation (as if there were any other kind in video games) in pursuit of engineering super soldiers. So a psychic military commander sends his puppet soldiers to take over Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, a warehouse emporium of weaponry, medikits, and indestructible office equipment. Enter the nameless, mute protagonist, as part of a special army unit designed to face paranormal threats, and his squad mates, who are consistently separated, injured, and subject to all manner of contrived reasons to keep them from interrupting the solo FPS design. “You’re just going to send him in alone???” the radio crackled for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe gunplay was praised again and again as being spectacular, but it’s just a typical FPS experience. F.E.A.R.’s own iteration of the arsenal with which any FPS fan is familiar functions exactly as expected, with one exception; kicking people is far more damaging than multiple machine gun rounds piercing through their torsos. The only distinguishing feature of the gameplay is its infinitely accessible bullet time mode, which trivializes every encounter throughout the entire game, even on the hardest difficulty. Shifting in and out of bullet time mid combat is pretty, but nothing near the level of mind-blowing so universally spouted from critics. It is by no means bad; it’s decent, but only that.\n\nEnemy AI was next on the list of sheer adulation, and was claimed to be “some of the best AI in shooter history.” Imagine my surprise when armored soldiers, who make up 80 percent of the game’s enemies, loudly proclaimed through their megaphone helmets that they were throwing a grenade at me, which then detonated two feet in front of them. I don’t remember if any of them ever did manage to hit me with a grenade, but I do know they were constantly informing me of what they were going to do, or how many of them I had killed. And for some reason, whether I was hiding behind a box, retreating, or charging head on, they would constantly shout at me, “HE’S TRYING TO FLANK US!” It’s not their fault, I suppose; someone built their armor with megaphones in the helmets… but weren’t they supposed to be psychically coordinated soldiers?\n\nI did begin to feel a certain attachment to these armored soldiers, for all their loud, bumbling ineptness. There were many times they could’ve had the drop on me, if only they had not shouted, “♥♥♥♥!!!” or something like that when they spotted me. At one point, an armored truck full of them tried to run me over, but when I moved out of the way, they just kept driving, right off a building. Sometimes one of them would shout to the other, “TAKE COVER!!!” to which the other, surrounded by hallways, doors, tables, and walls, would scream, “I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO GO!!!” I even started to let them have all the time they needed to awkwardly wiggle underneath fences or clamber over walls in plain sight of me before I gunned them down.\n\nOf course, no review of F.E.A.R. would be complete without mentioning the horror, something which critics across the board have deemed bowel-voidingly scary. But it just wasn’t. Throughout the game, several hallucinations occur that are supposed to be unsettling, but 99 percent of them can’t actually hurt you. With no real effect upon the player, and no way to interact with them, the visions take on a haunted house ride kind of feel—spooky happenings just outside the safety of a cart on tracks. I found myself startled once or twice upon turning around to see a little girl just behind me, but when I discovered that I could move toward and back away from her indefinitely to raise and lower the volume of the scary violins, I couldn’t help but laugh.\n\nThe ever popular mechanism of discovered audio tapes takes the form of voicemails, but the majority of them are poor voice actors reading aloud passive aggressive corporate squabbles. They failed to flesh out the story to any further degree than what-has-science-done; the game as a whole never delivers on its narrative. Ambiguity is a useful tool in crafting horror, but F.E.A.R.’s story remains largely undeveloped by the end of the game. I think some developers wanted to make a standard action shooter but were also into Japanese horror films, so the result was a standard action shooter with Japanese horror elements that might as well have been delivered from a TV screen.\n\nI will close with some of the non spoiler questions this game has left me to consider on my sleepless nights. Firstly, why do dead bodies sometimes randomly fly through windows, and why are there so many in the ceilings? ATC headquarters was taken over by psychically controlled soldiers, right? How did they even get the bodies up there in the first place? Or was it the little girl? Was she just stuffing them up through the tiles so they could conveniently fall down as I passed? And why does the protagonist spontaneously combust when he falls into pits? I did it several times out of disbelief, but sure enough, just before the screen went black, orange flames engulfed my entire body. What exactly are those shinless, tan men who float into me and pop like a fleet of suicidal balloons? And why do the armored soldiers sometimes blast off like rockets when I shoot them in bullet time mode? Machine gun fire shouldn’t send an armored body rocketing across a room, bouncing off walls and screaming.\n","May 16","false","8.3"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","20","3","15","3","0"

As usual, it’s hard to decide whether to recommend or not when I know others will not be as bothered by certain things as I am, but it is my review after all so here are my issues with FEAR:\n\n1.	It did not age well. The sky looks terribly flat and the level design consists mostly of gray corridors.\n2.	The game clearly has 2 gimmicks which it wants you to see as soon as possible: the slow-motion effect and flashy gun particle effects.  That is its thing, its selling point and it’s not enough to make a whole game. The game becomes boring after a while.\n3.	The girl from The Ring. The story of FEAR is actually not that bad but the antagonist is clearly the little girl from The Ring horror film and, again, it feels too on the nose.\n4.	The gameplay is the ultimate example of a classic PC first-person shooter where you have a health bar that goes down as enemies hit you, and the enemies WILL hit you the very moment they see you from a mile away, which feels unnatural. In a shooter like this, the game becomes about the health bar management and I hate that gamy feel.\n\nThe good stuff: well, some of the jump scares are quite creative and overall the graphics are not the worst I guess.\nThe AI, despite the annoying super-accuracy and reflexes, is quite smart. Enemies will throw grenades at your last known position and jump over obstacles (smarter than some of the modern AI in games).\n\nIN CONCLUSION, I bet it was cool in its day but I am getting incredibly tired of this game. And to prove that this is not just about this being an old game, I am also playing Doom 3 that was released a year earlier and it is a way more interesting game despite having many similar problems.\n\nUpdate: I uninstalled the game and feel sooo much better now. I was forcing myself to give another try because it is a well-known game, but holy moly, am I happy I don't have to play that grey goo anymore.","October 31, 2015","false","5.3"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","2","15","0","2"

Not on the level of Half-Life 2 or anything, but, people loved it! They always talked about how good it was. The horror elements were well done, the enemy AI was fantastic, the shooting was super great, and the graphics were amazing. You had to have a pretty beefy computer to play this game.\n\nMaybe back in 2005. Because, man has this game aged poorly. Like, really poorly.\n\n\nNot only does the game look... bad. It’s really not that fun either, sorry to say. Now this is probably due to the fact that I have ten years of games between the release of F.E.A.R. and now to compare it to. I can definitely see how, at the time, F.E.A.R. would have blown my thirteen year old mind. But as it stands, in 2015, F.E.A.R. is very underwhelming. It feels like a pretty standard shooter, with some cool bullet time and horror elements thrown in.\n\nI’m sure if I could force myself to play more I would probably get something out of it. But as of four hours into the game all I’ve done is: run through long hallways murdering puppet soldiers in an industrial complex, and an office building, while occasionally being frightened by a little girl. And... she doesn’t show up all that much, sadly.\n\nTo be fair, there were moments where I was genuinely enjoying myself. Rolling up on fools with a shotgun and slo-mo sliding into them while tearing them to shreds with buckshot is really cool. Like the first 50 times. Then it just becomes an easy “I win” button. Now, the horror aspects of this game were the main draw for me. And trust me, they can be genuinely disturbing and definitely made me jump more than once. But, as you play through the game you can see the seams at the edges of the experience. After about two hours I could tell when the game was going to go from ‘action’ to ‘horror’ just by level design.\n\nBig well lit area funneling into a small dark hallway? Scare incoming. Better turn on my flashlight!\n\nEventually I just got bored with the game. There wasn’t enough of the creepy to keep me interested, and the ten year old shooting and level design weren’t doing F.E.A.R. any favors.\n\nI honestly spent a large chunk of my four hours trying to figure out where the hell I was supposed to go. Which is the weird thing, because this game is quite linear. Sadly it’s very easy to get turned around, and everything looks the same… Plus sometimes the level designers expected you to intuit where to go without any indication. I felt like I was playing Duke Nukem, or Doom, considering how many times a seemingly decorative A/C vent was actually the way forward.\n\nI hear this game gets pretty crazy towards the end, but I can’t bring myself to continue any further. I wanted to try and complete every game I reviewed for this project… but, I don’t really want to spend anymore time on this one. Especially considering I have over one hundred more to do.\n\nI think the coolest part of F.E.A.R. is probably the firefights. Although the shooting is rather lackluster compared to today, the effects of your combat are really cool. Glass will break, the walls, floor, and ceiling will have large chunks blown out of them. And large amounts of dust, that actually lingers, will be kicked up. It forces you to move around, and looked really cool. Plus the bloody aftermath was always satisfying...\n\nThe dust tech is the most impressive part of this game to me. Seriously.\n\nHonestly, this game reminds me a lot of Psi-Ops, an old game for the PS2. It revolved around a paranormal military task force fighting against another paranormal military group. It had all of the same hyper violence, weird psychic powers, creepy horror segments, and strange meat puppet soldiers. Expect I played it at the time... so I liked it.\n\nIt’s not that FEAR is bad… It’s just like an old movie. It was amazing when it came out! It’s just, going back and looking at it compared to ‘modern’ releases, it just doesn’t hold up.\n\nLuckily I picked F.E.A.R. up on sale for like $2.75.

This game will never be as good as most would have you believe. I love horror shooters, and this one was not so good. Sure, Alma was creepy, and some of the scares were sorta effective, but damn, there are other better games that have much more of an impact than this. Plus the sequels were just as bad, if not worse.

Well, its great, but in negative way. They are using covers, supressing fire, even retreating sometimes. But they never stood a chance against me (i played on high difficulty and dint die once) Monolith developed not just a "great" Ai, but immitation of Ai. Guys, we never been fooled hard before... Great job Monolith!\nGraphics are awesome for its times, game was made in 2005. But lightning disturbed me a little, it wasnt scary it was kinda ugly and annoying sometimes.\nHorror part of the game - it didnt exist. Another thing Monolith fail to deliver. This creature just stand there tried to scare me and my reaction was "Ahaha what the ♥♥♥♥ is this?! :D".\nWell, gameplay is quite simple, because its a "horror" shooter game (which is not scary at all) You shoot those clowns which happens to be some sort of clones of your own brother who gone rogue and you need to kill the prick, ahaha.\nYou start alone, because developers cant make decent npcs coop for you and just killed everyone in the start.

I was going into the thought of...I remember this game getting the best of reviews I'm sure it is going to be a great horror game. I was completely wrong and you will too if thinking this. This game's horror basis is jump scares. That is all and they come few and far between. The fact that you have to constantly press x like its some kind of starcraft game for the flashlight is beyond annoying throughout the game. You will get lost in this game. The enemies are way too easy and the guns are unbalanced, pistols should not destroy an army within one clip. They try to church it up with some humor with the fat engineer "newman" and it just comes off as tasteless and unneeded. The game really jumped the shark when a freakin mech randomly showed up and started shooting rockets.. like really? I have never felt this ill towards a game before but this takes the cake especially for how high it is rated. I should of stopped there but no, This game will give cheap free to play korean mmo's a better experience due to the number of crappy fetch quests you do throughout each mission.

Controls work, but are a little awkward in comparison to others in the same genre.  Graphically, it looks quite good for such an old game.  Graphics options (via the menus) are very limited.  Changing the FOV requires you to edit the config files.  Not the end of the world, but annoying none the less.  The difficulty is exceptionally low however (I suspect this is because it was primarily a console shooter), and should pose little challenge to anyone with even a moderate exposure to FPS games.

I thought the second was a great game, and usually games that come after are usually ♥♥♥♥ on a stick by comparison. However, this doesn't seem to be the case, I'm glad they learned from their mistakes here for their second game, but the checkpoint method (although useful) is so obtrusive, if you're trying to get a horror game, make sure it's immersive so as to keep the person feeling like they're actually in some danger, rather than stopping the game completely so you can save. Nothing takes you out of a game more than the entire game stopping mid stride to save and F.E.A.R does this perfectly. Not only this, but the combat is completely ♥♥♥♥, I know it's an older game, but there is literally no indicator for being hit by a bullet other than your life meter way down in the corner (which in the heat of combat you wouldn't even glance at) and because of this, you just die, outright, I didn't even think that the enemies were hitting me, what couldn't make a hitting noise? Even a little red spot on the screen when a bullet hit you? Hell even after it hit you just something to ♥♥♥♥ing show you just got shot, nobody just keeps walking when they get shot as if nothing happened.\n\nAs old a game as it is, it's really nothing I'd recommend to anyone, and I don't own a pair of nastalgia goggles large enough to see this as a shiny turd even.","July 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 20 people (5%) found this review helpful","5","1","20","0","1"

This game has such an amazing concept but it's expressed too poorly. F.E.A.R is a first person survival horror experience that is praised by gamers for years. I've only played a decent 3 hours on this game but I know a lot about it and understand the plot and gameplay. There are many things positive about this game....don't get me wrong but this shooter has done so many things idiotic to make it a bad experience for gamers like myself. The plot and storyline are great, expressing a horror theme, inspired by Japanese horror. The use of noise is executed nicely but there is nothing creative about the location this game takes place. Throughout the game you run around bleak buildings that hardly contain any color and the outdated graphics don't do any justice as well. The game isn't suspensful at all and only contains a few scary moments (the ladder part). Other then that you just have predictable jumpscares, blurry images popping up on your screen or someone sprinting by you in the distance. Nothing else is rememberable.. even with Alma and her visions. Her parts are only disturbing, never scary or suspensful which is upsetting since shes a big part of the storyline. The shooting is mediocore and it shouldn't be praised for being average. The bots are also not realistic at all, hardly presenting any movement making the game feel like a old arcade shooter. The reflex time element is creative but it's not nesscary to use, making it utterly pointless. The things that make this game good aren't woven together in a proper way which showcases the things negative about the game. There is nothing special about bleak locations and predicatble faces on your screen. 4.5/10","April 24, 2015","false","3.3"," 1 of 20 people (5%) found this review helpful","5","1","20","0","0"

Even on normal difficulty this game can be pretty tough if you don't find the ammo or healthpacks that you WILL need, but after dropping to easy difficulty, it was near impossible to die and the FPS aspect got really boring.

I run Windows 8, which I know many of you don't like but it was the only operating system available to me at the time, and I've never had an issue running any games except for maybe a few minor graphical issues in Sim City 4.  F.E.A.R. starts up with the standard copyright and logo screens, but when I get to the Nvidia logo it freezes.  Sometimes I can reach the log out feature on my computer, but most of the time I have to restart my computer because the game either stops me from reaching any other options or it keeps me from using task manager.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure F.E.A.R. can potentially be a fun game.

The developers did a great job of mimicking a John Woo film with bullets ripping through walls, debris flying every which way, and soldiers getting bicycle kicked to the head in slow motion.\n\nA big influence on the story was Japanese horror, which means a poorly treated woman with long, dark, face covering hair, and a penchant for aerobics is out for revenge by paranormal means. Horror, when done right, can be an intense thing, but it just doesn't work here. Too much time is spent making the player feel like a bad ♥♥♥.

Many times I would hear this creepy sound coming in, then look around for something scary and see a figure walking around a wall. Oooh.\n\nAs a shooter, I like the way the guns work and the bullet-time reflex slomo stuff is fun to play around with. As a story, I thought it was interesting but not compelling. As for gameplay in general, there is a lot of backtracking and it can be frustrating walking around looking for the exit to the next section. The enemies are boring with the occasional "boss" every once in a while. No monsters or scary things to shoot at here - just soldiers. Lots and lots of soldiers.\n\nThe game took me about me about 8 hours to finish on normal difficulty. Overall, if you're looking for a shooter you can play when you want to shoot stuff, this game is pretty fun. The slomo fighting is probably the best part of the game. If you're looking for a horror game, don't bother with this one. It isn't scary and doesn't really have a lot of horror actually in it. There's a bunch of blood and skeletons but nothing actually horrifying.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nHorror: 4/10\nStory: Didn't really pay attention. I was too busy waiting for scares, lol. Pretty predictable, 5/10 maybe.","October 26, 2014","false","8.7"," 11 of 44 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","11","44","0","1"

At first the combat was fast and intense and had a really cool slow-motion function, until I realized that the next five hours were exactly the same. The game became blisteringly boring. The horror isn't scary, the graphics are mediocre, the combat is repetative (slow-mo, shoot them all, back to real time), the story is painfully under developed with so much potential, the maps are confusing and almost maze-like, its easy with no dificulty increase. Overall I would give it a 5/10 simply because it became so repetative I just got too bored to be interested. I also want to add that I hve no idea why this game would be tagged or considered a 'horror game.' The atmosphere is non-existent, mostly due to poor lighting, there are no scary enemies or monsters. The only thing that scared me was...wait...nothing scared me. The 'horror' aspect was entirely made of jumpscare...al three or four of them. The amount of shooting the same 2 models of guys un the same corridor in the same building with the same guns for over five hours made the 'scary' parts so insignificant I can't see why they didn't just remove them. No to mention Half-Life 2 came out a year before this and is better in literally every aspect, I can't believe this game is so popular.","January 3, 2015","false","5.7"," 8 of 37 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","8","37","3","0"

Here's how it works, you walk around the corner, see bad guys, activate bullet time, kill bad guys, repeat for 6 hours.\nLevels are bland sequences of empty corridors with no real atmosphere or character to them.\n\nGood points: AI is pretty decent, graphics and effect were pretty good for it's time, story is interesting enough but it's told in such a way you won't care about it at all, since all the ingame characters are kindergarden level of "black guy", "fat guy", "asian chick" and offcourse "radio boss man".\n\nAll in all go play Duke 3D or something.","September 8, 2014","false","7.2"," 5 of 30 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","5","30","0","0"

But i don't know if i like the graphics or not. Mostly you're walking around in office spaces and plain corridors and suddenly you might be outside for awhile. Common soldiers to kill. And suddenly you encounter killing machines, and then you arent? It's like plain.. cool!... plain... cool!\nYou easily take damage if you run into things, and this is where your slo-mo ability comes to use, which replenish when not in use. Weapons are OK i guess, but i didn't always find a clear distinction of what worked best in a situation.\nThis is one of those hard to understad stories, but it was still kinda interesting. Not that i was 100% sure what was going on all the times, but i it seems to have a complicated backstory, which is cool.\n\nSome of the biggest problems were level design flaws that could make you stuck and looking for that "hidden" ventilation to get further. I personally had some lag-issues after awhile, which were fixed by resetting the game. Not sure what was up with that.\n\nThis game felt kinda like Half-Life in the gameplay. It's an OK game.

But anyway, I bought the Platinum Collection awhile back, and even though the expansions are non-canon now, they're still a blast to play through.\n\nThe base game however? Best game I've ever played. Amazing shooting mechanics, smart and responsive A.I., very dark and interesting story that doesn't result in just mindless shooting, intense atmosphere and it has some really really good scares. And also, the graphics have aged surprsingly well! I remember at launch this game was a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to run!\n\nIf you search around, there IS a way to get the multiplayer working, but it was obviously a lot better when it was still supported. It was super simple multiplayer (TDM, DM, CTF etc.) where you just pick one of 6 extremely well balanced guns and go. Also had incredible maps, dedicated servers, all the things a good multiplayer community needed. ♥♥♥♥ing incredible game. 10/10 would play again and again.","December 31, 2012","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is awesome. It is not that scary, but creepy. 10/10 worth playing.\n\nExtraction Point: I am disappointed to the sequel of F.E.A.R. where it is so short, it is a 4-5 hour game. The pshycological expereience has just been upgrade, it is must scarier than the original base F.E.A.R. game. 8/10 notthing to be excited about, but a good sequel for the base game.\n\nPerseus Mandate: This is on a different timeline where you play as Seargeant instead of Point Man. This game takes place the same time you see the ATC assassinate a civilian (forgot the name). I got a few scares here and there so the pshycological  horror of the game has made a great improvement. Lots of gun blazing than the other 2 games. I believe this game is better than the last 2, as it is much longer than the Extraction Point game, but a bit shorter than the base game itself. 10/10\n\nOverall, this is not a miss, it is a must have if you are a fan of horror games.","June 16, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally think HL2 is better overall, but they're both great games and FEAR excels in areas where HL2 falls short in comparison.\n\nPROS:\nExcellent enemy AI\nGreat pacing\nGreat enemy encounters\nGreat lighting\nWeapons*\nBullet time mechanic is fun to use (I'M SHOOTING ROCKETS OUT OF THE AIR HOLY ♥♥♥♥)\nSpooky at times (if you're into that)\n\nCONS:\nVery linear gameplay\nMap design is not great**\nSpooky at times (if you're not into that)\nThe shading has not aged well\n\n* I love the weapons in this game, particularly some of the more unorthodox guns you come across later on.  They all feel appropriately powerful, and bullet impacts kick up dust and blow giant chunks into walls like you would not believe (it is incredibly satisfying).  That being said, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the weapon sounds do not hold up by comparison, especially when compared to the audio from HL2.\n\n** The maps are very labyrinthian; there's only one path from the start of a level to its end, and the path you take between encounters with enemies doesn't make very much sense in a narrative sense.  I frequently forgot where I was supposed to be heading, and relied on the presence of enemies to guage my progress through the level.  Occasionally the path taken will fork, and the player can find extra supplies or upgrades if both routes are explored, but the slow walking speed makes this tedious (routinely, I would walk halfway down one path, and then halfway down the other, until I figured out which one was the critical path).  I can't complain too much, since this is standard for this kind of shooter, but it is still a negative aspect.\n\nOverall its a great game, and if you can overlook the somewhat poor level design you will find a shooter which has aged magnificently.","December 22, 2012","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a Horror-style game from 2005, is it worth playing?\n\nAs a game from 2005, it may be a little dated for modern gamers. Yet, despite being old, it isn't unbearable, and sometimes it's outright good. Dynamic lighting is something even modern games lack, yet FEAR manages to make a lot of atmospheric design choices that make you overlook the actual quality of the graphics. The level design, use of shadows, and the sound all make up for a dated look.\n\nSpeaking of sound, the audio in this game is often fantastic. Bullets rip through the air, footsteps can reveal enemy positions, and the 'horror' moments of the game are made all the more tense because of the audio.\n\nDoes it work as a horror game?\n\nUnlike a game such as Amnesia, FEAR is a horror game where you are armed and capable of defeating potential menaces, which reduces the amount of raw tension usually present in horror titles. In fact, it would be more accurate to say that it is an FPS game with horror elements, much akin to Dead Space. If you enjoyed Dead Space, FEAR is very similar, with slightly less emphasis on Sci-Fi and a little more on the modern paranormal. FEAR also crosses territories with Half-Life in terms of look, feel, and storytelling; combat is often done in narrow halls, yet they are not so constricted that something cannot sneak up behind you, or that there isn't a different angle to attack from.\n\nThe game's difficulty is also somewhat irregular, though not necessarily in a bad way. At normal difficulties, enemies are easy to rip through, but can return the pain quite well. A bad grenade, a turn taken too fast, or being snuck up on can leave a player with a third of their health gone in an instant - and that's on the normal difficulty. However, smart use of the character's "Slo-mo" power, attentiveness to surroundings, and smart use of the game's more powerful weapons (proximity grenades are excellent for covering your back and alerting you to a flank) will make the game seem easy to the point where the player will not take damage for long periods of time. Since difficulty can be changed in-game, you are free to set it to hard (or very-hard), but normal will be enough for most players.\n\nAre there jump scares? Yes, and they will shock you into wasting your ammo, I guarantee it. However, with only one or two exceptions, most of them are harmless to the protagonist; trying to predict them just makes you more tense. Both the severity and frequency of cheap scares go down near the mid-game though, allowing players to focus on the action and the brief bits of story (though I have to admit, some of those scares were fun in retrospect).\n\nIf you want a more modern, darker Half-Life 1 and you enjoyed the kind of tension Dead Space offered, FEAR is probably right up your alley.\n\nAh! One more thing; there is an FPS issue for those using Logitech mice/keyboards. Go to your Device Manager and switch off anything labeled "HID-Compliant Device." Don't touch anything that doesn't say exactly that. There should be guides to help you if that's not enough. But yes, if you're wondering why your shiny new computer isn't giving you crisp FPS on a game from 2005, that's why.","December 14, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of horror and fps games and have not yet played this I highly recommend it. I've played through the campaign twice and I still get scares from it. To be specific though the horror isn't psychological it's mostly jump scares but like any decent horror movie it will have you expecting something to pop out when there's nothing there and it will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you when you least expect it even if only for a few seconds. Having said that the game does tend see saw between action and horror in the early stages. A lot of people say the ability to slow down time makes the game too easy, but it's entirely optional and on the highest difficulty you'll find plenty of challenge the enemies do a lot of damage and you can't take a lot.\n\nThe game has aged very well almost 10 years later the AI is still as good or better than the AI in new release games, enemies will run away and regroup if you let them, and search the area if you go hiding, they also communicate with eachother throughout fire fights yelling out your location or warning eachother when you've thrown a grenade near them. They also cry out when they've been shot or as they die, which makes them feel more lively than enemies in other fps games.","December 6, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The AI is still some of the best I have ever seen to this day. Enimies will crawl under obsticles, flank you, and draw you out of cover with grenades into waiting soldiers. What Im most impressed by is the soldiers ability to utilize cover. Not only do they hide behind existing cover, but they will activly make their own. Unlike other FPS' FEAR has some really cool unique guns, like my favorite, an assault rife that shoots foot long spikes that can pin people to walls. Its not as creative as games such as URT or more recently Sunset Overdrive, but its still refreshing to not use the same kind of guns over and over again like in CoD (Up until CoD AW).\n\nThe game is creepy, but not scary. The games biggest flaw is its inability to do combat and scares at the same time which really keeps the suspense down at times. If your in combat you know you are free of scares. The story is great, but I just wish that the game could pull off the horror aspect better. It is much improved in FEAR 2, Overall I love this game.

Every weapon, from the high-capacity, accurate pistol to the heavier cannons you'll find in the mid and late game, are powerful, distinct, and serve a purpose while being incredibly fun to shoot.\n\nMost levels are simply warehouses and office complexes, but most modern shooters are drenched in gray anyway so you might not even notice the fairly bland environments. That doesn't mean FEAR is devoid of style though. Sharp shadows, lots of smoke, sparks, and other particles, and a fondness for fire and blood give FEAR a distinct art style that other shooters, especially its sequels, lack.\n\nThere is a story to be had for those who really want to engage in it. There is a cannibal, mad science experiments, psychics, and a clone army. Players that don't care about the plot can skip -some- cutscenes and ignore the answering machine messages (the FEAR equivalent of System Shock 2's audio logs), and be apathetic to the dialog.\n\nDespit its name, FEAR is not a scary game. It tries to have some spooks here and there but its strength is in its unparalleled gunplay. Each expansion gets progressively duller and there is no option to not install them. Extraction Point is worth playing if you enjoyed the base game.","July 3, 2014","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game began my gaming and my computer hardware obsessions. I got my first horrible and outdated computer and my mom bought this game for me. It wasn't very old at the time. It was still being sold in your main markets and stores. I played the crap out of it too. At the time I had probably the worst set up ever for this game. The desktop was on the ground and my monitor was on top of it. I had to use what little space was left to place my mouse atop of the desktop and of course I had to set the keyboard on my lap (what better place?). And I had to sit in a miniature lawn chair that had the seat lifted from the ground about 6 entire inches. Not kidding folks. But would I change a single aspect of this memory? You better think again if you believe I would. This was the highlight of my gaming life. Especially for PC gaming. I enjoyed every single nanosecond!\n\nOverall this game is incredible even all the way into 2014. As everyone has said, the AI is insanely well constructed. Hell it won the award for the best AI of the year for a reason. They work and attack similar to a real military combat unit. They even try to call out to their team and give info on what you are trying to do. The only part I didn't like was the end. The enemies you have to fight there are pathetic and just a plain bother. That would be the only thing I wish would be changed. This game is mind blowing and will always be held extremely high in my books until I die.\n\nYou won't make a mistake getting this game.

It's like most shooters (at least from its time), but not. It combines a creepy atmosphere and super intense action to create the experience. I guess it's really not fair to compare it to other shooters because it is not like other shooters in the sense that this one has a story. It's a weird story and sometimes off, but a story nontheless. The greatest thing about this game is the slo-mo feature. Yup, you can slow down time all Matrix like. And yes, before you decide to question it, it is amazing. The AI, while stupid in some parts, is actually quite good. they work together instead of running past the same corner ten of their buddies were shot next to. for example, if you are up against two enemies, one will stay back while the other slowly approaches you and flanks you. The one who stayed put, will use suppressing fire to distract you, giving the other guy a minute to smack you in the back of the head with his own bullet. They also really like to use grenades, and have a pretty good arm too, so watch out for that. Even though the game is over five years old now, it still looks pretty decent. the blood and gore effects are stil gruesome, and the vaporization effects Alma (antagonist) uses on some helpless people during cutscenes is impressive. It's always fun to watch someone's skin get burned away by an angry ghost child. That's another thing worth mentioning; the horror in the game is cut down to mostly just jump scares and long, dark hallways. nothing really else outside of that. The action, however, is intense. especially when you come across the mechs. Oh, did I not mention that before? Well, now I did. Yes, giant metal monsters will be trying to blow your insignificant human body up into millions of tiny, bloody pieces. Conclusion: should you but this? To put it simply, yes. Even without multiplayer, it is still a fresh change from the mundane of shooters we have been forced to suffer with in recent years.","October 6, 2014","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere is creepy, and I often let loose a burst at a shadow or some bit of dungeon dressing.\n\nI suggest waiting until it is on sale, since I'm an average player and still completed it in less than 20 hours.\n\nWhat drove the rating down were several issues:\nThe game is very linear, with only a couple of places where you can solve problems in alternate ways, or where you have multiple paths to choose from.  Regardless of this, you still always have to end up at the same place for the storyline.\nExcept for the path for the story, you can't interact with anything...all other doors are painted on, and you can't open lockers, cabinets, etc.\nThe designers couldn't seem to figure out how to make certain sections hard enough, so they use the old "take away all weapons" trick.\nAlthough there are many times when you are told you need to "hurry", you can take as long as you want, because everything is scripted based on triggers, so regardless of when you get someplace, you're either just a moment too late or just in time.\nIn the same way, triggers cause enemies to spawn.  This often leads to you running into bad guys in places you had cleared, with no way in except through you.  Also, some of the triggers are can be avoided, but none seem to effect completion of the game.\nAlthough the "only carry 3 weapons" could have made this a really tough game by having to decide what to carry, the reality is that decent amounts of ammo are available for only 4 weapons after the first few levels, and two of the four are machine-gun variants, with one clearly the superior.\nEnemies can modify the environment (e.g., push over objects to use as cover) and maneuver better (dive and roll, crawl, etc.) than the player.  They also seem to be able to destroy more of the environment than you can, even if some of that is scripted.","October 20, 2014","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are still pretty good compared to the games that get released now, and the gameplay is really fun and overall immersive.\nF.E.A.R. is a game where you're an operative with F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assult Recon) and you're trying to kill Paxton Fettel. Whilst doing that, you uncover political and buisness cover-ups. People don't like you for digging into that while still going after Fettel, and Fettel has is own "army" that is also trying to kill you. So lotta shooty-shooty-gun gameplay mixed with a few good scares.\nIf you want to play F.E.A.R. 2 or 3, you HAVE to play this first! Personally, it is my favorite and scariest one, plus its essential for the story.","October 23, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the story is unique and the setting unnerving and atmospheric, the reason to really stay are the explosive firefights.  Every scenario or action sequence ends with rooms filled with flying debris, shooting sparks, and heavy dust which makes every shootout memerable and distinct.  Innovative weapons and an array of physical attacks only add to the mayhem you will leave in your wake, but all of this is wrapped in a tightly told narrative with distinct characters.  Don't deprive yourself of this amazing experience!  Get it as soon as you can!","October 23, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its an FPS with a bullet time effect that they refer to as slow-mo. This ability is necessary as the enemies will kill you extremely quickly if given the opportunity. What I most liked about this game were the multiple number of ways someone could take down a group of enemies, all with varying results. I found myself replaying the same sections over and over to find the best flanking positions to maximize my effectiveness. In combat, this game succeeds with flying colors. However, the story is lacking and the environments range from brown to gray. There are also only roughly 4 locations in the game that you actually visit, and you spend the majority of your time wondering around an office building. That is the most boring aspect of the game, which by contrast makes the firefights that much more exciting. Another criticism-- the final fifth of the game is a waste of time. There's no difficulty scaling as the enemies essentially disappear and in the final stretch you are simply without any troops to fight-- no strategy necessary.  It was extremely disappointing to see them just ruin what could've been a hail-of-gunfire-style ending in favor of a lackluster scare fest. Play until you get to the facility at the end and then just skip the final sequences-- a waste of time to a story that telegraphed itself from the beginning.","November 4, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People still liked the old school shooters, but wanted something new, something "fresh".\n\nAlong came Monolith Productions, the Washington-based studio that made a name for itself with games such as "Blood" and "No One Lives Forever" more than a decade earlier. Combining some of the best things the FPS-genre can offer gamers with a touch of inspiration from the game "Max Payne" and the dysotopic film "The Matrix", we got a "horror-shooter" with Slow-Mo.\n\nLooking back on the game now (and playing it over), almost nine years after it was released, it is still highly addictive and fun to play. The graphics are a bit dated, but the Ai still packs a punch, and that little girl "Alma", still keeps popping up when you least expect it.\n\nDon't forget the flashlight in those dark and eerie places, trust me, you'll need it.\n\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ The Slow-Mo feature\n+ Environments that are destructible\n+ Fast controls\n\n- Some leveles can be a bit repetitive\n- Doesn't support hi-res resultions (it can be fixed)\n- Lengthy (some parts)\n\nI also recommend the two expansions:\n\n1.

Though the gameplay is pretty much half life with a slow mo button when you get down to it, its concept, universe, weapons and lore are very, very unique.\n\nThe storyline is another great part of this game, its very engrossing and pulls you in, unraveling the secrets of shady corporation has never been this interesting, except maybe ultor in red faction.\n\nAll in all, great game, it will test your nerves, especially extraction point, man was that freaky.","August 18, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And succeeds in almost everything it sets out to do. The gameplay is solid, the music is good, the graphics are very impresive at the time it was released, the level design is great, and the enemy AI is still superior to most games today. Not to mention the awesome weapons that you can find (The minigun is my faverite!).\n\nNow for the parts of the game which aren't so good, the story in F.E.A.R. 1 was servicable, but in Extraction Point and Persus Mandate I didn't feel as though anything important happened. What dissapoints me the most however is the horror aspect of the game: F.E.A.R. isn't scary, it just isn't. There is never a moment in the game where you feel vunerable because of all of this elite weaponary you have on top of the slow-mo. It's really hard to genuinly scare someone after they just single-handedly destroyed two mechs with a rocket launcher. That isn't to say that the game doesn't have it's scary moments, but those scary moments only take up about 25% of the game.\n\nOverall F.E.A.R. is a very good game, and and I did have fun blasting someone in the face with a shotgun in slow-motion.
