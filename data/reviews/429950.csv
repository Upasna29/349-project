The bad news is that those titles are far closer to the barely functioning Cheetahmen than they are any 'instant classics' as this game bewilderingly touts itself.\n\nI was hooked in by the Mexican horror theme as there is precious little of it to be found in gaming but nothing feels particularly culture-specific about shooting down a tedious Halloween gallery of ghosts, bats, cats and, uh, monkeys for some godforsaken reason. The boss fights, although clumsily handled, are a little bit livelier, recalling the milder confrontations of the original Castlevania trilogy but out of a total of five of them, two are against the Grim Reaper and one is against an alien overlord so that really leaves you with precious little of what Abo Mando promises you.\n\nThe two biggest problems here are that every stage looks like crap on account of being one colour (whether or not that is an artistic choice becomes irrelevant the minute it starts to affect enemy and platform visibility) and the fact that enemies constantly spawn on top of you, sometimes in mid-air, of which you can either shut up and like it or quit to refund (my personal option). Trying to sell this as a 'Mega-Vania' hybrid is, frankly, insulting to both of those games and even the several generations of knock-offs that came after them.\n\nA disappointingly lazy effort.

Most levels continuously loop a track of around 12-18 seconds. It's painfully ear-grating and incredibly irritating. Apparently there was a music update a few days before I got the game, so I can't imagine how awful it must've been before.\n\nWhere the 'Mexican' horror kicks in, I'm not sure. But I saw none of it during the 2.9 hours I played. There are generic floaty ghosts and bats that attack you from above or diagonally, and since you can only shoot forwards it's near impossible to kill them without them hurting you first. Walking trees and what I assume to be various children wandering about are among some of the other 'Mexican'-themed horror on display.\n\nThe colourless backdrop, although clearly a design choice, does nothing to help either. The majority of the equally color-deprived enemies blend in with it making it hard to see anything at all, leading to almost certain death and having to endure the current level all over again from the beginning.\n\nFor the developers to proclaim this "an instant classic" is misguided and laughable. Save your money.","January 28","false","4.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it, and wish I could have the time back that I spent playing it.\n\nParts of this game play like Bit Trip, just poorly executed. The rest plays a bit like Super Mario Bros., except always having a gun. There's no indication that you've taken damage unless you're looking at your life bar. Jump functions inconsistently depending on where you are. For some reason when descending you can repeatedly hit jump to "float" down, but if you do it too much you die when you touch the ground. No idea what the "too much" threashold is.\n\nAt least in Super Mario Bros. you had some sort of idea what was supposed to be happening. This is kinda like walking past someone talking on the phone while you've got your headphones on. No clue what's going on with them, but whatever it is, it's happening.\n\nThe only positive reviews I see for this game say "has cards".","May 20","false","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Which is it? 5-8secons of loop music?  Really bored.\n- The start /intro of the game seems to be made to keep away epileptic people and it's very ugly to see.","April 26","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
