"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/308560/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2272 products in account","City Quest is a hilarious point & click game where you get to play as a dumbass hillbilly.\nA Gameplay & Review video showcasing the features I'm about to talk about:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG4GjzcM-es\nThis game is reminiscent of older point and clicks like King's Quest, except it focuses more on humor.\nYou can interact with almost everything in multiple different ways.\nThere's a look, use, lick/eat/talk action. All of them come up with unique and well written dialogue for any character or object you click on.\n\nYou will die a lot in this game, it comes with the curious nature of your disconnected stupid hillbilly brain. Because you interact with so many different things in dangerous ways. E.g: Walking into a plane turbine, going up to a carnivorous plant or standing next to a nude man with a huge dong (Don't ask how that one kills you. Watch the video)\n\nThe music is really catchy, and accompanies your journey and mini-games (that once unlocked, you can replay) very well.\n\nHere's one of my highlights: I searched a vending machine. I found an abandoned baby. I got an achievement for it. I put the baby back, and got an achievement for re-abandoning an abandoned baby. I then took it back out, and ate it.\n\nRecommended!","August 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","29","36","6","0"

The storylines (there are four) are amusing and the music is a true tribute to nostalgia. My hands-down favorite part of the game is the ENDLESS amount of amusing text the developers must have written to cover every conceivable object looked at, licked or fondled.","August 20, 2015","true","14.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","13","15","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketbabydolls/recommended/308560/","rocketbabydolls","Rocket Baby Dolls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketbabydolls/","728 products in account","Okay, so far I'm only two hours (on record) in playing this game, on my first play through and have no idea how far into the game I am and just how much there is left to go. I saw this pop up on Steam, thought it looked quirky and interesting and decided to wait for a sale and when it happened I snapped it up. The only regret I have is in waiting so long, this game is worth it at full price.\n\nThis game may not be for everyone as it makes you think out of the box, I understand that the box these days is "Here is a gun, go shoot things" but I'm talking about in adventure game terms.\n\nSure, there's quests to do which are pretty straight forward involving helping the homeless, pimp business and corrupt politicians. Your standard adventure game staples you might think. But you're some white dude with blonde hair who definitely has a disorder of some sort who can be talked into trying to disguise themselve as a Yakuza to aid the mafia.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't really make sense then the rest of the game will make less sense. If it did make sense to you then you're probably the protagonist of the game.\n\nI may edit this after a few playthrough's, but somehow I think leaving this game in people's minds with a little morbid curiosity might fare better. If you've seen it and read about it and/or put it on your wishlist just do it. It's one of those games that you think you'll fire up for a few minutes to see what it's like, think "everything is fairly standard and boring, nothings really happening. That's the first bit over, what's the fuss? I'll play a bit more and... what? Wait! What? Seriously? Is this?... Yes it is happening" and will just continue on.\n\nIf you want an adventure game that really makes use of you interacting with it for Steam achievements then this is for you.\n\nIf you want an adventure game that makes you try to find inventive ways for you to be killed then this is for you.\n\nIf you want an adventure game that tries to make you find ways to steal babies and then eat them then this is definitely for you, and you should probably seek help.\n","August 22, 2015","true","18.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","10","10","4","0"

It may have taken a while longer than expected to complete, but it was well worth the wait. This games humor will keep you laughing through the whole game. One of the best parts is the sheer amount of interactions there are to be had with nearly every object in the game be it through touching, looking, groping, licking, eating or talking. And for those of you who are wondering, yes, it has a TON of replayability, with four main storylines, branches in each storyline, side quests, and plain good old exploration. Great Game.","August 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

But that’s okay because you’re there for the deaths. Right? And they’re plenty varied and some are side splitting hilarious. Some of them even involve doing evil things for evil clowns. You’ll also want to be on the lookout for various ethnic babies to collect. And other hidden goodies. I won’t spoil all the fun, but if you’re looking for something irreverent to play then you should consider giving City Quest a try.\n\nhttp://cliqist.com/2015/08/25/city-quest-point-click-death-simulator/","August 25, 2015","true","12.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

What did you do to the game to screw it up so bad? Now it doesn't even close properly. It freezes my whole computer and I have to restart.\n\nUnfortunately, until the bugs are fixed, I can't recommend it.

I chuckled a good bit when playing it.  MUsic is suprisingly good for a game that looks like it was made for DOS.  Point and click adventure games did not sound that good back then but I'll allow the innacuracty.\n\nIn spite of this I can't recommend it due to lack of focus or a gripping story.  I just dont really care what happens and I don't feel like playing anymore.  I would prefer if the humor was balanced with a better story or maybe if it was cheaper.","August 21, 2015","false","1.3"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","6","20","2","0"
