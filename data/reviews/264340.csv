I really like this game. It's unapogetically generic, addictive, and smartly-designed. Major Mayhem is a game that truly feels like it was focus-tested for maximum enjoyment. When it comes to games, you'll sometimes read descriptions like "It's not for everyone". This game, is for everyone. Whether you're the type that likes to unlock stuff and get cash, somebody who just wants to shoot and/or blow stuff up, or even a person who shoots for the high-scores, Major Mayhem is the game for you.\n\nEhh...I feel dirty all of a sudden. These days Android/IOS can be regarded as a legitimate gaming platform, but I'm an old codger and can't grasp/don't like cell-phone games. So to recommend something as shameless as Major Mayhem, it really makes me pause, reflect upon my past, wander aimlessly through a desert, that sort of thing. So I'm going to break down what I like about this game.\n\n-Mission objectives are smartly-designed. There's always an incentive to change weapons, replay stages, and collect cash. This game knows exactly which elements of your brain to massage, so you're compelled to keep playing.\n-Different weapons have different scoring strategies. With a shotgun you'll want to aim for enemies that crowd together. Sniper rifles can pierce objects, and there are bonus points for killing enemies behind cover. If you want to unlock everything you're going to try each weapon, thus you'll devise your own personal best scoring weapon.\n-Enemy corpses can be shot for bonus points.\n-Mechanics are extremely solid. When it comes to gun games, there's nothing more frustrating than poor mechanics. When I aim at an enemy's forehead, I don't want the bullet to fly into their arm, and I want appropriate feedback. While the enemies in this game resemble toys more than human beings, they still react properly to every shot. The sound-direction and visual feedback is on-point as well. Altogether it's pretty satisfying.\n-Nice amount of depth to the scoring system. High scores aren't achieved just by shooting everyone. Everything from maintaining a combo, to using an item at the right moment, to getting those trick shot bonuses, are essential tactics.\n\nWhen a company name-drops Metal Slug and Time Crisis I get this "Whoa...really?" look on my face. I expect their game to deliver something of comparable quality. While I won't say Major Mayhem hits those highs, it gets so much right that I gotta give respect.\n\nWell worth my time and possibly yours.\n","October 29, 2014","true","9.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

A game with lovely graphics and solid and plenty of gameplay.\nYes, it may be a port from the mobile phones but it definitely fits our system. You'll be able to shoot enemies with precision and that's what matters most in a game like this. The one thing that didn't impress me is the fact that you earn coins rather slowly. So you'll be replaying levels over and over just to be able to buy those new outfits and weapons. If you play on a platform where you have this sort of precision you want to keep players occupied as much as you can. Replaying levels is fun but not if it takes tens of times to earn the amount of coins you need. Thankfully, there are challenges that help speed things up but after about 50 challenges (of the 150) you start noticing that this also needs a lot of replaying already finished levels.\n\nIn the end it's still twenty times better than Rambo, and even if that's not a fair comparison you still need to play this.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","March 3, 2014","true","9.0"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","36","50","0","0"

Turns out I was wrong, Major Mayhem handles pretty great with your mouse, which you use to aim, shoot and activate several powerups.\n\nOverall Major Mayhem presents you with a pretty simple, if not poor, storyline and some really neat looking graphics. The game is pretty much a simple aim and shoot game and you ocasionally take cover. By killing enemies and getting higher combos you get more points and more coins, which you can then spend on clothes and unlock weapons. The soundtrack was actually pretty  great to listen to while playing. The enemy variety is rather lacking and the same goes for bosses.\n\nIn the end Major Mayhem will end up being enough for some people and not enough for others, it certainly is nothing to be amazed by but it can provide you a few hours of fun with the various modes it has (Campaign, Arcade, Time Bomb and Survival).","April 18, 2014","true","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

In Major Mayhem you play as the major. Hes assing to kill some terrorist that kidnapped his girlfriend and thats all there is to the story. But how is this game ? Its actually quite fun. All you do in this game is go to cover from cover and fight bad guys there are the some boss fights that are really fun. The game acts on a three hit system. Three hits and youre dead. Its also a very easy and short game. It has a lot of bonus objectives that you need to complete to get new guns and more money for power ups and outfits for youre charecter. Like every game it also has its problems. The hit detection isnt always the best sometimes when you shoot somebody it doesnt really hit them and sometimes enemies can shoot you through walls which is annoying. The scoring system works when it wants to. Overall a really good game and a fun little title to pick. Its cheap fun i give Major Mayhem an 8/10","April 15, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Your mouse is the Aim, button 1 is shoot, button 2 is jump and #1 thru #4 are the extra weapons. You can also change the control configuration to what you like. The resolution is adjustable to your monitors resolution, it will full screen or window mode too.\nWith my experience with this game on Android, using a mouse for the aim made the game a whole lot more enjoyable on the PC and less frustrating in heavy combat fighting.\n\nIt's on sell right now for $1 off 20% - $3.99, but the regular price of $4.99 is a bargin for the amount of replay value this little game offers. There's 100 achievements to obtain in the game with 45 levels, so you're not going to play it just once.\nYou earn coins in the game by killing enemies and completing tasks, you use the coins to buy Supplies, missles, armour, slow time, super bullets and unlock levels. You can also buy various outfits for the Major to wear in the game. Different weapons (guns) are earned by ranking up through game play. So you're going to be playing this game quite a few times to earn enough coins to be able to purchase all the items in the game.\nIt's a great time killer when you don't have the time to get involved in regular size games, jump right in and play a few missions till it's time to do what you're waiting to do. We all need a game to kill time with and this is one of the best I've ever played to kill time with. Although it is hard to stop playing once you've started because it is that good.\n\nDon't miss out on Major Mayhem it's a great little shooter with alot of replay value and it's a great bargin for what you get, 45 levels of nonstop third person shooter fun with 100 achievements...","February 27, 2014","true","0.4"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I really was. It's a very simple game, quite entertaining and the ability to allow me to play with one hand and eat an ice-cream at the same time is always great!\n\nBUT!\n\nThe game screwed up in last chapter (3 in total). It was unfair, buggy and the difficulty scaling was way off!\n\nFor those who don't know, this is a "Third-Person-ish" rail-shooter that was definately ported from mobile devices (it even has the damn facebook and twitter page links. The buttons and overall UI layout also looks VERY mobile device influenced which means, of course... "obvious mobile port").\n\nAnyways, so... first chapter! The woods, full rambo style fun while shooting ninjas (yes, ninjas...). It's quite fun and responsive. Animations are fluid and nothing feels cheap. No difficulty spikes. Pretty much perfect.\n\nThen, metropolis! In the city, you fight Mr. Smith and it's clones alongisde the riot-shielders from Call of Duty. Nothing bad at all. Everything feels fair and square. No difficulty spikes, no problems. Game's responsive as usual.\n\nFinal chapter: Arab Desert. You will fight waves and more waves of... (yeah you guessed it) AND ALSO! Mummies!\n\n"Huh?"\n\nYep... and guess what? It's not ♥♥♥♥ing fair! After reaching the last chapter I got the bazooka! And it takes over 6 mother♥♥♥♥ing shots to kill a single mummy!\n\n"Well, doesn't sound too bad..."\n\nWait... it doesn't? Oh right I forgot! They throw 2-3 at the same ♥♥♥♥ing time! And also a couple of dudes in the background throwing shurikens, swords or plain shooting their guns at me!\nDid I forget to mention that the mummies can shoot green lasers out of their ♥♥♥♥ing eyes?! Yeah...\n\nBut I survived "most of it". I died a lot! The use of super powers (which you need to go back to the menu to buy with coins that you earn VERY slowly) is imperative beyond belief!\nAnd after restarting some ♥♥♥♥-poorly designed sections what happens?\n\nRub some salt on the wound because "Holy-♥♥♥♥"! The game starts bugging out! Enemies don't appear at all, so you wait.\n\nAnd wait...\n\nAnd wait...\n\nAnd you restart. And they appear. And out of nowhere you just die...\n\nI hope this is exclusively my issue. And if it is... fine. But I can't let it slide on my behalf for obvious reasons.\n\nSo the campaign was out of the window! Are there more modes?\n\nYep. 3 to be exact. All repeat the same thing but with minor changes. Time attack, survival, blah blah blah.\n\nAll play exactly the same. In the same levels. Level with the same layout as the campaign. Same scripted sections as well! No variation. The game becomes boring rather fast even though the achievements and the in-game level-up system DEMAND lots of time and effort to get maximum rank and 100% the achievements.\n\nIt's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It really is.\nAt least you get cards :P\n\nAnyways, I won't deny the fact that, while playing the first 2 chapters, I had lots of fun, even though it started to wear off on me after a while due to it's repetitiveness in both gameplay, enemy variety, levels and level layout.\n\nThe game's 4,99€ as well so... not much is being asked. Sadly... for 4,99€ there's SO much better stuff to buy that this is just one of those games to buy when you have absolutely nothing to do or are in a break from studying or working. A 30 min session and after that you're probably dying of boredom.\n\nAfter the issues I encountered I can say Major Mayhem doesn't deserve a blind recommendation from me, not at all. Only thanks to it's good 2 first chapters should you consider purchasing this. The 3rd is just a great mix of bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, difficulty spikes and frustration.\n\n5/10 If only steam has a yellow "Meh" option instead of the "yes/no". Get it on a sale if you really want it, and even then, you have better stuff to buy under 3€...","September 27, 2014","false","3.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

You don't have much of the control of the game apart from aiming , shooting and jumping in specific moments.\n\n#####iOS PORT#####\nThis is an iOS port, this means game was DESIGNED for smartphones.\n\nAs you know, porting games is poor due to Developers choice, you can see a good example of it: Deus Ex  The Fall.\nThis game is far from it but still, as much as I like cartoony graphic...

After 30 minutes, you'll realize that this game is just boring (at least I do, I'm a big boy).\n\nAfter 5 levels you'll realize how slow the progression is, you'll need to grind a lot to get a good stuff (iOS offered in-app purchases, blame that)\n\nYou can quickly unlock other modes or other locations by spending Gold Coins (you earn them by doing Objectives). That's soooooo boring.\n\n#####Music#####\nThrow the music away and play your own. Not good.\n\n#####CONS#####\nI'm not a fan of smartphone games. I've got a chance to play few and I disliked them by these few simple reasons:\n1. Forced Tutorial\n2. Tons of crappy objectives/achievements (Jump 5 times / Kill 1 opponent / Grab Armor...etc)\n3. Lack of options to disable "Features"\n4. Grinding and grinding.\n5. Game is GLITCHY\n6. Not optimized to PC players (ex: escape does not resume your game)\n\nNot worth to buy UNLESS you have Kids who don't have anything to play.\nNot worth full price.","March 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

This plays so well with a mouse that the thought of playing it with a touchscreen baffles me.  It does, however, suffer from some of the usual port problems and occasional bugs, though I am happy to forgive those here.  It also chooses not to explain what its various game modes are and how they work, for some reason.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is enormous fun and surprisingly clever.  It just feels so satisfying to play; it's addictive and has plenty of levels to replay and achievements to unlock.  I really like the way that most enemy projectiles don't hurt, and those that do give you just enough warning for quick and clever dodges.  You can even deflect them if you're quick!  It all makes you feel like you're in a dumb action movie, in the best way possible.\n\nThematically this falls square into the category of the traditional 'hur hur 'murica' joke, complete with cigar-chomping commando and 'ironic' racism.  I think that's a little tired now, and probably doesn't stand up to deeper scrutiny, but to be fair it does mix it up a bit in later levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/264340/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Major Mayhem is an arcade rail-shooter, with which I have very little experience (the only one I can sort of put in a similar bag is Rescue Shot on the PSX, actually).\nDespite coming from mobile, it looked enjoyable, and so I decided to give it a go.\n\nI'll say this right away: if a rail-shooter is exactly what you're looking to play, then it's probably safe to get this. If you're looking for interesting games or examples of great game design, look elsewhere. This is not to say that the game is bad, but it's very generic and "by the book". There isn't much in here to make it stand out (aside from being a rail-shooter, a rare genre today, it seems).\n\nHere are my indepth thoughts, starting with\n\nPresentation\nAs I said, it came right from mobile, and it's very noticeable. Big buttons on the menus, lack of options, missions, etc. etc. It was a free game with microtransactions, but, on Steam, you pay 5$, and then don't have them in the game. I'm not sure how much of a grind it was with MT, but progression is still pretty slow. But you can certainly get every useful item without the game feeling stale.\n\nVisually, it's simple, but it looks good, in my opinion. Doesn't do much to stand out either, but it's clean and colourful, with 3 different areas (each with 2 different enemy types -- the same 2, but reskinned). It does the job.\nOn the game's favor, it does a good job of telling you when you hit someone, for the most part, or when enemies shoot you. It only pales when you're using explosive, or high rate of fire weapons, since your bullet effects can obscure the screen a bit too much.\n\nOn the Audio side, it actually surprised me. The music is very bland, and gets repetitive, so I turned it off very early and just put something I wanted to listen to. The weapon sound effects, though, were great! Most of the weapons had a distinctive sound, and it really packed a punch when you shot the enemies' heads, or did some power shots.\nSo yeah, while it suffers on the music, the sound effects were very good, and a great indicator of your damage!\n\n\nNow, how's the game Structured? Well, as I said, there are 3 areas. Each one has 15 levels, including a Boss Fight on the 15th. Unfortunately, the level design is almost inexistent. Most of the levels play out very similarly (well, just point and shoot). The fact that there are only 2 (common) enemies doesn't help at all... but more on that later.\nThere are campaign, arcade, timebomb, and survival modes.\n-In Campaign, you just play the levels one by one, and are scored at the end (up to 3 medals). Probably the mode you should play first.\n-In Arcade, you play the missions randomly and just play until you want to stop. If you lose all the 3 lives, you can just use/buy a continue and you'll keep going with the same score.\n-In Survival, you have to try to play an area in one sitting, without dying. There are no continues. But other than that, just beat 15 levels at once.\n-Finally, in TimeBomb, you're given 1 minute to just try to maximize your score (like a mini-level in a semi-random area).\n\nThe game has a decent number of weapons (and half of them play out very differently -- while the other half are mostly side-grades of previous ones). And each has their own use in different situations (especially when you're going for highscores). While they're distinct, they're mostly very generic as well, when there was a chance to make crazy weapons to make the game more fun. You get Snipers, Rifles, Shotguns, Grenade Launchers, etc. etc.\n\nYou get these weapons by Ranking up. You do this by completing Missions. These are like mini-achievements that you're given. There are 150 in total, but you only have 3 active at a time -- and you do the ones you're given, no freedom there. There is a big problem with this. While these missions can improve variety and make the player go for different weapons and strategies, there's a major flaw: they're desynchronized with the actual ranks and weapon progression. I don't know how they screwed it up, but it just doesn't follow it... It would have been easy to get a mission for a specific weapon when you ranked up enough to get it. But nah, these missions are all over the place, often making you play a style that you've played before.\nThis is a big reason for the game's slow progression. Having 5 mission at a time would have been a good alterantive, perhaps. Or just give the player a chance to change them around (or queue them).\n\n\nWhat else is there to talk about?\nSo far, the game seems very limited from what I said. And for the most part, it is. The the various modes, achievements and missions may prolong its lifespan, if this is what you're looking for. Since I wanted to try out every weapon, I kept playing, trying out the different modes, getting higher scores, and went as far as playing the whole game without dying (with 3 survival missions in a row).\nIt's very monotonous if you're not into rail shooter. However, for what it is, I don't think it's all that bad.\n\nA game that's just about pointing and shooting... that doesn't sound very good. Well, there's a bit more depth to it, when you're going for highscores.\nYou have Combo and Damage meters.\nThe enemies shoot lots of fake bullets at you (to increase the adrenaline, I guess), but their real shots are very clear. You can shoot these bullets (if you're precise and fast enough), and you'll up your combo meter with these. Killing enemies before shooting will also increase your combo. Not getting hit as well.\nThe damage combo, you get from killing enemies, and shooting them while they're dead and on the ground as well. So you'll be constantly shooting something for the highscores, not just trying to survive (which is a bit too easy).\n\nAnd to top it, the game is just very smooth. It feels pretty good to play, despite its simplicity in concept and execution. The enemies are all physics driven, after dying, so you can also screw around with that. Overall, it's a pretty well put together game. Good controls are surprising for a mobile port, but they certainly give the game a much better chance.\n\nOther than that, there's typical mobile stuff. 5 power-ups (invincibility, super bullets, and air strike and bullet time), which you sometimes get with drops, or can buy with in-game currency. And lots of skins. Head-wear and Body-wear. These are simply cosmetical, and you also get with in-game currency. It keeps the character from looking the same for the whole game, nothing wrong with it.\n\n\n\nI think I'll finish the review here.\nIt's very, VERY light on game design. The only noteworthy aspect would the high-score system, I'd say. Very limited enemy and level variety, uninteresting weapons, ... It doesn't sound very good.\nBut it simply plays very well! The weapons, while generic, feel different, there are several different approaches to your playstyle, and rail-shooters aren't exactly something we're drowning in.\nSo yes. IF you're looking for something like this, you'll probably be entertained with Major Mayhem for a while. If not, go find some other game, since this one isn't special in any way. Just not bad.","October 10, 2014","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Additonally, there's been a transition from the entirely optional in-app-purchases on mobile to a tiered unlock as you progress.\n\nWe don't see a lot of well-done arcade action like this nowadays.

Phonies. Could be nice enough on one of those but feels too shallow for me on PC. Your guy, Major, runs vertically and stops whenever enemies start jumping behind rocks and huts etc. You are typically behind a cover and lose the cover while shooting. That's when you take hits. Damage. Ouch. Then you move on to a helicopter and get a rating of one star because you didn't shoot all of the enemies hats.

Instead its a onetime payment of 5 dollers and then you can gain all the Outfits and guns the game has to offer. As you level up you unlock guns and as you play you gain coins,you can guns one by one as you level up but you can buy what ever outfits you want with the money you earn they are all avalible from the word go,just some are alot more money then others.\nThis game is a railshooter in the style of time crysis you are in cover untill you shoot then you can get hit by red bullets,but luckly in this game you can shoot those out of the sky.\n\nThe games story is almost not there,you are major mayhem and have a mission of saving the free world and saving your girlfriend. It has 3 zones that have around 4 enemy types across them all. The game can take a few hours to beat but would take alot longer to unlock all the guns and outfits the game has to offer.\n\nIt might be a rail shooter but at only 5 dollers its not that bad of a deal,with rambo the video game being one of the only other railshooters you can choose from this might be one of the only choices people on steam have when it comes to rail shooters.

It has a similar "Story" as something you would expect from an 80's game. Evil Ninjas have captured your girlfriend and it's up to you to shoot your way through and rescue her....while changing clothes along the way, cause you have to be FABULOUS!\n\nThe game is a bargain at just 5 bucks, however if that is out of your price range, you can play it freelu on your mobile device. Google Play has it free, as do most app stores I imagine. However in my opinion, it's much more fulfilling to play on PC.\n\nDef worth checking out....Especially if you see it on sale!","August 7, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of content, very polished graphics and presentation, quite addictive, even for someone who's not a big fan of the genre. If you're interested in side scrolling shooters, this is a pretty worthwhile purchase for sure. Lacks a bit of depth and challenge though, in my personal opinion. Major Mayhem is definitely more for people looking to get into the genre, or just anyone who wants a casual pick up and play game.\n\n7/10","January 5","true","3.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't just spam if you want good points and getting all the weapons is a bit of a challenge. I spent 8 hrs with it and didn't even get near to a perfect game with all 3 stars on the levels and all challenges complete.","July 12, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also arcade, time attack and survival mode. Lots of equipment, weapons and clothes to win or buy. Replay factor is present - you can always go for better result and unlocking all kinds of nice things.","January 15","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why? because your own finger is not on the screen making it hard to see the enmies.\n\nIts fun, a simplified android game similar to "time crisis" with many customizations and unlockables.\n","March 6","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
