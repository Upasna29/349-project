"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jatan11t/recommended/364130/","jatan11t","GAR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jatan11t/","4334 products in account","This game has a fantastic sense of humor - I especially love the faces the characters make as they talk.  The difficulty progression and ability introduction is spot on.  I can't laud the gameplay enough - it's simple and kind of like an endless runner game, but has actual progression and feeling of accomplishment as you beat the levels.  The levels and objectives are varied enough to keep interest throughout, and the game itself is just the right length to avoid wearing out the concept.  The art and graphics are quite simplistic, but doesn't detract at all from the gameplay.\n\nOne complaint is that when introducing a concept, such as bullet time, the button you need to press should be displayed on the screen.  I didn't realize until after a couple of tries that it was only displayed right when you start the level, but not when you actually needed to use the ability.  MInor nitpicking, but the script needs some editing.  There are a couple of grammatical errors and spelling mistakes that should be fixed.\n\nOverall, I would not hesitate to recommend this game.","July 9, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He's awesome, and made it solo (as far as I know).\n\nRide the Bullet is a rather simple arcadey game, where you go through orange boosters to speed up your bullet, blue boosters to keep your bullet off the ground, use slo-mo in trying times, and assassinate people along the way.\n\nThe story is quite interesting, with a basic introduction of the character and the world, in just a few slides. Characters speak to you before each mission, and have a small portrait displaying their emotional state as they talk. Their portraits actually look surprisingly convincing, given that they are photos (of Radjor and friends) that were edited slightly, and hair or other accessories drawn on, giving them an interesting character for dang cheap development time.\n\nAs you play through the game, new mechanics are introduced pretty smoothly (although they tend to be some variant of "HIT THING WITH BOOOOOOOLET"), and even some difficult concepts are explained with hardly a word from the narrative. It starts pretty easy, but you'll be surprised how difficult it gets, so quickly you won't notice until you've retried that dang vase-smash level 20+ times. The soundtrack is pretty decent (I for one LOVE the theme) especially if you consider the constraints under which it was made. A lot of time is put into establishing locations and characters, and it felt great to finally finish the game, killing a certain baddy.\n\nThe art style is pretty simple, but I think it really works for the game. I think the characters really breath life into the world, while the cartoony levels challenge you to work for the next snippet of narrative. I played through the game to completion on both Android and PC (It works on both!), and it ran very smooth on both. When I (just barely) installed the steam(PC) version, I was getting 200+ FPS stable on 1280x720 and ran through a couple levels smooth as butter on my rather sub-par PC.\n\nSeriously, try this game. I am a big fan of noir-mafia esque settings, so I unsurprisingly loved the writing.\n\nP.S: My playtime is very low since I played it mainly through Itch.io.\nP.S.S: If you haven't watched it, check out the trailer. It's great.","May 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","0"

There's a few obsticles and a few boosts per level, and you have a minimum amount of people you need to hit. When you get a good run it's a really nice rush. I found it extremely easy to map keys to my gamepad and it plays great on my laptop.\n\nFor the price it's very reasonable for the amount of content and achievements you get.","June 22, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"
