There is some really cool and uniquely styled mechanics that you will find as you play through more of the game.\n\nGameplayThis is a relaxing puzzle game that has some rather interesting mechanics that are implemented throughout the course of the game. You play as a wizard, of all people, you are put in a tower and you have to escape, along with a friend that will help you understand the mechanics that are being put into place through the first few levels. Obviously, like most puzzle games, the first few levels are simplistic and easy to follow, just so that you can grasp the concept of the mechanics that they are throwing at you. After the first few levels you are then left on your own until a new mechanic is put into place. The game has steady difficulty curve (as long as you are playing the levels in order) and uses quite a lot of mechanics, so getting your head round what each of them do is essential to playing this game.\n\nBut what do you actually have to do in these levels to complete them? Well it is rather simple. There are 5 items that are needed in order to open the escape door to exit the level. Your job is to collect these items and get to the exit. There is no time limit, nor are you being timed to gain 'extra stars,' this just makes the game more relaxing and not rushing you into completing the levels.\n\nThere are a enormous amount of levels that you can play throughout the game. You start off in the castle, and as you complete more levels you will unlock new places with a different setting and a few new mechanics to make the puzzles that bit more difficult. Something that the game does really well is that the game won't force you to stay on a single level and try to figure it out. You can do the levels in any order that you wish to achieve them in and therefore won't be stuck on one specific level and lose interest because of that.\n\nThe game doesn't seem to be repetitive or just remakes of older levels. Each level seems to have had a fresh and new thought process instead of just remakes of previous levels. This really does make the levels that you play that more interesting and gives the game more play ability as you get into more and more levels of the game. Although something that I did find a bit annoying was there is not hotkey for a instant restart of the level, which is a bit of a shame for a puzzle game like this that has a lot of depth and gameplay in it.\n\nA interesting new concept that I hasn't seen done before was boss battles in puzzle games. Now normally puzzle games don't venture out this far, and even if they do the bosses are only small bosses that aren't really necessary to their game just seems like they took them from nowhere and added them to the game for no reason. The bosses in this game however are put here for a reason. In order to unlock each of the bosses on each of the areas you need to complete a certain amount of levels in order to unlock it. Defeating the boss is a lot harder than the plain simple levels before that boss room. I won't spoil any more of what the boss room contains just know that the boss room is awesome and well worth unlocking.\n\nThe graphics of this game are simplistic which adds more to the innocent looking side of this game, even though this game can get pretty hard in the later stages. Some of the characters that you meet don't have any animations, they are just still and you can talk to them. I would of liked to see maybe them looking at you at a certain distance just to add a bit of life to the characters. As for the player and enemies, their animations are smooth and presented well. Although sometimes I feel like your character tht you play as hasn't got as much of a walking animation as I would've liked to see. Then again this is a puzzle game, where the main focus of the game is to create challenging and interesting puzzles\n\nPros+ Nice relaxing puzzle game\n+ Steady difficulty curve\n+ Enormous amount of levels\n+ Doesn't force you to complete each level\n+ A variety of different areas to unlock\n+ Interesting bosses\n+ Steam achievements and Trading cards\n\nCons- Could do with a hotkey to restart the level\n- Would've liked to see some more 'life' in the characters you meet with their animations\n- Sometimes I feel like the character hasn't enough animations in his walking\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsThe final verdict of this game is that Mystery Castle is a pretty solid and well structured puzzle game that has a lot of mechanics and requires precious timing in order to complete some of its levels. It combines boss battles into the mix of every area that you can unlock by completing more levels. It is a very relaxing and easy to understand puzzle game.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","May 6","true","2.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","15","19","3","0"

However, there are bosses in this game that doesn't NEED to be attacked head-on! You gotta think before making your moves on them. The music in the game is quite charming, especially the one in The Enchanted Castle, and makes the puzzles more relaxing while you plan out the solutions of a puzzle.\n\nOne thing I don't like is the races, GAH! The races. You must be spot-on perfect in order to succeed in the race levels, otherwise you'd had to start that race all over again. Also, there are 4 locations (Temple, Pyramid, Harbor, and Academy[?]) that were not actual castles that seemed pretty interesting to play through. Extra DLC maybe? I don't even seem to know why they are in the map in the first place.","May 12","true","10.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

At its core, it has all the features that one can find in any of the early videogame classics,– straightforward objectives; charming graphics; easy-to-follow story; and gameplay that is easy to pick up and play but enjoyably challenging to master. However, it’s easy to simply say these and leave it at that,– but what good would that be in a review? Let’s break these down then, one by one and see just what it is that makes Mystery Castle such a pleasure to play.\n\nLike all of the classic heroes, Monty,– wizard-in-training and fancy hat owner extraordinaire,– just so happens to bump into people in need. In this case, it’s the dwarf Stumpi, who informs him that the fortress of the dwarves has been conquered and its people enslaved! And just like that, Monty is on his way. It’s refreshing to see a hero who is played mostly straight in this era of edgy anti-heroes and villainous protagonists. Mario, Link, Simon Belmont… none of them ever never needed to ask why they had to save their princesses or protect the realm,– Monty continues this time-honoured tradition. Monty is a hero, and in guiding Monty through mazes, traps and puzzles, the player becomes a hero as well.\n\nSo you have objective and story rolled into an easily understood whole,– no need for melodramatic backstories or metaphysical angst. After a simple tutorial stage, you are thrown straight into the gameplay. However, this is slightly misleading. I say tutorial stage,– but playing Mystery Castle very quickly makes you realize that the learning curve doesn’t just stop after the first few levels,– it just goes up and up and up. Every level is designed to challenge, whether it’s through highly devious map design or new mechanics, and a player will be constantly teased by the inventiveness and occasional deceptiveness of the solutions. With five worlds to explore and over thirty levels each,– and it looks like there’s even room for future expansions to add new worlds,– Mystery Castle is a game that promises hours of entertainment.\n\nThe controls are simple, making it as easy to pick up as it is to take a break from. Unlike many games today,– I’m looking at you, Attila: Total War,– Mystery Castle doesn’t make every level massive project. It offers instead highly engaging puzzles in bite-sized chunks,– perfect for both the casual everyman gamer or those who wish for a genuine intellectual challenge. With the number of games available today and the limited time most people have in the day to play them, it is very refreshing to see a game that doesn’t try to hog time, but instead offers short but highly enjoyable bursts of entertainment.\n\nThe graphics, as I’ve said, are charming. Colourful and vibrant, but very easy on the eyes, the graphics have an appeal that echoes that of the golden age of video gaming. Playing the game for a solid amount of time causes no discomfiture on the eyes, and the cartoonish quality of the art does go some way to making you feel like you’ve stepped into a fairy-tale world of heroes, monsters and, of course, fancy hats.\n\nMystery Castle is, in my opinion, certainly value for money. It has kept things simple but addictive. It has exactly the same qualities that made some of the classics classic. It has a charming protagonist, a world to explore, and a story that is straight out of a fairy-tale. To me, this is a recipe for a highly satisfying game. Monty may have never met Mario, but ye gods, with his moustache and that fancy hat? I rather think they should be walking side by side.","May 9","true","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you don't like these type of puzzle games, you probably aren't going to like Mystery Castle. If you like these type of puzzle games though you should enjoy Mystery Castle.\n\nWith the game having 180 puzzles, the game provides plenty of content. I have finished about half of the levels and have been playing the game around 8 hours. People who are really good at puzzles might take a little less time while players who aren't great at puzzle games might take a little longer.\n\nDifficulty wise I would say the game is moderately difficult. The levels that introduce new mechanics are really easy. Most of the other levels are moderately difficult that take a little while to finish but aren't overly challenging. Finally there is the occasional level that takes more time than you would think to finish and when you do finish them you think to yourself how it took so long to solve.\n\nOverall if you like these type of puzzle games I would recommend picking up Mystery Castle.\n\nCheck out my review on  GeekyHobbies.com [www.geekyhobbies.com].","June 2","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghegs/recommended/394950/","Ghegs","Ghegs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghegs/","451 products in account","An excellent puzzle game in the vein of Sokoban and Adventures of Lolo. The graphics are charming and the music doesn't get repetitive even after listening to it for a long while. The sound effects the main character makes upon dying do feel a bit out of place, though.\n\nMost of the time you have everything you need in order to solve the puzzle staring right at you, and it's up to you to figure it out, which is exactly the kind of puzzle game I like. There are a few cases where you need to check what switches do, but that's still acceptable. Enemies are of the passive kind, they'll never actively chase you. Couple of times you do need some timing skills to get past them, but overall it's very much of a slow-placed, thinking man's game. It's the kind of game where you can stare at the screen for 30 minutes trying to solve it in your head before executing your plan. And then feel an equal amount of pride for doing it and shame for taking 30 minutes to figuring out just where the boxes should be pushed to.\n\nThe puzzles can get quite inventive at times, cleverly misdirecting the player and placing red herrings to sow further confusion. It took me 15 hours to play through the game, solving every puzzle without any help. There are still some castles in the map that can't be entered, so I'm hoping they'll be added in a future patch. Or even DLC, I wouldn't mind paying a few bucks for more of this.\n\nIf there's anything to criticize, it's that the puzzles' difficulty is uneven. In every castle the first 20 or so levels (out of 36) are pretty easy, then the difficulty starts ramping up. But there were levels in the third and four castles that I found much harder than anything in the fifth castle. Still, that's a minor complaint.\n\nDefinitely recommended for box-pushing aficionados.","June 4","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
