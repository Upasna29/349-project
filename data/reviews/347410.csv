A few words beforehand: As point and click adventures in general are a rare thing these (momories of the Secret Files of Tunguska or Black Mirror are coming up) it's great to see that the genre isn't dead.\n\nMy two cents on my journey with Jerry McPartlin so far:\n[+] Nice sceneries\n[+] Great sense of humor\n[+] A Great number of nerdy references\n[+] Awesome Pro Voiceovers\n[+/-] Great chracter design despite some flaws on the lesser important ones\n[-] A little bit clunky on the tech side\n[-] A little bit wordy on the story side\n\n7,5/10\n\nPS: Keep a look out on what you can do with the bowling ball :D","October 1, 2015","true","10.8"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","26","35","4","0"

It's all a bit James Dean and Rebel Without a Cause (yeah there's your reference) and the town certainly borrows some inspiration from 1955 Hill Valley in Back to the Future or 1962 Modesto in American Graffiti.\n\nAnyway, the game didn't happen in 2011 and all but disappeared from my radar together with so many other promising point-and-click adventures. Then suddenly in 2014 news began trickling in that development had been restarted and the team had scrapped the planned episodic format in favor of a full-blown game (thank goodness) and lots and lots of other stuff had been changed as well. I began hoping that maybe I'd actually be able to play the game soon after all, and now finally it’s out, and I'm loving it to bits.\n\nIt's still a point-and-click adventure obviously, and from what I've heard the developers are estimating 5 to 8 hours of playtime, depending on how much you get stuck on the puzzles.\nUPDATE: I've now completed the game, and it took me a bit over 6 hours, so the developers' estimation seems to be pretty much spot-on. Btw, I love the outro music!\nI will certainly start over and complete it again in a couple of weeks. I've skipped some of the dialogue during my first playthrough, and there's still a couple of things that I want to try - for example I've only discovered yesterday what you can do with the bowling ball :) (update end)\n\nThe puzzles themselves are quite nice, nothing too much out of the ordinary, but I noticed how much the game really tries to guide you. There's this small dream sequence in the beginning that doubles as a tutorial for genre newbies, and there's a distinct effort to be as comfortable to play as possible, for example Jerry's car acting as a fast-travel system, the double left-click to run within locations, and you'll be using the spacebar a lot to highlight hotspots. Also I really like the inventory system. Nice little touches like these serve to let you focus more on the story and dialogues and actual puzzle solving, and generally enjoying yourself while playing the game.\n\nI guess using the Unity 5 game engine also goes a long way in achieving a more modern look&feel compared to all these other adventure games that are stuck with the much older AGS, Wintermute, Visionaire and Flash engines.  Also Unity enables the game to scale very nicely with your hardware - it runs quite decently on my old 2009 iMac using Mac OS 10.9, I also tried it on an i5-based office PC running Windows 10, and on my i7-based notebook running Windows 7 I can max out the resolution and detail settings to get a very smooth image and really nice lighting. The game supports lots of screen resolutions and you can choose to play either full-screen or windowed. While I do love the work of pixel art virtuosos like Ben Chandler, being able to play a point-and-click adventure at true 1080p resolution for once is very welcome.\nLast but not least, the game has been running stable without any crashes. There have been some minor bugs, but right now it seems that the developers are fixing them almost quicker than I can find them.\n\nThe visuals are nice, especially some of the locations are really well done, and the characters fit into the environments quite well. The animations are simple but effective, and I like the camera angles that make navigation easy and don't get in the way. Also I love the little touches that keep the music theme going throughout the game.\n\nMuch more than the graphics though you'll be enjoying the awesome english voice acting - It's just gorgeous and I've rarely heard voice acting this professional in an indie game - a game from germany no less. The developers have totally nailed the english voices. Well done!\nThere's german voice acting as well, plus subtitles in various languages that you can choose from.\nThen there's the rock’n'roll obviously, but music isn't playing all the time and everywhere. The game uses quite a lot of ambient sounds to get the immersion going, and this makes the music stand out even more when it plays.\n\nLast but not least, the writing. Don't expect deep character development, but the game is filled to the brim with in-jokes and references for adventure game nerds like myself, and there's a great sense of humor throughout. Also the story arcs really nicely and even gets a sense of mystery going while telling a rather personal story about Jerry's past. I guess you can notice the craft of professional author Bernd Badura here, and the writing is definitely another highlight of the game.\n\nAs you've probably guessed, I'm enjoying this game a lot and I can heartily recommend it to anyone who likes playing modern point-and-click adventures.","October 1, 2015","true","6.4"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","17","22","3","0"

The game doesnt feel finished (it feels like is missing some cut scenes to make the story come together) the different scenes are almost empty (not many hot spots) and the plot is rather...well...;O) Why are many characters behind locked doors?\n\nAnd there are so many bugs - from getting stuck in the surroundings to having the game not responding in different locations (and the car map), so you have to load an older save game and start over. And what is it with all this running around?\n\nOn top of that the game is very short - not including all the restarts.\n\nSigh - I think the game has potential - but it needs some finishing touches. A lot of them. Sorry :O)","October 3, 2015","false","7.1"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","0"

The only positive thing about it are the graphics, otherwise everything else pretty much sucks. Leaving aside the bugs and the clunky, cringe-inducing character movement, the game pretty much commits all the major sins of the adventure genre: superficial story and characters, illogical, stupid puzzles,  use of static screens where there should have been animated  sequences etc. I wholly regret I struggled with it too much time and therefore couldn't get a refund. Definitely not worth the money, unless it's free and even then I still wouldn't touch it again.","January 22","false","9.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It continually freezes and loves to crash on loading specific locations which basically makes the game unplayable/ unwinable. The concept is forgettable, the interface/ inventory is clunky, and the dialogue is so-so. This isn't a hard pass for me, but I don't recommend buying it. Also, I couldn't return it because the constant crashes put me over steam's in-game time limit. Now, I'm stuck with something unplayable.","January 12","false","4.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

However even at a deep discount I do not recommend this game.  The game is poorly optimized and occasionally crashes.  The cutscenes between locations is miserably slow to load and walking is way too slow. The graphics are second rate and the rockabilly music is repetitive which them becomes annoying. It is an inventory point and click and is probably the easiest of any of game in the genre I ever played,and I have played hundreds.  I would like to be fair and point out the positives but honestly I don't see any.  I see that the game price here on Steam is $20.  That price is way way out of  touch with reality.

Congrats Bluebox, you made a point and click unbeatable.\n\nJerry McPartlin started life as a Kickstarter and Indiegogo title, but could never secure the funding it needed. It's a shame too especially if you look at the old concept art, but either it lacked a certain something and just couldn't secure hype from people because it was a point and click game (a genre well known for being basically dead), it lingered out there more or less as a dead concept. Where did it come from now exactly and who funded it? United Independent Entertainment, one of those junkie publishers that puts out underfunded, underdeveloped trash so Jerry fits right in. The years in development hell haven't gotten this game anywhere, as the character models are horrible and lack style, there's no music outside of two tracks despite being about a 1950's rock star, it has a silly but not at all funny plot (DEMONS) and it just feels empty. The fact that Grim Fandango and Day of the Tentacle Remastered cost less than this bland atrocity is an insult.\n\nNot even to the die hardest of die hards of adventure fans could I recommend this crap to. If anybody is a rebel with a cause, it's me in trying to keep people away from this trash.","March 20","false","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
