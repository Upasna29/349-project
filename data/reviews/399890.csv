From a museum to a strange island and a village in the end of the XVIIth century, you're going to find a powerful artifact that will defeat that traitor.\n\nWhen Artifex Mundi publishes something that isn't their own work, you're often disappointed by the quality. While these games are still good and high quality, it's not what Artifex Mundi can deliver. And sometimes, you find a real gem, that could have been developed by them. Dark Heritages for example is one of these gems. Now, The Secret Order 2 is joining that club.\n\nThe story is a good one, though you wish that you played the first game to understand more the story. I mean, Nathan Williams, the bad guy, seemed to be related to the previous game (though it could be a mistake from my part). But, knowing you can travel through time (even if it's not really like in Time Mysteries, where you're going to different eras), you can expect some nice backgrounds. And you have them!\n\nIt's the Collector's Edition that is on Steam, so, the bonus chapter is already added in the middle of the story, when you're diving into a terrible atmosphere, with spirits, swamps and other cursed castles.\n\nWhat I really loved in this game is that it's not too hard but not to easy: puzzles are well-balanced, HO scenes are also easy for some items but harder for others because of a matter of perspective (you're not used to see binoculars behind a piece of wood, showing their profiles or another item being upside down for example).\n\nAnd the music.... it's really fitting to the game. Really fitting.\n\nAnyway, my only complaint is the HUD that I find too big but you're getting used to that anyway.\n\nIf anything, buy that game. You'll enjoy it.\n\nNow, I'm waiting for eventually for the first game to show up on Steam :)","November 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","1"

I bought this game a few hours ago and I'm already finished! I was hooked from the start! The artwork is incredible and I enjoyed the suspense and thrill of the cutscenes and I'm not usually a person to bother with cutscenes. I just like to get into a game straight away. Everything about this game reeks enjoyment, contentment, excitement and compassion. I say compassion because the game was created with the player in mind and everything was made simple and easy to understand. I like having a map included so I don't have to backtrack loads of screens and the puzzles were very easy to understand and it was very clear what was expected of me. The game is well put together with a mixture of art, music, sound effects, colour and mystery. I like the look and feel of a game and this game definitely delivered that for me. Colour, thought and organisation play a part in what I enjoy and this game has it all. If you are a huge HOG fan like me, I would definitely give this game a try. I promise you that it will be worth your money and you will be hooked, I'm sure!","November 5, 2015","true","5.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/recommended/399890/","littlemissmirage","ItsJustaMirage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/","73 products in account","The story for The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent delves deeply into a historical organization that's shroud with mystery and conspiracy. The player takes on the role of a female protagonist named Sarah, who receives an abrupt phone call one night from her father's close friend. This man warns her that a current member of the Secret Five Order, Nathan, plans to use an unholy relic to disintegrate its members. It's up to the player, as Sarah, to solve all the puzzles and end Nathan's mad plot!\n\nBefore my brief playthrough, I was only aware of the existence of hidden object games but have never dedicated any time to playing one. I'm happy to say that I made the right choice in choosing this title to start. The hour I've played so far has been wonderous! What makes me  enjoy this game heavily is the simplistic style in the environment, addictive mini-games, and puzzles -- which first appear simplified by nature, but later on proves more complicated even for the more adept player. Players will successfully accomplish a variety of puzzles to progress through the story, unlocking additional content to the game like conceptual artwork and soundtrack that are easily located in the EXTRA menu. Thankfully, the game is equipped with a difficult setting so that those who would rather enjoy the story with little to no frustration can do so on casual, while those who enjoy a good challenge will have that option readily available, as well.\n\nIf you rather see a quick video on it, don't be afraid to check out my preview of the game below! :)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fF4qSgivIwA","November 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/recommended/399890/","thecyberdruid","TheCyberDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/","4925 products in account","A pretty solid hidden object/casual adventure game with quite nice artwork. The video sequences are rather low quality and the voice acting of some characters is cringeworthy, but otherwise the presentation is really well done. The hidden object scenes make sense and most of the puzzles are interesting. There are a few puzzles that are either busywork or just plain annoying and a lot of the adventure elements just consist of finding the missing piece for the next puzzle. The story is quite colourful and for the most part connects the locations well, but there's also a good amount of 'why is this happening right now?' moments that feel like some backgrounds had to be 'shoehorned' into the story.\n\nOverall a decent hidden object game if you don't mind a bit weaker story and puzzles.","November 20, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/399890/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Review by Ainslie (my partner, a fan of hidden object games)\n\nIt is quite rare to find me glued to a computer game for more than 20 minutes at a time, but from the instant I started The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent I couldn’t seem to get enough.  I kept working for the next goal, finish the next puzzle and find the next clue.  I loved the combination of adventure, hidden object games and mini puzzles, each linking cohesively with the next.  The story brings to life a world of magic, mysticism and history that leaves you wanting to know what happens next and has you invested in defeating each challenge that stands in your way. I found the graphics to be perfect for the game as they had an antique feel but are also colorful and engaging without being garish which some games in the genre can be. I enjoyed the cut scenes and the dialogue which were appropriately timed and were succinct enough to not take away from the playing of the game. The cut scenes can be entirely skipped if you so choose, but the story is a good one for the genre so I would recommend that you watch them to keep immersed in the game.\n\nIf you are a fan of hidden object games and like a great story line and extra challenges thrown in to make the game oh so better then this is the game for you.  Personally i can’t wait to get Warwick out of his game account to I can finally complete my first game.  Enjoy!\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 14","true","8.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

But I was wrong. First of all, the story is very catchy and interesting, kinda similar to the Dan Brown novels (if you read them). The puzzles are quite difficult to complete. However, you really need to pay attention to the dialogs and messages in order to resolve the puzzles.\n\nThe hints are very useful, unlike other hidden objects games with erronate hints or incomplete.\n\nThe soundtracks and music is quite well created and same goes for the graphics.\n\nIt really worth it to buy this game and I can't wait for the next part!\n\n","November 7, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/recommended/399890/","emblemparade","Emblem Parade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/","3124 products in account","A polished, balanced, and satisfying hidden-object game. The graphics are 3D-sculpted and smooth, the animations professional, the music perfectly matches the moods, and even the voice acting is not bad. You will be pleasantly and casually guided from one challenge to the next: point-and-click adventuring, several good hidden-object scenes, and solvable puzzles. You will pass them and be happy. Nothing is too hard or too easy.\n\nAlas, also nothing about the story is especially innovative, but it's well presented and is interesting enough because it goes through several settings while maintaining a cohesive center.\n\nFinally, thank you, devs, for supporting Linux!","March 24","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/399890/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1583 products in account","A daring adventure through time with magic, ghosts, dragons and family drama; this game is filled to the brim with excitement from beginning to end.\n\nA good story is what keeps me playing games like these. I enjoy following along with the main character and helping them to complete their mission. This tale revolves around Sara who is trying to save her parents from her very own brother. Along the way she discovers a time traveling ship and goes to the past to uncover the mystical artifact that will defeat the darkness.\n\nWhile the story is good, it drags a bit to me. The time traveling aspect wasn’t as exciting as it sounds on paper. You only go to one time period and, of course, do mundane tasks until you finally get the information you need...THEN you get sucked into a vortex of some sorts and have to defeat two evil specters to escape. This part, I believe, is added content for the collector’s edition to make it longer which might explain why it seems out of place from the rest of the story. However, once back on track to finding the scepter things pick up pace again.\n\nGameplay is common fair for this genre of game. You have plenty of hidden object scenes, I wouldn’t even have minded more. You also have plenty of puzzles, some frustrating but the instructions are clear and you can get past them without having to skip. If you’re playing on Steam, gaining all of the achievements should not be difficult. The game also offers a mahjong alternative if you can’t find an item during a hidden object scene.\n\nArtwork is beautiful, though the characters suffer from dead eyes during cut scenes when they look at it. It’s a bit creepy but nothing too distracting. The soundtrack is great at setting the tone of the game and smooth on the ears along with talented voice acting.\n\nAs of the time I’m writing this review, the first installment of this series is not on Steam yet. I would love to see it and more stories involve the Order of the Gryphon available, however. The mythos of the game is intriguing and a lot of mystical fun.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","December 2, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The storyline is abtuse at best, and the cutscenes and graphics look like they're from 1999.  I'm a sucker for these kinds of games, but I may have to start rethinking purchasing games that Artifex Mundi only publishes and doesn't develop.  They need to start exercising some quality control.  Achievements on this one are minimal as well, with nothing beyond the story achievements and a few hidden objects ones like 3-in-a-row and completing a hidden object in under a minute.  4/10","November 10, 2015","false","4.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

It has mostly beautiful graphics and some realy good animation (and some that are not so good).\n\nThe game has three different difficulty settings, but if you are going for the steam achievment, it's irrelevant on which setting you play because it mainly influences the time between two hints and the steam achievments require you to do the game without hints at all. But it's not overly difficult. In fact, even without hints I would call it 'medium'.\n\nThe story is ok for a fantasy and time travelling story. Without spoiling anything it is mainly your task to find a lost artifact.\n\nOne positive point if you are no native english speaker and the game is available in your language is that they realy seemed to care for a good translation which is sadly not granted in many games. At least the german translation was nearly flawless. (There is no german voice output, however, only translated subtitles.) This is especially important on hidden object scenes. What times I have spent in bad translated games to look for an item only to find out the translation was spoiled.\n\n[Edit:] After I just played another hidden object game, I just realized that the map feature which does not only show you where you might be able to do something at a certain time, but also allows you to quick travel and therefore save you from spending much time just moving from location to location, is woth mentoining as an additional positive point. [/edit]\n\nA beautiful extra is that you can replay any hidden object screens and puzzles and rewatch all video sequences once you have finished the game.\n\nWell, most reviews I write are much longer, but there realy isn't much to say. So: If you are fan of hidden object games, this is a recommendation. If you just want to waste some hours with a decent time killer game, I'd wait for a discount.","January 19","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
