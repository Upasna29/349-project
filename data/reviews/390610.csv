The black and white that becomes more colorful the more you play, the circles that keep on rolling, everything makes you feel like you are on acid. While they do look good, there is nothing too spectacular to them.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is pretty straight-forward: you must jump to enter a circle, and jump again to enter another floating circle. Then you repeat, and repeat, and repeat until you get to the final one and you beat the level. While this might sound repetitive, the more you advance into the game, the more varied the levels get: new enemies, different patterns and the constant fear of getting hit make this a gripping game that will keep you hooked for quiet some time.\n\nCHALLENGEAs mentioned, the game is pretty challenging, and the further you get into the game, the more it gets harder, and harder, to the point of being borderline frustrating. However, there are some safe areas in the level that are basically checkpoints in which enemies can't reach you, so you hardly ever need to restart a level from the first circle.\n\nSOUNDThat soundtrack... Damn, if it is good. Even though it lacks in sound effects, the music is fantastic and exciting, giving a different rythm to each level and losing yourself in the acid trip that you are taking.\n\nREPLAYABILITYMultiple achievements and challenges are the only thing that will make you want to complete this game. Otherwise, once you finished a level you will not want to come back to it, especially if it was though as nails.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy platformers and games that closely resemble a drug-induced dream, this game is for you. The gameplay is easy to understand but hard to master, but it still delivers a satisfying experience.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 8.5\nReplayability: 7.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 7\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","September 13, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Right as you think the game has reached its absolute hardest you are thrown a brand new mechanic that requires you to think twice as hard as you feebly attempt to focus on everything present on screen. While the game is in no doubt challenging, the pace of the game allows you to learn how to interact with its bizarre environment by gradually ramping up the difficulty by providing you consecutive stages of the same enemies but each time adding in another element. If you are into challenging platformers like Super Meat Boy or puzzle games like Portal, I highly recommend that you play Circa Infinity.","September 9, 2015","true","8.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Levels ramp up in difficulty by introducing mechanics in an intuitive way, then testing the player on what they've learned.  Timing based puzzles are aplenty, and you must traverse the spheres using skill and cunning.\n\nKenny Sun was very smart in his level design.  The game is divided into 5 (maybe 6?) parts.  It gets incredibly hard, but deaths don't feel too punishing.  Dying only takes you back 2 spheres, not to the beginning of the level.\n\nI'm on part 3 right now.  If you're willing to put the effort into beating the parts, you will be rewarded with amazing new mechanics that will make you say "Whoa" out loud.\n\nEPILEPSY WARNING!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Karzons/recommended/390610/","Karzons","Karzon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Karzons/","2001 products in account","TL;DR: I rarely like platformers and am usually too terrible to play hard games (let alone find the effort worth it when I can), and I loved Circa Infinity. Also the music is phenomenal.\n\nCirca infinity is a certainly a hard game, but not in any conventional manner. Outside of the bosses (which you can trial and error until you get a pattern you find easier), it doesn't really require reflexes per se, or sustained timing. Hitboxes are extremely forgiving, and you can often wait between close enemies for whatever you have to do next. Enemies move predictably, and you have breathing room to plan out your next few moves, which you then execute over several quick seconds in a sigh of relief before repeating the process. It usually alternates segments like these with miniature maze-like puzzle sections you can do at whatever pace you want. Trying to play most levels like in the trailer would be extremely difficult if not impossibly the first time through.\n\nThe game is hard because it makes you manage and respond to multiple streams of information presented on different parts of the screen. It finds new and creative ways to completely screw up your sense of direction, distance, and everything else. You'll run right into a stationary enemy you meant to run away from, or didn't see at all because you were looking at what your other character was doing. No, the game did not trick you somehow. You're just an idiot because you've never done anything like this before.\n\nCan you pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time? How about the reverse? Change the speed of one without changing the other? Reverse directions without missing a beat? Switch between these in varying sequences? Could you learn to do all that gradually? Then you can play this. Those are the types of skills the game uses and it likes to switch things up suddenly. It's disorientingly different and every new level feels like a brick wall until you figure out the timing and order of what it wants. Then, suddenly, it seems very easy and repeatable.\n\nOk, an example. There's an enemy that runs continously around the circle at exactly the speed you do - enter the circle, hold down the movement key, and you're safe. They stop moving when you're in the air, so you have to be careful not to crash into the next one when you land. Then they intoduce a flying enemy that only moves when you're in the air, also at your speed. They put the in the same section of a level, so you have to jump through the air, but not too far. Then they make these enemies move in opposite directions, so you have to run in one direction, then jump in the other then switch back on landing. Then they reverse both of their directions. And then both of these completely disappear in place of enemies that move regardless of what the player is doing because there are newer and crazier gimmicks that keep getting combined in unexpected ways.\n\nYou'll move in pace with slower enemies while dodging others. You'll control two characters on opposite sides. You'll have one enter the circle before the other, so you have to avoid enemies on the inside and outside (in different places) at the same time. You'll have enemies that only appear when one character is closer. You'll run through orbs that change your characters' colors. You'll deal with enemies that can't hurt you depending on which color you are and gates that can be only opened by the right character of the right color.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of a rhythm game (or a bullet hell?) the way you're trying to process and time different patterns at the same time, and the satisfaction is similar. Considering the way the enemies animate to the beat, it's probably intentional.\n\nMy only disappointment with the game is the final boss. It's far easier, shorter, and simpler than the first one let alone all the others. I think the ending sequence was worth it, though.","May 3","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Circa Infinity is not one of these platformers.\n\nIn Circa Infinity you control character(s) that are stuck in a circular world. Your objective is to reach the center ring of each level. Unlike other platformers you must use the circular world to your advantage in order to figure out how to progress to the next ring. You will encounter enemies that you will try to avoid. If you hit an enemy you will be sent back to the previous ring and will have to complete that ring again.\n\nI would probably classify Circa Infinity as more of a puzzle platformer than just a platformer. In the later levels you really need to plan out what you are going to do or you will fail. These levels require that you approach them in a certain way or you won't be able to complete them.\n\nI would classify the first three worlds of the game as moderately difficult with the last two worlds being hard. Currently I am still completing levels in the last world. The challenge in Circa Infinity comes from how many things you need to keep track of at any time. In the later levels you will be keeping tracking of two characters as well as many enemies which you have to remember to avoid. At times this can be overwhelming which leads to the difficulty.\n\nI have had a lot of fun with Circa Infinity but I know that the game will not be for everyone. I could see the game making people with motion sickness dizzy. Also if you have trouble keeping track of a bunch of things at the same time you may have some trouble with the game.\n\nOverall Circa Infinity is a very good puzzle platformer that succeeds in doing something new with the genre.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Circa Infinity. Other than the free review copy I received no other compensation for the review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","September 17, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Trapped in a circular world you have to run in circles to get your character(s) to the end of each (sub)level. Easy enough eh? No, not really. There are tons of monsters in each stage trying to prevent you from getting to the end. Even tho you only need 3 buttons to play this game, it seems to get rather difficult later on. To be honest I am only at Part II of V?! (not sure bout that!). I already screamed at the screen several times but always combined with a good laugh. Aint that frustrating, as you can't really die. The game just sets you back to the last subcircle if you fail to complete a circle without getting hit or w/e. I really dig the artstyle/gameplay mechanic & not to forget the amazing soundtrack. I sure see myself coming back to the world of circles again and again, just to get past them all without dying (haha, as if!)\n\nControls are smooth, just as expected with a controller. Can't say anything bout keyboard controls tho.\n\nAll in all I really enjoy this game so far. Glad I gave it a go, even without playing the demo+the trailer just confused the hell out of me.

Very addicting.\n\nIf you've played Super Hexagon, you might think this looks similar. But if anything, this game is more like the final boss from 140.\n\nThe game does require some quick reflexes sometimes, but it actually has a lot of puzzle, a lot of planning, and a lot spinning the gears in your brain into just the right motion to be able to get past certain parts.\n\nAs opposed to Super Hexagon you get pit stops and checkpoints in between sections of the level so it's much more forgiving.","December 31, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Games like this take advantage of a potential in video games that is all-too-rarely utilized, and this alone makes it worth the download. While the last couple acts might have benefited from more development time to flesh out their original ideas, and the final boss is a bit of a letdown (WAY too easy!), the game more than makes up for it in the shear creativity of its design concepts (also note: the game's other 4 bosses are fantastic!).\n\nThis game borrows play elements from the supurb Ikaruga, and like that game it wears its Eastern influences on its sleeve. But whereas Ikaruga settled for a final boss battle with the Taijitu, the Chinese symbol that depicts the fundamantal polarity of all things in the universe, developer Kenny Sun uses this illustrated metaphor as the backdrop for his entire game. One could look at Circa Infinity as a form of mental gymnastics on the very principles of yang vs. yin, as the game forces you to process an increasing litany of opposing gameplay elements simultaneously (left vs. right, move vs. stop, jump vs. crouch, and of course, Ikaruga's color-matching black vs. white mechanics). At its core, this game is a run-and-dodge platformer in the style of the original Donkey Kong (substitute ambulating devils in the place of rolling barrels); these elements bring a fresh take to this tried-and-true genre. It all can become extremely challenging, at times even seeming to be borderline unfair. It is only when you replay earlier levels and find out how eminently do-able they are do you recognize how sound and skill-based the gameplay truly is.\n\nIn an interesting twist, Sun fuses his Eastern philosophical inspirations with Western religious iconography depicting Hell. To do this, he borrows heavily from the first act of the Divine Comedy (Dante's Inferno), complete with a tearful Satan at the center of a not-quite infinite fractal of mesmorizing concentric circles. The exit-less purgatory, with each door leading into the same room, tonally evokes Jean-Paul Sartre's famous play. The biblically unattired male and female protagonists, always just beyond an arm's reach yet doomed to chase one another for eternity, might well be Adam and Eve. In keeping with the theme of root contrast, the gender difference is depicted by the presence (or absence) of a vertically-oriented pair of cleverly placed (or omitted) pixels where the second Chakra might be.\n\nIn utilizing spiritual symbolism from both hemispheres in a single artistic expression, one gets the sense that Kenny Sun is making a positive statement on globalism. Perhaps he is suggesting that the Devil may have a place on the Dharma Wheel alongside the metaphysically innocent. Or perhaps not! All that really matters is whether or not the game is fun, and whether you feel happy with the money and time you have invested in it when it's over. For $9.99 and 10 hours or so of gameplay (more than double if you add in the remarkably fun speedruns and challenges), I'd say it's both worth it and worthwhile. I look forward to future games from this very promising indie developer, and I hope this game garners enough support to keep him at it.\n\nOne final note: Adam and Eve are simultaneously controlled by the same commands, and in the game's third act, they also interact with the game environment and enemies in the same way. Which character becomes the subject of your default control focus vs. who you let lag behind may say something implicit about your attitude towards gender roles and how you identify with gender yourself. (It would be awesome if the game statistically tracked which character you tend to enter the circles first with!)","November 6, 2015","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

You play on the inside and the outside of a circle, dodging terrible demons. I was more surprised by this game than i thought I would be. It feels truly unique. It has a great soundtrack, it looks beautiful and mindbending, and the mechanics are phenomenal.\n\nAs of this review I've played through half of the third chapter (out of five). The first was easy (as you may see in the video), but from there it gets much harder. This game is for anyone who wants a game that will make them think, and then cause their brain to catch fire... and maybe explode.
