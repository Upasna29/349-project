Exploration, upgrades, weapons, etc. The question, is what differentiates Axiom Verge from its best competitors in the genre? Metroid-style games are common, and there are plenty of great examples that populate the modern PC game library. Ori and the Blind Forest, Guacamelee, Shadow Complex, and Mystik Belle are all good games that fall in the category.\n\nOn the surface, Axiom Verge looks and feels like the classic NES Metroid. Deep down, it STILL feels like the classic NES Metroid, except it has tighter controls and a few neat tricks (like phasing through walls and corrupting enemies with a glitch-gun).\n\nWhat TRULY makes Axiom Verge stand above its competitors, is its ability to captivate the player by allowing them to get lost in an alien world. While all of the above-mentioned metroidvania games guide the player's exploration by bombarding them with "Go here next" hints, objective markers, and compasses, Axiom Verge stands alone by refusing to hold your hand and tell you where to go next. The main design aspect that seperated Metroid & Super Metroid from Metroid Fusion, was that the first two never held your hand. Instead they allowed you to, again, get lost in a mysterious alien world.\n\nSo... Is Axiom Verge innovative? No, but it does what it set out to do so well that you might even recapture the same feelings you felt when you popped a Super Metroid cart into your SNES for the first time. Axiom Verge is a captivating game with much to see and do.\n\nThe plot is mysterious and full of twists. Trace, the oddly-named main character, is a hapless victim of an accident that throws him deep inside of an unknown world, alone and unguided. The level design is engaging and packed with tons optional upgrades and weapons. Speaking of which, there are over 20 unique weapons, and a lot of them are just plain crazy. I can't forget to mention that there are plenty of ways to traverse the labyrinthine world of Axiom Verge, from ceiling-hook swinging Bionic Commando-style, to airdashing, to teleporting through thin walls, to remotely controlling small drones.\n\nYou might be thinking "This is kind of expensive for such an old-looking game." But I assure you that Axiom Verge is one of the finest games in its genre. It isn't short either. Of 48 players polled, it took over 11 hours on average to complete the game.","December 25, 2015","true","33.9"," 169 of 173 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","169","173","5","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/recommended/332200/","specialneedsforces","Special Needs Forces","http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/","245 products in account","Remember the demonic imagery and disturbing backgrounds of Ninja Gaiden as you got closer and closer to fighting the demon? How about the sci-fi creepiness of Metroid? Or the creepy alien lair of Contra?\n\nAxiom Verge takes these elements and cranks them up. The setting is creepy, the music unsettling, and the story increasingly disturbing. There's even some impressively melancholy chiptune music at one point.\n\nThe game first starts out as an utterly shameless ripoff of Metroid. I'm talking totally shameless - everything from the enemy types to the types of environments encountered early in the game, to the Super Metroid-esque map - it all screams Metroid, and it's painfully blatant, to the point where I rolled my eyes and thought "Does this game have *any* originality?".\n\nWell, it does.  Not only does the game not continue in this direction, it even deliberately subverts expectations.\n\nSee that thin space that you just can't fit through? In Metroid, you'd get through it by turning into a ball. Axiom Verge never gives you an equivalent ability, but rather, a drone that can fit through spaces that you cannot. High up areas that you can't reach? Grappling hook - there is no Space Jump. Thin walls blocking your path? No, you don't speed through them and break them - you teleport through them with a special jacket. You don't freeze enemies to stand on them - you "glitch" some of them to stand on them, or you "glitch" the world on occasion.\n\nWhat's this about "glitches"? Well, Axiom Verge has a little fun with the fourth wall. Remember how NES games looked when they weren't working right? When graphics glitches caused things to get garbled and strange looking? When in some cases, a graphics glitch would even transform an enemy or object in such a way that its behavior became totally different? (as just one example, Chip and Dale on the NES had a weird glitch in the sewers level at the point where you went up, where if you managed to get the water at the bottom of the screen to turn white, you can suddenly stand on it as if it were ground)\n\nWell, this game does that for deliberate and sometimes unsettling effect. There are "fake graphics glitches" you encounter quite often, which perfectly simulate what actual NES games looked like when they malfunctioned. The glitches and how they are used almost make it seem as if the world is tearing itself apart - an impressive way to take an error from our childhoods and use it as both plot and gameplay device, not to mention to add atmosphere. There are even some creepy "outer world" areas that look like unholy glitched up messes with some filters that approach the fourth wall, such as filters to make the game suddenly look like it's being played on an old TV that's dealing with interference.\n\nYour "glitch gun" weapon (it's called the Address Disruptor) can invoke this deliberately to a degree, as it transforms enemies into glitchy abominations and even changes their behavior. An enemy may slow down, change its attacks from ones that harm you to ones that break through walls, or even try to escape you. Some of these behavior changes are the sort of thing you'd expect to see from a messed-up Game Genie code used on the NES. Or, appropriately, what NES games do when the memory addresses of objects get disrupted. This game's sole designer, Tom Happ, really knows the NES.\n\nThe graphics, while retro-inspired, actually use certain design elements of the olden days to intentional effect. Areas tend to have their own color scheme. While NES games tended to do this out of necessity (without going into super technical detail, the NES had strict color limits due to how it handled its 8 palettes at any given time), this game does it deliberately. It starts out looking a lot more NES-esque, but gradually, more color is used. It works, and the areas, while generally not having more personality beyond "creepy and alien", "super creepy and alien", "disturbing and alien", and "kinda creepy but cool, and alien", still look distinctly different. They range from tunnels with pulsating organs hanging on threads to a very strange forest that looks like something that could not only never exist on Earth, but on any planet in this universe.\n\nThe music and sound design is... interesting. Sounds are often loud and piercing, similar to old games. I assume this was intentional. The music is entirely different, and is quite the genre mix. One song I found particularly memorable started out as a melancholy NES chiptune with echo effects, and started getting louder and with more electronic non-NES instruments added. Another song features alien lyrics and chanting.\n\nThe world is huge. You will get lost. You gain new abilities and new weapons constantly, giving a rather impressive feeling of progression that few games match. As you get new abilities that aid in travel, you'll naturally have to use them, and that's when it's time to look at the map and see which areas haven't been filled out. The hallway that seems to cut off on the map - is that because you got stopped by something and were unable to reach the end? Might want to check it out.\n\nThe problem is that backtracking takes longer the further you get in the game, and there just aren't enough connecting areas or fast means of travel to really speed it up that much. I didn't find it a dealbreaker, and some enjoy that aspect of the game, but just be aware that it's there.\n\nMy other complaint is that the end of the game ramps up the difficulty to such a degree that I had to use cheap tactics to fight the last few bosses and deal with annoying, tough new enemy types. I felt like I was fighting cheapness with my own cheapness. Not the best way to end the game.\n\nDespite these complaints, Axiom Verge is an amazing game, especially for being made entirely by one person in his spare time over 5 years. It's more than just a nostalgic throwback to the creepier side of the NES with its Contra, Ninja Gaiden and Metroid inspirations along with its oddly unsettling use of "glitches". It's also an amazingly creative experience that plays with the expectations of the 30-somethings and late 20-somethings that it's aimed at. Even if you hold no such nostalgia for that era and that style of game, it's still a great game.","May 25, 2015","true","28.2"," 85 of 89 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","85","89","0","2"

A very well designed and built one, too. Doesn't reach the echelons of Super Metroid/Prime and Castlevania SOTN, but a very worthy contender.\n\nBut that's just from the outset. As you continue through the game, you'll find it subverts a lot of what you'd usually expect. Small Morph-Ball sized gaps? You don't fit though those. You send a remote drone to explore in your place. And the glitches... well, this game replicates glitches you might have seen on some poorly built NES games, but these are gameplay mechanics. An annoying exploding enemy can be glitched to make every other enemy explode when you shoot it. Buggy terrain can be swept away or made into existence to create passage.\n\nSurprising story, too. Creepy collectable notes, Prime log style, that cast things you've encountered in a different light. A far more intricate plotline than any Metroid or Castlevania game, told through dialogue and a few cutscenes. There's a speedrun option that tracks your time and skips every single talky bit, if you don't care for that.\n\nEspecially impressed that this was made by one person alone, over the course of 4-5 years.

Not only that, but also an excellent example of how you need to make a game inspired by original Metroid. Axiom Verge has very similar design and gameplay, but improves upon every aspect of them to make something really unique and at the same time very recognizable to make you feel at home.\n\nJust like in Metroid games, there's a huge map you need to explore with unique areas and enemies in each of them. There's also a lot of secrets and hidden stuff to find including new weapons, story related notes and even random secret worlds which you can explore, each of which contains items and even unique weapon which is not available in the world map and not that easy to find. The game also has decryption device which not only can help you uncover hidden areas and Items, but also glitch some portions of the map to clear the way to the next area or even glitch enemies which can clear it for you or can fight for you in certain situations (this won't work during boss battles though). And if that's not enough, the game has a ton of unique weapons to suit your play style (22 or something in total including hidden ones) and variety of different abilities which can help you fully explore the map. The world of Axiom Verge is very unique and atmospheric, it has this organic and alien feel to it and it is also reflected in the soundtrack, which is just outstanding and surely one of my favorite soundtracks this year.\n\nBut if there's one thing that upset me a bit in Axiom Verge... it's boss battles. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not that they are bad or anything, it's just they are not very challenging, well, except maybe one boss but still, most of them is very easy. I don't know, maybe that's because I have played so many metroidvania games before and kinda know exactly what to expect from boss battles at this point, but that is the only complaint I have about this game, other than that it's just absolutely incredible and really fun to play. Oh, and if you are a speedrunner, the game also has a special speedrun mode for you.\n\nFinal verdict: 10/10\n\nAxiom Verge is one of the best (if not the best on PC) games inspired by original Metroid.","May 14, 2015","true","26.1"," 87 of 106 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","87","106","3","0"

It's a HUGE game, with so much to do. The gameplay is great, and there are plenty of secrets to find. At first, the sense of exploration made me keep playing, finding out how to do certain things, finding new areas to explore, etc. But after about half way through the game, the main thing I wanted to do was find out what happened next in the story, and i'm not really a big story guy. I wont say anything about it specifically in order to keep this review spoiler-free, but you can look up the trailer to get started.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe gameplay is great. It's a sidescroller, but by the end of the game there is so many maneuvers to do that it gets quite challenging. Another great thing about the gameplay is that I didn't find myself getting stuck anywhere to the point I had to look something up. Sure, you might have to think about it for a while, and the game is really challenging at times, but there is something so rewarding about figuring something out on your own, it's fantastic. The only problem with the gameplay was that some of the weapons seemed completely inferior to the base gun, which isn't really a downside but doesn't add much to the game.\n\nMusic/SFX: 7/10\nThe music was pretty good, it was fitting. Nothing that stood out too much, but also nothing that I really despised either.\nThe sound effects were for the most part good, except for the drill hitting something that couldn't be drilled sounded similar to scratching finger nails against a chalkboard (which makes sense actually... but couldve chosen something less aggressive)\n\nStory: 10/10\nLike I said before, I don't want to spoil anything, but the story is simply fascinating. It what motivates you to keep exploring.\n\nControls: 9/10\nThe controls were really solid on the xbox-360 controller. I'm not sure how the keyboard support is, but judging by the movements you have to do it would seem to be pretty hard. This is really just a personal preference.\n\nGraphics: 11/10\nHOLY COW the graphics are amazing in this game. I don't really have anything else to say but WOW.\n\nThere is also a "hard" mode, and a "speedrun" mode, as well as completionist achievements for those who want to play even more. For the speedrun mode there are even leaderboards, which is great. Overall this game was well worth $20, maybe even $25.","July 22, 2015","true","13.0"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","50","53","3","1"

The exploration and backtracking, powerups, and same-design-but-different-color-so-they-must-be-stronger monsters are all highly reminiscent of the genre's early days (before it was even a genre). But that's not where Axiom Verge ends as a game.\n\nThe gameplay quickly becomes far more advanced than any metroidvania I have played, and the twists in both plot and abilities are unique, inspiring, and flat-out amazing. While it can be infuriating at times, trying to beat a particularly hard boss or fill out that one hard-to-reach square of map to reach 100% for an area, I have found it almost impossible to put this game down to do anything else.\n\nThe controls can be difficult to get used to at first, but that quickly fades as you continue gameplay. The weapon selection is easy to understand and memorize, and there are enough save points throughout the game.\n\nOverall, this game is heavily reminiscent of the games that created the metroidvania genre, but with so much unique additions to that idea that you cannot call yourself a fan or player of metroidvanias if you haven't played this game.","June 22, 2015","true","21.4"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","55","61","2","0"

Time for a review!\n\nStory goes you place as Trace, a scientist in the near future who wakes up on an alien planet after your laboratory explodes, and after contacted wireless by giant robotic companions, it is now of course up to you to solve what is going on and get yourself back home.\nI will get this out of the way, yes it is a throwback to old school 8-16 bit games like Metroid as you wander through the hostile areas on the similar map structure, game is very nice and captures the old school feel, just that some of the enviornments do feel plain sometime.\n\nGoing through the worlds enemies you will have a whole array of weapons, health & power nodes, upgrades, and pages to collect through the game to make your arsenal stronger and yourself to get to the next part of the game.\nWeapons come in all sorts from lightning to fire weapons. All provide a nice punch to it. You can even change the way the monsters controls with a hacking device to make it easier to navigate through the world because some of the rooms and enemies can get a little frustrating in tight quarters if they are in groups and others are just firing directly at a distance.\n\nMusic is nice and once again gives the foreboding feel as you traverse through the game.\nNot really many problems I had with the game, just in some cases while collecting powerups, the controls as you learn a new ability does take time to get used to as there are some almost seemingly impossible items to reach that require 3 button combos and moves to get to, still nothing keyboard breaking.\nAnother little thing that got to me was the boss fights, although very creepy in design, they all were too easy as there was a way to beat all of them in a certain position where you could just stay at and keep firing at them.\n\nStill overall it is a very nice game to get the nostalgic feel of the retro age in gaming, this game will probably take you 10-14 hours depending on the first playthrough if you do not know what you are doing or just collecting and finding all the secrets. Another great recommendation for retro and platformer fans alike.

Thomas Happ did an excellent job in creating not just a metroidvania game, but the classic 2D Metroid game.\n\nJust one look at Axiom Verge and you'll immediately get that Metroid feel. From the overall look & feel and level design to enemy types, weapons and play mechanics, Axiom Verge draws heavily from Nintendo's cult classic. And that is certainly a good thing in my book. This game is basically the original Metroid on steroids, made with modern tech and little to none of the annoying old limitations.\n\nYet, despite drawing so much from Metroid, one shouldn't dismiss just how original Axiom Verge actually is — Thomas Happ has created a unique world with interesting characters and story. Nor should anyone doubt the high quality of this game: the graphics and overall visual design are gorgeous, music and sound effects are atmospheric and fit the game perfectly, controls are spot on and everything is pretty much just right.\n\nJust as any Metroid game should, Axiom Verge features an extensive map, which is made up from different zones, all of which feature their own design and style. As you play you will slowly uncover more and more parts of the map, with some of them becoming available to you only after you'll get new upgrades and abilities. As you would expect, there is quite a lot of platforming in this game, with some of it being rather challenging, but none of it's really unfair — if some of it may seem that way, then you probably don't have the necessary equipment yet. Unlike most metroidvania games, which almost exclusively take place in rather small enclosed areas, Axiom Verge features some broad open areas, which nicely break up the the regular flow and add some additional variety to the game.\n\nThe boss fights in Axiom Verge are exciting, with bosses being interesting and huge, in fact some of them are so huge that the screen zooms out to be able to show them completely. As with most things in this game, some bosses are better fought with particular weapons that you may not have when first encountering them, so it may be a better option to keep exploring than fighting at the first possibility. As with the bosses, enemies in this game are very interesting both in design and behaviour/attack types and patterns.\n\nAmong the more unique game mechanics in Axiom Verge is the glitch gun, which serves many different purposes (like opening up passages, traversing the map, etc), but also can modify the enemy units. Glitching the enemies causes them to change in one way or another, gaining new properties, which you can utilise for your own purposes.\n\nAll in all Axiom Verge is a great game which you definitely should play, even if you aren't a fan of the genre. It's a darn shame that almost nobody did — at the time of the review, SteamSpy estimates the sales at ~29K copies.\n\nP.S.

Despite my lack of hours I’ve put in, thanks to that thing they call Real Life (sigh), I’ve seriously fallen for the game.\nNostalgia … NOSTALGIA!\n\nExcuse me. Now let me explain. It’s nearly impossible to talk about Axiom Verge without talking about Metroid, one of Nintendo’s finest.\n\nBasically this game looks, feels and plays like a love letter to Metroid. And this isn’t even a bad thing! Au contraire!\n\nWell you see for the older generation, or let’s be a bit nicer and say for us Veterans it’s something we longed for. We wished for. We needed.\n\nWhile there are numerous good games on the market, be it 2D, 2.5D or 3D there’s nothing quite like a Metroid or a Metroidvania for that matter.\n\nAnd boy this game is one of the best if not THE BEST Metroidvania which was released in the last years.\n\nAs you might have noticed, I do have quite an affection for Metroid and the Metroidvania genre.\n\nBut let that not blind you! While I get critically hit by the games Nostalgia strike, I have to say it’s damn near perfect. Especially if you consider that one sole human being was responsible for it.\n\nLet’s talk about the game\nI don’t want to spoil too much so I try to keep it rather short, since exploration is key for any Metroidvania.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier you slip into the role of Trace, a scientist, which awakes on an alien and high-tech planet after suffering a fatal injury. Confused as to where he is and whether he’s still alive or not and what this is all about he tries to makes sense of his situation.\n\nAfter hearing a strange voice which seems to try to help him he ventures into the next room and finds a Weapon …\n\nThus begins your Story in Axiom Verge.\n\nWith a weapon in your hand, it’s now up to you to explore your new environment and try to make sense of your situation. Death? Illusion? Afterlife? Reality? Dream?\nIt’s now up to you to figure out what exactly happened to you.\n\nAfter you’ve explored a bit you might notice the game has several glitches. Those are intended. Those glitches can be anything. Power Ups for your character or even Secret Rooms. It’s up to you to find them to gain new powers so you can explore every bit of this weird place you’ve found yourself in.\n\nYou’ll find numerous Power Ups which will help you out in one way or another.\nMost of the time a new Power Up means that you’re now able to reach new areas you’ve been unable to reach.\n\nThe Drill for example allows you to, while dealing damage to enemies, destroy certain rocks which will occasional block your path.\n\nSo you see there’s something for every situation.\n\nThe game features a variety of enemies and bosses and also secret labyrinths which feature unique creatures and bosses.\n\nSo let’s talk about the boss fights for a bit here. If you’re new to the Metroidvania genre then they might, maybe, hard for you but if you’ve played games like this before then they might be actually a bit too easy.\n\nThis might be really the only negative aspect of the game that I could find.\n\nEverything else, the art, game design and music … Those all work in perfect harmony.\n\nWhat else can I say?\nNostalgia! NOSTALGIA! If you grew up with games like this then this will be a must have for you. I guarantee it. Even if you’ve never played a game like this before I’d say go ahead and buy it. I truly believe that it’s the perfect entry into the Metroidvania genre, if that is, you’re not able to get your hands on Metroid.\nEven if you just want to try something new this might be just the game for you.","June 5, 2015","true","7.2"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","40","48","0","6"

Axiom Verge excels at recreating what made those games so special.\n\nthe 2D side scrolling gameplay is a wonderful compliment to the vibrant colors in each of the different areas. As the player traverses the game’s many different environments a massive sense of nostalgia is bound to kick in as every sound and pixel is reminiscent of the past games.

There are no waypoints telling you where to go next. You will get lost. You will spend half an hour trying to figure out where to go next. And once you find the way, it’ll feel amazing, kind of like discovering a hidden room in your own house. But being lost for a while isn’t so bad, because there’s optional hidden stuff everywhere that will make you more powerful in a staggering number of ways. Rest assured that you will definitely need to hunt around a bit for some power, as the game’s difficulty can ramp up to near-impossible levels if you don’t have enough HP or firepower to deal with the stuff you'll stumble across. With its branching paths, interconnected areas, and numerous secrets, the level design borders on perfection.\n\nAnd then there are the upgrades. You’ve got your standard expected powerups like high-jump, life expansions, and alternate weapons… but there’s also a half-dozen powerups that you will never see coming, and this is where the game really shines. In Metroidvania games, we’ve trained ourselves to watch our surroundings and say “Hey, there’s a blocked passage with some obstacles in front of it. Guess I better come back when I’ve got the right upgrades.” But Axiom Verge does a great job of keeping this from even happening; the powerups are so unique and different than what you’d expect that you’ll never be able to spot where they’re used ahead of time, so you’ll have to periodically wander around with a fresh eye to re-evaluate the world using your current abilities. If you remember that magical moment when you got the Space Jump in Super Metroid and realized “Whoa, I can fly now?!” You’ve got a good idea of what to expect from the powerups in this game. (In fact, don’t even watch the trailer. It spoils some of ‘em.)\n\nThe sound and art direction is scary good. Without spoiling anything, the game pays very close attention to detail, and you’ll constantly be finding little things to appreciate. The artistic design of the environments will trigger a lot of recognition not only from Super Metroid, but also from Fusion and Zero Mission. I love how creepy some of the environments are; if you’ve ever felt that Metroid games didn’t have enough creepy organic elements in the stage design, this game’s got you covered.\n\nMy nitpicks are comparatively small:\n\n- Late into the game, the controls start to get questionable. You’ll have to juggle about 6 buttons for special items alone, and there’s one item which is too easy to misfire on accident if you’re not careful. Hope you've got a controller.\n\n- The story’s a bit on the incomprehensible side. There is no awesome “baby Metroid saves you” moment; instead there are only a handful of "WTF" moments and no straightforward explanation for them. The ending was less than satisfying, and apparently the biggest questions will be answered in the sequel.\n\n- While the soundtrack is very stylish and distinguishable, I found it lacking some powerful melodies. Out of all the tracks, only about one of them is melodic enough to hum. Most of the tracks have a heavy, same-sounding techno beat which could get tiring to hear after a while.\n\nOverall, Axiom Verge does for Super Metroid what Shovel Knight did for Mega Man, going above and beyond a simple homage and demonstrating an astounding understanding both of what Metroid fans wanted, and how the formula could be expanded using new ideas. Game length is about 10 hours on the initial playthrough if you take your time and hunt for stuff without a guide. The homage bits are spot-on, and the new ideas are brilliant, sometimes shocking. Despite some nitpicks, I give the game a solid 9/10. The gameplay was thoroughly satisfying from beginning to end.\n\nIs it worth the $20 asking price? It’s a bit steep. I think that if you’re not sure what you’re getting into, wait for a 25-50% sale. But if I were to ask you “Have you ever wished that you could go back in time and re-live the day you played Super Metroid for the first time, so that everything would feel new again?” and you were to respond “hell yes,” then the game is worth every penny. Go support this developer; you won’t regret it.","February 29","true","13.3"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

Everything the positive reviews tell you is true: The controls are tight, the game is expansive, it lets you explore at your own pace, the difficulty is perfect (tough yet fair). It is everything modern games are not: earnest in design, unpretentious, filled with mechanics waiting to be learned and applied. That's all you need to know - If I went into any more detail, I'd just be repeating what the other fellas told you. It's true. This game is terrific.\n\nLet me point out something else instead: AXIOM VERGE is trippy. The right kind of trippy too. They totally chanelled Tsutomu Nihei's BLAME and BIOMEGA mangas in terms of story and aesthetics. (If you haven't read those: get 'em, they're fun!) You won't see ACTIVISION or BETHESDA doing that anytime soon.\n\nTo sum up: I totally dig this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spessmarine/recommended/332200/","spessmarine","TRUE DOOM MURDERHEAD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spessmarine/","477 products in account","This game is incredible.  From the mind of one man, who made all the art, music, story and gameplay, comes one of the best Metroid games I've ever played(my favorite game series, sans Other M).  Now, that's being a bit disingenuous, since Axiom Verge very much adds a lot to the Metroid formula, though makes no bones about where its inspirations initially come from.\n\nThrough abilities such as teleportation, the Address Disruptor(a gun that creates NES-era visual data corruption on objects and enemies, similar to if you put an NES cart in wrong), the drone, and other abilities, it expands on the standard 2D Metroid gameplay in a huge way.  The lack of a run button is kind of a bummer, but that's a minor quibble, and the only major gripe is that teleportation requires a double-tap in the direction you want to teleport, which means trying to do this on an analog stick is pretty much luck-based.  I wind up going sideways when I want to go up, up when I want to go sideways far too often, but there's other means of movement that I can resort to to avoid that.\n\nThe graphics are incredible.  Using a faux-8-bit style with setpieces and bosses that fill the screen(or beyond!), I would say it is a visual combination of Metroid and H.R. Geiger.  Every single tile and object is covered with minute details, from dents and rust on bosses and enemies, to throbbing veins in organic scenery.  The Rusalki are incredibly unnerving looking, as you'll see as you play the game.  The gross organic look of many objects and enemies mixed with the technological parts of others makes for horrible techno-organic nightmare machines.  Backgrounds and terrain are lovingly detailed, and the special effects are straight-up surprising.  While I've been following the game for a while and thus knew about things like the Address Disruptor's effects, or what a boss death looks like, these things will likely shock a new player with their "oh, right, this is a modern game!" effect.\n\nThe weaponry is plenty and varied.  Not all are useful, plenty are gimmicky, but most have their time to shine.  I wound up sticking with the starter weapon for long range, and the Kelver for close up for most of the game, switching to about a half dozen other weapons throughout the game for specific reasons.  At the end I still hadn't found a full half of the total weapon count, so I'm eager to get back in and track them down.\n\nThe music is outstanding.  The boss fight themes are all frantic and intense, and the general world exploration themes are fitting to their respective zones.  I am definitely going to buy the soundtrack once it goes on sale.\n\nThe story starts off as basically Half-Life 1.  Lab experiment goes wrong, you get teleported to hostile alien world full of horrible death creatures.  Trace is a pretty interesting character whose reactions to things are pretty justified.  The Rusalki, your "narrators", essentially, are alien AI and have different personalities themselves that evolve as the game progresses.  By the end, I was mostly satisfied with the story, and a few sections of the game blew me away(the Hallucination section, in particular, was one of my favorite parts of a game in years).  Athetos, Trace, the Rusalki, they COULD have had more fleshed out stories, but I think it was fine as it was.  There's more to the story in hidden notes and such, possibly a true ending as well?  Not entirely sure, still haven't collected everything as of this review.\n\nGame time clocked in at around 12-13 hours total for a 70% playthrough for me.  I'm the sort to fumble around trying to find secrets though, so an 8-10 hour playthrough wouldn't surprise me, and there's a speedrun achievement for beating it in 4 hours, so there's that.  It's definitely a much longer Metroid game than most Metroids tend to be.\n\nOverall I'd say this was a 10 out of 10.  The only complaint of mine, detailed earlier, is for a single movement ability that works most of the time.  I was constantly exploring new regions and surprised by the variety in terrain, the music is great, very fitting, and only gets better as the game goes on, the gameplay was fun and very varied while providing plenty of options for weaponry, the visuals are some of the best 8-bit style graphics ever made, and the story is perfectly serviceable.  A must-buy if you enjoy Metroid games, or platformers in general!","May 17, 2015","true","20.0"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/332200/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","Axiom Verge is a good game in the vein of Metroid/Super Metroid with Castlevania-esque graphics circa 1990. It's rather impressive for a title made by one person, but it's not without faults. The gameplay itself is very tight and enjoyable, and the story, while sort of predictable, is interesting to a point. There's a ton of upgrades to obtain, and many of them are optional. One thing I do like is that most upgrades boost the stats of all of your weapons, including damage, bullet size and range. This is an excellent way to make weapons feel less useless throughout the game, but the problem is there's so many weapons that you'll likely only use a handful of them. I think I had around 13 or so, and I kept defaulting to the best ones, some of which are from the first quarter or third of the game.\n\nSecrets are kind of interesting, as while there's a lot of secrets that are the same playthrough to playthrough, some of them, the secret worlds that look more retro and glitchy than the rest of the game, are randomized. You get 5 of them, and one of them is supposed to contain a strong weapon. Unfortunately I couldn't ever find the secret world with the weapon in it, but it's a really cool idea.\n\nThe game has an interesting "speed run mode" where it'll put time stamps on killing bosses and automatically skip text and cutscene stuff, so that's pretty cool if you're into speed runs.\n\nI guess the only other gripe I have besides there being a state of weapon overload, some of the level design could be more interesting. Much of this could be chalked up to the NES style, what with the blocky setting, but many of the underground areas lack their own gimmick to make the areas feel more separate. Also, I guess another extra thing on top of it is the last boss is really unsatisfying. Like, RNG bad. You are basically trading hits until it's over, so if you don't have a ton of upgrades or the flamethrower it's going to be rough (beware low %!). It's really up to if you get health drops or not, which sometimes you get absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed on. Not really a great way to close off an otherwise really fun experience.\n\nAll of this aside, I still feel like it's $20 well spent, though I'm highly biased toward Metroidvania titles. There's a lot of fantasy themed Metroidvanias to pick from (Chasm, Valdis Story, UnEpic, and eventually Bloodstained) but not really many sci-fi ones. Axiom Verge would be in the top selections of what you can get on Steam in the sci-fi variety without question, but it may not be as deep of a Metroidvania compared to some of the fantasy ones. A good title, but probably not a "must play" for everyone.","May 15, 2015","true","17.7"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","34","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/recommended/332200/","sweetzz","Sweetz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/","320 products in account","Axiom Verge is another game for which I wish Steam had a neutral ranking.  I'd call the game "tentatively recommended...with many caveats".  Lacking such a rating category, I'll have to lean on the side of not recommending it.\n\nMy number one complaint about the game is that the secrets, of which there are many, are handled in far, far too archaic a manner.  Basically there are tons of blocks which appear solid but can be passed in one way or another; some are telegraphed visually, but many are not.  This makes upgrade/secret hunting an excruciatingly tedious process of trying your several wall bypassing abilities on nearly every wall in the game.  This isn't fun.  Upgrade hunting in Metroidvanias is rewarding when it's obvious you can come back and get something later - and you remember it and do so.  Stumbling into a hidden room because you exhaustively tried every ability on every wall in the adjoining area doesn't make you feel clever, it makes you feel like your time is being wasted by a developer who has no concept of fairness.\n\nI finished the game with barely half of its available weapon arsenal, which I only realized upon consulting a guide after the fact.  Some were hidden so fiendishly that I'm surprised a developer would go so far out of their way to discourage the average player from getting to experience some of the more entertaining weapons that said developer surely put good effort into creating.  Even if you do find some of them, most can only be obtained so late in the game that you never really have much time to play with them anyway, which is a shame because they are all pretty interesting and fun to use.\n\nMany details of game's story are similarly buried in hard to find journal entries, and from what I gather it seems like the developer is a bit too enamored with his grand designs there as well.  It's overly complex and too obfuscated for the passive manner in which its delivered and I once again can't understand the logic of putting all that effort into it, only to then hide it except from the most obsessive of players.\n\nNow that being said -  you can ignore the secrets, ignore the story, play the game in a straightforward manner - and it manages to be a decent Metroidvania, although even then not without foibles. Primary among them is a type of dash ability obtained roughly half-way through the game.  This is activated by double tapping a movement direction which, when playing with an analog stick (an absolutely fine input method before that point) is often accidentally activated when you don't want it to, and annoying to pull off with appropriate timing when you do want to use it.  A button dedicated to the dash would have been preferable.\n\nThe tile based graphics are also a little too slavishly retro for my taste, to the extent that I'd even call the game ugly in parts, and on several occasions I had trouble distinguishing between foreground and background tiles.  In my defense, this is because there are places the sames tiles are actually used for both - which is another of the misleading methods by which paths to items are hidden.\n\nThe difficulty can range from infuriating to a breeze, completely dependent on what weapons you've found.  While the ease with which some bosses can be dispatched with optional weapons would be a good reason to encourage exploration - as a new player experiencing the game for the first time, you have no idea that these weapons are out there to be found.\n\nUltimately, I had some fun with the core game, but took no joy in the exploration and backtracking because of how things were hidden and that's pretty damning for a Metroidvania.  There are far better examples of the genre in recent memory.","December 27, 2015","false","14.0"," 81 of 128 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","81","128","6","13"

Even despite having several large levels, you never get tired of running back and forth. Graphics is colorful and stylish, range of available equipment is wide, and you can move really fast, performing various acrobatic tricks. Also, there is a certain horizontal lift, which makes inter-level journeys a matter of seconds. Very nice. And very important for every game of metroidvania genre.\nIt's not hard. I'm definelty not a hardcore platformer lover. Neither a casual, though... I just enjoy style, story, puzzles and exporation more than fighting, analysing boss movement patterns and so on. When I see "difficult" tag on a platformer game, it makes me a little sad. Axiom Verge is not one of this rouge-likeish super-hard platformers.\nVisual style. There is not enough words to describe how much I love pixel-art. And also, I adore cyberpunk, bio-mechanical-styled things, and postapocalyptic athmosphere. Every one of that is present in Axiom Verge. On the top of it, game has very nice and modern visual effects, which turned up to be very nice addition. Stylish bio-mechanic pixel gun, radiating distortion effect on stylish pixel backgrounds. Beautiful.\nSoundtrack. It's very good. Just listen to it.\nGame tells interesting story. But, to be honest, the story is not a main source of fun in the game.\nAlso don't let the fact that this game has only one developer, who is also the artist, composer and designer, Axiom Verge is not a mere "indie" game.

Yes please!\nSurprisingly there are very few retro metroidvania games that exist on Steam, so the erection experienced was fierce when I found out that Axiom Verge was making a appearance.\n\nOn a more serious note...\nAs a whole this game is rather impressive, with nice environments to explore, pleasing musics to be heard, crisp and responsive controls to be played and quality pixel are to be seen. But if we were to dissect Axiom Verge and take a closer look at our samples we will start to find a couple of flaws.\n\nThis peculiar world is big and vast but has many empty areas which aren't fully utilised; it seems like there are a few too many pointless areas and places which act like filler or a waste of space. But, you find a tool called the "Address Disruptor" which can be used to disintegrate certain walls and bring platforms into existence. While altering the environment it also has a effect on the creatures as well. Some of them can be altered to allow you to access new areas you originally couldn't get too. A little creature that shoots beams at you will transform and instead shoot enemies or blow up walls, while a floating ball can be made more solid and ridden on to allow you to get to hard to reach places. Very neat and fun addition to the game.\n\nWhile the boss designs are brilliant, they really lack any form of difficulty and each fight so far seems to be underwhelming and unrewarding. (The biggest downfall IMO but maybe this might be better on the hard difficulty) For example you fight this one guy who is absolutely huge and intimidating, but the entire fight is spent standing behind a wall and peaking out shots between his attacks. Another fight I spent the entire time crouched down spamming my weapon fire while the boss just sent shots over my head. So far I have 1 shot all bosses and they are quite lame fights to be honest :(\n\nConclusion\nThis is starting to sound like a negative review but it truly isn't. When you put all the pieces together the game shines as a fun and addicting platformer that I can really see myself sinking a lot of time into. Sometimes I feel I need to do something more productive with the time given to me. But I can't resist it when you have game developers/music producers like Thomas Happ, who with tender love and care create absolute quality games by sinking their heart and soul into them. While it's not without its flaws, I can't recommend this game enough to every gamer who likes to dabble in retro platforming goodness.","May 14, 2015","true","15.1"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","24","35","7","0"

Works well enough when the platforming isn't where the challenge is, it's the shooting. Only problem I ran into was the dash ability you eventually unlock, which is a little too sensitive. Works by double-tapping a direction, and from fidgeting on platforms, I would constantly dash myself off of them.\n\nCombat: Easily the game's biggest strength, there are a ton of different weapons to find, and all of them are optional (apart from the first), I think. I found a use for just about every weapon at some point, which is a nice surprise given the lack of ammo/damage types that are usually present to force weapon variety. Somewhat challenging boss fights, though it helps if you have the "correct" weapon for the fight.\n\nStory/Exploration: Story was weird enough to keep me guessing at where it was going, but interesting enough to keep me invested in what was going on.

There are few games that do what they do and do it well. Axiom Verge does not do the former but, it does the latter.\n\nAxiom Verge is a passion project five years in development by Thomas Happ, and in every facet of this game, the game radiates that passion for the adventure platformers(or "Metroidvanias" if you prefer) of yore. Every single part of this game oozes care that many indie games fail to capture when emulating that style of game.\n\nTo many, Axiom Verge may seem nothing more but yet another independant project trying to emulate classics such as Metroid or Symphony of the Night but do not be fooled, beneath the surface lies a game that stands on it’s own legs. Axiom Verge is not as much concerned with breaking the mold and changing how these types of games are played, or even try to set itself apart. Axiom Verge does what the aforementioned games do but is content with doing it well rather than make any unnecessary changes to the formula.\n\nDo not take this as me saying “Axiom Verge does nothing new”. The game takes ideas established by games such as metroid but subverts in its application of mechanics. It uses the player’s familiarity with the genre and turns it on it’s head, as demonstrated by the game’s “remote drone” power up, which initially functions like the morph ball but as you progress further in the game, it is fit with functions such as the drill and teleporting the player proper to the drone’s location, which add more functionality to the drone and make way for more varied methods of traversing the vast game world. This is one of many mechanics in the game that seem familiar to other games, but are implemented differently and utilized in entirely different and fresh situations.\n\nSubversion is the keyword. Everything Axiom Verge sets out on accomplishing from other titles is quickly subverted and has the game’s own spin on such mechanics. From traversal power ups that seem familiar to the game’s weaponry, everything in the game is a subversion of what a player would expect from such games when it comes to mechanics and power ups. The game will always start off in familiar territory but take unexpected turns and make such ideas it’s own.\n\nThe game’s implementation of these ideas and a larger focus on subverting player expectations make this game a divider between other Metroid style games. Axiom Verge is less a “clone” or an attempt to recapture the older titles that inspired it, but is in fact more of a love letter to such games. The game’s design does not dwell on the past unlike games such as “Shovel Knight” which dwell on old design and nostalgia without establishing an identity of their own. Axiom Verge is the antithesis of “retro throwback”-style games, it has it’s own identity.\n\nAxiom Verge is fantastic and has quickly established itself as one of my favorite games of all time. It is what I personally consider to be one of the few “perfect” games. It is highly recommended for anyone looking for something fresh in the style of games such as Metroid.","November 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The developer of Axiom Verge managed to create a Metroid style game that captures the essense of the Nintendo masterpiece better than anything I've played since the actual Metroid itself. Forget the other "Metroidvania" games you find on Steam, this bar none the best of the bunch.\n\nEverything from Maps, Weaponry, Items, Music and level design is a wonderful homage to Metroid, and yet the developer managed to turn this into his own unique game. I couldn't put the controller down, and I was hooked from the first night. My first run took somewhere close to 16 hours becuase I did get stuck quite often, so this game does not hold your hand in the slightest. There are plenty of secrets and some obscure locations and items to find, I suggest a walk-through if you're desperate, but there are some things I was positive I would have never found on my own because of cryptic puzzles and hiding places.\n\nMy only complaint is that some items and areas were hidden pretty well and a little too obscure, and honeslty there were too many weapons and most of them were not worth using. I like the fact that there is variety and people could potentially use a certain weapon the entire game if they wanted to, but there are just so many, and so many of them are junk or far too situational. I mean, there is one weaopn in the game that I literally used once for a certain boss and never touched it again because it had no other practical application beyond that. Kind of a waste.\n\nI also felt that the last section of the game, namely the final two maps you visit, were a little rushed. The final boss is also kind of a let down and I was hoping for much more.\n\nI can't fault the game entirely for the ending and the abundance of (bad, junky, worthless) weapons, because overall this game really does belong in your library if you're a fan of these types of games. I will be playing this again, maybe trying for that speedrun or low item % run, you never know.\n\nI hope the guy that made this game releases a sequel, I really do.","April 8","true","16.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Like most metroidvania games, you explore a large and connected world doing things like platforming, shooting enemies, getting powerups, and getting new abilities that will help you solve puzzles, beat bosses, and generally progress in the game. There are also a good amount of secrets and some interesting story bits thrown in. The overall story is confusing and mysterious, which helps add to the alienated vibe of the game as well as making the plot more interesting. Without spoiling anything, the basic plot is that you play as Trace, a brilliant scientist that gets caught in a lab explosion, loses consciousness, and winds up in an unknown place. It's up to you to figure where you are, what happened, and how to get home.\n\nAs mentioned, the gameplay is mainly platforming, shooting, exploring, and some mild puzzle solving. You can find a good variety of items if you look hard enough. You can get powerups to increase the damage, size, and range of your weapons, as well as expansions to your health. There are some passive powerups mixed in with tools that will give you new abilities, helping you progress through the game. There are some interesting notes you can find scattered throughout the world that will give you more bits and pieces to the mysterious story as well. However, the coolest part is that you can find a lot of cool weapons. A few are required to get through the game, but many of them are found by exploring. These weapons all have their own unique qualities. It's nice because they are well balanced and do not require extra ammo. They all have inifinite ammo, meaning you can play around with them all you like. So you can use certain weapons to effectively fight certain enemies, cycle through all your weapons to vary your gameplay, or just pick your weapon of choice and have a ball! It adds a layer of fun to the discovery of new weapons. Plus, the controls are tight and the control scheme is fairly comfortable.\n\nThe art is very colorful yet fitting to the world of unknown mystery and wonder. I also found myself really liking the soundtrack a lot. Sounds a bit John Carpenter-esque to me. It's crazy how Tom Happ has managed to do such a great job with the gameplay, the art, and the music basically all by himself. The package as a whole comes together beautifully. The dark, mysterious atmosphere and cool techno influences mixed with a bit of alien flair make for an engaging experience that sucks you into the game for hours.\n\nAs great as I think Axiom Verge is, there ARE some negative arguments to be had. It didn't run flawlessly on my computer, but my computer is a bit dated and worn out as well so I'm sure it was not a fault of the game... just thought I'd mention it slowed down in some of the larger, busier areas for me. Hardly worth complaining about. This game is clearly heavily inspired by the Metroid series, and while I love that... you could make the argument that it is borrowing from that inspiration a bit too heavily. I personally think it has enough differences and unique twists to make it work as an original game expanding on the genre, but I could understand some people not finding it distant enough from that source. It'd also be cool to have a bit more of a choice in some story elements, but ultimately it is a story that you have to follow and your character is Trace, not you, so I suppose it makes sense the way it is. My only real complaint with the game is that you get a dashing ability, but once you get it you cannot turn it off. This can be troublesome for precise movements because you dash by double tapping in a direction. So if you're trying to move forward and then stop to dodge something and move forward again too quickly... you'll dash instead of just moving. You can lock your position or turn all the way around on stopping to remedy it, but it is a touch adjustment and can still get you killed in some hectic situations while you move eradically. As far as replay value, it's probably not a game you'll start up again immediately after finishing it. There's hard mode, which seems to be about the same but harder, and speedrun mode for... well... speedrunning. So unless you want it to be more difficult, you want to speed through the game, or want to go hunting for achievements, then you probably will leave it alone after your playthrough. Though it DOES have good replay value in the sense that you'll definitely be coming back to it at some point to experience it all again, and the amount of playtime in your playthough is pretty good.\n\nSo there are a few bad points, but the good clearly outweighs the bad in this case. It's a decent length game with tons of things to find and a neat story. The music and art are very interesting as well. If you like Metroid, Super Metroid, or metroidvania games in general, then you'll definitely appreciate this game. Honestly, it's probably one of the best games I've played on Steam. So the question is... is it worth the price? And for this one, the answer is yes. 20 dollars for 15-20 hours of great gameplay is definitely worth your time and money. If you're on the fence about waiting for a sale or just getting it full price, get it. It's worth it and it's worth supporting with the purchase. I couldn't wait either and I certainly don't regret it one bit. Axiom Verge gets a 10 out of 10 for being one of the best metroidvania experiences I've ever had.","September 16, 2015","true","17.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

This feels way more like a pure Metroid game than anything. Gameplay wise, your character's strength is defined by the items they find; no amount of killing will make you healthier or faster. However, there's a massive amount of weapons that makes fights enjoyable, and exploration tools that open up the world around you, with pickups that increase your health, damage, weapon range and even projectile size, so exploration is well-rewarded. The main issue with this is that a good 20% of the items can only be found with one end-game item, and finding the right areas to plunder can become a massive hassle if you aim for 100%\n\nThe story was intriguing enough to keep me going to the credits. One scene near the midsection played out rather well, with the gameplay changing to match the character's state of mind... somewhat. I'd describe the ending, but I'd rather avoid spoilers so let's say that, on a personal note, I wasn't a fan. However, I liked the game's use of graphical glitches as a gameplay and story element, and was very pleased that the player-character, Trace, doesn't once remark on how the glitches reminds him of things he saw in a video game he once played. It's all played straight, with mentions of "artifacts" and "The Breach" being things that affect the world in unnatural ways.\n\nThe game-map is pretty big, or at least it feels big. There's lots of things to be found, as was mentioned in the first paragraph, and returning to old areas with new tools not only makes exploration fun, but makes killing once-annoying enemies with new weapons all the more fulfilling to one-shot. One of my main gripes with the game (along with what makes me not want to dub it "Metroidvania") is that you have no method of warping to places late in the game; your main method of fast travel is to make for the hub-corridor and catch a ride with a local monstrosity. Which is pretty neat in how streamlined it is, but with the way lore is presented, I'm surprised there wasn't a way to get taken to specific save-points around the world. There's also an annoying habit of having secret areas hidden behind blocks that are identical to other blocks, so you'll spend a lot of time hugging walls near the end.\n\nSound is good. Music loops similar to how old PS1 games used MP3 tracks in that they finished the song, then played it again after a moment's silence. I wouldn't call it stuck-in-my-head-for-days memorable, seeing as it's mainly ambience. But the final boss fight is easily the exception, and I'm sure it'll find its way onto playlists here and there. One track ended up grating thanks to either dying and returning to a save point over and over again, or just revisiting said area and slowly losing patience for what started out as a really cool track. As a plus, if you go into low HP values, the game will do the usual "bdeep-bdeep" thing, but it's in time with the music, and will slowly dip in volume so that you're not being assaulted by "BDEEP-BDEEP-BDEEP-BDEEP" like some annoying £5 alarm clock.\n\nThere's also an optional Speedrun mode that adds a timer and cuts out story and "randomised" elements so you can try to beat the game as quickly as possible. It's something I might use, and I'm sure others would be pleased to see it.\n\nI'll add in as a disclaimer that I got the game as a birthday gift so the value of the game is a bit nebulous. But I would easily recommend the game to people with £15 knocking around, if they're a fan of older 2D Metroid games. For anyone else, I'd say check out gameplay videos first.","May 6","true","11.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

What's even more impressive is just how professionally crafted it is. The level design is superb, the items are unique and well thought out, and the massive array of weapons are varied and useful in their own particular ways.\n\nEven more importantly, the controls are spot-on (I played on a PS2 controller run through a USB converter). This is especially apparent when using the Tethered Charge weapon. With the full collection of items, there's some crazy acrobatics you can accomplish.\n\nThe story is told primarily through text boxes and SNES-esque cutscenes, and never felt overdone or particularly obnoxious. It's also pretty compelling, and I was curious to see how it'd play out. Furthermore, playing on Speedrun mode removes all the story elements completely, for a pure run-through.\n\nMy only real complaint was the lack of difficulty on most of the bosses. With the exception of the later few, bosses were complete pushovers (even on Hard difficulty). Considering how impressive and intimidating they are, it was odd how most enemies posed more of a threat.\n\nThat aside, Axiom Verge was an absolute blast to play, and having just finished my first play-through, I'm already starting on a second!","June 8, 2015","true","74.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/332200/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","Let’s start by saying Axiom Verge is essentially a Metroid Game… and it is a very good one. As a massive fan of the series it pains me that Nintendo have not released a proper 2D Metroid game in 11 years (none of this Prime nonsense) but Axiom Verge really is the closest you are going to get.\n\nAfter an experiment of yours goes South you wake up in a strange world called Sudra. It’s a strange world not too dissimilar to the planet Zebes and this doesn’t seem to bother the games Protagonist Trace one bit… But we’ll overlook that. The game’s plot is interesting and engaging and remind me slightly of indie hit “The Swapper”.\n\nThe game sees you travel across the world guarded by large mechanical beings known as the Rusulka. These beings are your eyes and ears and guide you across the planet. Without giving away any plot elements these being form a key part of Axiom Verge’s plot.\nThe game emphasises exploration much like the Metroid games of old and it draws you in as you want to push further and further into its twists and caverns. One thing where the game does differ from the Metroid Franchise is the emphasis on different guns. Each of the guns allow slightly different attacks and excel in different situations… think the guns in Contra and you have a good idea what to expect.\n\nThere are other equipment to find that opens up new parts of the map such as a laser drill lets you drill through rock opening up new paths and secrets, a grappling hook with a striking resemblance to the one from Bionic Commando and right about the time you expect to get the morph ball you get access to a drone that you can set through small space and eventually teleport to.\n\nOne of the games key stand out features however is its glitch mechanic. Early in the game you acquire a gun called the Address Disruptor. The device can corrupt enemies and make them glitch out. This allows enemies to be converted to another form which may make them attackable, give out health or let you stand on them. There are loads of cool things to find and using this gun makes the game seem like a breath of fresh air. It also allows you to access secret areas that contain some of the game’s best weapons but these secret areas change every play through.\n\nThe Save system in the game works well. There are save points scattered across the land which you teleport back to if you die. What is helpful is that you do not lose any of you gear that you have gained since you last save point. This helpful mechanic makes dying less painful as it tends to happen quite a lot.\n\nThe game isn’t perfect. Some of the controls are fiddly and do not always seem to work as expected and obviously forget playing it with anything but an Xbox game pad. Another small issue is some of the enemies seem a little odd and do not really fit the rest of the game (the swirly flower things particularly come to mind).\n\nThe sound design however is fantastic and the background music in each zone really helps set them apart from one another.\n\nAll in all the game took me about 15 hours to get through and even then I had only found 72% of items and 95% of the map (sod the tops of tall rooms). What makes this amazing game even more remarkable is the fact it is made by one man. Tom Happ has created Axiom Verge all alone and this really stands as a testament to what is achievable. Axiom Verge is the best Metroidvania game this century and apart from the 2 standouts of the genre Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night this really is the best of the best.\n\nYou can check our our video review of the game here: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150513_game-tutor-grades-axiom-verge-pc-steam","May 14, 2015","true","25.1"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","20","32","0","0"

I definitely did, and I LOVE Axiom Verge. Hell, even if you've never experienced a Metroid game (which, personally, I'd remedy some time in the near future), this game may yet be up your alley. This game contains colorful 16-bit visuals with the occasional stylish twist, catchy techno beats that I listen to even when I'm not playing the game, over a hundred collectibles hidden throughout nine worlds, over twenty unique weapons with special properties, a very interesting mechanic where you can "glitch" enemies to completely change how they behave (sometimes even turning them into your allies!), a drill to pierce the heavens with, the ability to warp through walls, a grappling hook (à la Super Metroid), and a cute little remote controlled drone that looks like a headcrab!\n\nFor $20, this game is a steal; at the time of this review's creation, I spent 19.2 hours in Axiom Verge, and I JUST NOW completed it for the first time.

The first boss fight teaches you that the faces of the enemies are the vulnerable spots, but this doesn't hold true for the rest of the bosses. Following fights have similar face areas on the bosses, but 2 of the 4 similarly designed bosses do not follow this same fight strategy. This would be perfectly acceptable if it weren't for the fact that it is established so early in the game that the particular spot is the weak point. In addition to this, multiple boss fights felt as though there was no space for dodging projectiles and attacks, and some of the attacks were too fast with too large of hitboxes. This left me feeling cheated at certain points of the game, having to fight a boss over and over, hoping I would make one mistake less than the last time (I'm sure I just suck at the game). The most memorable and well designed boss fight was the 3rd one, where the player could shoot different parts of the boss to disable those weapons. There was also an arena that punished reckless gameplay while rewarding thoughtful execution by providing cover to certain weapons at varying times. This fight also followed the first boss' damage design which made the other two fights with similar face designs feel more confusing. The arena was spacious and provided plenty of room to dodge the projectiles.\nIn regards to the overall world design, I liked the visuals and the different areas, but I found that they didn't make structural sense in the context of a world (and I hate to compare to Metroid) like Zebes from Super Metroid. Where in Super Metroid the levels changed gradually and made sense in their placement relative to each other (lava is deeper in the planet while the crashed space ship is at the surface, burrowed partly into the crust), Axiom Verge had a world which seemed to feel more like a variety show à la Metroid Fusion. In Fusion this made sense because Nintendo created a scientific environment testing vessel, but Axiom Verge is supposedly a continuous world.\nThe story of Axiom Verge is told through notes and written dialogue/cutscenes, and while I have no problem with this method of storytelling I found the story itself to be far less ambitious or consequential as I thought it would be. This is where I bring my first direct criticism of Tom Happ himself; he has stretched himself too thin in creating Axiom Verge as a one-man development team. Happ has a strong grasp of the metroidvania genre and he clearly understands implicit level design where the player can find the next area and item through exploration. Where he struggles is storytelling and designing a compelling narrative for players. This is fine of course because Happ is great at making a tight game that controls like none other, but with such an ambitious story for Axiom Verge, I would have preferred someone else's touch on the narrative and how the gameplay and world reflected this story.\n\nAll of these gripes are minor because I simply loved the overworld, the combat, and the sense of progression based on items and powerups. I look forward to seeing what Happ develops in the future, and I hope he can collaborate with others to create a masterpiece following this promising first major release.\n\nTL;DR\nTHE GAME IS GOOD, NOT PERFECT.

I've just completed it and I feel buzzed. On first impressions it might seem like another Metroid clone. However, the more you play, the more you realise that it has a unique character and personality of its own. I'd say the words spiritual successor would be most appropriate. It utilises all of the strengths of the Metroid franchise and virtually none of the weaknesses.\n\nThe game is challenging, but none of that challenge was unfair. It was obvious the developer could see the game through the player's eyes when designing it, like having save rooms spaced apart at perfect intervals (and there's always one before boss fights), the levels being designed really well, the controls being slick and smooth, and you're never forced to do silly wall jumping manoeuvres that Metroid had you do.\n\nThe visuals worked well. Most of them were just dungeons really, but everything was consistent. And the music was a whole new level of awesome, ranging from gripping atmospheric tracks to adrenaline-pumping boss battle tracks.\n\nThe game throws a variety of challenges your way, there are tonnes of weapons and unique accessories to collect that help you get stronger, plenty of secrets to find, but my favourite aspect were probably the boss fights. They were all challenging to some degree, especially the ones in the second half of the game, but each and every one of them could be beaten with the right strategy. The trick is to simply figure out that strategy and to optimize it. I kind of wish there were more of them in fact. From what I recall, the game only has 7 boss fights in total.\n\nSince this is mostly a dungeon crawler, the story was in the background most of the time, but it had some cool and unique concepts, and the backstory cutscenes were always interesting, as they always revealed something new.\n\nI can't really find anything major to criticise about the game, aside from the fact that it's not for everyone. If you've ever liked any of the Metroid games, or any other games with similar gameplay, you wouldn't want to miss Axiom Verge. It's slick, fun, and rewarding, exactly as games should be.","June 24, 2015","true","16.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

That doesn't mean it's a bad game, it's still very good actually, but in this review I will mainly talk about the things I didn't like,  because I think those are always more important factors for someone who is thinking about buying the game.\n\nThere are a surprising amount of weapons in the game, some of them are also a bit harder to find, and that's cool, but the difference between the weapons is so minor or some weapons are so extremely situational that you will maybe use it just 3 or 4 times or so. I think the developer could easily "merge" the functionality of some weapons together who kinda fullfil the same role. For example you get a spreadshot which shoots 3 projectiles in a cone with very low range, but then you get a weapon which shoots electricity in a cone but this one can also shoot through walls and does more damage too.\nOr you have like 4 different weapons which just shoot projectiles forward with just really small differences, and then you have a weapon which covers the whole screen but does little damage. The sound design of the weapons is also not great.\n\nThen there are the enemies. A lot of enemies just have their movement pattern and technically "ignore" you, you just have to watch out that you don't touch them or their attacks. The game had too many enemies like that for my taste. I find these enemies annoying most of the time, because they prevent you from traversing the enviroment, because they crawl along the paths you have to go most of the time. And that is a problem since this a metroidvania and you will backtrack A LOT in this game. There are also more aggressive enemies, some really cool ones, but also a lot of really annoying enemies. Some have attacks which are undodgable, well, in theory you could dodge some attacks I guess, but in practice it's just annoying. Much later in the game there are enemies you can only dodge using the teleport ability, but using the teleport ability is really fiddley so sometimes weird things happen.\nBecause the weapons aren't well designed overall and there are more annoying enemies than fun to fight, the combat isn't the strongest suite of this game.\n\nWhat was really dissapointing, like REALLY dissapointing, were the bossfights. Visually they are really really well designed, but they have extremely weird attack patterns, weird weak spots and the fights mostly consist of standing in the right spot and spamming the shoot button. It also doesn't help that the bossfight music is the same for every boss.\nAll of these annoyances get even worse at the last quarter of the game where the game sends you from one end of the world to the other just to get an item, then back to the other end of the world and then somewhere else. On your way the game throws one room full of enemies at you after the other with the thoughest enemies of the game. But because this gets so tedious and annoying I just wanted to rush through past all enemies or was too lazy to go to a save room or something which even led to more frustrating moments.\n\nAnyway, that was a lot of criticism, I still really like this game. First of all I think the game does a good job with the metroidvania aspect (good, not great). There are a lot of different pick ups you can find, not only weapons and items you need to progress, but also stat upgrades and stuff like that. I also like how all the areas are connected with each other and how the game guides you a bit through it`s world. However you can easily forget where you can go and where you know you need an item for. This could easily be solved if the game just let you put notes on the map, an infinite number of notes with custom text, currently you can just mark 2 spots per area which doesn't help at all. A good example of what I mean is Legend of Grimrock 2. The difference between your character at the start of the game and at the end is so extremely huge, you really feel the progress you made.\n\nThe story of the game starts really simple and boring actually, and after reading the first lines of dialouges I thought this will be a throwaway story, but over the course of your journey the story gets more and more interesting. The game also has some really neat surprises for you. The presentation and atmossphere are also really strong, the pixel art is really really good except for a few enemies, but sometimes you come across some really huge and incredible looking things. The music also fits the game really well, I especially like the subtle sounds when you are in the room before the bossfight.\n\nSo. The game has functional combat, good exploration, interesting story and nice atmossphere and music. It is also over 8 hours long which is nice, however as I said the last quarter of the game is really tedious. If you are a fan or metroidvanias the purchase is a no brainer for you, you probably already purchased it. For everyone else I recommend waiting for a small sale.","October 28, 2015","true","9.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm really happy I own it, but wow should I have nabbed it sooner! The aesthetic is very Giger, lovingly depicted with some truly amazing art. The sound design in each area is haunting, yet also uplifting. It makes you want to see what's around the next corner, what next powerup you will get.\n\nThe map lets you mark two places of interest per "zone", so you can know to come back once you get powerups. As for the powerups...\n\nThey're AMAZING. You have a few standard ones, and your first gun is pretty standard, but there are over 10 guns, all of them giving you more options instead of simply being raw power. While Super Metroid's beam modes were neat and all, this enables smarter, more personalized, creative play. Like playing close ranged? That's there. Like standing back, using obstacles, etc? Adapt to the situation with more and more tools to deal with each situation!\n\nThe lore is also very interesting, showing you glimpses of an amazing culture, a ruined world, and hints of who and what you are. I don't want to spoil anything except to say that I was as curious to find more lore as I was to get more powerups and kick more booty.\n\nIf you like metroidvanias, especially if you enjoy the brand that is less rpg elements and more item based (and not for stat ups, though those exist!), this is for you.","January 2","true","13.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Everything about this game is utterly fantastic. The gameplay, the graphics, the music (good lord the music). Axiom Verge is a love letter to Metroid in video game form. It is -unabashedly- Metroid. If you grew up on 2D platformers, this will be your jam. Even if you didn't, PLAY THIS GAME. It was made by a single dude!\n\nIt's a short but sweet experience. I'd say on average it'll last anywhere from 8 to 12 hours. I clocked in at 11 and a half hours as my clear time. There's a ton of collectables and hidden items scattered throughout the game, but most are pretty optional.\n\nSpeaking of collectables and hidden items, Axiom Verge has a lot of weapons. A LOT of weapons. I think there's 20 or so? A minor gripe I had was that despite the vast array of weaponry, only a handful are actually useful. It seems like the design mentality was akin to "sounds cool on paper", but in practice it ends up being pretty useless. Fortunately, the handful of weapons that are good are REALLY GOOD. And to be fair, some of the "useless" weapons are really useful against certain bosses.\n\nAnother gripe I had was regarding some of the controls. Two upgrades in particular, the Grapple and the various Dash upgrades you get have kinda... janky controls. They're pretty unwieldy. The grapple's just plain hard to use, and the dash, well... The dash activates by doubletapping a direction, but often times I'd find it would activate randomly on its own just from normal movement. I would much have prefered the dash being mapped to a button instead.\n\nOverall, solid Metroid-y experience. I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of 2D platformers or Metroidvanias.

However it turned out surprisingly good for a one-man project. Not bad at all, Mr. Happ.\n\nAxiom Verge's story is alright but nothing that will stick with you. It does start out promising but as I've uncovered more of the story, either via "cutscenes" or hidden collectable letters (an idea I always welcome), the less I cared for it. It's really hard to win me over with a story so take this information with a grain of salt.\n\nGraphically it looks very reminiscent to Metroid and the games' overworld provides some beautiful sceneries, tho I think that fore- and background visuals often look very inconsistent. Nevertheless they get the job done and I really love the overall asthetic, right down to the garbled mess of glitchy sprites. The music is for the most part well done and greatly add to the isolating atmosphere of the game, but the instrumentation in some of the tracks can get very annoying.\n\nThere are over 20 different modules for your "Axiom Disruptor" to find, and while I haven't unlocked all of these modules yet, I've found myself only using 2 of them in my entire playthrough as both were efficient enough to destroy whatever came in front of me. Along your way through the game you will also pick up items that allow you to literally glitch through obstacles, dash or let you cling on ceilings and swing across pits "Bionic Commando-style". Player control is well done with the exception of performing dashes which require you to double-press your analog stick or digital pad to the intended direction. It often happened that I dashed without actually wanting to do that maneuver. Not only that but the analog stick control in the main menu is overly sensitive. I've played Axiom Verge with a XBOX360 controller and I'd like to hear feedback regarding this issue from other players.\n\nThomas Happ did a really good job with the design of the overworld. I haven't found myself stuck at any point during my playthrough despite the lack of information given to the player (as it should be). Even backtracking to locations you've already been at before doesn't feel like a chore. Secrets are very well hidden and will require some extensive searching. I'd argue that the level design is Axiom Verges' strongpoint.\n\nAnd despite all the good things I have to say about this game, it somewhat lacks its own identity. It lends itself way too much to Metroid and plays it safe. And the somewhat lackluster story doesn't help to emigrate that feeling.\nAlso I don't think that the game provides enough content for the 20€ Steam is asking for it. I think that 15€ at max are a good investment.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAxiom Verge schafft es, das Metroid-Feeling im Spiel aufkeimen zu lassen, geht aber auf Nummer sicher und kopiert Metroid lediglich, anstatt auf dem altbewährten Konzept der bekannten Reihe aufzubauen. Dennoch ist es eine respektable Leistung für ein Ein-Mann-Entwicklerteam, gute Arbeit Mr. Happ.\n\nDie Geschichte von Axiom Verge geht in Ordnung aber es ist keine, die den meisten Spielern lange im Gedächtnis bleiben wird. Am Anfang beginnt sie vielversprechend doch je mehr von der Geschichte aufgedeckt wurde, entweder durch Cutscenes oder versteckten Notizblättern, desto weniger interessierte sie mich. Ich bin nur sehr schwer mit einer guten Videospielgeschichte zu überzeugen, daher solltet ihr meine Meinung zur Geschichte nicht zu wörtlich nehmen.\nDie deutsche Übersetzung ist tolerabel, einige Rechtschreibfehler gilt es zu verkraften.\n\nGrafisch lehnt sich Axiom Verge an Metroid an und die Overworld bietet hier und da auch einige schöne Kulissen an, auch wenn es öfters vorkommt, dass Vor- und Hintergrundgrafiken oftmals sehr inkonsistent zueinander wirken. Die Ästhetik des Spiel gefällt mir sehr gut, bishin zu den grotesken Glitchgrafiken. Die Musik ist größtenteils sehr gut und verleiht der Overworld auch eine unglaublich gute Atmosphäre der Isolation. Nur wurde die Instrumentation für einige Musikstücke ünglücklich getroffen, was beim längeren Verbleib in einer bestimmten Sektion auf die Nerven gehen kann.\n\n20 verschiedene Waffenmodule gilt es für deinen "Axiom Disruptor" zu finden. Allerdings habe ich während meines Playthroughs nur von zwei von diesen Gebrauch gemacht, da beide sich gut komplementiert haben und der Rest nicht wirklich hilfreich erschien. Außer Waffen findet man in Axiom Verge noch weitere Items, die einem ermöglichen, sich durch Wände zu glitchen, einen Dashmove auszuführen oder sich an Decken anzuhängen und über Abgründe zu schwingen, wie in "Bionic Commando". Die Steuerung wurde im Großen und Ganzen gut umgesetzt. Allerdings hatte ich das Problem, dass die Spielfigur öfters den Dashmove eingesetzt hat ohne dass ich dies auch wollte (Doppel-Tippen des Analgsticks oder Digitalpads in eine bestimme Richtung). Außerdem ist die Steuerung im Menü mittels Analogsticks viel zu empfindlich. Ich habe Axiom Verge mit einem XBOX360 Controller gespielt und würde gerne wissen, ob auch andere User die selben Probleme hatten)\n\nThomas Happ hat hervorragende Arbeit bei der Gestaltung der Overworld geleistet. Nicht einmal während meines gesamten Playthroughs bin ich irgendwo hängen geblieben, trotz spärlicher Informationen, die dem Spieler vorgesetzt werden (wie es auch sein sollte). Selbst das Backtracking in Areale, die man schon besucht hat, belastet nicht. Secrets sind sehr gut versteckt worden und es bedarf ein waches Auge um sie alle zu finden. Meiner Meinung nach ist das Leveldesign die größte Stärke von Axiom Verge.\n\nUnd trotz all den guten Dingen, die ich über das Spiel zu sagen habe, fehlt diesem eine eigene identität. Es lehnt sich einfach zu sehr an Metroid an und geht auf Nummer sicher. Und auch die schwache Geschichte des Spiels trägt nicht dazu bei, es vom Muster zu differenzieren.\nUnd ich denke nicht, dass das Spiel genug Content abliefert, um die 20€ rechtfertigen zu können, die Steam für das Spiel verlangt. 15€ wären noch in Grenzen.","May 16, 2015","true","9.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I couldn't wait for it to drop on Steam. So, I never thought I'd be writing a negative review for it.\n\nI did have fun with the game, but that's where the praise begins and ends. Of course, the soundtrack and art style are very cool and attractive, but the game proper underwhelms.\n\nThe game length is quite short (8 hours with ~85% completion), and the early parts are fun, but you quickly become too powerful for any of the game's enemies to be a threat to you, even on Hard mode. Basically, that means Axiom Verge quickly becomes focused on the exploration aspect.\n\nWhile exploring is half the fun of any metroidvania, the game gets into a slump where you're just dashing around the map like a mad man toward any undiscovered map tile, ignoring enemies and trying to find the next powerup (which you only need to get to the next powerup, anyway). The enemies might as well not even be in the game; you hardly deal with them past the first couple hours of the game.\n\nThe real problem with this game is the controls. Bosses get damn near impossible at the end of the game; one tiny tap on the control sticks will switch out your weapon, or enter the radial weapon select menu, or send you double-tap dashing in a random direction. The final boss fight was a nightmare akin to a Mario Party minigame, where I was spinning my D-Pad around and mashing buttons like crazy, just praying to get through it. The final upgrade you get is practically impossible to control, since it seems to have a mind of its own in terms of controller deadspace and which directions it "thinks" you wanted to double-tap.\n\nThe bottom line is that the game suffers from simplistic level and enemy design. If enemies were designed to be tough at first but then much easier to beat with each successive upgrade, there would be a sense of difficulty progression, but the game feels like a flatline item-hunt after the first couple hours. Also, the story is mostly incomprehensible, although to be fair, I haven't read all the collectible note logs. It's possible that the story does get fleshed out and has a great ending, but I personally wasn't gripped by anything the story had to offer.\n\nThat being said, I still think any self-respecting metroidvania fan ought to give Axiom Verge a go. I'd just wait for the game to go on sale.","May 16, 2015","false","12.0"," 142 of 268 people (53%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","53","142","268","12","20"

The developer CLEARLY understands the target audience; the execution of this game is flawless. From pixel 1, I was engaged, entertained, challenged (but not frustrated), and taken aback at the quality of this production.

With multiple collectables upgrades for health, weapon damage, range, projectile size, and various special upgrades, the game's structure plays out with the exact same progression as a metroid game. The most interesting gameplay mechanic comes from a sort of 'virus' that appears to plague the planet you are present on, and it is represented as game corruption (the kind you get when you don't put a game cartridge all the way in or run a rom through a corruptor). There's even a weapon upgrade that allows you to corrupt tiles and enemies with various, and sometimes bizzare, results.\n\nThe music is very solid, and while the graphical fidelity may be lower due to using pixel art, there is enough in the way of modern particle effects and distortion to make the game feel visually polished. Sadly, while the story is interesting enough, the main character is fairly forgettable, but Axiom Verge isn't a story driven game in any capacity, so this doesn't hurt the game much, if at all.\n\nThis game is of course not as polished as an actual metroid title, but is well worth playing, and at the very least has rightfully earned my 20 dollars.","May 15, 2015","true","15.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

The exploration is just not fun, which is a big minus for a metroidvania. The enemies are more often than not very annoying to take out, and you'll be killing the same ones a lot due to the nature of these types of games. On top of that, the movement abilities are laughably hard to use. I can't fathom the logic that went into the way the grappling hook works, and the trenchcoat is far too easy to trigger by accident. I would often find myself climbing to a great height only to struggle with the grappling hook or accidentally teleport into thin air, forcing me to make the climb all over again. Even after several hours, I couldn't shake the feeling that the game was working against me.\n\nThe bosses, which were what drew me to this game in the first place, ended up being very grindy. You find a single weakness and you exploit it repetitively until the boss is dead. Not much going on there.\n\nOn the plus side, it has a really neat art style and an interesting story. The hacking aspect is pretty novel as well. But these don't save it in my opinion.","September 13, 2015","false","8.0"," 39 of 72 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","39","72","2","3"

Aside from excelling in every area, what sets it apart is a compelling intrigue and a wide range of pretty unique mechanisms, which I will do my best not to spoil here.\n\nThe first right note that the game hits is the atmosphere. The visual design might not be everyone's cup of tea (it surely wasn't mine at first), but the somewhat crude colours of this alien world in which you find yourself stranded play their part in creating a deep sense of immersion. The sounds and music are on point, and set the perfect mood for the 12-15 hours you'll probably spend exploring and backtracking across the different areas on a casual playthrough.\n\nThe sense of progression is extremely satisfying throughout the adventure. The level design teases you along the way with a good number of inaccessible areas and/or pickups, which you'll be encouraged to revisit once you've acquired new tech. Aside from lore logs and the usual upgrades (health, range, weapon damage), a good number of the items you will find are inherently specific to Axiom Verge and will have unique consequences on the gameplay. The movement upgrades really redefine the platforming, and the rather sizeable pool of weapons will leave you with a lot of options when it comes to combat.\n\nThe difficulty balance was just right for me - some of the end-game rooms and bosses are pretty brutal, but exploring and acquiring enough upgrades will make it possible to push through without too much grinding and frustration. With a clear mind and a bit of experience with the genre, finding your way on your own is perfectly possible (and I would deeply recommend doing so, as it is infinitely more satisfying than following a guide). The more hardcore-oriented players will be glad to know about the inclusion of a Hard mode as well as a built-in Speedrun mode, complete with global/split timers, reduced RNG and leaderboards with separate categories (any%, 100%, low%)! Nonetheless, Axiom Verge is perfectly suited for casual gameplay as well.\n\nDid I mention one person did all of this? Yep. The coding, the art, the level design, the music (!)... all the work of a single man, Tom Happ, who created Axiom Verge as a personal project in his spare time over the course of five years. For a game this close to perfection in every area and a product far above the industry's usual finishing standards, this is truly impressive.","March 14","true","15.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Full of great, responsive Metroidvania gameplay. Very close feel to Metroid, without seeming like a clone. Great ascetics and atmosphere. Menu systems are great, as are the map and weapon systems.\n\nGameplay:\nControls are very tight, and I highly suggest that you play this one with a PS3/PS4 controller. Having the dpad in the main spot and the precision of the gamepad is vital near the end of the game, where you use one of your swifter moves and require precise use of it (or at least I did to stay alive) during the final battle. Doing this double tap Left/Right with a joystick is ok at first, but it is very difficult near the end.\n\nThe weapons are fantastic, and I implore you to find them all. Each weapon as it's great strengths, even if they felt miniscule in the final few rooms, where the enemies are quite tough. Superb selection. Movement is tight, and I very much loved how responsive the game was.\n\nStory:\nStunning, while you are in a place that you don't understand, the alien story is nice and simple, while leaving ambiguity in droves, even after the end of the game. Smells like a sequel :)\n\nWhile games like this (due to ADHD) tend to make me only play in small bursts at first, man, was I HOOKED near 2nd half of the game, going after every nook and cranny of each map section. Even though I took time to explore every area I could, I ended up with a 90% map completion, and a 60% item completion.

You start on a strange alien planet with nothing more than your wits. Progression comes by acquiring new abilities that give you access to new areas. The world eventually opens up, and there are lots of places to explore and secrets to uncover.\n\nVery quickly, however, Axiom Verge subverts your expectations of a game of this sort, especially if you've played Metroid before. You'll see blocks and places and think "Oh, I'll use bombs here" or "I'll get a morph ball later". By the second ability you get, the game gives you a completely different way to progress past them. The methods of travel and manipulation tools you get crazier as you go on, and like any good entry in the genre, by the end you can zoom around and steamroll enemies with ease.\n\nGetting there will be a long road, as the game puts up a decent challenge at its regular difficulty. The regular enemies start off simple enough, but later ones have attacks and abilities that will catch you off guard the first time you encounter them. While you can brute force your way through them, knowing your abilities and weapons will give you an easier time when dealing with them. The bosses don't evolve quite as much, but they mostly manage to be intense, fun encounters. If you love exploration and puzzles, this game has you covered as well, as some of the most difficult secrets will require you to know the game's mechanics and require you to pay careful attention to your surroundings to claim your rewards.\n\nThe exploration and fights are a pleasant experience since the presentation is excellent. The world of Axiom Verge looks very nice and retro, with a style that gives an appropriately otherworldly feel, and even manages to make graphical glitches significant. The music has an old-school feel, and like the graphics manages to evoke the feel of a wondrous,  unfamiliar place.\n\nThe high points Axiom Verge hits makes the low points all the more glaring. The coolness of the best items makes the ones that aren't as subversive or useful that much more disappointing. While each map looks great on its own, they don't connect together well, with one example being an area with a night sky connected to an area with a daytime sky. The story has potential, and looks like it might go in some interesting directions, but it drops plot points and world elements as quickly as it introduces them. In the end, most of the consequences of the game's events are waved away, although the ones that aren't leave things open for interpretation.\n\nEven then, the flaws don't detract enough from the game's best moments. Axiom Verge is a great experience that looks like a straight tribute to Metroid, but eventually forges its own path, and largely succeeds at it. If you enjoy big exploration-based sci-fi adventures, this comes highly recommended.","November 15, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But that label does an injustice for what the game presents.  There is an unbelievable amount of items and powerups packed into this game, and thats not even bringing up the most unique thing about this game: glitching the world!  That concept really enhances the game experience and presents a new set of challenges and strategies that your basic Metroid clone would lack.  It also is paced very well, starting you off nice and slow, but really pushing you come the end when you get more powerful.  Even on the easiest difficulty, playing careless will result in death.  Doubly true for bosses, which all present difficult but fair challenges.  However, a few bosses can be defeated using cheap tricks.\n\nThe story knows its place is on the backburner, because the thing that sells this game is the adventure and action.  So it is generally not intrusive.  And the backstory is revealed only through certain pickups.  But it does have some interesting ways of reintroducing itself, ways that you will definitely not see coming.  The story isnt anything special, but it was not lazily written by any means.\n\nOverall, Axiom Verge is one of the best games I've played on Steam.  And thanks to item percentages, multiple endings, and even a speedrun mode for those who enjoy that challenge, there is replay value there. Whether you get it on sale or not, it is worth the price tag, without question.  This game is not just some Metroid clone, its takes that label and glitches it into oblivion.","February 10","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Rips off Super Metroid shamelessly, but is not as tight design-wise, which, in the end, makes Axiom Verge it's own thing. Still, it's the closer any game has ever got to Super Metroid. Metroid Fusion is less Super-like than Axiom Verge. (I'll confess I can't compare with Zero Mission, because it's been too long since I last played it.) A clone with it's own thing - yes, it's kinda paradoxical. It's like a fan-made spiritual successor, albeit the fan is a professional programmer/designer/artist/composer/nerd-god-among-us and Axiom Verge is his  spare time project, or so I heard.\n\nPros:* The closer you'll get to Super Metroid, my favorite game ever.\n* Design: cool retro aesthetics, sometimes going even to monocromatic or CGA-like palette. HR Giger and Cronenberg-inspired biomechanical design. Also, glitch art relating to reality bending mechanics.\n* Some huge bosses. The screen zooms out so you can see the whole monster and his room!\n* You can use a PS4 controller right of the bat it you want. I don't have one, but if you do, good for you. A 360 one will do too.\n* Huge array of weapons. Most of them have a clear trade-off. The ones that cover wider area are weaker. Some have very specific uses. Most of the time, I used an electric bolt more akin to a melee weapon than a projectile, very strong albeit very short ranged, but hits across walls and floors. Another cool weapon is an electric beam that homes into the enemy, but it's not effective with some enemies.\n* Very cool mobility mechanics! See those narrow tunnels? Think you'll get a morph ball upgrade?  No, you'll control a spider drone to explore and gather itens! Later on, you'll be able to teleport into the drone's position. You'll also be able to teleport to the other side of walls and later on, you'll have a multidirectional teleporting dash! So maybe you want to reach a distant platform? How about jumping, teleporting up at the apex, then blasting the drone's egg, hatch the egg, teleport into the drone's position, teleport dash again and voilá: there is your platform! Maybe you're a grappling hook person? You're covered too! Go as Cronenberg-Bionic Commando as you like, Rick!\n* Glitch your enemies away! Adress disruptor will turn your enemies into those things that used to appear on your screen when you banged your cartridge while your system was on. Their AI will change too in different ways. Some will become slower, others will alter their motion, some will turn against other enemies, some will turn into platforms and a specific kind will even become controllable via player input. There may be trade-offs, as enemies may become slower, but gain a special attack. Some walls and platforms can also be glitched-deglitched so to allow your way.\n* Great music! Very sci-fi-like electronica. Chiptune square sound waves mixed with traditional trance-like sounds. Listen to Famicom/NES's square wave being modulated into distortion!\n* Although I've seen a reviewer claiming he got stuck for 2 or 3 hours, I've breezed through the entire game in far less than a week. Granted, sometimes I didn't know what I was supposed to do, but I did it anyway (It's a Metroid clone - you go everywhere you can and look for anything you can. What's the secret?). No guides used. Only clue I got from somewhere else was a spoiler in that said video review - thanks Super Bunnyhop... Good thing it was nothing major, not getting that would not hinder my game. Also, I cannot understand why some people complain about difficulty. This game, at least in normal mode, is not hard at all! I'm impressed how quick I've beaten it.\n* Although the design is not as supertight as Super Metroid's, this gives Axiom Verge it's own twists. As you'll not be as efficient as Samus doging a barrage of bullets, you'll find yourself hiding a lot and exploiting enemie's AI's inefficiencies, like when it traps itself in a corner. But that exploit adds to the sense of strategy. Knowing how enemies behave is essential to come up with ways to defeat them or at least to run away from them.\n* Fun.\n\nCons:* Shameless Super Metroid rip-off. Wait - wasn't this one a pro? Oh yeah, right. Next one, please.\n* Although it says "Full controller support", it's limited to 360 and PS4. Got a PS2 one and plan to use X360ce on this game? Too bad, it won't happen! You gotta have a Xinput controller or a Dualshock 4. SCPToolkit (Windows only) will do the trick for Dualshock 3. Google it and give it a try if you need it, it's worth it.\n* The story is very difficult to grasp! While Super Metroid told its tale through game mechanics, Axiom Verge will explain the backstory of everything through dialogue and notes. Not a bad thing per se and Metroid Fusion already got that approach before, so it's not new either. But this one is made from the start to twist your brain! If you have the patience, by the end you'll make sense of all the nonsense, but it's too convoluted to be for everyone. It's nothing you'd not have seen in Moffat-era Doctor Who before, but that alone says something.\n* Although weapons variety is cool, most of them will not be used. I was surprised to realize how many times the best approach was to use the default weapon.\n* Although bosses' visual designs are cool, some of them have uninteresting AI. There is one in particular which I killed just by mashing fire as I realized all I had to do was beating his fire frequency (gunfight until one of us dies first).\n* Sometimes you gain access to a new part of the map, dig your way into a hole, only to realize your reward was not an upgrade, but a backstory note. And sometimes you won't even be able to translate the alien language. Said backstory notes should be located only in areas you have to traverse anyway, not in detours where your sole purpose is the note.\n* I sometimes wished the combat was tighter and being a bullet-sponge was less of a successful strategy - maybe you should try hard mode if that's your concern too, but beware: the said bullet-sponge strategy becomes a legit strategy on two or three later bosses - the last boss, specifically, is all about how much damage you can take and how much you can recover before depleting your health. Health is no rare commodity in normal mode but, in hard mode, that changes. Bullet count goes the other way around, so choose wiselly when to soak yourself in bullets.\n* I wish it was longer, but I can't have everything I want, can I? As a one-man-made game, you would expect a lot less.\n\nSummarizing, a great game, not a perfect one, but no game is. It's a Metroid ripoff and knows it well, and yet it presents cool new ideas. Just make sure you have the right type of gamepad or you don't mind using your keyboard.\n\n10/10 - Would Cronenberg it again.","January 8","true","20.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Controid I guess.  Or Metra. If I was Contra and my kid was Axiom Verge, I'd suspect my spouse to have slept with someone else, maybe Dark Seed.\n\nI observed Axiom Verge's development (by only Tom Happ) for quite some time and was looking forward to its release. I cried a little when I heard, it'd be a timed exclusive for PS4, however it's all okay again, since it was just one month. And what I got completely satisfied my thirst for a next "true" metroidvania.\n\nWhile games like Guacamelee! or Strider (2014) are great and fun in their own regard, the metroidvania feel gets lost when they show you where you have to go on your map. In Axiom Verge, there's no such hand holding (at least not that I was aware of). You get put in a maze and have to figure out on your own how to get through it. I backtracked wrong a couple of times, but that's more fine by me, as this defines what metroidvanias should be about - to be beaten by your own urge of exploration. And when you didn't (and I didn't...) set the markers, the game generously give you, you'll be there for some time to explore.\n\nIt took me little more than 10 hours to complete the game, if don't explore every inch, like me, and sometimes pointlessly backtrack, you can finish it in about 8. For me, this is a perfect duration. In fact, I expected the game to last about three to five hours, like, say, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, so I was pleasantly surprised when I hadn't reached the ending at all after five.\n\nThe game feels even more amazing, when I think about that it was developed by just one person. Also, this ensures that the whole game experience is a lot rounder, however it doesn't come without at least SOME downsides. I thought, that some controls (I mean you, double tapping! And you, grappling hook.) felt a bit unintuitive. The music, while providing an excellent atmosphere to the game, was looped a bit cheap in the areas, that might have been better.\n\nOtherwise Axiom Verge brings an amazing experience to every lover of the metroidvania subgenre or frightening, HR Giger like artstyle or, preferably, both.\n\nHighly recommended!","May 22, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Some just seem like they have no purpose at all, other than the make the game more difficult. They also seem underpowered, as they rarely stop anything.

A lot of the environments in the game are quite visually striking too, albeit a bit self-indulgent. Lately that's the only thing that kept me going through the game.\n\nBut even so, the design of these maps are painfully outdated. The original metroid could get away with endless vertical climbs and recycled enemies with boosted health because of hardware limitations. I hate to use this cliche', but it's 2015, level design must have meaning (I'm talking to the thoughless amount of dead ends through corridors in Axiom Verge) many of the places I jump to, have no meaning, no puzzle, it wastes the player's time.\n\nWhat made metroidvania games so good in the past, was their incredibly fast pacing and constant gratification of finding secrets throughout the map. Some of those "metroidvania" traits exist here, but they are too far apart, or you're busy jumping to a place that leads to a dead end.

It took me a while to get into it, but some of the weapons and tools you get are really awesome, like teleporting through walls or shooting drones to go through small areas. There are some really cool songs in there like the boss theme ( Trace is Rising ), though overall I wasn't really blown away but the soundtrack. The progression/exploration is also a little weird. I found myself backtracking quite often (especially during the second half of the game) and not knowing where to go so it can be a little frustrating when this happens.\n\nThe story gets really interesting halfway through the game, so yeah I recommend it, but maybe wait until it gets on sale.\n\n7/10","December 19, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it doesn't just copy the ideas that made the older games so great, it builds upon them introducing a lot of cool original mechanics and ideas into the mix.\n\nAxiom Verge is a real treat for any Metroid fan and you should go play it, it's just that good. The level design is spot on, the controls are tight and the various little mechanics that you unlock along the way all feel unique and interesting. A lot of the unlocks also seem to fit into the theme and story very well. The story itself appears to be really interesting and cool. And finally the music is really good, although the sound effects themselves don't sit really well with me. They seem a bit too generic. It's easy to forgive that tho when everything else is so good.\n\nThe only gripe I really have with Axiom Verge is the poor english localisation - I wish the developers would ask someone proficient in english to go through the text and correct it.

What makes Axiom Verge stand out is several things:\n1. a very creating and interesting world (not going into details to avoid spoilers)\n2. great feeling controls: smooth jumping, not hitbox shenanigans, and fairly easy aiming\n3. OPTIONS!  So much of the game is optional, it really rewards exploration.\nTo expound on point 3, it is common in games of this genre for the player to spend a lot of time retracing their steps trying to find the way to progress the story forwards.  Axiom Verge is no exception here but it is less irrirating because you will frequently stumble across a new weapon, health upgrade, or extra story element.\n\nAxiom Verge is an outstanding example that future games of this genre will be compared against.

The story is different, the weapons are different.\nBut you jump around, exploring areas with funny names on an alien planet, fighting hordes of enemies, and bosses that are waaaay bigger than  you.\n\nFor something made by one person, and their vision. It's pretty damn amazing.\nAxiom Verge does, what Nintendon't (Or haven't done in a god damn while).\n\nI'm not going to give a score, because I don't think games can be label good or bad with a single number.\nI will say that this game IS amazing, and hits a lot of the right notes for me.\n\nGiven there are a few things I don't quite like/agree with design-wise. Though this should be taken as a way to make the game better.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing visuals, things look pretty... well, there are some ugly things, but that's intentional!\n- Interesting story (I wanted to know more and more about where I was and what was going on).\n- Tight controls, walking and jumping around feels good and responsive.\n- Rewards gaming instincts.\n- JUSTIN-BAILEY\n- Tutorials through experimentation/gameplay.\n- Music is great and fits the setting. Elements of the HUD, and cutscenes are in time with the music. I love this stuff!\n- I want more of it.\n- Characters are well rounded, and have emotions. One of the "Good" characters even kills you at one point out of anger.\n- Moral ambiguity, makes for interesting story, and thought provoking situations.\n- Many hidden secrets, but much like Metroid, they can be in stupid places. Though I found 70% of items my first time.\n- Lots of weapons, all act differently. I found a use for most of them at least once, but I stuck with the main weapon.\n- Cool toys! You get a bloody corruptor, you can glitch out enemies and make them do weird stuff!\n- Not too much backtracking, not until you're tricked out with all the fancy toys, making it easy to get around.\n\nCons:\n- The Final Boss is a bit... Hard. Could just be me, but it's way too hectic. And was pretty much "Shoot the thing and win".\n- I would have liked to see the final boss actually use some of the tools and tricks you picked up.\n- The "Invalid" hit noise, that Metroid had too, is freaking loud, and can play over the top of itself!\n- Some areas, mainly the first and second one, kind of blended together for me.\n- I want more of it.\n- Kinda open/underwhelming ending, this could be for a sequel though.

It is a side scrolling shooter that plays about as fast as Metroid or Castlevania and can easily become difficult if you increase the difficulty.\n\nThe story is based on a scientist that has something go wrong in his lab and then he ends up elsewhere.  Without going further into the story, it gets unique to say the least.  You get a multitude of different weapons, one for each number key on your keyboard and a few secrets as well as abilities that enable you to access more parts of the level. Things like phase shifting through walls to upgraded weapon power and health nodes.\n\nThe graphics on the store page are what you get.  A retro throwback to the golden days of gaming.  As you explore the level you will find secrets in the walls as well as secret levels that give you more upgrades.  Overall, my play time logged is how long it took me to finish the game with most of everything collected.  You can speed run the game in a much quicker fashion if you like but you miss out on the exploration and the bosses can be considerbly harder without additional power or health increases.\n\nMy only complaint, is without hard mode, the bosses are incredibly easy to beat and can be cheesed with ease.  Even the final boss was relativelty easy.  As I have said before, this can be remedied with hard mode and can make things a bit more difficult and possibly frusterating.\n\nFor anyone looking at a side scrolling action platformer, I would recommend this game.  I couldn't pull myself away at times and wanted to keep on playing.  When a game does that to the player, it tends to show how well designed it is.  I hope there is a sequel planned, I had read talks about it but who knows.  The story was well designed and threw a curveball at me as I progressed, which is an awesome way to immerse the player.\n\nThe only negative things I can think of with this game that would detract and possible sway a purchase is that the bosses are indeed cheesable.  Even on hard, you can still cheese them but everything else is generally much more difficult.\n","March 18","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vittorioe/recommended/332200/","vittorioe","Vittorio E","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vittorioe/","162 products in account","An excellent Metroid clone, this one gets almost everything right.  I think the general creepiness of the world feels like the original Metroid, but the controls are more precise like the SNES iteration.  I love that the game never tells you exactly where to go next, this is what's missing in today's action/adventure games (with the notable exception of the Dark Souls series).\n\nThe upgrades that allow you to progress from one area to the next constantly surprised me - I was almost always wrong about what was needed to access a new location.  A few examples: you don't need missiles to open doors, you don't use bombs to blow up weak blocks, you don't roll up into a ball to get through tight spaces, and you don't get a freeze gun to turn enemies into stepping stones.  There were a couple exceptions, but for the most part the developer did an excellent job coming up with new ways to solve these old puzzles.\n\nThe music is some of the best I've heard in gaming, from any time period - dark synths with the occasional bit of creepy chanting.  And the graphics, while a little bland in some of the wall/floor textures and enemy sprite designs, more than make up for any shortcomings with several rooms that are absolutely jaw-dropping.  Many of the weapons also put on a nice light show, and are worth tracking down for this alone.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, most of them are completely optional, and unless you go back and thoroughly explore you won't find half of them.  You probably also won't find many of the other secrets the game has to offer - I already know I didn't get the best ending, but I'm looking forward to going back in the near future.\n\nIf I had to come up with a complaint, I would say the bosses, while looking very impressive, all had fairly easy patterns that did not really change during the battles (most simply got faster as you damaged them).  This is a minor issue though, and did not affect my enjoyment of the game much.\n\nIf you enjoy Metroidvanias, this one has my highest recommendation.","April 4","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/332200/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","A lot of people seem to call this game a love letter to "metroidvania", and I can't fault them for that. This is one person's attempt to create a truly modern 2D Metroid-like game, using all the lessons learned from the best of the best in genre and adding new elements, that weren't tried in the genre before. This game has exciting exploration, varied locales, fantastic soundtrack, unique visuals that mix old-school 8bit and 16bit era art with subtle modern effects, surprisingly good challenge for the most part and a very interesting atmosphere that can probably be summarised as "sci-fi adventure as if Another World/Out of This World was designed by H.R. Giger".\n\nIt's not without flaws or questionable decisions. Challenge in the opening parts, before some upgrades, feels higher than you'd expect from a Metroid-like game, with action not being tight enough to justify that. Boss battles look great, but only 2 actually feel fun to play, with most others just being "shoot shoot shoot die already it's getting annoying shoot shoot" deals. Game features some random elements in the way of "Secret Worlds", which, in concept, are cool, but make the "exploration" part of the genre most loved for it, a bit less rewarding, because the areas are random and you have no chance of getting everything in one run. Some of the navigation moves just feel clunky to pull off, especially the very important one, that requires directional double-tap - most of the run-and-shoot actually plays better with an analogue stick, but these are very hard to pull off and are frustrating even on a d-pad, no matter what gamepad you use. And finally, the story and dialogue feel rather averagly written, which is sad simply because the setup and situations they show are actually very interesting. So, story, while often predictable, is exciting to experience and the world lore is out there to be found, but both are just told in a very mediocre way.\n\nThat said, the game is still fantastic, especially due to its innovation in treating death more like a... well, Souls game, I guess will be the most understandable comparison. That is - death does bring you back to the last save room you used, but you keep all the unlocked map squares, items and everything that is permanently done (like killing a boss or triggering a cutscene) stays done. This, along with the idea that enemies do not respawn immidiatelly after leaving the room and instead after you move two rooms away, makes exploration so much more fun, while not simplifying the rules to the point, where it gets boring.\n\nOne of the best recent games in genre which, while probably isn't as full of awesomeness as La-Mulana or Aquaria, still feels like a solid "proper full game" that you'd get full priced 15 years ago and love it. A real treat for anyone who wants to explore some amazing worlds in Metroid style.","November 12, 2015","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, i've never actually played Metroid or Castlevania back then, so i've been introduced to the concept much later. I guess that proves that you don't have to be a hardcore Metroid fan to enjoy Axiom Verge.\n\nThere are three things that i loved about this game. Initially i've been lured in by its visual style, and it did not disappoint me. The colossal Giger-esque Rusalki are simply gorgeous, and overall, Axiom Verge looks just right for a dark sci-fi adventure.\nThe second thing is level design - you can really feel all the effort put into it. Every labirynth on Sudra is polished to the limit, which makes for a relly satisfying exprerience.\nFinally, there's challenge. On Hard difficulty setting it's just enough to keep you going on and on, trying to find a perfect strategy to defeat another boss, or to finally gain access to that secret area you've encountered earlier.\n\nMy only minor complaint is that some of the weapons in the game are practically useless, since there's a lot of alternatives that are simply better.

I'm not being metaphorical.  This game will fill your ears with other-worldly sounds and your eyes with dancing colors, but most of all, your mind with a tale so engrossing, you will forget where you are and become lost in it for hours.\n\nI'm going to be 38 soon.  I've played many a game in my day.  I own a ton of games spanning many platforms from many generations.   It takes a lot to hold my attention anymore.  I've probably invested thousands of hours into games like D1, 2 & 3.  Starcraft, Dune, Warcraft, C&C, Sim City ect.   Even though I grew up playing them, I don't play a lot of platformers anymore.  I lean towards rpg's, rts's and games like Bioshock.  However, Axiom Verge had a Sci-Fi look that appealed to me.  So I bought it without expecting to ever really finish it.

What makes Axiom Verge stand out is several things:\n1. a very creating and interesting world (not going into details to avoid spoilers)\n2. great feeling controls: smooth jumping, not hitbox shenanigans, and fairly easy aiming\n3. OPTIONS!  So much of the game is optional, it really rewards exploration.\nTo expound on point 3, it is common in games of this genre for the player to spend a lot of time retracing their steps trying to find the way to progress the story forwards.  Axiom Verge is no exception here but it is less irrirating because you will frequently stumble across a new weapon, health upgrade, or extra story element.\n\nAxiom Verge is an outstanding example that future games of this genre will be compared against.

With my only prior meteroidvania experience being Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I didn't know if I'd like a sci-fi one. The visuals in the game ALMOST look like they would belong on an NES, but just barely make it to the 16 bit look due to multiple layers of scrolling, and amounts of color on screen (would probably be on a turbografix 16/pc engine). I got this game through Indiebox, and I'm glad I did, because I got a bunch of stuff, including a map of the game, which helped out a lot. I only really have 3 issues with this game. The first one, is backtracking. This metroidvania doesn't really have a teleportation system, exept for the INDI area, which is a glorified version of a teleporter that takes longer than one. I didn't mind the backtracking too much, but it's something to keep in mind when buying this game. Second is the PC port. I think the PC port is fine for the most part, but I'm experiencing an issue where when I'm simply playing the game, my computer doesn't recognise my controller's input as an input to the computer, so it goes into sleep mode. This is really annoying, but it can be circumvented by using big picture mode (even though it's inconvinient). My third issue is the end. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but this isn't one of those game where you feel acomplished at the end for overcoming what you faced, at least not to the extent of a lot of other games.\nOther than those issues, I can reccomend this game. I'd personally wait untill it's on sale to get it, but if you like super metroid/metroid/metroidvania games, then you'll like this one.","November 21, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But most or many of them did not get it right. Sometimes they can be so alienated from the originals they look and feel like a different game. Or do nothing to improve the fun.\n\nAxiom Verge gets it all right. Unlike many other classic games this one is still as fun to play now as it was than. It both looks, feels, and plays like the original Metroid. I feel like I am playing the original Metroid all over again with different levels and a much bigger game but still the same 8 bit classic. It moves as smooth as the 8 bit classic also. Not slow and sluggesh like the 16 bit sequel.

It is a side scrolling shooter that plays about as fast as Metroid or Castlevania and can easily become difficult if you increase the difficulty.\n\nThe story is based on a scientist that has something go wrong in his lab and then he ends up elsewhere.  Without going further into the story, it gets unique to say the least.  You get a multitude of different weapons, one for each number key on your keyboard and a few secrets as well as abilities that enable you to access more parts of the level. Things like phase shifting through walls to upgraded weapon power and health nodes.\n\nThe graphics on the store page are what you get.  A retro throwback to the golden days of gaming.  As you explore the level you will find secrets in the walls as well as secret levels that give you more upgrades.  Overall, my play time logged is how long it took me to finish the game with most of everything collected.  You can speed run the game in a much quicker fashion if you like but you miss out on the exploration and the bosses can be considerbly harder without additional power or health increases.\n\nMy only complaint, is without hard mode, the bosses are incredibly easy to beat and can be cheesed with ease.  Even the final boss was relativelty easy.  As I have said before, this can be remedied with hard mode and can make things a bit more difficult and possibly frusterating.\n\nFor anyone looking at a side scrolling action platformer, I would recommend this game.  I couldn't pull myself away at times and wanted to keep on playing.  When a game does that to the player, it tends to show how well designed it is.  I hope there is a sequel planned, I had read talks about it but who knows.  The story was well designed and threw a curveball at me as I progressed, which is an awesome way to immerse the player.\n\nThe only negative things I can think of with this game that would detract and possible sway a purchase is that the bosses are indeed cheesable.  Even on hard, you can still cheese them but everything else is generally much more difficult.\n","March 18","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its just beautiful. Its a standard 2d Metroidvania with mazelike maps, areas you cant get to until you get certain powerups, backtracking, savepoints, many different interesting weapons and items. That all is pretty vanilla for the genre. The story is minimal (so far) but is interesting enough to make me want to keepo uncovering more of the plot. You are a scientist who was performing some kind of high-energy beam experiment when *dun dun dun* something went horribly wrong and the building you were in collapsed on your head. But instead of dying you got sucked into a world that looks like one of Geiger's fever dreams. You have no idea why you're here and you hear a voice in your head...\n\nWhat makes it beyond awesome is the atmosphere and music. Creepy biomech monsters and pulsing slimy organic-looking masses in the background seem like something right out of Aliens or Metroid, and a driving electronic musical score that perfectly matches the creepy bio-alien feel. Its Metroid if Metroid was done by an indie studio in 2015. Its pixel art, but very very well made pixel art with modern depth and DPI. The controls are fluid and very well executed which is always an absolute requirement in a game like this, and the controller mapping is fully customizable. If you f'd a jump or got hit,  its your fault, not the fault of the controls. That is a breath of fresh air in and of itself.\n\nTheres a whole other aspect of the game I haven't even experienced yet, something about "glitches". You encounter areas where the graphics are glitched out, and eventually you aquire a power that allows you to inteact with them. I cant wait to see what thats about!\n\nThis is hands down one of the best Metroidvanias (emphasis on the Metroid) I've ever seen.

I followed development for 2 years prior to release. Being a long time fan of Super Metroid, I wanted something that was as good as Super Metroid. I gave Axiom Verge a lofty set of expectations, and it exceeded almost all of them. But to keep things short and concise, my personal takeaway:\n\nPros:\nThe world is very well-designed. The way pathways connect in both expected and unexpected ways, and the means by which the layout of blocks guides/teaches you is superb\nThe story - some may not be a fan of it, and it can be a bit hard to grasp, but I found it both different and intriguing. It's not limited to dialog/journal pages, but more subtle world elements as well\nUpgrades - they start out fairly boring, almost a carbon copy of what's been done before (weapons, high-jump, etc) but eventually become bizarre and unique, allowing the player to glitch through walls and such\nControls - Movement mechanics in particular become a lot of fun once you get all the mandatory upgrades\nScope - The game is a good size; large enough to sink several hours on your first playthrough, but small enough to complete in a sitting once you've mastered it\nSecrets - There are a lot of them, including an entire avenue of secrets I didn't even know about in my first playthrough. Some are very devious to find\nCons\nSecrets - They manage to be both pros and cons, because while a lot of them are clever, a lot are equally esoteric and almost frustrating\nNote taking - you're able to mark "reminders" on the map, but those reminders are just "1" and "2" - having a means to note "come back when I can jump higher" or "glitch wall I can't open yet" would serve the player much better. This issue bugged me in SotN, and it's not any better here.\nWeapon balance - There are a bunch of unique and interesting weapons - and most of them are useless gimmicks. The Axiom, the Kilver, the Flamethrower and the lightning gun/piercer are about the only weapons you'll ever use when dealing with day to day combat\nThe Climax - not strictly the "ending" or the "final boss", but the entire lead-up to the finale felt weak compared to the rest of the game. There was a lot of build-up, and the final area just didn't live up to the rest of it\nIn short: the weapon balance is terrible, the climax was disappointing, and in spite of that Axiom Verge is pretty much guaranteed to be my game of 2015 and one of the best platformers I've played in the last 20 years, if not the best thing since Super Metroid.\n\n\nAnd since everyone seems to like talking about price: Axiom Verge is absolutely worth the $20 price tag for anyone who likes games in the vein of Super Metroid.","May 20, 2015","true","35.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's obviously not aimed for players who are looking for graphics and super new detailed effects, but from my own experience this always comes at the cost of gameplay and fun. And this is where Axiom Verge excels.\n\nTook me 15 hours to beat the game with 97 deaths, 71 % map revealed and 60 % items. Yes I am kinda new to this genre and I am lame :-) This being said, I had a great time and fun. BUT the backtravelling and countless hours of just looking where you might go, what you have missed might be frustrating for someone. Some places where so unintuitive, that after a few hours I just used a guide at some parts because I value my time more than the joy of the moment when you find out where to go. Oooooh , so this is iiit .... umm okay ?\n\nThe sound and the music is another superb aspect of the game which I enjoyed very much, but the thing is that during my 2nd gameplay I found it kinda repetetive and maybe even annoying. Not every song is good, so I ended up using my own music in the background.\n\nPlayed on a keyboaard since my old Gamepad is not supporter because of the lack of the circular buttons. I have only the D-pad. Steam big picture mode doesnt let you save your controller settings which btw carries over to the game, unless you bind every button.\n\nIs this game good ? Yes it is, definitely.\nIs this game perfect ? No, it isn't. It has it's flaws like everything in this world. I am yet to play a perfect game or meet a perfect human :-)\nIs this game worth it ? Yes it is, but probably not at full price. I bought it here on steam for 17.99. I cant say I regret it, I just cant recommend it for this amount of money.\nBut know also this... the replayability in this game is huge if you like speedrunning. For the rest, one or two playthroughs will be enough.","June 16, 2015","true","24.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Wait at least a few days before getting it, though.  There are some game-stopping bugs, and the dev's patching them as fast as he can.  Once those are fixed, it'll be an incredible game.  I'm putting a Yes for my recommendation since I doubt those bugs are long for this world.\n\nSome people actually complained about the graphics, but they're supposed to look that way.  That's the chosen art-style.  It's not cheaping out.  We like it.

It had a fantastic story, superb controls, the extensive length and repla ability associated with the Metroid series, and some of the most suspenseful and immersive music that I have ever heard from interactive media.\n\nAxiom verge reminds me of this game in all of the best ways. It has a fantastic soundtrack, a lengthy hour count for being such a small game (took me 11 hours to complete the story mode at ~60% item collection), and visuals that match the old Metroid games perfectly. This is undoubtedly a game for the sake of nostalgia, bringing back the feel and attraction of old Metroid games while adding an entirely unique world and story. It is extremely difficult to believe that so much variety and creativity came from one developer, who managed to create what I must call a masterpiece.\n\nThat being said, there are a few issues I would point out to both the developer and to those who have an interest in playing this game:\n\n- It is extremely challenging, but not always in the best ways: Most of the bosses and enemies are creative, unique, and require some problem solving to defeat that make each new area a pleasure to find. However, some enemies (heavy turrets and a boss you will recognize when you fight it) are simply infuriating, as their patterns make them nearly impossible to skirt or stun using even the best end-game weapons. However, a bit of patience and well-placed fleeing can mitigate this issue.\n\n- There are so...many...guns: This game involves an  upgrade system common to the Metroid series, in which new items unlock new areas by adding some new form of movement that allows the player to access new parts of the map that they passed earlier in past areas. Included amongst these upgrades are a plethora of different weapon types that can be equipped at any time once they are found. However, there are ~30 different weapons, which means that any normal player finds 4 that they like and never use any of the others. This could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the game, adding a large selection to the player, but I prefer a smaller selection of weapons that are individually more useful. This makes the weapon selection much more akin to the tool selection from any LoZ game.\n\n- No instruction or direction whatsoever: Again, this could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the game, forcing the player to search for their objective rather than being pointed in a particular direction and being told to fetch. However, I have found that a small amount of instruction (what you should be doing and a general idea of where to do it) is preferable to no instruction at all, simply because it removes the 1 1/2 hours devoted to backtracking to find that one door that you can open now. In an attempt to help prospective players without directly spoiling anything, I would recommend that players assume that the tools they are given are capable of doing more than what they say, and that no two tools perform exactly the same task (IE some tools may be useful for doing things other than what their explicit instruction text says in-game).\n\nThese are my main concerns with the game, but otherwise I found it extremely enjoyable and unique. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys old 8-bit metroid-vania games and unique science-fiction.","March 16","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That means you'll be slowly amassing an aresenal of power-ups and weapons to beef up your player character, and using lateral thinking and exploration to unlock and discover new parts of it's mysterious and seemingly massive map. In Axiom Verge, by the end of the game, you'll likely have a massive weapon wheel, all with their own little quirks and benefits. You'll think about areas in a totally different way by the end of the game, as your movement options will increase exponentially. You'll chip away at the Map screen until all those squares are filled in. It's a classic, satisfying formula, and it works here. The level design matches the mechanics quite well, and the exploration feels very natural.\n\nI adore Metroid. I remember I went on a total binge of purchasing Metroid-vanias when it became moderately clear to me that Nintendo is currently kind of neglecting the franchise. ANYWAY. Axiom Verge is a love song to Super Metroid. It's the Interstellar to 2001, in a way. It's a hard game to live up to; most consider Super Metroid to be a masterpiece. And you can tell it's likely that Thomas Happ, the creator of Axiom Verge, probably does too.\n\nAnd therein lies one of the issues with the game. While there are many Metroid-vanias coming out nowadays which innovate the genre, Axiom Verge itterates. It continues. Looking back, I can remember very little memorable or particularly excellent. Nothing truly bad, but nothing that had me enraptured. I thought the "Rusalka" were really cool, a few cool little puzzles and gadgets, and the music can shine frequently, those stick out, I'll admit. But I also remember the visuals not being my cup of tea (this is ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE, however). I remember boss battles which were so poorly designed they seemed like jokes. I remember a plot so convoluted and engrossed in itself it just came across pretentious. But most importantly, I remember a moment in the game where a necessary item was hidden in a giant mass of breakable blocks, inside a soulless random tile. At that point, I thought to myself, "Something about this game isn't working."\n\nHey. Axiom Verge is by NO means a bad game. It's actually pretty good. Mechanically, the game is solid, with a few neat inventions here and there. If you're looking for a fix of Metroid like I was, this is a fine way to go. However, I would never introduce someone to the genre this way, and I find myself having trouble remembering anything I found truly notable or excellent about the game. Which I suppose isn't a bad thing. But it's not a good thing, either. So, I guess Axiom Verge is a thing, that isn't necessarily bad, but isn't necessarily good either. Axiom Verge is a game. It's definitely a game.","November 26, 2015","false","14.6"," 44 of 88 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","44","88","2","0"

Clearly inspired by Metroid (particularly Metroid 1 and Super Metroid) with a creepy very alien feeling world to explore. Lots of new weapons and abilities to find, a lot of hidden pickups, and a lot of weird looking enemies.\nManages to perfectly hit that feeling of 'Oh man, now I can go do THAT thing that I couldn't before!' whenever you find a new item.\nDecent running time, I clocked in 12 hours to finish it on my first playthrough (without 100% completion). Will keep you occupied, but also is clearly designed to make speedrunning/sequence breaking possible.\nThe ability you get fairly early on that allows you to digitally 'corrupt' enemies and parts of the environments to have different effects is really great and something I havn't seen before.\n\nIf I were to give criticism it would be that the boss fights, while visually impressive, are mostly pushovers. Also, there are a LOT of weapons, but several of them are not really worth using outside of very specific situations, and others aren't worth using at all.\n\nOh also, the soundtrack is fantastic.\n\nWould thoroughly recommend it.","May 30, 2015","true","12.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To be perfectly clear, I'm thumbing up the game BARELY because the price is out of control. I got it on sale for $14 and that's a lot closer to what it's worth.\n\nThis is a metroidvania (clearly) and is more similar to the original metroid in aesthetic and exploration than most recent entries. Unfortunately some of the upgrades are very nice but others fall very flat. Specifically, the primary weapon is a bit ridiculous. There are serveral types of "beam" that you can pick up, but you can only have two equipped at once and toggle between them without going to the menu. Further, they're all really very boring weapons. I found myself relying mainly on the first gun until I got the other one that shoots straight for long distances, then my alt weapon was the one that could penetrate walls a little. Not very exciting. Another annoying design quirk is the "lock" button. In Metroid games you can lock your firing angle in various ways depending on which entry in the series you're playing, but in Axiom Verge you hold a button to lock your position instead, so the d-pad controls firing angle instead of movement. Look, the Metroid systems aren't perfect, but they allow for highly mobile combat and they feel natural. The position lock in this game is immersion breaking, even after having been used to it for a couple hours.\n\nSome of the other items are quite nice though. Instead of a morph ball you get a remote drone that you can fire and then control. It can go just about anywhere so long as it's not blocked by high jumps or otherwise un-navigable terrain. You can even leave the area you left your body in and continue exploring. When the drone dies or self-destructs you return to your body. That's pretty neat, really.\n\nThe other main items are a disruptor and a laser drill. The laser drill is kind of a more convenient version of Metroid's bomb weapon - mainly intended to break holes in certain walls. The disruptor works to corrupt the reality of certain blocks or enemies and can make some interesting things happen when used in the right place. For example, there's one enemy that looks like a big coral and shoots out annoying projectiles that fly around in random directions. If you get the leve 2 disruptor you can corrupt it and it shoots out health instead.\n\nThe length of the game isn't too bad. I've been playing for a few hours and I'm at less than 20%. I'm smart enough to not use a guide/FAQ until after I've beat the game though, so YMMV if you spoil yourself.\n\nAnyway, it's certainly not worth $20. At this point I'd say that the $14 I paid for it is about right for a metroidvania fan.","November 11, 2015","true","15.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are amazing, the music is great (along with the near death sound integration), the gameplay is good for what it is, and the story is surprisingly unique despite me thinking I knew exactly how it was going to play out. However, throughout playing I just felt this sense of generic-ness, this feeling I had done it all before. Yes, obviously this is a metroid spin off, but even above that, I just felt like there was nothing new for me to discover. Sure there are secret weapons, hidden worlds, life and damage powerups for you to find in every nook and cranny- but I am talking about the life behind the game's eyes, it just felt like there was no originality or drive there for me to continue playing. Furthermore, I found the enemy design annoying at best, most of the weapons useless but novel (I think I only used 3 for more than 5 seconds despite collecting 8 or 9), the backtracking tedious, and the price too high for what I got. In short, I had fun while playing but left disappointed and just overall very static on how I felt while playing the game.\n\nMaybe I am looking for the wrong game out of this? To compare with another metroid clone released recently, I loved Environmental Station Alpha. But ESA is even more of a carbon copy clone of metroid, with much less interesting weapon and powerup progression. But the secrets were more engaging, the bosses harder, and overall it just felt like more of an immersive experience. Axiom Verge is constructed ten times better than ESA in almost every department however it just feels lifeless in comparison to me. I was not nearly as hooked or addicted, although I did beat the game in 2 sittings (but mostly because the game was pretty short and I'm a binge gamer).\n\nI'm sure if you're looking for a new metroid game and have been waiting for a good spiritual successor for a long time, you will be satisfied and enjoy Axiom Verge. I'm also sure that if you just love any metroid/vania that is out there as long as it has a decent production value, you'll also enjoy Axiom Verge. I guess I just went into it expecting to be blown away, and left with a mostly forgettable experience besides the art and music. Based on personal experience alone, I do not recommend this game at it's asking price.\n\nEDIT: Reading other's reviews, I immediately realized what I was trying to say but couldn't put it into words: The exploration was just not fun. I felt like I was going through the motions despite the game going "Look, you can explore all this stuff over here!" and never felt "smart" or "engaged" whenever I found a secret. The one secret world I found was drilling randomly into a wall, and the multiple pickups I found were just mainly backtracking to previous areas that had a non-hidden powerup behind a progress locked (literal key or powerup you get later in the game) gate to get a 1/6 heart piece that requires you to get 5 other pieces to get your health up a pip. The weapons you get are worthless usually as previously stated, so other than cool animations or some ridiculously niche usage, there is really no point to explore past some lore you might be interested in.","January 2","false","8.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/332200/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","This is one of those cases where I wish steam had a "meh" option because for a game like this, it's sorely needed. Okay. I don't usually do this but I'm just going to break down everything separately.\n\nFirst off: I will quite frequently bring up this game's contemporary Environmental Station Alpha multiple times, since a comparison to this game is how I found ESA originally, and then what brought me back to this game was a comparison of this game to ESA, and since the games came out in the same month both heavily aping Metroid, the comparisons are almost begging to happen.\n\nStory: It's pretty good, actually. I wouldn't say it's a huge factor in the game, but the story and the collectible lore are pretty intriguing, leaving just enough ambiguous to keep you guessing. I wouldn't say the story is the main draw of the game, but I definitely can't hold it against the game.\n\nGraphics: Hmm. This is tricky to rate. On one hand, the pixel art is gorgeous to look at. On the other hand... it's a bit of a sensory overload sometimes, since there are so many bright colors all the time. It doesn't help that the only really noticeable graphically difference in most areas is the color. The game doesn't have very well defined "enivironments" like ESA, and though this technically has better "art" than that game, I dunno, I feel ESA just has a better aesthetic than this game. I wouldn't say the graphics are bad by any means but it's amazing how bland I find them for how well they're done.\n\nMusic: It's alright at first, it's very game-y music, but by the end of the game I was utterly sick of it. I dunno, it's way too blaring and in-your-face most of the time. Metroid had more atmospheric music, ESA has more atmospheric music, it added to the mood instead of overpowering it. I wouldn't say it's bad music, you'll probably enjoy it your first time through the game, but not for much longer.\n\nAnd now... here's where things are really gonna fall apart.\nGameplay: Uuugh. I should love this so much more than I do. But. Okay, here's the key problem: This game is stubbornly rooted in Super Metroid, in almost every aspect. A lot of its mechanics are quite similar, for one, just "modernized", and for what it's worth, a lot of the "modernized" mechanics are good. The grappling hook is an utter travesty though, worse than any in Metroid and an absolute trainwreck compared to the fantastic grappling of ESA. It's just... thank god this thing barely sees any use because it's utter trash.\n\nBut that aside... the game design itself apes Super Metroid far too heavily, especially when it comes to collectibles. I did not enjoy hunting for secrets in Super Metroid and never bothered to get 100%, but I wanted to here because achievements etc. I did not get past like 75% without consulting a guide because there are just so many obnoxiously hidden secrets in the game... Some of the passwords in particular are total "how would you ever figure that out on your own" moments, and. Okay, maybe this just annoys me in particular, but sometimes... secret locations are shown to you on the map via the wall of the room not being finished. But other secrets aren't. There's no consistency for stuff otherwise hidden in the exact same way, it's just really strange. You have a fair share of pure fake walls that you can't find until you're touching them, and there's a ton of things you need to drill, a few strange glitched enemies you need to take advantage of, and absolute no item-finding tool to assist you, unlike Super Metroid. There is, amazingly, both indication of 100% map completion and 100% item completion for each specific area, but you'd never know until it showed up for you the first time, and even then you probably wouldn't know what it means.\n\nI will be the first to admit that, yes, ESA did have a lot of the same stuff to it. But here's the thing. The way that game's map is designed turned an annoyance into sheer brilliance, because the map was 100% tightly packed. You could figure out where secret rooms are 9 times out of 10, because the entire map is solid as a rock. There was also a hidden map item that mapped out most of the main secret areas, too. And even with the secrets on the outside of the station, you did have a fairly limited scope of things to search. Stuff was hidden, but it made sense. In Axiom Verge, it just doesn't make sense. Add to that the fact that there's no "secrets" necessary to just complete the game, no fake walls, no maps lying to you, and you'd never know there were supposed to be secrets like that until you accidentally stumbled upon one, or noticed how low your item % was at the end of the game.\n\nI've rambled on about this one element enough but this is legitimately the biggest deal I could ever have with a metroidvania:\nExploring isn't fun.\nAny metroidvania that fails this is fundamentally doing something wrong, no exceptions.\nI loved exploring in games like ESA, Guacamelee, La-Mulana, Knytt Underground, heck, even games like Dust and Ori where exploration is stupidly easy. Here though, it just ain't fun.\n\nOnto the rest. Sigh.\nThe platforming is generally alright. I actually dig most of the movement mechanics in this game. The coats constantly upgrade your ability to move through walls, and by the third one you have this cool dash attack that speeds up movement considerably, and it's just really fun to use. The drone is far, far superior to the Metroid morph ball, being much more flexible and once you have the drone swap allowing for a lot of cool movement options. I'm legitimately excited to watch the run of this game at AGDQ as soon as I finish watching this review, because while movement in this game is a bit stiff at first, as it tends to be in most metroidvanias, it gets really fun later on. There's no real tough platforming challenges in the game, though, a few instances of grappling hook shenanigans but they're rare, and everything else isn't any harder than completing the first world of Super Meat Boy. Heck, probably even easier than that.\n\nI have mixed feelings on the combat, though. For one, there are too freaking many weapons, and so few of them saw much use. Especially once you get one of the god-tier weapons that basically invalidates all the other weapons before it. The lightning gun feels like cheating, almost. Basic enemies start out pretty manageable, but by the end of the game they are waaaayyy too strong and waaayyy too durable, and possibly even waaayyy too prevalent. I guess, the game wouldn't have any challenge at all with the higher-tier weapons unless the enemies are this way, but it reeks of fake difficulty. The bosses fare a little better, though they're also fairly unmemorable. There aren't very many of them, they're all very standard in design, no clever tricks, just shooting and dodging stuff. Snore. The final boss is atrocious, by the way, being basically an RNG boss unless you're a god at dodging tons of projectiles and three huge hitboxes while also trying to hit one specific section of the ceiling. Seriously, who the hell thought that was a decent idea for a boss. It doesn't even feel rewarding to win, it just feels like "Oh, I got lucky with the health drops this time so I won. Okay." And it's just really anticlimactic. Though honestly the entire game feels really anticlimactic. The story itself is fine but never seems to go anywhere. I didn't realize I was approaching the end until the game was like "Oh hey by the way you're approaching the end". Ehh. Some of the guns are fun to use though. For a primarily combat-driven game though I really feel like this could've been better. Granted, I've never really liked combat in Metroid games either, and the bosses in Metroid games are even worse than the ones here in my humble opinion, but whatever.\n\n[Character limit hit, continuing in comments.]","January 18","false","12.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","5"

I would not, read on to learn why.\n\nKind of saddens me to not reccomend this game to be honest, it's very well crafted but there's only so much bull ♥♥♥♥ a man can take.  Regular enemies that take way too much damage, frustrating bosses, a dash mechanic that would be awesome if it had a dedicated button rather than having to tap away on the d-pad, weapons that don't really add a whole lot to the game.  I love the Metroid series which this pays homage to in many regards but honestly I feel this game pales in comparison.\n\nIt's like the developer played Super Metroid and though it wasn't diffuicult enough.  This game is more like Metroid than super Metroid, it's progressive in terms of scope and variety of pick ups, but a complete step backwards in terms of approachability.  Filling your game with enemies with too much health and unavoidable attacks just saps all the fun out of it and the bosses later on are just awful.  I would even argue that the exploratory nature of the game is hamstrung at a certain point I wanted to go back to explore old areas and find items so I could get more health to help ease the pain of a boss fight, but I was trapped in one area until I beat said boss and collected a certain item.\n\nThe visual design is excellent but the music is so-so it loops quickly and repeats often so even the tracks I enjoyed I got sick of fairly quickly.  All things considered it's not a terrible game, but I can't reccomend it to my friends, it's frustrating, time consuming and can often seem unrewarding.  Die hard fans of the genre will probably still enjoy this game however.","November 13, 2015","false","16.5"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","17","38","0","4"

I just kept thinking "The original Metroid did this already".\n\nThe visuals of this game are quite unattractive and lead me to believe that the developer doesn't really understand pixel art and what makes it appealing.

No, they feel like elaborate one off keys.\n\nThe games exploration amounts to spraying every block in the game with each tool you have to see if it opens a secret area.

Just random.\n\nAudio didn't blow my hair back either and some of the sound effects are just plain bad.\n\nIn closing, If you're like me and don't have much time for gaming, this game doesn't offer much in the way of new or interesting game play. I'd pass on this one in hopes of finding something that's more orignal. If you want nastalgia just play the original Metroid games again.\n\nIf you have all the time in the world to play games I still recommend you pass. If you want to play a good Metroid game I highly recommend just playing through the  actual Metroid series all of which outshine this pale immitation.

More than that and the controls would agitate me enough to just quit and walk away for a while.\n\nThe 2 biggest issues effectively pair together. The right thumbstick for gamepads is horridly used as a weapon select wheel, with the L/R thumbstick clicks cycling between preset weapons. A problem with this is it becomes far too easy to end up swapping weapons unintentionally in combat because of inevitable clicks while moving.\n\nAll of this could be fixed with a little more condensing on controls. Remove the drone from having a discrete button press and treat it as a quick-select weapon. Make the selection wheel a Press+Hold button action to activate thumb-stick selection on Y, the quick-select tap Y, and the drone a preset 4th weapon in the quick select.\n\nAnother issue is a frustrating dash that is unlocked and controlled by double-tap direction movements. It feels uncomfortable to use in any situation and completely breaks momentum on the character while exploring. It would be much better served if it had a dedicated button to control use. A good candiate to replace is the super-bomb, which somehow gets a dedicated trigger while having ~10 locations to ever really need to use it, compared to the heavy use of the dash when unlocked.\n\nI wish the controls were better so I could enjoy the great story, cool weapon selections, nice environments, and tons of secret items. As is, I'd have no incentive to hunt down all the secrets or ever try for the more difficult achievements because of how painful the controls can be to tolerate.\n\n7/10 from an objective standpoint, but 4/10 from a personal view because of how outright bad the control feel compared to other recent and classic metroidvania games.","July 24, 2015","false","11.3"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","3"

It looks and sounds terrible to begin with, I personally find the audio even worse than the graphics. The music is very unpleasant to listen to and the sound effects are way too obnoxious, especially enemy hits. It's ridiculously loud too. But even if you perservere through the graphics and sound, the game experience is not a pleasant one. I don't like the stage design, the enemies, or the weapons/powerups. There is little creativity in the maps and moving through it feels more like a chore than actual exploration. Most enemies are simply annoying, most of them move too fast and very hard to dodge, including their attacks. The drill upgrade is okay, but the combination of a drill and the address disruptor is a very weak design choice, as you'll end up drilling or disrupting everything in sight. That is not what I call good gameplay. Last but not least are a lot of weapons that are hard to use or sometimes even useless. Pushing the left analog stick, which happens in the heat of a fight, makes you switch between weapons where you usually don't want to do that.\n\nI wouldn't even call Axiom Verge mediocre, it simply isn't fun. The longer you play, the more obvious it becomes how much thought went into the Metroid and Castlevania games, because Axiom Verge tries very hard to benefit from their innovations but does not get close.","February 8","false","1.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Trolling\n\nI'm very near the end of the game and now, suddenly, the game is not about skill or observation anymore. It's about placing enemies in spots that will compromise and kill you without notice. Super-turbocharged ghouls exploding out of the floor in places that aren't marked. Divebombing nats that attack you from off screen and take out 1/4 of your health per hit. The games no longer a challenge or fun. Now I'm being trolled by the developer and I don't like it.

However, it is impossible to recommend this game due to its price and its controls.\n\nLets talk about the price:\nIn the past I have been forgiving with high prices in my reviews and I was willing to accept a 15 dollar price tag on retro styled indie games starting with shovel knight, however taking the price to 20 dollars was going too far. This is not a 20 dollar metroidvania, a 20 dollar metroidvania is a game like "ori and the blind forest", a game where effort went into all aspects of its development including graphics. My friends would probably think I had lost my mind if I recommended them a 20 dollar game with such primitive graphics and so I won't. I could recommend it if the base price drops to 15 dollars, or if a hqx or similar filter system is implemented to improve the graphics, but otherwise there are simply much better choices out there. In fact you can buy 6 slightly inferior but very similar games to this for a total price equal to the price of this game and I actually did this with the guy who bought me this game just to prove my point.\n\nNow lets talk about the controls:\nThere is no reason for a retro metroidvania to require more than 8 buttons + d pad for everything. The fact that it requires much more is a big weakness of the game. The dev should have just copied the super metroid control scheme.\n\nI recommend just buying ori and the blind forest instead, that gets more generous sales as well. Other games to consider are super panda adventures, dust: an elysian tale, knytt underground, cave story, and environmental station.","December 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","5"

However, the list of cons far outweighs the list of pros, unfortunately.\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics.  The grapics are about as colorful and immersive as that sprite style can be.\n\nCons:\nDifficulty: The game is unnecessarily hard.  I know in today's gaming climate, because of Dark Souls so many developers now think difficulty = quality.  This is only true if the difficulty is fair.  Here, all of the enemies have way too much health, you have very little health, and the health pickups are few and far between.\nWeapons:  The game gives you like 6 different weapons in the first hour.  The only problem is the first one is really the only useful one.  I never thought I'd get to a point in a video game where I dreaded getting a new weapon.\nSound:  The effects are incredibly loud and jarring.  Even health pickups have this awful alarm sounding noise.  The music is actually very good but I personally don't think it fits the game too well.  I'd listen to it on it's own, but it gets way to repetitve especially when you find yourself wandering around endlessly looking for the next area to go to which brings me to...\nLevel design:  It's bad.  Chances are you'll end up finding all the secret areas and places you aren't supposed to go yet before you find the next place you're actually supposed to go.  That's another thing - I never thought I'd get mad at finding a secret area.  It kind of surprises me that the level design is so bad since it's fairly obvious that the developers eat breathed and sleeped Metroid while making this.\n\nI hate giving bad reviews, I really do.

It reminded me of the games from the time-period when I got into this hobby. It's got a great soundtrack, very Metroid-like graphics and encourages exploration, like this genre of game should. At first, it seemed like the sort of game that I was going to enjoy.\n\nUnfortunately, around halfway through the game, it takes a turn for the worse and the whimsical exploration from the early game is replaced with spamming every metroidvania ability on every surface to make sure that you aren't missing a deviously hidden main path.\n(If you're going to play it: Use the disruptor on the slightly pinker goo than everything else that 2 fishlobsters jump out of)\n\nAnother problem is the controls (I played using gamepad) become overburdened with half-baked exploration mechanics that never quite feel good enough to pull off what the game is trying to get you to do, instead just putting you in a nightmarish loop of repeating the difficult parts over and over until you get it right by virtue of chance... and then you get killed in the very next room and have to do it all again.\n\nFor now, I've decided to put the game down, at what I believe is the final boss, because it is more frustrating than fun.

The textures are very rough and sterile, they have no flavour, no distinct, striking pattern. It's simply a cheap and loveless surrounding - all the time. You are not immersed in the environment, you don't feel like you wanna be a part of it. The music sadly supports this strongly, cheap 8-bit-like noises instead of soundtracks. I simply never felt welcome or intrigued by new environments, speaking of which:\nThey appear way too often. The map, which is really small over all, is neatly divided into sectors, but within those you have like 5 different environments as well. Sometimes it feels like one environment is 3 screens wide. It changes too fast for you to develope an emotional connection.\n\nThe bossfights are cheap as ♥♥♥♥, and there is no end boss fight. wtf?\nThere are like 12 beams, why? You literally play with one long range and one short range, period. You cannot combine them or anything, they are simply useless.\nSafe rooms are 2 tall, not that I care, but WHY? It is utterly random.\nTools. You don't need them or they get replaced. The drill is annoying as ♥♥♥♥ but for the most part your only tool to detect secrets.\nThe story is the nail in the coffin. It started out really good and I felt compelled to uncover the truth, well, the game ends before you even know what's going on. No kidding. You struggle the entire time with little bits, playing puzzling in your head until the end, and then there is no real surprise or anything. The concept is amazing, but it played out SO badly..\n\nStill, there ARE some good things about this game, some gimmicks are innovative and fun to play with. The story is a let down in the end, but keeps you driven most of the time.\nAll in all, no real recommendation for people who would like to see super metroid reborn. It's pathetic, really, that people in 2015 are unable to come close to a game that is like 20years old.\n\nGet it for 3 bucks or so","December 13, 2015","false","11.6"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

I started following it before it's release on PS4 and then waited so so patiently for the PC release. Maybe I hyped it up far too much in my head or maybe it was because I had just finished being amazed by ESA, but when I finally got my hands on Axiom Verge I couldn't help but feel disappointed.\n\nPositive\n\nThe tools and weapons are inventive and used cleverly to hide secrets and alternate routes through the map. The artwork is by far the best thing about this game hands down. I'm a sucker for 16-bit but the bosses, environments and animations were some of the best I've seen in a 16-bit game ever. The story wasn't spectacular and was reliant on you finding and decrypting certain secret notes but it was definitely satisfying.\n\nNegative\n\nThe early game feels super tedious as backtracking and finding your way around are excruciatingly long without some of the skills you'll acquire later in the game. It seems as if this was done on purpose to increase the longevity of the game but is a slap to the face as soon as you realize what's going on.\n\nWhile hunting for secrets and loot may be one of the most exciting parts of a metroidvania, it started feeling lackluster in AV. A lot of the weapons you came across almost felt like immediate downgrades and were more 'tools' than weapons which allowed you to hit a previously inaccessible switch but I would seldom find myself using them against enemies.\n\nA lot of the bosses are incredibly easy to cheese. In fact, some of them are just completely ignorable. Seeing such nice artwork for these bosses made them look menacing and tough and I would have preferred that over a cakewalk.\n\nThe music is by far the worst part. I would suggest hiring someone else to do the music if it is not your forte, or to never hire whoever did this music again. While a few of the tracks are certainly reminiscent of Super Metroid, some are downright painful and unbearable (I actually had to mute the program through windows until I found a save point and was able to turn the music volume down in the main menu, because no, you can't adjust audio settings IN-GAME which is basically a cardinal sin in any game) It's bad. That's it.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile overall a satisfying game and definitely worth a try if you are a big metroidvania fan, I simply cannot endorse this to the average gamer.","May 25, 2015","false","19.2"," 10 of 34 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","10","34","0","0"

Controls are unresponsive and awkward and there's no dual-stick option, which is ridiculously anachronistic for any side-scrolling shooter released in 2015.\n\nOnly two bosses in and I'm also thoroughly unimpressed with the boss design. The first boss is just a generic bullet-hell spammer, while the second boss might as well be from a rhythm game. Both follow the formula of getting gradually faster as you tediously chip away at their health 0.5% at a time. The second boss also appeared to be glitched, as ducking under the high bullets only worked about half the time. This meant jumping over the high bullets, which the timing doesn't seem to realistically allow once the boss is at its fastest.\n\nCoupled with the damage knockback and maybe only 200ms of immunity after taking damage, there's no recovering after you inevitably get hit. Outside of that boss battle, the knockback also has a tendency to send you through doors and, upon reentering the room you were just kicked out of, the enemy who knocked you back is often sitting on the door and instantly depletes your remaining health.\n\nArt is fantastic, soundtrack is pretty decent (although the bass mix is ridiculous, turn down your sub before playing unless you enjoy head-throbbing migraines), and the concept is solid. I just wish its dev had put as much thought in to the game's controls and boss design as he did towards original weapons and powerups.

Disabling the Steam in-game overlay and setting launcher option -force-opengl helped. This would be somewhat acceptable in early access, but having to debug a fully released game for 20$ is just embarrassing. The log4net config is broken, too, so the log files are empty and don't give any hint.\nI will compare to Super Metroid, because Axiom Verge is such a blatant clone of it.\nThe game itself:\n+ good mechanics\n+ clever weapons and tools\n+ soundtrack, but not coming close to Metroid\nCons:\n- The most important part of Super Metroid: Level design. Levels are really, really boring in Axiom Verge and not atmospheric, with few exceptions. Most of the time, tile colors change.\n- Plot is clever, but the storytelling is horrible\n- Exploration feels ... unrewarding (see level design), except for frequent items.\nDeveloper should have taken some steps back and consider what aspects made Super Metroid a timeless classic. The actual effort in Axiom Verge is the game engine - it's a good Super Metroid engine.\nWould buy for 5$ on sale, not worth 20$ at all.","May 14, 2015","false","4.2"," 71 of 207 people (34%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","34","71","207","10","6"

I played and loved all of the Metroid games, this is not that, not even close.\nDon't believe the hype and wait for a sale. I feel this game is definitely not worth $20, and I'd not find any fun in it even if it were free. There are better free games out there.\nThe game has good art and style, and the way that the character abilities is atypical for the genre, but that doesn't make them good.

Hands down some of the best entertainment I've played in a while. It was exactly what I was looking for. I'd give it a 8.5/10.

I just looked what I needed and moved on. That's a design flaw. This was all around getting the flame gun which I discovered 100% and was unable to get to it until I figured out this one mechanic.\n\nAll in all I got 22hrs out of the game for $15.00 and I enjoyed pretty much every level. I loved the new upgrades and how they used inventive ways of technology (within the game) to give you progression. The music is excellent.\n\nThe game is worth the full price but it's an absolute steal if it's under $15. Do it.\nYou won't regret it.

That it comes even close to the quality of its forebear, Super Metroid, is a genuinely huge accomplishment. It's been a long time since I felt this fascinated and this compelled to complete a game (Pixel's "Cave Story" comes to mind as well, speaking of similar genres), to see as much as I could, to come back as often as I could, never wanting to stop playing.  The soundtrack is gorgeous and memorable, the controls are -- with one or two quirks kept in mind -- as tight as can be, the items are truly clever and innovative, and even though the game is inspired by Nintendo's brilliant game-changer, it never feels like it's flat-out aping the game Tom Happ so clearly adores.  "Axiom Verge" is its own game, through and through.  And then there's all the hidden items and map sections and secrets galore.  You'll be so proud of yourself when you find some of these cartographic riddles.\n\nIf you have ever enjoyed a "Metroidvania"-style game, support this fella and buy this game.  $20 is a small price to pay for a game that would've been $50+ in 1994.  Oh, and the story?  Well, it's a lot deeper than you might be prepared for.  This has immediately gone into my All Time Best list.

Just kept drawing me back in. The only drawbacks I'd highlight are repeated backtracking, sometimes for hours, though this is part of the charm of the metroidvania; and that one point in the game where everyone in the universe has gotten stuck, which is unsporting and counterintuitive but simple to solve once you know how. I'd conjecture you'd need to be a fan of at least some action-exploration 8 and/or 16 bit games to enjoy it, and you need patience, memory, a small amount of creativity and a smattering of the twitch-gamer about you, though not in crisis situations. Boss fights are fair and balanced. Amazing work for a single developer. Best indie title I've purchased in an age, and I buy a good few.

Most of the time, I generally cycled between 2-3 weapons. Some of the weapons also felt so similar to others, I really didn't bother using them most of the time. Reducing the number of weapons, and increasing their unique interactions with the environment would have added a lot of flexibility in the game (see metroid prime games, fewer weapons, but I felt more attached to the weapons)\n- Some of the enemies and areas feel like there's a cheap shot.

The only bosses I had a hard time with were Uruku (for some reason, I couldn't get it through my head to shoot the mouth after clearing the other parts) and Ukhu. Giving the bosses more varied attack patters and behaviors would have made them much more engaging for the whole fight, rather than the first half where the patterns were memorized.\n\nSummary\nDon't take the cons as a "don't play." These are just things I felt the game could have done a little better. Overall, I thought  this was a fantastic game beginning to end, and I am excited for axiom verge. The gameplay, music, and art style were all so reminiscent of the old days exploring dungeons in Metroid. Not only does it capture the styles of the old game, but it builds upon it with even more interesting zones. The story is very well paced, leaving me always looking forward to getting to the next area and seeing how things progressed.\n\nOverall\nVery solid indie title that was incredibly fun to play","June 17, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't even call this a metroidvania; this game is very unabashedly a Metroid. You know this game already. You probably already LOVE this game... but you have no idea how it ends. Even after deciphering all the codes, it's hard to even tell where it began, and with whom. Was it Queen Elizabeth I? Earlier? Later? You might even begin to question which version of yourself you are, or discover you can't account for a few months of time. Finally, as you start to unravel the fabric of reality, you'll start to see meaning in the scanlines themselves, and begin to believe that you aren't even IN the map.\n\nI would recommend this enchanting combination of retro glitchiness and cthulian insanity easily, without reservation.

This game most certainly nods to the Metroid style of play. You will navigate through the world, gathering power ups and new weapons. Defeat bosses to gain the next big piece of tech that you need to progress to the next few levels (as well as access recently unreachable areas that you have already passed by).\n\nOne of my favourite parts has to be the disrupter. This allows you to alter reality within the game and effectivley "glitch" your enemies into less threatening ones (except bosses.. at least, not in my experience!). There will be sections of the environment itself which you can remove/create with the help of this device. It is a great addition to a gaming style/gaming style whose era is full of unintended glitches, and has more or less become a hobby of most to exploit. Which brings me onto the Speedrun option.\n\nI haven't played the Speedrun yet, but the intentional ability to "Glitch" within the game makes me very excited with this! There is even an achievement if you successfully complete the game in under 4 hours (quite a long way away from my 14 hours to complete - I was trying to be thorough and enjoy the beautifully tiled worlds and well crafted music).\n\nMy experience with this game is fantastic! I just need to find the last few items and areas of the map to be completely satisfied with my play. If you loved the original Metroid games (especially Super Metroid; being my favourite); you should definitely give this game a try!\n\nHands down 10/10 from me","May 21, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays like a sequel to Super Metroid from a universe where 3D games never happened, except that it manages to set up an almost completely distinct set of power-ups that work in subtly different ways from the standard Metroid loadout.  The game has the same great sense of exploration and discovery as the best games in the Metroid series, but is a bit more modern and forgiving in some ways (for example, you keep your power-ups and explored map tiles if you die).\n\nOne interesting divergence is that it provides a ton of optional weapons.  These mostly don't unlock new progress through the game, but many prove very useful in certain situations.  Clever weapon selection can completely change the difficulty of some of the boss fights, for example.  There are almost *too* many; in my time with the game I've barely touched at least three or four.\n\nThis game is one of my best recent buys, and easily one of the best PC "Metroidvania"-type games out there.

If you are into old school platformers and challenging combat scenarios, then you'll probably get a lot out of this game. Personally I really enjoyed the exploration aspects, but I found the controls and the combat too clunky. Normally I would be able to look past this, but I found the game frustratingly difficult, especially some of the boss battles, on the Normal difficulty. Unless you are really looking for a challenge, I would recommend going for an easier setting and then hopefully you might get a more enjoyable experience out of the exploration.\n\nOn the plus side, the art is great and nails the retro style of the Super Metroid era. The music and sound design is also pretty good and meshes well with the visuals.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game, but after beating the end, I was happy to be done with it and had no real drive to 100% the game.","June 8, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Okay. Well, that was a good game. I just beat it on normal and I am wondering if there is a game plus or an alternate ending. It holds true to the classic metroid feel with some additions that I really love. The awesome array of weapons is fun and offers a lot of solutions to "problems". The enemies vary greatly and have the kind of AI I would expect in a game like this. The glitch mechanics are a blast to play with and the exploration was rewarding. The music fit well and only bugged me in one area. The art direction was VERY nice. It fit well with the games feel, well crafted, really felt like a turbo graphix 16 game, but with some occasional warpy effects.\n\nA couple of things to watch out for, the sound has a weird glitch on my system where everything becomes louder when the music is not playing. That is annoying, but not a game breaker. Unfortunately the biggest hurdle in this game is controls.\nI had to remap my controls several times as I got new abilities that crowded up my controller. Some items become kinda worthless as well, but still demand a button. I wish I could disable items in my inventory. The best thing I did was learn to use the D-pad again, because THAT thing is ONLY for direction and does not double as a button. The "double-tap" on the analogue stick is janky as hell and you'll  be dodging all over the place when your just trying to move about normally or are aiming and running. Same with the bombs! I had to put bombs on R3 and quick select on L3, learn that D-pad, and it's all good.\n\nAll in all, solid game with some really nice surprises.\n\nLooking forward to the rest of the game, aka, resolution of the cliffhanger with sooooooo much unresolved.

It's not all that common nowadays to find a game that both intends for you to explore and rewards you for it. From weapon and and health upgrades that will make your journey easier to a variety of secrets and tidbits of lore that help you understand Trace's predicament as well as how the world you're exploring came to be. Guided along by its retro-styled aesthetic and its haunting score you'll find that it's easy to lose yourself in this game.\n\nThough the game can be tackled in speed run style (and even has a mode dedicated to it) I put almost six hours into it on my initial run (And almost ten hours total on my 100% completion follow up), so there's no lack of content for your buck. As a matter of fact the secret levels that you can discover and the treasures they hold change with each and every playthrough.\n\nSo, if you've got time to spare and feel the nostalgic yearning for an experience reminiscent of old-school action adventures give Axiom Verge a shot.

Just kept drawing me back in. The only drawbacks I'd highlight are repeated backtracking, sometimes for hours, though this is part of the charm of the metroidvania; and that one point in the game where everyone in the universe has gotten stuck, which is unsporting and counterintuitive but simple to solve once you know how. I'd conjecture you'd need to be a fan of at least some action-exploration 8 and/or 16 bit games to enjoy it, and you need patience, memory, a small amount of creativity and a smattering of the twitch-gamer about you, though not in crisis situations. Boss fights are fair and balanced. Amazing work for a single developer. Best indie title I've purchased in an age, and I buy a good few.

Most of the time, I generally cycled between 2-3 weapons. Some of the weapons also felt so similar to others, I really didn't bother using them most of the time. Reducing the number of weapons, and increasing their unique interactions with the environment would have added a lot of flexibility in the game (see metroid prime games, fewer weapons, but I felt more attached to the weapons)\n- Some of the enemies and areas feel like there's a cheap shot. By the end, I made a habbit of running my drone through each room before I walked through to keep from getting sneak attacked by the burrowed\n- Most of the bosses were too easy. The only bosses I had a hard time with were Uruku (for some reason, I couldn't get it through my head to shoot the mouth after clearing the other parts) and Ukhu. Giving the bosses more varied attack patters and behaviors would have made them much more engaging for the whole fight, rather than the first half where the patterns were memorized.\n\nSummary\nDon't take the cons as a "don't play." These are just things I felt the game could have done a little better. Overall, I thought  this was a fantastic game beginning to end, and I am excited for axiom verge. The gameplay, music, and art style were all so reminiscent of the old days exploring dungeons in Metroid. Not only does it capture the styles of the old game, but it builds upon it with even more interesting zones. The story is very well paced, leaving me always looking forward to getting to the next area and seeing how things progressed.\n\nOverall\nVery solid indie title that was incredibly fun to play","June 17, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tccristccrist/recommended/332200/","tccristccrist","Detective Late","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tccristccrist/","270 products in account","This game is a great Metroidvania with interesting game mechanics. It's a solid title even if you don't know it was made by one guy. There haven't really been many pure Metroid style games recently- most similar try to blend the Metroidvania genre with other gameplay types. That's well and good, but this goes closer to the roots, and, in my opinion, is stronger for it.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor issues.\n\nFirst off, sometimes your progress is completely halted because of a detail you couldn't realistically find out on your own without a guide, unless you either get lucky or experiment more than should be necessary. (1 specific room and 1 specific boss.)\n\nSecond, the aiming controls could use some work- although they're usually fine, sometimes they force you to move in a specific direction to shoot the way you want to. There is a button that's supposed to help with aiming, but it locks MOVEMENT rather than aiming, which I found strange, because being stationary is usually a bad idea. Simply changing the movement lock to aim lock would be very helpful in this regard.\n\nThird, the "glitches" don't ever really feel like you're actually messing with the game.\nHere are the things they do, based on my memory:\nMake enemies bigger/smaller\nMake enemies shoot slower\nMake enemies shoot with less spread\nTurn enemies into a different type of enemy\nMake enemies, or their attacks, destroy some specific walls\nMake enemies, or their attacks, create\nKill enemies prematurely\nMake enemies slower\nMake enemies stop moving\nMake things solid/disappear/turn into blocks you can destroy\nGo through walls\n\nThese are used to good effect for unique gameplay that revolves around finding out how to best use these changes, but the "glitches" never really feel like glitches, other than the aesthetics. Going through walls is the closest it ever gets. For someone who's actually glitch-hunted in games (notably Super Metroid) this isn't like HUNTING for glitches, because you're given a gun and told "Use this to make things work differently." It's more like solving a combat puzzle in Megaman, or switching between worlds in Guacamelee. The glitch aesthetic is really just that, an aesthetic. It typically works well, but I was a bit disappointed it wasn't a bit more like actually finding glitches for yourself. There are also secret worlds that appear at random, but these felt more like random secrets than glitches to me from my limited experience with one.\n\nFinally, an issue that was more of an annoyance than any of the other things on the list. The enemies all tend to be damage tanks. This is meant to be a catalyst for players that use strategy over simply running and gunning. However, what it tends to do is make fights drag even after you've found out the best strategy to use against an enemy.\n\n\nOne more thing: I think the game is actually TOO well-designed- the creator knew all the limits of the player at any given time, and prevented sequence breaking. I like sequence breaking, so this makes me sad.\n\n\nOverall the game is very enjoyable (I finished the game, which I only ever do when I think it's worth playing all the way through.) However, go into it with the knowledge that the game is more about combat puzzles than realistic glitches.","July 10, 2015","true","40.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Borrowing from past 8-bit and 16-bit conceptualizations is only half of the formula.  The graphic design inspirations borrow heavily from HR Giger, and the music has a wordly enough variation to allow the overall attitude of the game to be within the definitions of modern-day video games.\n\nThe only weakness that is obvious is the fact that there is not a Boss Rush mode or a Survival Mode.  However, there is a Speed Run component, and the game has a Passcode function allowing for costume variations, among other ideas and concepts.\n\nSeeing that this title has only been out for about 3 months, it may seem premature to claim that Axiom Verge will become a classic.  But, anyone who has a chance to experience its many beauties will discover retroactive reminiscences of a game worthy to be in any old school gamer's library.","July 10, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only downsides to the game are the endgame is a massive drop in quality, as the final boss dosent even take skill, just spamming and ducking.

What drew me in initially was the H.R. Giger style of the "cover art."  I adore dark alien imagery, and Axiom Verge is full of it.  The world the game takes place in just feels...wrong (in a good way); like a place that shouldn't ever exist in any part of the universe (a bit like the Far Realm in D&D).  This feeling is helped by the cyberpunk-style soundtrack constantly pulsing in the background as you explore the tendril-like labyrinthine environment.  I just have to say, the game nails atmosphere perfectly, and that's not even getting to gameplay and story.\n\nThe action feels tight here, and it's always satisfying to blast hostile aliens into pulpy goo.  There are also a ton of weapons to find and play with -- and believe me, there are *a lot* of them, each one with a different feel.  Some of them I'd say are objectively better than others, making the "lesser" weapons you find pretty much useless.  But that's a minor complaint.  There are also a ton of other optional items to find: everything from health powerups, damage powerups, range powerups , projectile size powerups and so-on.  That leads into one of coolest aspects of this game: just how much there is to explore.  I spent about 20 hours on my first playthrough and only managed to find like 70% of them total items in the game.  And believe me, I spent a long time exploring.  Although, to be fair, I'm pretty bad at metroidvania games.  I think the average time for a playthrough is 12-13 hours.  Still, for an indie game, that's pretty huge.  There are also some really fun mechanics introduced into the game, like being able to "glitch" enemies (which changes their appearance and how they behave).  It's always fun to figure out which enemies' "glitched" versions do what.  You also get the ability to teleport through walls with your badass sciency labcoat, which is just awesome in of itself.\n\nThe story is pretty darn great, too.  I won't spoil anything about it, but I was pretty impressed with how well-written it was.  My only issue with it was how it ended -- not necessarily what happened, but how it was executed.  The pacing sort of felt a little rushed in the final encounter, but that's a pretty small complaint and doesn't take away from the experience, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, this is easily one of the best games I've played in the last few years and deserves your attention.  The asking price is a little steep for your average indie game, but this game is *well* above average.  :)","August 23, 2015","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is obviously not the kind of game you play for a deep and thrilling story, but it's there nonetheless and it is not entirely trivial. The graphical exposition and music complement the story well, and specifically help in portraying how alien the game world is.\n\nGameplay and ControlsAs a platformer in the 'metroidvania' style the game is well made. Other than a few unique weapons that help you progress into new areas the game doesn't innovate much. It offers a large variety of weapons, although you will likely ignore most as only a handful are really useful. Due to this the feeling of reward is diminished when you find new equipment, because it will not impact your gameplay in most cases. The most important part of a platformer is its controls, and in that department Axiom Verge is flawless.\n\nConclusionPositive: It is a well done and well-themed metroidvania-styled game with excellent graphics complementing the theme well.\nNegative: It does not innovate upon the genre, and despite having a large variety of weapons to use, they don't feel that useful.","September 8, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the most part, I enjoyed the experience. The music is enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty nice for the 8-bit NES style they were going for. Gameplay wise the game is fairly solid with only a couple of hiccups here and there.\n\nThe story consists of a scientist named Trace being transported to a strange world after an accident at work. He is tasked by a mysterious living machine to revive her fellow living machines, and find a way to stop the evil scientist who has put the  planet into disarray. There's a bit of a M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist in there along the way. The story is interesting, but at times can seem a little all over the place. You can flesh it out more via locating notes around the world, that give you further information that the "cut scenes" you encounter don't fully inform you of.\n\nThere are a ton of different weapons you can encounter during the game, as well as a decent assortment of enemies. There are a few palette swaps here and there but they usually at least ACT differently. Not all of the guns are useful, but there are a small handful that are very effective. Flamethrower comes to mind.\n\nThe game, however, is not without faults. The first fault is that the game is very vauge at times as far as where you're supposed to go, or what you're supposed to be doing. There is at least one bit which requires you to use your hacking device to solidify some lava so you can stand on it and jump higher. Simple, right? The issue is that no other lava in the game (that I can recall anyway) has the same effect of getting solid, so you really have nothing prompting you to try it. Another section involves you having to find an item you actually need to progress further in the game, via drilling into a wall in a room completely full of drillable walls.\n\nSome items cannot be aquired without making use of an item that allows you to input a password. To find these passwords you have to translate a made up language (or, you know, just google it). The flamethrower is one of the items you need to do this for. One of them even forces you to translate the language by sight alone. It was an interesting concept, but comes off as more annoying than fun. Still, this is not THAT big of a negative as there are only a handful of instances that require you to do this.\n\nOverall, in spite of the issues the game is a fun, and challenging Metroidvania. It's a little bit closer to the Metroid side, than the CastleVania side, so be aware of that. The game is quite clearly a massive love letter to Super Metroid in particular so go in expecting Super Metroid, not something like Symphony of the Night, or Dawn of Sorrow.\n\nI'd personally recommend it if you're into the genre, just be prepared for a bit of a sequel bait if you get the true ending (you have to get most of the map, and items so that your percentages are displayed as green).","September 8, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But they lacked something savvy that the Sakamoto crew just seemed to really grasp that made the original Metroid, and its SNES follow-up so captivating.

This game leads much more to the Metroid side of that equation; in fact, one of the biggest criticisms I've seen of this game is that it feels like a Metroid clone.  To me, that's more a matter of personal taste - if you enjoy exploring alien worlds, finding powerups and secrets, but don't mind missing out on the Castlevania staples of leveling up and finding new equipment (with some exceptions), then you'll probably like this game.\n\nOn the aesthetic side, the game duplicates the retro NES style fairly well.  I don't think it sticks 100% to the NES' 4-color palette, but the illusion is there.  Something that bears mentioning is the glitch effects seen in game - as someone who owned and operated a NES for several years, I'm quite familiar with what happened if a cartridge was inserted crooked, or if the contacts were dirty.  Axiom Verge duplicates these with startling accuracy.  On the style side, this game isn't for the squeamish - if Metroid's environments were biomechanical, Axiom Verge is BIOmechanical.  Tentacles, fungal growths, pulsating organs, and some very Giger-esque imagery gives me the impression of walking around inside some huge creature, rather than an alien planet.  This is alleviated when you get to the surface areas, but I never liked the Monstro scenes in Pinnochio as a child, so this combined with the music (a pulsating, semi-atonal electronica selection) makes me feel uncomfortable.  I believe this is intentional, as someone suddenly ripped from their homeworld and plunged into a dying alien world would probably have a bit of culture shock.\n\nStorywise, the game does very well.  I'll not spoil anything, but it kept me guessing, and it's very hard to figure out who to trust as the game goes on.  It's delivered through in-engine cutscenes and dialogue boxes, without voice acting - this is probably due to a combination of budget concerns and adhering to the NES style, but I do hope for a larger budget for Axiom Verge 2 (or whatever the studio's next project is).\n\nOn the technical side, the game is superb.  The controls are very tight (more like the original Metroid or Mega Man than the slightly floaty Super Metroid) - my only two complaints are the double-tap teleport command (would be better if it was assigned to a button) and the weapon quick-swap (it takes a bit to figure out how to assign weapons to the quick swap, and on my controller one of the quick buttons is R3, with the right stick being the normal weapon swap, which occasionally leads to accidentally opening the weapon ring).  Still, use a controller with this game, and you shan't be disappointed.  Additionally, the game has a built-in speedrun mode.  Speedrunning is a staple of metroidvania games, though I've always been bad at it.  Speedrun mode removes all cutscenes and adds an on-screen timer that automatically splits at every boss kill, which is wonderful if you're into that.\n\nThe achievements show that the developer knows the metroidvania audience; aside from the standard achievements (beat the game, beat it on hard, beat it without dying, and beat every boss), they included achievements for both 100% and low% collection, 100% map completion, and finding some very well hidden secrets.\n\nOverall, if you played and enjoyed any modern Metroid game, you'll probably enjoy Axiom Verge.  If you like modern Castlevania games and aren't adverse to sci-fi, you'll probably also get a kick out of it.","September 11, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are dying for a metroid like game, this is probably it.\n\nThat said, it's my opinion that a lot of the weapons and the way you use them is pretty weak.  I'm not going to pretend to be an excellent player, but there are some guns that seem to serve little purpose in most fights.  I did, however, find myself switching guns quite a bit to clear trash mobs, and I did not see it as much of a plus.  In general, I would say there are some balance issues, but it isn't trying to be a modern easy to play game, so maybe it's fine the way it is.\n\nI havne't gotten too far in the game, but it was pretty obvious to me that there is no clear progression to the game.  Some games, even metroid, have good pacing, but in this one you can explore quite a bit more than you need to before having to backtrack.. I'm not sure that everyone will have the experience, but I did find myself fighting my way through the same areas multiple times, almost pointlessly.\n\nThere are a lot of good things about this game, like the soundtrack.  It's also a pretty good adaption to the retro castlevania/metroid games.  I would say if you haven't played the old school games that this is based on you should go back and find emulators for them.  Most of the emulators are free and work in your browser.\n\n","March 4","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is developed by one of the original metroid creators and the game, map and story shows that. The story is interesting fun to play but the game is difficult for new players to the game and new players to metroidvania games as well. The graphics of the game feel similar to super metroid or similar snes games. The controls for the game are tight and clean with a few expections with certain items like an item you get (spoiler alert) the grappling hook and the coats that you get. Those items are a bit werid to use and annoying at times but overall still fun. The items are spread out evenly through most of map with a only a few expections but that can be overlooked. My main complaint is that there is no clear direction that the game wants you to follow for items to progress the game. This can be annoying for new players but it does help with exploration. Overall the game is fun and if you metroidvania games or like 2D platforming then you will like the game.","March 8","true","45.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Granted, it doesn't even bother to hide it's super metroid influences but honestly with all the crap steam is trying to push as "metroidvania" when the games are anything but, I am willing to let a few things slide.\n\nSo short version: If you loved super metroid, you will find something to love about this game. It's that game but with a different skin.\n\nThere are a couple things that made me wince in terms of design choices, namely the mobility-based skills you pick up and a very hit or miss soundtrack, but overall the experience was more or less what I had hoped for in a game carrying a metroid-vania tag.\n\nIt's also generously  long, with a modest helping of replayability. Namely in the form of a speedrun mode, size of map, a hard mode, and a couple other specific challenges for the achievement hunting folks out there (don't die more than once)\n\nI definitely recommend this game in the hopes other developers will see how successful this game is as an example of what TO DO when you want to make a metroid-vania game.\n\nSeriously though, Kur has one of the worst BGM's I have ever heard.

You are almost completely unguided, which does have some problems in that the world is large and figuring out where to go can be frustrating. However, it also lets you be creative - you can often get places you aren't really meant to be at yet through the creative use of abilities.\n\nThe game's plot is not overly extensive or twisty, and ends in something of a cliffhanger, but there are notes and other things laying around for you to pick up which add a bit of depth to the world. At one point you get an item which allows you to quite literally hack reality, which really raises a lot of questions as to just what exactly is going on.\n\nThe controls take some getting used to but are responsive and work quite well for the type of game it is. There is a huge variety of weapons, and even if a few of them shine brighter than others all of them are useful in one situation or another, Getting hit is punishing, there aren't too many areas where it's truly difficult to do things, and most bosses are fairly easy once you have their patterns down.\n\nArt wise, the game has a very "organic" feel to it, and the music goes along well with it. Even the low health beep, which is infuriating in most games, is timed to go along with the music and fades in and out, so you notice it, but isn't irritating.\n\nI only have two real issues with this game. Backtracking can be quiet slow, even once you've unlocked the intermediate area that connects all others, and you will be doing quite a lot of backtracking. Beyond that, there are several hidden zones which are unique to each save file, but the only notification these are nearby is a slight visual change that's easy to miss. However, these hidden areas don't count towards your 100% completion or any achievements, but they are a fun throwback to the glitch zones of the original Metroid, and they can contain unique (and powerful) weapons.\n\nThe characters, such as they are, are typically interesting and the mish mash of English some of them do works very well to fit in with the game's alien feel. If you're looking for a retro exploration game, this is definitely right up your alley.","May 28, 2015","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, as we all know, Metroidvanias are a dime a dozen in the realm of indie games, and it's easy to see why: It's a genre that is very easy to make, but takes a lot of talent and effort to do really well. For every Cave Story and La-Mulana there's a deluge of mediocre to straight up awful Metroidvanias a few meters behind them. Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania style game in which there's a lot of Metroid and not a lot of Vania, which I do quite like, as the Metroid side of things allows the designer to go really crazy with the atmosphere and world building as opposed to "get the thing to increase your numbers."\n\nAs mentioned above, Axiom Verge feels a lot like Metroid, even down to the very first area of the game feeling a lot like Brinstar, complete with long vertical shaft with a bunch of enemies that run along the walls. It does start to branch off from there, as rather than breaking walls with things like power bombs or missiles, you are instead equipped with a drill. This drill can be used for combat purposes, but it's not too recommended as it does bugger all for damage. Another way in which this game branches away from Metroid is that you get a LOT of weapons throughout your playthrough. I ended up with ten different weapons by the end of the game, and while they're all pretty fun to play with, odds are you'll fall into one weapon and just use that for the rest of the game. This was a little disappointing, as I would've liked to see more environmental puzzles that made use of the characteristics of the weapons.\n\nPowerups in this game are pretty neat, and there are a fair few of them that are pretty cool, but there are a few that feel like completely arbitrary gating mechanisms, with the most egregious example being one of the later areas in which you have to mine through more blocks with your drill than the average Minecraft player, only to receive a key "powerup" that moves literally two blocks in the world and that's it. In fact, there were more than a few powerups that felt like completely arbitrary gates, something that I think could've been fixed with more of a focus on environmental puzzles that make use of the weapons you have.\n\nOne of the most important things that you need to do right if you're going for a Metroid feel in your game is to get the world itself correct. The world itself is big, very big, but it does have a tendency to feel somewhat sparse after a while. Another problem with such a big world is that if you ever need to backtrack, it gets annoying very quickly. There is no teleportation powerup (unless I just didn't find it; if there is, let me know and I'll change this review accordingly), which really doesn't make sense given that you teleport to the last save point when you die. Speaking of such, one thing that I was definitely happy that this game did is that you never game over, so even if you die, you don't lose progress.\n\nEnemies are your typical Metroid fare, wall-crawlers, spiders, things that shoot at you, and they do more damage as you go along because reasons. Bosses are really disappointing, especially given how cool they look. In fact, there is one boss where you can spend most of the time crouching and be perfectly fine. I did play through this game first time on Normal, so maybe the AI was tweaked for the bosses on Hard mode to make them actually threatening; I dunno. There was only really one boss that I would call challenging, and that's just because it does a lot of damage. The final boss was just a mashfest, honestly; dash around everywhere and shoot the thing from time to time.\n\nOverall, I had a pretty good time with Axiom Verge. The world was pretty good, despite all the backtracking; there were pretty well hidden secrets that were fun to find, and even though bosses could've been a lot more fun to fight than they actually were, this could be something that was fixed on Hard mode. If you've played something like Environmental Station Alpha, I'd definitely play this on Hard first time through. It manages to be pretty good, but not fantastic. 7/10.\n\nStory: The story, or at least what all I got of it from this playthrough as you need powerups to translate some of the alien text, is actually pretty cool. It's written quite well, even though it gets a little bit up its own ♥♥♥♥ from time to time (a line from a page that goes, "As everyone knows from the Euclid Equation..." Yeah, as *everyone* knows...). The only "real" character in the game - and that's somewhat questionable from time to time - is the character you play as, called Trace. Trace is/was a scientist at a facility that blew up, science happened, and now you're in an alien world. Without going into too much detail, the game does a very good job at making you wonder whether your "benefactors" are really that, as well as making you wonder whether what you're doing really is for the best. Despite this, there doesn't seem to be any alternate endings, for better and for worse. While there isn't much in the way of character development in the game, the focus of the writing is not on the characters; it's on the world, and building of worlds this game does pretty well. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: When I saw the art style of this game, I instantly knew why the person who recommended it to me did so: the art style in this game is pretty dang excellent. One shocker is that it was all done by one person. An even bigger shocker is that this entire game was made by one person, although I don't think witchcraft makes you one person still. All joking aside, this game does look really, really good. As mentioned above, the bosses look really, really cool, which makes it all the more disappointing how boring and easy almost all of them are. Funnily enough, the boss that looked the least interesting ended up being the hardest of the bunch (the bee thing for those who were wondering). Still though, the art style of this game is very, very good and it's all the more better considering that just one person worked on it. As for the technical side of things, the game fullscreened to 1080p and ran at a solid 60FPS throughout; just what you'd expect. It can be run windowed, but I never messed with that option as I like having things searing off my retinas at glorious full screen. I don't really need to say much more on this one than, "look at the screenshots." 5/5.\n\nSound: Another thing that became very surprising once I learned that this was a solo project is the music: the entire game, as well as the music, was still made by one person. This is surprising because the music is quite good. It's kinda chiptune-y in some areas and kinda not in others, which normally shows a bit of a confused direction with the audio, but since the whole game is "kinda 8-bit, kinda not," it never becomes too distracting. Plus, I don't know if these tracks would offer as much atmosphere as they do in a strictly 8-bit format. Speaking of sound direction, every enemy in the game makes the same exact noise when you hit them, which is a bit weird but again, one of those things that you notice if you're really nitpicking. I don't know if the OST is good enough to make me wanna buy it for myself, but it at the very least works really well in-game. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/8/5/4; cumulative score of 8.0/10. Quite a good showing, especially from one person, but it does some issues with level design and bosses that keeps the game from being as good as it could be. Still though, if you're looking for a Metroid-style game that you can blaze through in a couple of nights, this is a very good one to pick up. I got 60% item completion and 90% map completion in the ~7 hours that I played it, so I could see 100% being possible in under 15 hours.","May 29, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game follows the classic Metroid formula with some modern game improvements.\n\nFor example, the various weapons are tactical in nature.  As opposed to Metroid where the guns just get predictably more powerful, the various guns in Axiom Verge display radically different characteristics.  Picking the right gun for the right situation is the key to succeeding in combat.  Fortunately, switching between the surprisingly large arsenal is quick and easy with a controller (native PS4 controller support!).\n\nAnother surprising aspect is the story.  Though at first glance it appears to be a minimalist tale like so many other Metroidvania games, notes scattered around the world reveal a deeper and more convoluted plot than what is initially presented.  Combined with a cryptic ending, there is definitely a path paved for a sequel.\n\nThe only downside for me was that the game was rather easy.  I played it on Hard for my first run through and the game only started to get challenging towards the last third or so.  The main reason for this is that the enemy behavior is not very complex or varied.  Most enemies fit into one of two categories: moving in a set pattern, and dashing straight towards you.  The first type are always easy to kill, while the second require more thought but are usually easily defeated with proper tactics and the right weapon.  Boss behavior is similarly limited with most bosses only exhibiting one or two patterns.\n\nUltimately, I feel that $20 was a bit much for what I got.  While I enjoyed the game, the lack of enemy variety and challenge doesn't inspire me to do multiple play-throughs.  I would say it would be a must-buy at $10, but for $20 you need to be a fan of Metroidvania to really appreciate it.\n\nIn conclusion, great controls (played with a PS4 controller), great music, cool pixel art, and all designed by one man.  I'm definitely interested to see what he will do next.","May 30, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style and dystopian design is wonderful. There are some surprisingly dark parts that really set a tone that I've never really felt with a "16 bit" game.

Gets a lot of influence from the Metroid series without actually being Metroid. This is not a clone. You run, jump, shoot, backtrack, find upgrades, but apart from that, it is very different. The upgrades and guns you'll find are very interesting and creative. It sort of recreates that Metroidish feeling of “I can’t get to that area yet, but I bet there’s an item that’ll help me,” but it is not an item that you’d think it’d be. There’s no morph ball, no space jump, no missiles. You instead get a creative tool or ability you wouldn’t expect and because of that, it really captures that first sense of wonder when playing Metroid for the first time.\n\nThe story is average. The premise is the common, “There is a bad guy, and you are the only one who can help us” with a plot twist or two. The setting is very interesting and unique, but being a unique and complex world, it can be confusing without finding and collecting the in-game notes about it.\n\nAxiom Verge was made by one person, and I gotta say I am very well damned impressed this guy created all this. Kudos to you Thomas Happ! This game satisfied my Metroid fix. I wouldn’t say it is better, less than, or equal to Super Metroid, because it is a different, but enjoyable experience.

That it comes even close to the quality of its forebear, Super Metroid, is a genuinely huge accomplishment. It's been a long time since I felt this fascinated and this compelled to complete a game (Pixel's "Cave Story" comes to mind as well, speaking of similar genres), to see as much as I could, to come back as often as I could, never wanting to stop playing.  The soundtrack is gorgeous and memorable, the controls are -- with one or two quirks kept in mind -- as tight as can be, the items are truly clever and innovative, and even though the game is inspired by Nintendo's brilliant game-changer, it never feels like it's flat-out aping the game Tom Happ so clearly adores.  "Axiom Verge" is its own game, through and through.  And then there's all the hidden items and map sections and secrets galore.  You'll be so proud of yourself when you find some of these cartographic riddles.\n\nIf you have ever enjoyed a "Metroidvania"-style game, support this fella and buy this game.  $20 is a small price to pay for a game that would've been $50+ in 1994.

It's easy to dismiss Axiom Verge as a clone, but the game has enough unique twists that could give any bounty hunter a run for their money. Axiom's main feature is a throwback to dusty catridge games where the graphics would get scrabled or players could force themselves into places the game wasn't programmed for them to go. The game actually incorporates these glitches into the gameplay; the hero has the ability to zip through walls, make tiles appear and disappear and scramble enemies into other forms. You may even find randomly placed secret areas unique to your save file that are a blast to seek out and discover. Aside from a few late-game issues (the map doesn't keep track of where you found items, just whether you've found everything or not) Axiom Verge is a solid game start to finish!","June 27, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even more rare for an indie game to have this much substance. Yet even more impressive is the fact that such a game can exist under the creative eye of a Single Person. All coding, artwork, music handled by a single person with more creative talent than should be possible.\n\nI grew up in the NES days and put my time into Batman, Megaman, Bionic Commando, Ninja Gaiden, etc. etc., and this game just Does It Right. Sooo right, down to the 8-bit cinematic sequences, sound effects and difficulty. The art here is Giger-like, bio-mechanical monstrosities with a minimal colour palette for each area. Not NES minimal, but nostalgic nevertheless. Every sound fits so well and is incredibly authentic, without being a knock-off. The stereo digital static that surfaces in certain spots just makes the hair on my neck stand up. Speaking of which, the music isn't anything to scoff at either; it's a beautiful hommage to classic games, but incredibly modern/apocalyptic dark electro. This makes revisiting areas a pleasure, just to hear the amazing songs play again. Trust me, you'll be revisiting places often.\n\nThere's the obvious Metroid comparisons, albeit with an integrated map system, but it feels completely natural. Hidden areas requiring your newly-found skill power-up begs for exploration of every section of the map. Items and Nodes appear in plain sight, seemingly unobtainable, until you advance enough in the game to wander back and pick it up. The list of weaponry is Huge as well, breaking up any monotony and providing a depth of strategy to the R-Type-esque bosses, and overall use of different weapons vs. different enemies. I highly suggest using a gamepad, it's really fluid and organic, although remembering the weapon icons is a little tough.\n\nBottom line is that Axiom Verge is well worth your time, even if you get 'stuck': you can always come back and dig a little deeper. There will always be that corner of the map not filled in, taunting you to run 'n gun your way over to it to see what's up. There are images and moments in this game that are absolutely classic experiences. You won't regret it.","June 30, 2015","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original Metroid is probably one of my top 5 favorite gaming experiences of my life.  So this game was basically made for people like me.\n\nSomebody on Metacritic described it best:  This game is 'Retro Gaming Ecstasy'.  Challenging gameplay, with no real hand-holding and a large focus on exploration.  You'll do a lot of backtracking - as you'll find rooms where you will encounter insurmountable obstacles, only to later find an item which allows you to explore it - a classic feature of the 'Metroidvania' genre which I love.  Really fluid, tight controls - those who grew up on NES/SNES platformers will feel right at home here.  Diverse weapon selection and there are very few parts of the game that force you to use one weapon over another - you can choose which is best for your playstyle.  As you get deeper into the game (without spoiiling too much) there are a bevy of movement options at your disposal which adds to the experience greatly.\n\nThere are also a number of large,classic 16-bit style boss fights in the game.  The early ones are fairly trivial - the ones in the latter half of the game are fairly challenging and you will feel accomplished when you defeat them.   (Note this was only on Normal - I did not play on Hard - yet)\n\nThe only real frustration I had with my playthrough was going off to explore another area, forgetting to find a save location, dying, and then being reset to my last location, which might have been a long way away.  This only happened a couple of times, and I learned quickly to find a save spot while exploring!\n\nNow that I am done, I am motivated to go back and see if I can do it faster, via the game's built in 'speedrun mode', which disables the story popups and slowdowns.  Very cool feature and a nice nod to the speedrunning community.\n\nHighly recommended.  It's well worth $20.","July 1, 2015","true","44.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't completely flawless, but if you're looking for something to scratch that itch, this is it.\n\nMore details:\nAxiom Verge is a great game, and basically none of the complaints I saw on the negative reviews here at steam seemed to be even factually correct by my own experience. It has contra-style aiming, there's a decent number of bosses, which are for the most part clever and interesting; the game has plenty of challenge to it and lots of things to discover. It's largely completionist-friendly: There is nothing missable; there are some bonus areas that appear in random locations but they don't count for the game's "official" 100%, which is good enough for me. Playing this game is fun and satisfying; there are puzzles everywhere, many of which have more than one intriguing solution.\n\nThere are a few complaints, mainly falling toward the end of a game, and none of them really make me not want to play it again.\nThe story ends in a somewhat unsatisfying way; I like the mystery of it, but it leaves too many questions completely unanswered, even after reading all of the notes. It tries to be a story people talk about and try to figure out, but it feels like it was written without even the author knowing the truth behind everything. I prefer stories with satisfying conclusions: The universe is saved, you win, that sort of thing; even leaving some hints that things aren't as they seem alongside something like that would be better.\nThe final boss was a breeze, which should never be the case. To be clear, I had 100% of the items in the game, but that's no excuse. By comparison, the final bosses of Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission are so tough that unless you went out of your way to get more items than you normally run across or are just ridiculously good at it you'll probably get killed, and the latter is made even harder if the player has 100%. In this case, the section before the final boss was harder than the boss itself. After the challenge and cleverness of most of the earlier bosses, this was a bit of a let-down.\nThere were some really clever puzzles with the game's "glitch gun" that alters the behavior of enemies it hits in the last section, and I really wish the game had more puzzles like that, possibly replacing some basic "gotcha" items in non-obvious walls.\n\nOverall, though, it was fun. I never really had a complaint while I was playing the game, and what complaints I have come up with were on reflection rather than in the experience. You should buy it.","November 19, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Axiom Verge is not a new genre touchstone the way, say, La Mulana was.  But it's certainly miles ahead of the rest of the pretenders.\n\nAxiom Verge has unusual items in its library of powerups that do well to reintroduce an element of surprise for people who've played too many of these and know what to look for.  The game also rewards exploration with inventive, purely optional weapons, which is a great improvement over a hundred missile expansions.  Unfortunately all weapons do roughly the same amount of damage, even ones that are awkward to aim, so many are not as good as the default gun.\n\nMetroid was inspired by Alien, and Alien was inspired by H.R. Giger.  Axiom Verge looks back to Giger's works and often feels even more Metroidy than Metroid itself.  It's a great decision, and the game looks gorgeous.\n\nThe game doesn't do anything exciting to enable sequence breaking - some breaks are possible, but it doesn't do anything as bold as Super Metroid's walljump or Bunny Must Die's parrying.  This, and fairly stiff, accelerationless movement controls, probably curtail any hope of it becoming a great game for speedrunning.","July 26, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, it seems that the amazing series isn't worth reviving, which is a sad disappointment to fans of the series, myself included. Even if NIntendo did decide to revive the series, it would most likely be revamped into something that is unlike what we all know and love. So, you ask, how can I relive my childhood memories of searching for hidden items, exploring exotic worlds, fighting bizarre bosses unlike any I've ever seen. Well, look no further. Ladies and Gentlegamers, Axiom Verge is what you've been looking for.\n\nThe series starts you off with an elusive plot that introduces you to your main character, but is vague enough that it keeps you searching for answers for the next several hours of the game. You wake up in a strange egg-like structure, forced to begin making your way around. Despite the fact that it doesn't contian a near-silent protagonist like the classic Metroid games, Axiom Verge still manages to keep you in the dark with it's plot, slowly revealing pieces to you for a mind-blowing finale. The game is chock-full of interesting environments, creatures, and boss-fights that will give you a rush of adrenaline and nostalgia that you haven't probably felt since you beat Metroid Zero Mission a decade ago.\n\nThe best part of all is the replay value. Heck, you'll find yourself searching for all the hidden items and secrets scattered all over the map long after you've beaten the game's final boss. The game has a similar end-game bonus if you manage to get nearly all the items in the game, giving you a secret ending. The world also has several pieces of paper and tablets that reveal parts of the plot that aren't normally obtained during the main gameplay.\n\nMy only major gripe about the game is the keyboard layout. It's unlike any I've ever seen in a game, especially a platformer, and won't have you holding your mouse and your fingers on the WASD keys. For this reason, I highly recommend grabbing a controller if you've got one handy, if not, it takes a little while getting used to the layout, but it's by no means a deal-breaker.\n\nSo, I'm sure you're asking yourself, is this game merely a copy of Metroid? Will I just feel like I'm replaying Super Metroid, except now I'm out twenty bucks? Absolutely not. While Axiom Verge will tingle your nostalgia senses, but it's got it's own wonderfully crafted story and world that stands all on it's own.\n\nIs it worth it? Heck freaking yes.

(No objective indicators etc)\n+ Feels good to explore\n+ Top notch soundtrack\n+ Brilliant Checkpoint system\n+ Low system requirements\n+ Supports Controllers\n\nCons- Bosses can be pretty tough\n- Easy to get lost and even stuck in some places requiring starting the game all over again.\n- Few issues with the controls\n\nOverallThis is an outstanding example of a decent Metroidvania styled game.  In fact its more of a pure Metroid game in that it shares many similarities with the Metroid (NOT PRIME) franchise.\n\nWhile I am usually put off by no hand holding, when I find where I need to go it feels great, that I've done something without being told where to go and exploration is rewarding in its own right.\n\nWhen playing this with a controller I find myself using the right thumb stick to aim which it doesn't it in fact selects a weapon you want to use.  A very minor complaint but something I thought was worth a mention.\n\nAt the end of the day the question you should ask: Do you like Metroid? If so then GET .... THIS ....

As soon as I saw the trailer, I almost immediately bought it ( due to Metroid being one of my most favored Nintendo franchises ).\n\nThe game is unique, challenging, and most definitely fun to play. I've only played about 2 hours of it, and i'm already addicted to playing through out the entire story and find out what happened to Trace. Speedrun also seems to be a good way to get hooked onto the game.\n\nOn another note, I like to bring up the old 8-bit style and the old chip-tune beats.

I'll leave detailled descriptions of what the genre entails to other, wordier reviews, and will instead focus on what makes this game stand out among the crowd.\n\nThe artwork, music and atmosphere are sinister and fitting. This is a metroidvania that feels like HR Giger was on the design team, but all the more sexual elements of his designs were removed. Biomechanical structures, grating noises, reality becoming undone at the seams.\n\nThe story thus far has been enjoyable. The game mechanics are tight and slick, with an enjoyable "glitching reality" theme. This is not to say the game itself is glitchy - your abilities have the appearance of glitches but are carefully controlled in what can effect what. Under the hood, you are still obtaining an increasing arsenal of weapons and abilities to move around a map in pursuit of plot-nuggets and story-critical thingammijigs.\n\nI don't see much point in numerical scores, but this was very good.","January 2","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ah, the 2D games, like Fusion and Super Metroid. Now Nintendo stop making such classics, and are giving us 3D FPS Metroids. They are still quite fun, but do not give us the "high" the old ones did.\n\nAxiom Verge brings back that high, with backtracking, a lot of experimenting on guns, not to mention, over 10 different weapons to use. While this does not have the attention it deserves, unlike Undertale, which was recommended to me because I dearly enjoyed earthbound (I still do not see a similarity). This game has a great story, and has been in the works for 5 years, and was made by 1 person only. It was heavily inspired by the classic Metroid and has the retro graphics that make you feel like you are playing a SNES game. It has the amazing throwback music, no singing. Hell, it even has secret glitch rooms inspired by the negative levels in the original mario bros. This game is basically a very late SNES game.

Also, I wish there was some kind of fast travel (I know there's that "thing" that helps you move through the areas but you still have to backtrack a lot so a waypoint system or something like that would be good) but that's just a personal thing, I guess, because I always explored the whole map as soon as I got a new upgrade and got bored of having to walk all the way.\n\nReally I'm not very good writing reviews but to sum it up:  this is probably the best metroidvania on steam, no doubt.","December 29, 2015","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I'll probably compare it to Metroid the whole review.\n\n\nTime for random comparisons to Metroid all in the same paragraph\n\nAnyways, sadly, you can't walljump, but the jumps are less floaty than most Metroid games, fairly close to Zero Mission. The password tool is annoying just in that some passwords are very hard to find and much easier to look up in a guide, making it harder to get 100% unless you look up a guide. I wish that the weapons would stack like in Metroid games, but there are way too many weapons, although it is interesting messing around with the different weapons. The music is definetely a different style than the Metroid games, but I think it is still very good music. As for the graphics, "HAALY *poo* DEM GREEPICS" - JonTron 2011. Continuing on, the difficulty is nice, gets hard near the end, its easy at the start, just normal video game stuff. but it is kind of hard at the end, not easy at the start, and slightly easier at the end. Last point of this game. The price. It's super expensive if you'll play it for 1 hour and never finish it, but if you like the Metroid style, you'll at least want to finish it, and spend about 10 hours on your first playthrough, which may or may not be worth it for you.\n\nOVERALLS: i don't wear them. Now if you take the s out,\nOVERALL, It's a great game, lots of fun, hard to 100%, expensive by steam standards, super cheap by console standards.

I beat the game on Normal difficulty with 100% completion in 16 hours.\n\nIt gets the feel mostly right, but dialog and cutscenes happen just often enough that the sense of pleasant loneliness that comes from exploring a hostile alien world is lost. In addition, the story, while generally fine, is told somewhat strangely--too much detail to hold much mystery, and yet not enough detail to appreciate its scope. I actually think it's fine that you can't really relate to most of the characters, being that they're supposed to be so alien, but the one that you are supposed to connect with is still fairly bland.\n\nControls are fine--the addition of a lock button to hold still while aiming is a nice touch, but there's a dash ability that requires double-tapping a direction that gets kind of old, and probably should have been its own button. Nonetheless, the game presents enough interesting ways of maneuvering around the environment that just traversing rooms feels pretty satisfying.\n\nItem collection is probably the game's weakest aspect--there's a ton of backtracking, and the map doesn't have any indication of what items you have or haven't gotten--it only tells you if you got them all. This would be forgivable if there weren't a pretty sizable number of items that are almost impossible to find without a cheat sheet or a lot of obsessive checking of every single wall, and some require even more unorthodox solutions--I'm all about out-of-the-box problem-solving, but the game gives little indication of even where to start in some parts (helpful hint: try 'scrambling' every enemy at least once to see what it does.) When you don't feel like you can trust the information provided by the game--when you aren't even given indication that you *should* be curious about a room--it makes for a pretty tedious exploration experience. This is further exacerbated by the lack of a final powerup that essentially trivializes navigation in the early areas of the game--an important element that helps mitigate the fact that the threats of the areas you're backtracking through are no longer challenging to someone with all the weapons and power-ups the endgame affords.\n\nVisually, the game knocks it out of the park--environments and enemies are beautifully bizarre, and come in almost endless variety. Nothing more to really say about it--it's a visual treat you'll be happy to pore over.\n\nThe sound design is similarly excellent: the music has good variety while keeping a certain pulsing feel that makes every area feel alive and alien; your weapons sound appropriately powerful, and your enemies sound appropriately monstrous. The only two knocks I have here are the low-health alert, while cleverly timed to the beat of the music, is rather piercing, and the "clang" you get when you hit an invulnerable part of an enemy becomes overpowering when you start fighting large bosses with rapid-fire weapons (since they tend to be almost entirely invulnerable save for a small weak point.)\n\nOverall, this is a great game, and my complaints are really mostly nit-picking--I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I can't wait to see the next game from Mr. Happ.","May 20, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Granted, it doesn't even bother to hide it's super metroid influences but honestly with all the crap steam is trying to push as "metroidvania" when the games are anything but, I am willing to let a few things slide.\n\nSo short version: If you loved super metroid, you will find something to love about this game. It's that game but with a different skin.\n\nThere are a couple things that made me wince in terms of design choices, namely the mobility-based skills you pick up and a very hit or miss soundtrack, but overall the experience was more or less what I had hoped for in a game carrying a metroid-vania tag.\n\nIt's also generously  long, with a modest helping of replayability. Namely in the form of a speedrun mode, size of map, a hard mode, and a couple other specific challenges for the achievement hunting folks out there (don't die more than once)\n\nI definitely recommend this game in the hopes other developers will see how successful this game is as an example of what TO DO when you want to make a metroid-vania game.\n\nSeriously though, Kur has one of the worst BGM's I have ever heard.

Gets a lot of influence from the Metroid series without actually being Metroid. This is not a clone. You run, jump, shoot, backtrack, find upgrades, but apart from that, it is very different. The upgrades and guns you'll find are very interesting and creative. It sort of recreates that Metroidish feeling of “I can’t get to that area yet, but I bet there’s an item that’ll help me,” but it is not an item that you’d think it’d be. There’s no morph ball, no space jump, no missiles. You instead get a creative tool or ability you wouldn’t expect and because of that, it really captures that first sense of wonder when playing Metroid for the first time.\n\nThe story is average. The premise is the common, “There is a bad guy, and you are the only one who can help us” with a plot twist or two. The setting is very interesting and unique, but being a unique and complex world, it can be confusing without finding and collecting the in-game notes about it.\n\nAxiom Verge was made by one person, and I gotta say I am very well damned impressed this guy created all this. Kudos to you Thomas Happ! This game satisfied my Metroid fix. I wouldn’t say it is better, less than, or equal to Super Metroid, because it is a different, but enjoyable experience.

This game is beyond rad.\n\nI'm using a modified SNES controller on PC for this game. I'd recommend rebinding the directional keys for this game and using a program like JoyToKey in order to bind the gamepad to keyboard strokes. Since this game was made with an anolog stick controller in mind a normal 8way directional gamepad may not necessarily register the directional pad correctly at first.\n\nThe game is very atmospheric like Super Metroid. I don't think it is a clone I'd say it takes a winning gameplay mechanic of powerups and new weapons in order to open new areas. It's an action/adventure metroidvania platformer game with solid music as well. Another thing I like about this game is the reminder system for the map. That was a genius way of rewarding players for early exloration and terrain pounding with the drill :D.\n\n-Tyler","December 28, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is solid enough that I can easily recommend it for anyone that is a fan of metroidvania style games. I'll likely come back and give some final impressions once I finish the game but I highly doubt anything would take away my recommendation of the game.\n\nWhat really pulls this game together, however, is the amazing soundtrack and delightfully surreal landscapes. There's a lot of variety to be found in the visuals and each new area was a marvelous experience taking in the environment and new enemies. Exploration is definitely the highest mark of Axiom Verge.\n\nWhile the gameplay is solid and holds up, a lot of the unique features (Such as the address disrupter/glitch gun, glitching through walls, etc.) are little more than a novel way to substitute locked doors. I've been told that they're more prominant when searching for some of the more obscure secrets, but as far as shuffling through the story they haven't been more than ways around simplistic roadblocks.\n\nDifficulty feels okay for the most part. Environmental difficulty actually feels perfect, but bosses thus far have felt a bit on the easy side. A little more difficulty or ingenuity with the boss attacks would have been welcome, but they aren't an unsatisfying experience - just a fairly generic one.","April 14","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Axiom Verge doesn't hide the fact that it is a love letter, heavily influenced by the classic masterpiece. The game succeeds in many ways. The areas you will traverse are ranged and all have a beautiful, 16 bit scifi theme. The music melts nicely into those environments. There are a range of weapons and upgraded abilities to acquire. Boss fights are challenging without being too challenging and catering only to the obcessive gamer population.\n\nWhere the game falls a little short is in the late game pacing and the story in general. I never really cared for the Keanu Reeves super scientist bro story line. Samus was the strong silent type. I felt this game could have benefited from that model. Late game pacing with no fast travel eventually ended my trip a little prematurely. After hour 8 I ended up just traveling back and forth between distant locals hoping to explore a new piece of the map with a newly found ability. I found myself not enjoying that process or caring much about the story I was involved in so I stopped playing. Too many great games out there with not enough time to play them all to continue on when I'm not in it, just for the sake of beating it.\n\nHowever, if you are in the market for a retro Metroid game for PC, look no further.

Not the best example of it, though. If you need a fix, you can't go wrong, but maybe you could go back and play Super Metroid too?\n\nTight gameplay, feels very natural with a controller in hand, though teleport-dash input is a glaring issue. It -really- needs to be bound to a button and not directional double-tap.\n\nThe corruption/glitch aesthetic is a nice twist and spices up the regular gameplay, changing enemies with your glitch ray and whatnot, but outside from that application it is dreadfully underutilized and never explored in any meaningful way other than to provide roadblocks and ability requirements.\n\nLarge but inconsistent weapon variety (some obviously strong, some nearly useless, many in between that are outshined by the more useful ones), visually impressive but weakly designed boss encounters, somewhat forgettable music. Graphics seem to be hit or miss on people, I found them a little lacking; aside from color there's few strong, consistent, eye-catching features of a given zone and everything is a bit bland and lacking flavor. But the outdoor environments were a little more pleasing.\n\nPlot is, without question, completely overrated by the majority of reviews I've seen. It's adequate, but there is little build-up and almost no sense of drama or weight to the events. The ending -- even the true ending -- is a little disappointing, and feels like there was supposed to be more gameplay to follow it up and conclude things better.\n\nI'm harshing on the game a bit here when the truth is that I enjoyed the time I put into it. It doesn't hold your hand or tell you where to go, letting you get immersed into exploring each zone at your leisure. The exploration and puzzles are done well and hit all the right buttons, though it has a habit of throwing a lot of branching paths at you that result in dead ends, forcing you to backtrack because you don't have a given ability. But that's an issue about the genre itself, isn't it?\n\nI would like to give this game a negative rating, just to balance out the average a little and make it more representitive of the quality of the game, but... I get the feeling that's like yelling into a windstorm so nuts to it.\n\n(I personally think the teleport dash is kickin' rad, more games need teleport dashes)","December 30, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is interesting, and just the overall feel of the controls are tight as heck. In general If you're having that metroidvania itch this will satisfy it on literally all possible fronts but one\n\nand that's with enemy design.\n\nThe vast majority of the game is thoroughly enjoyable, but at the same time the vast majority of enemies end up being bullet sponges, surprise punches in the face, or tiny ultra mobile whisps that chunk your health away. Regardless of the guns or upgrades you end up having they end up being a frustrating and demoralizing thing to be constantly fighting as you backtrack (or progress) through the world.\n\nThe saddest culmination of the bad enemy design is definitely the bosses, most of which either end up being "stand in one spot and shoot" or "find this very specific way to cheese it out". Neither of which would be a problem if there was something inbetween those two difficulty extremes.\n\nIn general I'd still say it's a great game with some cool inventive weapons, the sole issue is with enemy design, and it pains me to pick fault with it because of how incredible the game is otherwise.

Suffice it to say, we haven't seen, and won't be seeing, a Metroid game for quite some time, and that's a real shame because there's something about that mix of being stuck on an alien world alone with hundreds of aliens that want to eat you, and collecting upgrades to explore a labarynthian planet while blowing up your enemies that just so intoxicating. I'm not ashamed to say that I don't completely understand why Metroid is such a captivating game, but the whole point of this paragraph is to tell you that if something captures it, it's this game.\n\nAxiom Verge scratches the itch I have for a new Metroid game so very well, and tows you along with an intriguing story that you'll piece together as you explore the mystery of Axiom Verge's world. In some respects, it outperforms the original model with new ideas and a huge array of weapons to pick from, provided you take the time to find them, and provides you with plenty of challenge with tough enemies and frantic boss battles, while rewarding you for poking your head into the nooks and crannies of the pulsing, decrepid terrain you walk upon. This game understands what makes the Metroid genre good and you'll know within an hour of playing that it's no mere copycat.\n\nIf you like Metroid and are itching for something that captures the essence of it, this is the perfect game. If you've never played a game of the Metroid style before, then this is a great place to start.","April 15","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the pixel art, to the weaponry, to the AMAZING music (if you liked the soundtrack from Super Metroid, then you'll dig this too), I find this game really jives artistically.  You'll really appreciate it if you grew up in SNES era, as this title really harkens back to that time.  The controls are well done and so it combat.  Even the story is interesting, if a bit strange at times.\n\nThe one thing I'll criticize here is the lack of direction the game provides you with.  Even in exploration based games like Castlevania or Legend of Zelda, there are usually SOME hints of where to go and what to do.  I have spent hours searching for my next objective.  Some areas are difficult to traverse, and so it gets frustrating when I can't figure out where I should be!  Note that I enjoy explorative games.  I don't enjoy being forced to backtrack repeatedly until I can miraculously find the new area the power up I found an hour ago opens for me.\n\nOverall, still a fun game.  I'm almost finished with it (last boss), so I'll update again soon.","March 14","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Axiom Verge is a 2-D sidescrolling action adventure platformer. If you have played games like the classic Metriod games, or classic Castlevania games then you will have an idea of what Axiom Verge is like from a gameplay standpoint. It channels the best of what is now known as the "Metroidvainia" sub-genre, that being said, knowing this does not take away from the game's originality when it comes to story and setting.\nWhat makes this particular game so special, it that it was painstakingly designed by ONE man over five years! The man's name is Tom Happ and he has taken what so many people love from the "Metroidvania" sub-genre and made his own fine tuned, well designed experience.\nThe main character is Trace, a scientist from Earth, and an accident in the lab leads Trace to coming to a scientific epiphany. I won't spoil the story of the game, but lets just say that Trace does't make the best decisions and ends up becoming a powerful villian who ends up almost wiping out an entire race of aliens called the Sudrans.\nIn response, Trace is cloned from an imprint of the real Trace taken before he went mad. It is believed that this clone of Trace may be able to stop the power mad, original version of himself. You play the clone of Trace.\nThe graphics are done in a style that looks very much like an NES game made at the end of that particular console's lifespan, looking as though it uses every ounce of 8-bit processing power the system had available. Of course, there are other graphcal effects that do much more than the NES ever could, but the look and feel of the game very much feels like a great NES game of that era.\nAs for gameplay, the controls are very responsive (I play with a USB Xbox 360 controller) and work very well with a controller. (NOTE: I did not play with the keyboard controls, so I can't speak to how well the game plays in that regard, I suggest playing with a controller, as this game runs amazingly well while using one.)\nAs with any "Metroidvania" style game, you are dropped into the world and are able to go where you please, but many areas will be unaccessible to you until you find the right weapon/sub-weapon/powerup. This forces one to explore the very well designed world in order to find the items necessary to progress to other regions of the game.\nThere are a large variety of unique enemies to battle against, and every new region of the world has enemies that are native to that region, keeping the enemy threat interesting and their differing ways of attack keeping the player on their toes.\nThe weapons and powerups you gather along the way help to give you an edge against your enemies in varying ways, and they also serve some sort of function within the world. No weapon or powerup is pointless, all of your weapons can give you an edge in specific situations or against certain enemies and they make fighting the bad guys intuitive and fun.\nBoss fights are an event, and each boss is different from other bosses in the game, and each presents a different challenge to the player.\nLike most games in this sub-genre, there are save points littered throughout the game, the save points completely heal your character, and act as a checkpoint if you happen to die.\nAs for the design of the game, it is simply beautiful. The world our hero is dumped into is a strange, alien world filled with weird and dangerous creatures. The environments in many areas look as if they are alive, those that have played games like Metroid, Metroid II: Return of Samus, and Super Metroid will feel the sting of nostalgia, as many of the environments seem to echo the planet Zebes or SR 388.\nThe music and sound design is another high water mark; the music can be moody, and at times creepy and ominous, it gives the game a unique atmosphere that gives Axiom Verge an identity of mystery and discovery. The sounds within the game are fantastic, the sounds of your various weapons make them sound lethal, and the sounds that some of the alien monsters can be unsettling and well...Alien!\nPersonally, I think this is one of the best indy games I have ever played. I am a big fan of games like Metroid, Metroid II: Return of Samus, Super Metroid, Castlevania 1-3, Super Castlevania 4, Symphony of the Night, Rondo of Blood, Bloodlines, and all of the Gameboy Advance Castlevanias (Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow). If you are a fan of any of those games, you will absolutely LOVE Axiom Verge.\n\nUnique Story, beautiful retro 8-bit inspired graphics, amazing soundtrack and atmosphere, lots of weapons and powerups, and a large intriguing world to explore. Axiom Verge is one of the best games I have played this year, and I look forward to the developer's future projects.\n\nMy final score for Axiom Verge is a full 10/10.\nI admit that maybe my fondness for the sub-genre and my nostalgia for the graphical style, and gameplay probably influenced my score. This game is not for everyone, but it is a game that I firmly believe that anyone can enjoy. Since the game is so cheap when it comes to price, I say it is completely worth a purchase.\n","December 25, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sort of recreates that Metroidish feeling of “I can’t get to that area yet, but I bet there’s an item that’ll help me,” but it is not an item that you’d think it’d be. There’s no morph ball, no space jump, no missiles. You instead get a creative tool or ability you wouldn’t expect and because of that, it really captures that first sense of wonder when playing Metroid for the first time.\n\nThe story is average. The premise is the common, “There is a bad guy, and you are the only one who can help us” with a plot twist or two. The setting is very interesting and unique, but being a unique and complex world, it can be confusing without finding and collecting the in-game notes about it.\n\nAxiom Verge was made by one person, and I gotta say I am very well damned impressed this guy created all this. Kudos to you Thomas Happ! This game satisfied my Metroid fix. I wouldn’t say it is better, less than, or equal to Super Metroid, because it is a different, but enjoyable experience. I had lots of fun playing it.\n","December 27, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is beyond rad.\n\nI'm using a modified SNES controller on PC for this game. I'd recommend rebinding the directional keys for this game and using a program like JoyToKey in order to bind the gamepad to keyboard strokes. Since this game was made with an anolog stick controller in mind a normal 8way directional gamepad may not necessarily register the directional pad correctly at first.\n\nThe game is very atmospheric like Super Metroid. I don't think it is a clone I'd say it takes a winning gameplay mechanic of powerups and new weapons in order to open new areas. It's an action/adventure metroidvania platformer game with solid music as well. Another thing I like about this game is the reminder system for the map.

If you're afflicted with a similar bias I can say with almost 100% certainty that you will love this game as much as I did.\nThis is a true 'metroid-vania' style action platformer and as such relies heavily on exploration and item-progression to advance the story. Warning: this isn't a game that will hold your hand and a lot of back tracking and trial and error will be necessary as you traverse the tunnels and corridors looking for a way forward. Thankfully, this isn't much of a chore as the gorgeous 16 bit world has been crafted with loving attention to detail and your entire journey plays out to one of the best video game soundtracks.. full-stop. The weapon system is a blast, combat is entertaining and the item-progression is rewarding and inventful. I love the ability to 'glitch' enemies and environments and found myself constantly experimenting as I progressed.\nIf I had to level a criticism it would be that the story falls absolutely flat, especially near the end as the intrigue and mystery so carefully cultvated in the beginning has all but dissapeared. But that's a small compaint to levie against what is otherwise such a superb game.\n\nBottom line: if you've been looking for a game that would re-kindle your love affair with this long neglected genre look no further.

Axiom Verge is not a new genre touchstone the way, say, La Mulana was.  But it's certainly miles ahead of the rest of the pretenders.\n\nAxiom Verge has unusual items in its library of powerups that do well to reintroduce an element of surprise for people who've played too many of these and know what to look for.  The game also rewards exploration with inventive, purely optional weapons, which is a great improvement over a hundred missile expansions.  Unfortunately all weapons do roughly the same amount of damage, even ones that are awkward to aim, so many are not as good as the default gun.\n\nMetroid was inspired by Alien, and Alien was inspired by H.R. Giger.  Axiom Verge looks back to Giger's works and often feels even more Metroidy than Metroid itself.  It's a great decision, and the game looks gorgeous.\n\nThe game doesn't do anything exciting to enable sequence breaking - some breaks are possible, but it doesn't do anything as bold as Super Metroid's walljump or Bunny Must Die's parrying.  This, and fairly stiff, accelerationless movement controls, probably curtail any hope of it becoming a great game for speedrunning.","July 26, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/332200/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","There are many games that are throwbacks to earlier eras in gaming. They have become so commonplace as to be unremarkable, and it's not difficult to see why. Even setting aside the obvious power of nostalgia and the (relative) ease of production of such titles, there remains the matter of how often and how severely the gaming industry has changed. What graphics are considered acceptable by the general public, what practices are tolerated regarding downloadable content, what genres see growth, decline, and resurgence, and what platforms games are developed for... All of those things have changed over the years.\n\nSo what separates Axiom Verge from any other genre throwback? What makes it unique?\n\nThese things do:\nThe story of Axiom Verge begins in a manner that is rather typical of comic book/video game science fiction. The protagonist, Trace, is a scientist working on some relatively undefined experiment during the game's opening. The mechanics of what he's doing at the time are irrelevant. What matters is something predictably goes wrong, and through means unknown to him Trace awakens on an alien world, guided by a mysterious voice. From there things become increasingly complicated. The presentation of the story is simplistic, but the story itself is not.\nThe game's art style is knowingly inconsistent, and it uses this to its advantage. The sprite work for the protagonist Trace and many of his enemies is relatively simple, something that is thrown into stark contrast by the game's bosses and several NPCs. The difference is jarring. It's also excellent at ensuring the player feels exactly how bizarre and alien Trace's situation is. Admittedly, I would have preferred the game stuck with its more detailed style throughout, but considering it was developed by one man over years that may not have been feasible.\nAn early power up allows the manipulation of certain aspects of the environment and enemy behavior through essentially "hacking reality". This system could have been used more thoroughly, but works rather well in practice.\nRather than receive many different weapons throughout his adventure, Trace receives (bar certain movement powerups) a single gun that acquires progressively more diverse and complicated bullet patterns. The diversity of combat styles this allows once several bullet types are acquired is one of the game's highlights.\nThings taken for granted in games of Axiom Verge's genre are part of its universe. Save points are an in-universe technology, not a gameplay abstraction, for example.\nThe occasional hidden area is, effectively, a segment of "broken reality", indicated through a scan-line effect over the game's visuals and circuitous layout design.\nAxiom Verge's soundtrack is excellent, both on a technical level and at providing atmosphere.\nThe game has a "speed run mode" built in from the outset that removes all story elements, a nice touch in a genre that frequently lends itself to such challenge runs.\nThose are the game's highlights. What, then, are it's weaknesses?\nWhile the game being created by one man in virtually every aspect is impressive and worth commendation, the development status of the game shows in ways that may not be appealing to everyone. The environments are diverse and interesting, but also primarily prone to simplistic shapes in their design more often than not. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it should be noted.\nAs mentioned above, while the disonnance of the game's multiple sprite work art styles are used to its advantage, it's hard not to imagine how much more effective the game could have been at providing its alien atmosphere if the high level of detail used in bosses was the default.\nSome of the game's secrets are sufficiently obscure that obtaining them without a guide is extremely unlikely. Some might take this as a given considering the game's genre. I found it more annoying than not.\nOutside of the explicitly delivered cutscenes and text boxes, the story is given through the breadcrumbs of in-game notes that can be discovered and eventually translated. The concept is an established one, but remains divisive. I wasn't too fond of how this game handled it.\nAll in all, do I recommend Axiom Verge? Absolutely. It's not by any means perfect, and its weaknesseses and presentation can understandably be divisive. Despite that, the game's strengths make it well worth a purchase for fans of its genre. Even so, watching at least one gameplay video beforehand is recommended. If it's not your thing, it won't be difficult to find out.","January 10","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Axiom Verge takes a lot of your expectations on this style of game, but often has you getting the neccessary results you would in other games (such as reaching a higher location), but has you achieving these through a non-standard means. The story is definitely interesting, there are tons of different items, collectibles, and secret areas to keep you searching, and many of the boss designs are very fun.

If you buy Axiom Verge what you'll find is:\n\n- A Excellent, atmospheric soundtrack\n- A BIG variety of weapons\n- Lots of secrets and power-ups. Some of them optional\n-  nice looking artwork, with very nice spritework, especially the bosses.\n- About 10-15 hours of gameplay with tight controls and excellent gameplay.\n\nWell, what didn't I like?\n- The soundeffects got some HORRIBLE noises. prepare to turn down your headphones.\n- With a few exceptions, the backgrounds are kind of generic.\n-It can be easy to get lost, especially since the in-game marker system is bad as it only allows you to have 2 markers on the map simultaniously. If you're serious about 100% without a guide, be prepared to use notes.\n- While a big arsenal of weapons is good, that many of them quickly becomes obsolete is not good.\n\nUltimatley I'd say that any fan of the genre owe it to themselves to check out the game.

There are plenty already and there is loads of footage on youtube for your viewing pleasure.\n\nIf you're reading this, you are probably somewhat interested by now. What I will say is that as a big fan of Metroidvanias ever since I played Super Metroid as a kid, this game delivers. I don't throw around Super Metroid lightly, that game is still one of the all time greats, not only in its genre, but amongst all games and I consider Axiom Verge to be in the same rank.\n\nI have yet to complete the game, but my experience so far, exploring, collecting weapons and upgrades, trying out new powers in previously seen areas has been a joy. The story so far has me asking myself "WTF!?" and exclaiming "oooooh sheeeeeet!" and I expect there are more twists and turns to come. The graphics are lovely, a really nicely crafted pixel art style with some modern effects and I really like the glitch motif. The soundtrack has a nice moody sci-fi electro vibe (I bought the soundtrack and actually have to stop myself listening to it all the way through as to not spoil the aural aspect of the game). The weapons and upgrades are mostly unique and interesting, some are your standard fare (rapid fire, spread shot, high jump, etc.) others are rarely if ever seen in a game (I don't want to spoil anything). There are however a couple that don't seem to have anything much special over another already equipped weapon (out of the 8/9 weapons I have found, maybe 3 of them seem a little redundant).\n\nAll in all, I am really satisfied with Axiom Verge. If something goes horribly wrong between now and when I complete it, I will update this review, but I can't even imagine how big of a ♥♥♥♥ up would be necessary to diminish the enjoyment I've had so far. If you're looking for a game that is not "just another Metroidvania" but actually a game that can stand next to Super Metroid, this is it.\n\n\nUpdate: I have just completed the game (stats: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=559445841), and I can safely say that it didn't disappoint. Definitely going to replay on hard mode.","November 16, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The environments and atmospheric music taken together really sucked me in.

I was playing at Normal difficulty though, not sure if this happens if you pick the harder difficulty.","February 27","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Making sure realizations happen at the right time. Creating a sense of wonder. Building a world that for some time can contain the fascination of the mind. Axiom Verge creates a definite experience that I greatly enjoyed.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, tried-and-true metroid-style exploration, shooting, and tool-based puzzle solving. If you're new to them, this is a fine game to start with. If you're familiar, Axiom Verge will give you a chance to flex a lot of old muscles, but often in ways that will surprise you.\n\nThe atmosphere is great. Every background, wall  and enemy comes together to create a world that feels both alien and alive. Walls and floors are often constructed of what looks like intestines or pipes of blood, creating the feeling of wandering through a giant monster's innards, which ties in nicely to the story.\n\nAxiom Verge's story does an excellent job of giving meaning to its unsettling aesthetic, and many of the mechanical surprises it has under its hood. In the end, I wish there were a little more of the story, but then, wanting more is usually a sign of a good story.\n\nAxiom Verge creates an experience I enjoyed immeansely and its easily one of the best platformers I've played in years. If you've ever wanted to wander through strange and hostile alien landscapes, or just want to remenisce on the days of the 2D Metroid games, don't miss this one.","February 27","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the first game I ever bothered playing over and over and over and even into the next generation of systems, I'd still boot up the SNES for some metroid play.

Let me go over some things that helped me decide to play the game.\n\nFor a very long time, I haven't played a Metroid game. Not a Metroidvania game, just any Metroid game. When I saw this I instantly thought it wasn't very original from a gameplay stance. However this game isn't just some clone with no personality. Axiom Verge is very different from the rest of its competitors in that it doesn't simply emulate its inspiration, it uses its it as a means to help cement its identity. You play as a scientist, not as some bounty hunter or mercenary, but just as a normal dude. You get thrown into the world of Sudra after an explosion and after very little to no real heavy explanation as to why you are there the game tells you to "explore".\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint the mechanics are solid, and well implemented. The game plays like butter, and it is very challenging. Nothing isn't impossible to overcome, but will take time and persistence. Don't give up.\n\nMy only complaint is that there are too many weapons in this game that are not very useful. I feel like the oversaturation of weapons made collecting them towards the end of the game more like a chore than a reward. However that is soley my opinion.\n\nIf you enjoyed Super Metroid, Zero Mission, or Fusion please do yourself a favor and play this game. It is simply fantastic.\nIf you haven't played the former, do so because those games are awesome too.","February 24","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game offers an arsenal of different weapons a lot of which are situational which means that you will probably not use in addition to a variety of different perks and abilities some of them original others inspired.

From the pixel art, to the weaponry, to the AMAZING music (if you liked the soundtrack from Super Metroid, then you'll dig this too), I find this game really jives artistically.  You'll really appreciate it if you grew up in SNES era, as this title really harkens back to that time.  The controls are well done and so it combat.  Even the story is interesting, if a bit strange at times.\n\nThe one thing I'll criticize here is the lack of direction the game provides you with.  Even in exploration based games like Castlevania or Legend of Zelda, there are usually SOME hints of where to go and what to do.  I have spent hours searching for my next objective.  Some areas are difficult to traverse, and so it gets frustrating when I can't figure out where I should be!  Note that I enjoy explorative games.  I don't enjoy being forced to backtrack repeatedly until I can miraculously find the new area the power up I found an hour ago opens for me.\n\nOverall, still a fun game.

While the controls for certain abilities can be difficult at times, I find everything in this game to be beautiful: the music, the graphics, all of it.

I can't even call this a metroidvania; this game is very unabashedly a Metroid. You know this game already. You probably already LOVE this game... but you have no idea how it ends. Even after deciphering all the codes, it's hard to even tell where it began, and with whom. Was it Queen Elizabeth I? Earlier? Later? You might even begin to question which version of yourself you are, or discover you can't account for a few months of time. Finally, as you start to unravel the fabric of reality, you'll start to see meaning in the scanlines themselves, and begin to believe that you aren't even IN the map.\n\nI would recommend this enchanting combination of retro glitchiness and cthulian insanity easily, without reservation.

This game most certainly nods to the Metroid style of play. You will navigate through the world, gathering power ups and new weapons. Defeat bosses to gain the next big piece of tech that you need to progress to the next few levels (as well as access recently unreachable areas that you have already passed by).\n\nOne of my favourite parts has to be the disrupter. This allows you to alter reality within the game and effectivley "glitch" your enemies into less threatening ones (except bosses.. at least, not in my experience!). There will be sections of the environment itself which you can remove/create with the help of this device. It is a great addition to a gaming style/gaming style whose era is full of unintended glitches, and has more or less become a hobby of most to exploit. Which brings me onto the Speedrun option.\n\nI haven't played the Speedrun yet, but the intentional ability to "Glitch" within the game makes me very excited with this! There is even an achievement if you successfully complete the game in under 4 hours (quite a long way away from my 14 hours to complete - I was trying to be thorough and enjoy the beautifully tiled worlds and well crafted music).\n\nMy experience with this game is fantastic! I just need to find the last few items and areas of the map to be completely satisfied with my play. If you loved the original Metroid games (especially Super Metroid; being my favourite); you should definitely give this game a try!\n\nHands down 10/10 from me","May 21, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't really get the game for the story so I was surprised about it. Nothing groundbreaking that'll make you cry a river or something like that but it's good enough that you'll want to find the lore pieces and learn about it.\nThe game just feels very cool and fun.\n\n- My only complaint is with the soundtrack. It's good, don't get me wrong, but sometimes it can get a bit repetitive if you're like me and like to explore every corner. Also, I wish there was some kind of fast travel (I know there's that "thing" that helps you move through the areas but you still have to backtrack a lot so a waypoint system or something like that would be good) but that's just a personal thing, I guess, because I always explored the whole map as soon as I got a new upgrade and got bored of having to walk all the way.\n\nReally I'm not very good writing reviews but to sum it up:  this is probably the best metroidvania on steam, no doubt.","December 29, 2015","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is the main draw. The 16-bit art would stand on its own as the levels are impossibly detailed and varied - obviously a labor of love. The game also makes great use of digital effects that wouldn't be possible in a strictly 16-bit game but add to the retro feel of the game.

All you remember is there being an explosion in the laser lab you were working in. A mysterious voice tells you that there is a gun in the next room. The way to the right is blocked by Norfair bubbles, so you go left. You grab the gun,  then everything lights up like Super Metroid and you're blasting your way through bubbles and zoomers all over again. You could mistake this game for the next Metroid if your  wasn't wearing a t-shirt.\n\nSo you blast your way along and eventually find yourself in a room with a flying Mother Brain that calls YOU a demon.\n\nLater, you see what appear to be texture glitches.\n\nEverything begins to make sense eventually, don't get me wrong, but I won't spoil any more.\n\nOverall this game is spectacular. A new and innovative Metroidvania that has unusual solutions to problems, a new and sometimes surreal world, good combat, tight controls, and a decent plot.\n\nI am honestly giving this game a 10/10 because there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nIt is a perfect and fresh Metroidvania.\n\nNow stop reading this and go buy it.","July 21, 2015","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love Super Metroid so much that I searched out fan made ROMhacks of the game. One of the best I have found is Super Metroid: Redesign by Drewseph. He changes everything: the physics, the weapons, and game mechanics. It is completely different, but it is still fundamentally Super Metroid.\n\nAxiom Verge is very similar in the regard. The gameplay is different, the physics are different, the weapons are different, the story is different...but it is still fundamentally Super Metroid. Rather, it takes what I love about Super Metroid and distills it into the amazing experience that is Axiom Verge. I cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nIf you like the classic 2D Metroid games, Castlevania games, or even run and gun games like Contra, this game is for you. If you like classic 2D platformers like Mario or Sonic, this game is also for you. If you don't like either of these game types, then this game might not be for you, but I would recommend getting it anyway for one simple reason: Steam offers refunds on games now.\n\nYou have literally nothing to lose if you get the game and immediately dislike it. You can use the refund option. However, I have a feeling that if you get Axiom Verge, you will want to keep it.\n\nThe music is very well written, and one of my favorite things about it is the prevalence of a heavy bass kick in most of the tunes. To me, this is Trace's heartbeat. It increases during boss battles, it decreases during calm areas. Another cool thing is the low health beep. Anyone who has played Zelda of Metroid is familiar with this; it is an annoying, jarring way of telling you that you might die if you don't get health soon. Axiom Verge uses this mechanic, but instead of overriding the music, the low health beep is implemented into whatever song you are listening to. It slows down or speeds up depending on the BPM of the song. The first time I heard it, I was amazed that I hadn't seen that used in any other game I have played as it is such a good way to let you know that you have low health.\n\nThe environments have some areas where the backgrounds have pulsating objects that move to the beat of the music. I am a huge fan of how this is added. It helps to suck me into the game, and make me feel more connected since the music is an integral part of the experience.\n\nThe jumping physics are top notch, and able to offer precise movement control. Some of the upgrades you get are very cool, but I won't go into them since finding them and figuring out what they do is a fun part of the game. There is only one part of the map I am less than impressed with, but that is just because there are a lot of small, white creatures that sort of blend in with the background and can disrupt your jumping if they hit you.\n\nThe difficulty of this game comes in normal mode and hard mode. I finished normal mode in about 10 hours, with something like 80% of the map revealed and 75% of the items found. There is a lot to find, and doing it is fun. There are an amazing amount of weapons that do various things, making some boss fights easier with certain weapons.\n\nOverall, this is an amazingly well made game, which is made even more incredible by the fact that it was made completely by just one man: Thomas Happ. He designed the game, composed the music, and created the story. This game is a huge win for independant developers, as it shows that good things can come to those who work for them.\n\nGet this game. Just...get it. As much as I love Super Metroid - the lonely atmosphere, taking down large boss enemies because Samus is awesomely powerful, the music, the exploration and cycle breaking...I am conflicted to say that this game may even be better than Super Metroid. They are very similar in game type, and this game does so many thing right. Super Metroid and Axiom Verge may have to live in my mind as co-favorite games.\n\nTL:DR Get this game. If you hate it, Steam will refund you. Trust me, you won't hate it.","July 10, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is pretty much a modern version of Metroid 1 with a different story and actors.\nControls are very responsive and a gamepad is a must as the game is also of "classical" difficulty. (I just came from Batman and AC and got a beating)\nThere are a bunch of different guns and you switch them around a lot to deal with the different enemies.\nThe chiptune futuristic soundtrack is also satisfying.\nAs another reviewer mentioned the secrets aren't mapped out for you so you actually have to look for breakable blocks in suspicious areas and dead ends some of which you can easily guess. I don't think that's a bad thing. Using pen and paper might also help.\n\nThe game doesn't come close to Metroid 3 which is still one of the best video games ever despite being from the last millenium but Axiom Verge is very good to play on its own and we're starved for those games on PC anyway.\nAlso one guy made this while Nintendo had hordes of workers.\n\nFans of the genre should absolutely play this.\n\nDon't buy if you're neither persistent nor good at jumpnshoot-games and think metroidvania is about clearing icons from a minimap without effort like with Ubisoft.","February 12","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good, but not perfect. While the inventiveness surrounding a number of the game's mechanics make it an excellent exploration and action game in the vein of classic Metroid that is well worth your time, I feel that there are a number of design flaws that could have made it a lot better.\n\nThe difficulty curve suffers from tremendous spikes towards the end of the game, where enemies hit for massive amounts of damage, so if you haven't been exploring every single nook and cranny, there is no way you will have enough health to take four hits from the shower of bullets late game enemies dish out.\n\nThe way powerups seem to be distributed just comes across as (imo) badly designed sometimes, as many times I had barely survived a rather difficult gauntlet only to find a node piece, or even worse, a note.\n\nAnd yet despite all that, if you enjoyed the early Metroid games, then Axiom Verge is well worth checking out.","February 16","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You may even find randomly placed secret areas unique to your save file that are a blast to seek out and discover.

Axiom Verge is not a new genre touchstone the way, say, La Mulana was.  But it's certainly miles ahead of the rest of the pretenders.\n\nAxiom Verge has unusual items in its library of powerups that do well to reintroduce an element of surprise for people who've played too many of these and know what to look for.  The game also rewards exploration with inventive, purely optional weapons, which is a great improvement over a hundred missile expansions.  Unfortunately all weapons do roughly the same amount of damage, even ones that are awkward to aim, so many are not as good as the default gun.\n\nMetroid was inspired by Alien, and Alien was inspired by H.R. Giger.  Axiom Verge looks back to Giger's works and often feels even more Metroidy than Metroid itself.  It's a great decision, and the game looks gorgeous.\n\nThe game doesn't do anything exciting to enable sequence breaking - some breaks are possible, but it doesn't do anything as bold as Super Metroid's walljump or Bunny Must Die's parrying.  This, and fairly stiff, accelerationless movement controls, probably curtail any hope of it becoming a great game for speedrunning.","July 26, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is excellent, it is so damn good that I bought the soundtrack DLC.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game, is the controll over the grapling hook.

Of which you will find much.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting story\n-Creepy & isolated environment\n-Tight controls\n-Challenging\n\nCons:\n-I would like to decide my allegiance to determine the ending\n-Not enough starting abilities for sequence breakage\n-Too many useless weapons\n\nThe game gives you a variety of abilities to menuever the environment which keeps things interesting especially so for speedrunning. I just wish there were some hidden starting abilities.\n\nWhile there is a lot of weapon variety many of them end up being useless. They don't rack up the kind of damage or range that either the lightning shotgun (the third weapon) and the starting weapon will do.\n\nI was very dissipointed with the ending. I really wanted to have the main character change their mind or find some way to do it, but it appears there is only the one ending where I think the protagonist honestly acted quite foolish which goes against their supposed character of a critically thinking scientist.\n\nBut I can't say to not get this game. It has so much going for it. You will not be dissipointed if you like any similar games. The music at the very least is pretty good and as far as gameplay there are few that are as good in the genre. Get it now! Highly recommended.\n\n\n\nI have a controller that works now, but that does not change the fact that I did originally leave a review that warranted my refund. I still must warn that this game will not work with a variety of Direct Input controllers. That's actually VERY helpful for a developer to know about this issue and yet I got 15 fanboys to say this review was "unhelpful".\n\nAll I have to say to you guys is... do you want to help make the game worse? Do you want less people to play? Really, get a hold of yourselves ya dweebs, complaints are a necessity to improvement & I hope the dev is actually able to see it this time without a brigade of overly defensive fanatics pretending the product is perfect.\n\nOriginal review:\nSadly this game does not support my Mayflash converted Gamecube controller. Works fine in other games, but would not respond in this one. Until I can use my preferred controller I'll be keeping my money. It might be a good game, but I can't play it at all on keyboard so it effectively does not work.","November 14, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story was okay, but the exploration was what drove my interest.\n\nThe game was very good at showing you when you could not enter an area, and could clearly tell another item was needed.\n\nUnlike Metroid (in my experience) the game did not require specific weapons to get to different areas, but instead relied on the secondary equipment that had a focus on mobility.\n\nThe second-last boss was surprisingly difficult (and was practically a bullet-hell game compared to the rest). However, some areas that were difficult to get to were quite important. If one was to get stuck I would recommend  looking up a map or guide to find where areas connect.\n\nPlayed on Windows with the Steam Controller (final two bosses completed with Xbox 360 controller).\n\nNOTE: Some difficulty occurred when configuring the Steam controller (playing via Steam Link). It would always recognize the trigger as the trigger even when the config set it to map to a different button. I assume Axiom Verge hooks in at a lower/earlier level than usual. Luckily the game allows for customising controls in-game.\n\nThe Crunch\n========\nPlaytime: 12h22m\nOS: Windows/Steam Link\nInput: Steam Controller, Xbox 360 Controller\n\nPros:\n- lots of weapons (not tied to enemy/damage types, pick what you like)\n- broke the rules with its movement equipment\n- fitting soundtrack\n- lots to do for completionists (I am not though so this is biased)\n\nCons:\n- Surprisingly difficult/different penultimate fight\n- Didn't show how to get to/where the last few areas were very well.","April 25","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is developed by one of the original metroid creators and the game, map and story shows that. The story is interesting fun to play but the game is difficult for new players to the game and new players to metroidvania games as well. The graphics of the game feel similar to super metroid or similar snes games. The controls for the game are tight and clean with a few expections with certain items like an item you get (spoiler alert) the grappling hook and the coats that you get. Those items are a bit werid to use and annoying at times but overall still fun. The items are spread out evenly through most of map with a only a few expections but that can be overlooked. My main complaint is that there is no clear direction that the game wants you to follow for items to progress the game. This can be annoying for new players but it does help with exploration. Overall the game is fun and if you metroidvania games or like 2D platforming then you will like the game.","March 8","true","45.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But at no time did I ever feel frustrated by it. The game is jam packed with things to find and you will willingly double back over areas that have places which now look suspicious in light of your most recent upgrade (the map marking feature is exceptionally useful here). Discovering new items or getting past a previous obstacles is extremely satisfying - and it happens often!\n\nThe setting is excellent. The game does a great job of building atmosphere through the level design, little bits of lore hidden throughout the map, cutscenes and music. You really do feel like you're alone, trapped on a strange dead alien world, struggling to find answers.\n\nThe story is very compelling. It's delivered in small, short segments which feels like a great choice. The pacing is good and will keep your curiosity piqued as you move forward.\n\nThe graphical style is wonderfully retro. It's pixel art, but it's extraordinarily done. One thing in particular I really love about Axiom Verge is the way it works "glitches" into the world. If you've ever played an old NES game on real hardware, you will immediately notice familiar looking sprite/tile corruptions, flickers, and placement errors. This is done to great effect in this game and it's incredible how it manages to bend them to actually work in a good way!\n\nThe music is perfect.\n\nMy one and only complaint would be the controls are a little tough to get used to at first. I kept finding myself reflexively using the right analog stick expecting to aim while moving. In actuality, no such feature exists. I also found myself frequently clicking the analog stick buttons by mistake and accidentally activating their functions. Not a deal breaker, but again, it does take some getting used to.\n\nI've only just completed my first play through and there is so much left to discover.

Sadly nintendo has lost touch with the series and what made it great, other M while it could have possibly been the perfect re-entry into the series took a few turns which didnt cope well with many gamers and instead of trying to rectify this they shelved the series entirely.

The gameplay is solid enough that I can easily recommend it for anyone that is a fan of metroidvania style games. I'll likely come back and give some final impressions once I finish the game but I highly doubt anything would take away my recommendation of the game.\n\nWhat really pulls this game together, however, is the amazing soundtrack and delightfully surreal landscapes. There's a lot of variety to be found in the visuals and each new area was a marvelous experience taking in the environment and new enemies. Exploration is definitely the highest mark of Axiom Verge.\n\nWhile the gameplay is solid and holds up, a lot of the unique features (Such as the address disrupter/glitch gun, glitching through walls, etc.) are little more than a novel way to substitute locked doors. I've been told that they're more prominant when searching for some of the more obscure secrets, but as far as shuffling through the story they haven't been more than ways around simplistic roadblocks.\n\nDifficulty feels okay for the most part. Environmental difficulty actually feels perfect, but bosses thus far have felt a bit on the easy side.

Suffice it to say, we haven't seen, and won't be seeing, a Metroid game for quite some time, and that's a real shame because there's something about that mix of being stuck on an alien world alone with hundreds of aliens that want to eat you, and collecting upgrades to explore a labarynthian planet while blowing up your enemies that just so intoxicating. I'm not ashamed to say that I don't completely understand why Metroid is such a captivating game, but the whole point of this paragraph is to tell you that if something captures it, it's this game.\n\nAxiom Verge scratches the itch I have for a new Metroid game so very well, and tows you along with an intriguing story that you'll piece together as you explore the mystery of Axiom Verge's world. In some respects, it outperforms the original model with new ideas and a huge array of weapons to pick from, provided you take the time to find them, and provides you with plenty of challenge with tough enemies and frantic boss battles, while rewarding you for poking your head into the nooks and crannies of the pulsing, decrepid terrain you walk upon. This game understands what makes the Metroid genre good and you'll know within an hour of playing that it's no mere copycat.\n\nIf you like Metroid and are itching for something that captures the essence of it, this is the perfect game.

H.R. Giger!) and the biomechanoid sirens that urge the "hero" on.","May 12","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of which you will find much.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting story\n-Creepy & isolated environment\n-Tight controls\n-Challenging\n\nCons:\n-I would like to decide my allegiance to determine the ending\n-Not enough starting abilities for sequence breakage\n-Too many useless weapons\n\nThe game gives you a variety of abilities to menuever the environment which keeps things interesting especially so for speedrunning. I just wish there were some hidden starting abilities.\n\nWhile there is a lot of weapon variety many of them end up being useless. They don't rack up the kind of damage or range that either the lightning shotgun (the third weapon) and the starting weapon will do.\n\nI was very dissipointed with the ending. I really wanted to have the main character change their mind or find some way to do it, but it appears there is only the one ending where I think the protagonist honestly acted quite foolish which goes against their supposed character of a critically thinking scientist.\n\nBut I can't say to not get this game. It has so much going for it. You will not be dissipointed if you like any similar games. The music at the very least is pretty good and as far as gameplay there are few that are as good in the genre. Get it now! Highly recommended.\n\n\n\nI have a controller that works now, but that does not change the fact that I did originally leave a review that warranted my refund. I still must warn that this game will not work with a variety of Direct Input controllers. That's actually VERY helpful for a developer to know about this issue and yet I got 15 fanboys to say this review was "unhelpful".\n\nAll I have to say to you guys is... do you want to help make the game worse? Do you want less people to play? Really, get a hold of yourselves ya dweebs, complaints are a necessity to improvement & I hope the dev is actually able to see it this time without a brigade of overly defensive fanatics pretending the product is perfect.\n\nOriginal review:\nSadly this game does not support my Mayflash converted Gamecube controller. Works fine in other games, but would not respond in this one. Until I can use my preferred controller I'll be keeping my money. It might be a good game, but I can't play it at all on keyboard so it effectively does not work.","November 14, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
