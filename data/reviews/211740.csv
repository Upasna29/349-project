HUGE levels, superb use of audio and light.   It is so much fun I quickly forgot about the 10-year-old graphics (and I believe there are mods for correcting that now).\n\nThis game isn't linear or easy.   Loot quotas force you to explore your surroundings and it rewards the observant with many a secret stash or alternatve point of entry.\n\nThere is some slog in the middle as the thief universe has always had a mystical bent that I could do without and the last level can get very frustrating but that didn't stop me playing it through twice in a row.\n\nWhat really sells me in the end is I *feel* like a proper thief when I play this.

Thief II: The Metal Age (the sequel to the critically-praised Thief: The Dark Project) brings players back into the world of master thief Garrett, this time with a bunch of new missions and antagonist in the form of Karras, the leader of the Mechanists.\n\nThe one thing I loved most about this game was that the scale just felt bigger in (almost every way). While I still have an issue with the fact that roughly half the levels are strictly linear, the missions that open up to you (like "Stonemarket First Bank", "Life of the Party" and "Masks") offer a wide array of alternate routes and secret passages to accomplish your goals, as well as give a far grander sense of the City and the threat Karras poses to its inhabitants.\n\nLikewise, the variety of weapons and items you can acquire is great and allows for lots of experimentation, although (since I'm a purist) I still stuck to water arrows for the majority of the game.\n\nAdmittedly, I found much more joy in the levels where I could pick off guards at will with hit-and-run tactics. I think it's fair to say that the AI in this game alternates between hypersensitive and woefully inept. When the guards aren't aggro-ing on you from far distances, they're complete morons in combat. It is exceptionally easy to take advantage of the combat system. When a sword-wielding guard runs at you, walk backwards and swing like mad, or circle-strafe and hit his back. Bow-wielders are an automatic win - just mash the attack button if you get one cornered. The only real challenge came from the Mechanist robots and groups of enemies, which sometimes stacked up in doors and got stuck or ran around the mansion in the "Masks" mission chasing me (all that was missing was the Benny Hill music).\n\nLikewise, the voice acting is either really good (in the case of Garrett's voice actor and some of the minor antagonists) or near-laughable (the nobles, who sound like they're reading from a script). I couldn't take Karras seriously as a villain because of his nasally voice, which made me laugh more than get freaked out whenever I heard his voice.\n\nI vaguely remembered a lot of buzz and praise for "Life of the Party", which sees Garrett take to the rooftops to rob every building in sight and infiltrate Karras' tower, Angelwatch - and that mission did not disappoint. Easily the best in the game, it had everything I consider to be so great about the genre - lots of expansive areas and alternate routes to take, lots of secrets and hidden goodies to find, great level design, the works. I wish more of the missions had those kinds of additional areas or features to make them worth replaying, because I didn't feel much compulsion to go back and do much besides replay the missions that were either "loot everything" or "steal and/or kill everything".\n\nAll in all, though, Thief II is still a standout in the stealth genre. I haven't played Deadly Shadows yet (as of this writing), but the improvement in scope in this game makes me excited to see what's next.","March 14, 2014","true","28.0"," 55 of 59 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","55","59","0","2"

I was born too late to have experienced the theif series in it's prime. But even to me, a series newcomer, this game has more than stood the test of time.\nPros:\n+ Garret is a great protagonist.\n+ Amazing stealth gameplay\n+ With an HD texture pack installed, the game is still atmospheric 15 years after it's release.\n+ Great steampunk setting\n+ Father Karras is a great antagonist\n+ Humanized enemy guards with their own worries, lives and dreams, a rarity today. Makes you feel awful about killing them more than any forced karma system ever could.\n+ Encourages acutally going through a level without anyone noticing you, rather than the modern approach of (pick off guards one by one do it do it do it)\n+ Huge expansive levels with tons of little details and secrets.\n+ Combat is incredibly difficult when directly confronting guards. and thats a good thing.\n+ the material the floor is made of, and how loud your footsteps would be on it, is a huge gameplay mechanic.\n+ Voice acting is pretty great considering how old the game is.\nCons:\n- while dated voice acting is to be expected, some of the voices are pretty awful even by early 2000s standards. Mostly the female ones.\n- Inventory wheels can be intensely frustrating when you have to switch items quickly.","February 3, 2015","true","22.7"," 44 of 44 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","44","44","0","0"

I spent many, many hours looking for hidden loot and secrets while trying to kill nobody. This game highly rewards the non-confrontational type of players and stealthy manuevers gives an immense amount of satisfaction for doing so. There are many new toys for Garrett to play with in these huge mission areas and also some of the encounters are hilarious. The story was amazing; I will not dive in but it has great morals and a few familiar faces will be present. Once again the sound is spot on whether Garret is going down a steep hill or a long climb everything syncs pretty greatly, not to mention the music is very fitting and adds to the overall atmosphere.\n\nOn a side note the visuals in this game can be somewhat bland but in my opinion that is no reason to bring the score down since there are so many amazing modders that keep this game running on par with some games today!!!\n\nPersonal score: 9.8\nplay Thief Gold before Thief Metal Age","July 2, 2014","true","32.2"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","42","45","0","0"

It starts out small, with you simply trying to get some money to live by, and suddenly you're in an epic, fighting for your, and everyone elses, life.\n\nCombined with the first, and the third game (ignore the fourth), this game not only gives you a lovely story for each one, but the games complete eachother completely.\nYou go full circle.\n\nThese games deal with what happens when extremes get the upper hand. What you think is evil, might not be, and what you think is good, is not certain to be. When neither exists, that might prove to be even worse. Everything needs a balance.\n\nThat is what the thief games, as a whole (ignore the fourth), deals with. That is what they put you in the middle of.\n\nSeriously...\nThis game... no, not only this one. The first 3, are my favorite games of ALL TIME. I've played alot of games. I've put countless of hours into games of all forms. This serie is my top choice.\n\nDo you like a good story? How about sneaking? Stealing stuff?

No problem! Here's a bank for you to rob! No, seriously, you rob a ♥♥♥♥ing bank and that's not even the best mission!

I cannot sit still in one place for very long if there isn't something going on to entertain me, and I get really antsy waiting for even a short amount of time. I'm also very bad at sneaking around. I would often try and sneak up on family members just for fun to startle them, but they'd always notice me, and often they'd beat me to the punch. With that said, Thief II is my favorite game of all time. Yes. A game as slow-paced and patience-testing as this one, which relies on you being very good at stealthing around to pass the levels even on normal difficulty, is my favorite game of all time, and also the only one I began again immediately after finishing for the first time. That should say everything you need to know about how perfectly designed this game is. I could talk about the absolutely gargantuan levels that reward exploration, or the deep gameplay with a huge variety of tools and ways of approaching any situation, or the amazing story, featuring excellent, writing, voice acting, and one of gaming's best protagonists and most underrated antagonists, but really, what else do you need to know? Thief II had the misfortune of coming out the same year as Deus Ex, and was thereby overshadowed (no pun intended). While it still sold well in it's day, it's fallen under a lot of people's radars over the years. Fix that. Get this game. Be it Steam, GOG, or physical CD, there is no excuse for any gamer not to have this in their collection. Go. NOW.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention this game also has fantasic sound design.

Bar none.  No game before or since can compare to the immersiveness of this game and it's fine-tuned mechanics.  It manages to mix the fantasy, strategy and adventure aspects of the first with a more prescient storyline than the first Thief game.  The first game was an excellent stealth game that occasionally drifted too far into Tomb Raider territory with it's platformy style missions, devious traps and creature threats.  The fact that Eidos was the publisher of both Thief and Tomb Raider, and that one of the missions had you raiding an underground tomb frought with booby traps and monsters, ought to tell you something.  Thief 2 , thankfully, focuses on the strengths of the stealth system and makes that the core of the game and not just an aspect of it.  That's not to say you won't be jumping across ravines and encountering creatures, but the heist-pulling, pick-pocketing and blackjacking really comes into thier own in Thief 2.  I've read that the developers created the missions of the first game to suit the plot, while the missions of the second were produced first with the plot retrofitted.  In any case, the levels are larger and more complex than the first.\n\nThe graphics had gotten a slight bump from the first game with higher poly models, better texturing and weather effects.  They even added dithering to the hardware renderer, which was a nice addition.  It did have the effect of dampening the deep shadows that were such a part of the first game, but it generally made the game more pleasing to the eye.\n\nThe sound design is, again, excellent.  Sound propagation is one of the core facets of gameplay.  Listening to footsteps draw near or fade into the distance allow you to judge from your hiding place in the shadows whether or not you can risk stepping into lit areas.  Leaning against doors to listen to conversations or the presence of sounds in the next room allow you to determine if opening a door is wise or not.  Sound is fundamental to this game.  You will not be able to play this game successfully while blasting Megadeth or Slayer.  Just not happening.  And that's one of the things that makes this game so damn immersive.  You are literally concerned with the environment both visually and aurally at all times.  It sucks you in.\n\nThere are some new gadgets in this game.  Garrett lost an eye in the first game, and that has been replaced by a mechanical eye that can zoom in and out like a telescope.  A new object called the Scouting Orb allows you to take a peak over walls or around corners without exposing yourself.  There are also new potions and a new arrow:  the vine arrow.  Similar to the rope arrow, but it can "stick" to things rope arrows can't, like metal gratings.\n\nThe design went from a predominantly dark age style steampunk in Thief 1 to a predominantly Victorian era style steampunk in Thief 2, in much of it's architecture.  Actually, art deco also makes an appearance as part of the design of buildings operated by a faction that's new to Thief 2, the Mechanists.   The European old world oozes in these games.  In fact, many of the textures from Thief 1 and Thief 2 were from photos of architecture taken by the developers while vacationing in Europe.   The overall design is pretty immaculate.\n\nThe first two Thief games share a cult status, along with System Shock2 (uses the same game engine and made by some of the same people), as games of remarkable vision and quality.  They are all lauded as excellent games by the gaming press and continue to make the top # lists.  The gameplay transcends gaming.  To play this game is to embark on an existential and  metaphysical experience.  This game seems to attract a higher-brow gaming audience.  There is a community forum that has been the stomping grounds of its players since the games were released.  They have created hundreds of fan missions to play; you can find it here:  http://www.ttlg.com/forums/forum.php\n\nHere you can get a community made patch that updates the rendering of the game and allows for some nice effects, like bloom, while also fixing a number of leftover bugs:  http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=131106\n\nHere you can get a high resolution patch that updates some models, textures and also adds a numbder of new effects to the game:  http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=144312\n\nHere you can read about and find fan missions to play:  http://www.ttlg.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=100","September 19, 2014","true","36.9"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

To summarize, you play as master thief Garret (voiced by the great Stephen Russel) who is trying to unravel The City's new religious order, The Mechanists (the replacement of the first game's Hammerites, who believed in the Creator and that industrial construction was the way to keep evil influences, such as the Trickster (a Pan-esque God who worships chaos and nature) at bay. If you don't understand you should check out the first game, it's great!) and their leader, Father Karras, the likes of which are inventing new mechanical innovations in security and industry (robot guards, cameras,etc).\n\nThe core stealth gameplay is still here from Thief 1, with the ability to deal with guards either lethally or nonlethally (avoiding or blackjacking them) and either playstyles are sufficiently suitable for every mission. This is primarily because the level design in Thief 2 (like its predecessor) contains many hidden paths and secrets to find and explore to deal with mission objectives and secure the most amount of loot possible. Also with new items such as invisibility potions and old ones such as noisemaker arrows (used to distract guards and clear paths), as previously stated, both playstyles are equally supported in the game.\n\nThe stealth mechanics are still as great as the first game, with the "light gem" still in effect( flashing white if you are visible; dark if you are not), the ability to lean around corners to see guards/ cameras/etc. and the aforementioned items to facilitate being stealthy. One improvement I loved from Thief 2 is the change of setting for the missions, from looting ancient crypts and supernatural dimensions( still awesome but not very thief-like) to looting actual mansions and houses (especially the amount of loot in every level, with multiple areas to scour and explore). And whilst these houses and mansions may not look too good, i feel the art style has a certain charm to it.\n\nAnother reason why i enjoy this game? Its story and atmosphere, Garret's tale and The City's backstory is thoroughly established in the pre mission cutscenes and books and texts found throughout levels. And the game's soundtrack is simply amazing, with chilling sweeping synths and general dark tones, the game's soundtrack gives the player a sense of always being watched, of potentially being hunted down, which gives the game's world such a distinctive feeling of ambience and general eerieness. But these are just my thoughts so feel free to check this amazing game out if you'd like, but I'd recommend checking out the first game beforehand, then diving into The Metal Age's world.","December 7, 2014","true","71.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

This game will not hold your hand at all; there are no objective markers, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t x-ray vision that pervades modern stealth games, and no option to play like it's a generic shooter. The game is very non-linear, with multiple pathways and options for stealth, and even some secret passages for one with a clever mind and sharp eye. The ultimate goal, however, always remains the same: steal some priceless artifact and escape, leaving no trace.\n\nThe few downsides I can think of with this game just stem from it's age: the graphics are very dated, and the AI isn't very advanced, but the latter can be negated by thinking that the game's main challenge comes from the environment, not the guards. In addition, the Dark Engine that this game runs on is a little buggy, especially when it comes to dismounting from a ladder and climbing up objects, but it shouldn't impede your enjoyment too much.\n\nIf you enjoyed Dishonored (which was inspired by the Thief franchise) or the real Splinter Cell games (the series up until Double Agent), you can't go wrong with this game.","February 7, 2014","true","51.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","3"

Thief Gold is a masterpiece but at times it feels as though it isn't sure what it wants to be. is it a stealth game? is it a horror game? is it an exploration game? is it a game about stealing ♥♥♥♥?\n\nit's essentially all of these things. mostly just stealing ♥♥♥♥, though.\n\nThief II does a far better job of merging together all these genres. it IS a stealth game. it IS a horror game. it DOES feature a lot of exploration. all of these elements weave together in a super cohesive and enjoyable experience. it never gets stale.\n\nif Thief Gold is a flawed gem, Thief II is a flawless one. please buy it. please play it.","December 28, 2015","true","99.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The game mechanics just work and there is a dark, unique humour and fine attention detail in every aspect of the game making it a perfect example of a time when developers were more concerned with making an enjoyable game for the player over one that would appeal to the masses and therefore sell well. This point is further shown by the fact that the original developer, Looking Glass Studios, went bankrupt after releasing this game, yet this game and it's predecessor are still considered beloved classics while the future games in this series, created individually by Eidos and Square Enix, are widely recognised as terrible and failures and I must say I totally agree.

I just deided to play Thief 2 again after buying it on Steam. WOW is it different than "THIEF" (the newest one, not part of the original trilogy). It's in a league of its own. Strategy, timing, and pure stealth are key in the Thief trilogy. The graphics are very much outdated, but it is still a ridiculously immersive game, partly because the creators put a LOT of time into sounds. This was also true in the first one, Thief: The Dark Project. When you're getting your bearings and trying to find a safe time to move (which is a constant throughout the game), listening is key. If you have a busy or otherwise noisy household, you're gonna have a hard time playing this game. It is absolutely reliant upon being able to listen closely to the movements of nearby NPCs, and sometimes the spoken hints as you're listening to their conversations.\n\nTo make Thief 2 even better, it not only has zombies sometimes like Thief 1, but it also has "metal beasts" -- creations of the Mechanists (a splinter of the Hammerite cult), which are creepy in their own way, but also very hard to kill if you find yourself in that position.\n\nI miss games back in the day. In the bank level, the first time I played it, it took me just over 4 hours to beat. That's just one of many levels. What made so many older games awesome was that some games had absolutely gargantuan levels, and in the Thief trilogy they had a dozen ways of being completed, increasing replayability, whereas games today tend to be so linear, with the exception of a rare few.\n\nEnjoy it!","September 6, 2014","true","47.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Shortly after its release, I rebuilt my PC and dove in. The graphics were much improved from the first games, and the story was even better. The missions were even more expansive this time, and replaying the game always led to finding something new.\n\nWhat made this game even more brilliant, was the opening of the Dark Engine to the users who wanted to mod/level build. Looking Glass Studios closed shortly after the release of Thief II and the sequel wasn't produced until 2004. In that period of downtime, hundreds of new, fan-made, missions were created and distributed in online communities like the Circle of Stone and Shadow. Some were better than others. And just a few may have been better than the game itself. In fact, one of the fan missions was so good, the developer was hired by Eidos to work on Thief III. Moreover, some fan mission developers ended up joining forces to release their own, unofficial sequel named Thief2x.\n\nThe game itself had its own replay value, but the fans who made these missions and mods increased the value tenfold.\n\nThief II is a must play.

It's stealth mechanics make use of both light and sound which is pretty amazing for a game that came out in 2000. It also features a great story with possibly the coolest main character of any videogame series out there, Garrett.  Voiced by an awesome dude called Stephen Russell, Garrett is a sarcastic thief whose commentary you hear throughout the entire game and it is a joy to listen to. You might know Stephen Russell from the game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" where he voices a large number of characters including the leader of the Thieves Guild, Mercer Frey, which is a nice nod to the Thief series.\nUnlike it's predecessor, "Thief: The Dark Project" (AKA "Thief Gold"), Thief 2  knows what it wants to be, a stealth game, and ditched all the combat focused, "Tomb Raider-esque" missions that were so prevalent in it's predecessor, making it the superior title. Large open levels, even more tools than the first one, amazing atmosphere, a great stealth system, and awesome sound design make "Thief II: The Metal Age" the holy grail of stealth games.","March 12, 2014","true","143.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That's because I just recently got it to work with steam on a 16:9 resolution and I already beat it several times over way back in the day on windows 98. This gameplay time is currently subject to change whenever I can get the time to beat this game again.\n\nThief 2 is a good sequel to a stealth masterpiece. The map design is much more focused and much more clearly defined than in Thief Gold, which makes for some mildly streamlined but much more sensible map design than in the first; This also introduces entirely new gameplay mechanics (Literally) such as security cam operated sentry guns and robots which lore wise are explained rather well.\n\nDevelopers of the world, this is how you do difficulty modes right.\n\nEach difficulty can add new objectives and higher difficulties make the sword a detriment to your inventory as you will often auto-fail a mission for killing someone; You must instead use a blackjack that only works when an enemy is unaware of your presence, which admittedly is sort of broken when you learn how to lean in and blackjack effectively from the shadows. Personally I think it adds to the game to be able to lean in and blackjack, it's a fun abuse of gameplay mechanics, like Bunnyhopping.\n\nThe sound design is masterfully crafted and unrivalled (for the most part) even today; you're going to want to get a good sound card and some plugins to emulate EAX to really get the proper effect of it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E0sXdX-Bc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ng_bGozSo\n\nBoth Thief Steam releases come with an outdated version of ddfix which allows a few graphical enhancements such as modern resolutions and bloom injection but since the version that comes with the steam release is outdated your game will likely crash immediately upon using a 16:9 resolution in cam.cfg. It's moderately difficult to find the latest version so I'm going to save you the trouble and directly link it.\n\nhttp://rapidlibrary.biz/source.php?file=ulzq8ez8qri89on&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjermi.dyndns.org%2F~jermi%2Fddfix%2Fddfix_1.5.12.zip&sec=893b4f3af5fae4c1\n\nJust drop this into your Thief directory where your .exe is and using notepad++ to modify that to whatever graphical improvements you desire, though personally I think bloom looks terrible in any game, let alone injected into one. So i'd just leave it alone and modify cam.cfg so that game_screen_size is 1920 1080 if you're using a 1080p monitor.

For one the world is now further fleshed out into a fantasy/steampunk experience (you face enemies like steam powered robots and cameras).\n\nIt also streamlined a lot of the other elements to the game. In Thief 1 you were required to tango with enemies like zombies and flesh eating monsters. Wheras in Thief 2 for the most part your missions don't usually extend very far from being stealing something from a bunch of guys. Of course your objectives in Thief 2 are often very unique. One of which on it's hardest difficulty doesn't allow you to even knock anyone out during a mission due to raising suspicion.\n\nThief 2 isn't for everyone, if you liked the original Thief 2 is the next best thing.

At the core it uses same mechanics and even same techonology of engine as the original, so some might think of it as expansion pack. Yet it's upper level of design is different, being designed like a proper stealth game and having more steampunk setting.\n\nAlso, yea, you probably heard that this version doesn't have credits music. It's not a false statement, but it's not suppose to have one to begin with. It's just that localizator of German version decided to add some song from some German band. Doesn't sound Thief-like at all.\n\nTechnically, it's released as-is and thus has some problems. Like, it doesn't support widescreen resolution or anything more than 800x600.\nI think that just like with Thief 1 on Steam, to see cutscenes you have to run .exe file with admin rights. But I think it already does it?\nI also noticed that the gamma slider doesn't work either. And in this one I felt that the game is way too dark by default. Or maybe Thief 1 is the one which is too bright. Not sure.\nAlso, yea, enable fogging in options, it's art-improving graphic option, not "hide things if far away".\n\nThen again, you probably should use one of a community patches. Not sure how much do they change, I was there for Vanilla experience, but people love those, so.\n\nPlot once again follows our cynical thief by the name of Garrett in the mysterious City. In the first game he had to destroy the Trickster, god of Pagans house of nature, who wished to destroy everything man-build. This heroic deed shifted the balance of powers toward the path of progress, to a dawn of the twisted Metal Age. Pure fantasy elements and monsters are almost not seen, The City is being cleaned by the City Watch and a new Mechanists sect emerges out of Hammerite house to lead the age.\n\nAnd yea, the story continues, as everything here shifts to steampunk and Victorian setting. And Thief is focusing more on just being a thief, rather than adventurer. No more adventure, you now have big houses and mansion to rob and even your maps are always accurate and provide good description to let you. It even feels less linear due to this, albeit actual levels are less dragged due to less maze-like qualities and less of fetching and puzzles. But hey, this is what people expect Thief to be.\n\nAnd it futher embraces the fact that it's more focused on stealth. You got new tools of trade, like Invinsibility potions, slow-fall one. There is a scouting orb that you can throw anytime and see from it's point of view, which I always forget to use even though AI never notices this so there is no good reason not to. Remember kids - don't be like me, that's not smart choice.\nYou can now lean into door to eaversdrop. Guards pretty much always mumble something to themselves, futher giving you audio hints. Some rare guards even wear special helmets that you can't blackjack them. Althrough they are so rare that I don't remember any such encounter. There are even occasional patrol that have more than one person.\n\nAnd it's a Metal Age that we are talking about, with Mechanists bringing new toys to watch out. There are surveliance camera, security systems and robots, which can be divided into huge dangerous robot that can't hear and small robot that can only warn others, but only after first hearing you, activating their vision and seeing you. All mixed with humans, giving more stealth-focused variety instead of monsters. All while you are cracking the bank level with it's ceramic tiles and three floors of complexity.\n\nAlbeit, it does mean that it lost some of the charm. There isn't much of wonderful immersive mystery that made me fall in love for Thief. That, and I am not fan of this theme, it's just feels too Victorian. It mostly has to do that it actually lost some gameplay variety. There is only so much mansion that you can crack at before it gets a bit old. Which isn't to say that there is no rare mission which goes out of this style. And it also varies the stealth objective that you have, even having this single awesome police station mission where you actually supposed to ghost due to knockouts limit. And it has this awesome mission where you travel on rooftops of a city.\n\nBut I still can't help but to feel monotomy setting after the half of a game. After all, it still ends up too much with you blackjacking everybody you come across. Or maybe it's because of the plot. It starts nicely, with some conspiracy going on, but soon it's all same grey Mechanics, Mechanics, Mechanics, who lack some charm. Even though their leader is kinda awesome and robot carry it along, but the environment gets you after a while.\nThat, and I am still dissapoint that the plot didn't explore relationship between Hammerites and Mechanics. At least I never seen any actual conflict. Kinda hoped to see the clash of ideals ever since I overheard one of the very rare Hammerites complained in the second level. But oh well.\n\nThat, and in the last one third of a game it simply farts out. I don't know, it feels like the quality and excitement suddenly drops. Then again, Looking Glass studios was in deep financial trouble and was rushing out, I bet this is the impact to it. The Kidnap level is both boring looking and boring to play, in a cave with more mechanists, where you run all over the place to find the needed NPC. Not to mentioning that I had sudden framedrop because of some trouble with AI pathfinding, until I found the guard who was hogging game up.\n\nThen you have two levels in a row that take place in same mansion, in both cased you enter it and exit in. The thing is that the first level of it feels like an earlier development version of the level, while the second time around it doesn't differenate enough to hold interest. Like plot-wise you sneak in to find a secret stairway toward the third floor so you knew where it is to snack masks on next day. After that you are supposed to leave yet you can venture futher into the third floor where you find many glitchy things, with flying decorations, misaligned models and you can even steal the already-present masks, but no one will care. As if you aren't supposed to be there.\n\nFinal level isn't bad though, at least on second try when I learned how to exploit big robots into blowing up themselves. And when I knew to take it slowly. Kinda like a little nightmare of steel, albeit I can see how some may decide that it goes too long, as well as being a challenge course. It's actually is quite awesome. But then the ending feels dissapointnig. It leaves you with no satisfication of victory and doesn't hype you up for next title. Just ends immeditly, with no music. Unlike the perfect Thief 1 ending.\n\nBut hey, I don't think that the main point of the games lies in ending. I would say that the Thief 2 is more than worth beating, even if it leaves you a bit sour. It's a Thief game, the one with complex levels, no hand-holding and more focus on stealth. And even though stealth core gameplay is still a bit on simple side, knocking everybody out, despite having excellent audio design that futhers gameplay, it's still a greatly enjoyable game.","March 7","true","23.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But I can safely say that these games honestly do still hold up today.\n\nPros:\n- Light/Dark system is a great mechanic and leads to the player paying more attention to their environment.\n- Static map, some areas are missing and without an all encompassing minimap you are forced to be more cautious, unsure of what lies around each corner and this adds to the games'  tense atmosphere.\n- Your footsteps become louder when walking on harder floors such as marble, adds depth and makes you more observant of your surroundings.\n- No zombies or supernatural elements (preference).\n- Excellent level design, navigating is not a problem despite not having a full map or quest markers. This is because the levels are designed logically (as though they were not designed just for a game but to serve the purpose of the building e.g a mansion)  and loot is distibuted accordingly, e.g you can safely assume that there will be little to no loot in the servants quarters, but there will more than certainly be something valuable in the nobles quarters.\n- Tells the story through level design and gameplay instead of directly through a cutscene or text.\n- You can't choose to go in all guns blazing, you die quickly (2 sword hits) and thus feel more vunerable and this creates tension. You aren't invincible, their is no second option to just fight your way in. Only through the patience and intelligence of the player can Garrett succeed, as you play you become a better thief- not through "levelling up"- you are never given any notification of your progress by the game (this is a good thing), Garrett stays his same vunerable self throughout the whole game, but you the player learn how to handle yourself: which areas are low/high risk, when to blackjack guards, where to hide etc ... This is extremely rewarding as by the end of the game you (the player) have gone from an amateur burgalar to a masterthief, this progression of the player instead of the character is extremely rewarding and makes you feel like you are truly getting more skillful- this progression is expressed not through a number or a level and Garrett doesn't become more powerful as you play, your growth is shown in the way you play the game.\n- Amazing soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n- May be too dark and hard too see for some.\n- Not the greatest voice acting.\n- Graphics whilst not awful do not compare with those of newer titles.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to experience this masterpiece.","December 30, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It would sadly be their last ever game as financial problems would see the studio close 2 months later.\n\nThief 2 is everything you could possibly ask for in a sequel; tighter and much larger level design, deeper exploration of the characters, a tighter and a more coherent atmosphere and an enthralling story of an unlikely alliance solving a twisting and evolving mystery that threatens to destroy The City and beyond.\n\nOnce again, Garrett is the unlikely hero of the tale. Stealing to survive and slinking through the shadows are a daily fact of life for him; Getting to the truth, whilst stopping to line his pockets along the way.\n\nYou'll be exploring nobleman's estates, police stations, banks, cathedrals and even The Thieves' Highway. All the while, the atmosphere and storytelling will keep you on your toes and keep your mind sharp. The environments in Thief 2 are much bigger and much more detailed than the first game and gone are the vast majority of undead, haunted crypts and tombs the first game contained.\n\nYou'll also have some new gear to play with in Thief 2; Slow-fall potions, expensive and rare invisibility potions, flash mines and 'The Eye', which I won't go into much detail about, as well as others.\n\nThief 2 is also more challenging than the first game. Higher difficulty levels will, in some cases, require you to leave very little or, in one case, zero trace of your presence behind in one or two levels. This will require you to think ahead even more about what to expect; a tense but rewarding experience.\n\nThis game the peak of the Thief series so far, the graphics are much improved over the first game and the story, whilst having a satisfying conclusion, left the door wide open for a Thief 3 that would never arrive from the studio that started it all.\n\nSo Adiós Looking Glass. You created amazing experiences, stories and gameplay long before it was the norm in gaming as we know it today and even now, studios are still playing catchup to you.\n\nThe game is very mod friendly. You can find texture packs and graphical upgrades out there. If you need help setting up the game, you can read this guide here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113169312\nObviously, I'm going to recommend the hell out of this game if you want a gaming experience that will live long in the memory!","April 19, 2013","true","54.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A genuinely intriguing story moves things along between missions and whether by experience or design I feel every bit as challenged while feeling like a more capable thief. A much improved map is still reasonably vague while giving you a much better idea of your location so it doesn't feel so daunting to navigate levels.\n\nI find myself playing with the guards, looting rooms far out of the way or after every objective is cleared for the thrill of the theft.

More enemies, more open levels, better envoirments and slightly improved gameplay. It also has more gadgets like invisibility potion, which can come handy sometimes.\n\nI've didin't expected this game to be what it is, it's a perfect sequal with changes, but not tragic ones which would ruin it. The envoirments are amazing and you even get to walk into woods in one level. Furthermore, the  gameplay and visuals are pretty much the same, it looks good for it's age, when i was playing this in 2000 then it would be the game with the best graphics ever, but nowadays if people play this they are to blind to see how old this game actually is and that that is the reason why it looks so ''bad'', while it in fact looks amazing.\n\nSo, the theme is really cool, with metal robots and stuff. I've had a good nearly 8 hours in this game, i've could finish it more quickly because i learned a lot from Thief Gold if it comes to actually playing this game the right way. The ending of this game was exciting:  all the deaths.. 'all...as it was written'\n\nAn all-time classic perfect game. A must buy. It's a steal for the price it's on Steam right now.. so, go ahead..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/211740/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","Next in line in the Thief series, here I am. I have never played any of the games of Thief, though I have always wanted to. I just finished the first game and wrote a review for it, and now have finished the second. The very first Thief disappointed me very much, but that was all due to the level design, which ruined the whole experience for me. However, I was still greatly interested in the world's atmosphere and story, so I was hopeful with this game and came in with a neutral outlook.\n\nThief II greatly increased my expectations through the first two-thirds of the game, but quickly disappointed me again with the last 5 missions and the ending. Firstly, just to brush through everything else, as I don't need to say much more here than I did with the first Thief:\n\n+ The story and the atmosphere given by it is just as engaging.\n+ The graphics were better than the first game's, and the world mostly looked like it was put together better in each level. The cinematics were pretty much the same in style, however.\n+ Garrett is still just as likable of a character!\n+ The sound effects are mostly similar, and the voice acting is still well done, except for Karras, which I will go into more detail later.\n+ The gameplay mechanics are mostly the same as well, not too much new, though I enjoyed things like the robotic cameras you can throw.\n\nIn the end, most of the above is rather the same, though slightly improved in one way or another. Nothing too drastically new in those areas... but the level design, now that was so much better! Based on the first two-thirds of the game, I have to say that the levels were (mostly) great, so much better than 90% of the levels in the first game.\n\nThe first level was an interesting start, especially neat for clearing a path for an NPC. The second, however, was pretty bad and generic again, scaring me that the game would be the same. The storage area was nothing special, and the design of having to repeatedly go to the office, punch in a code, and go back out so many times was just bad.\n\nBut afterwards, the game picked back up very well. I liked every mission up to and including Life of the Party, though the Eavesdropping/Bank missions were nothing too special. Ambush was actually a very good mission for me. I enjoyed running throughout the city, trying to weave my own path back to my place, creeping around. Life of the Party was my other favorite mission, sneaking around on the rooftops being my favorite part. Before that, Trail of Blood was interesting as well, mostly in the environment and the ghosts you kept encountering.\n\nNone of those levels were really that confusing as in the first game either. They were no longer wide open, empty areas. Instead, you could get a better grasp on where you were for the most part, and I could always keep track of what I was doing, never getting bored.\n\nThen came the last third of the game, back to terrible. From the first Cavador mission forward, I didn't enjoy the environments anymore, nor did the levels keep me entertained. Even worse, the Casing the Joint mission was a generic build for the most part. I mean, I was interested with the secret paths throughout the place at first, but to be honest, they wore out pretty quickly, as the mission was such a pain of trial-and-error, more so than any other mission. Then the immediately next mission throws you back into the same exact mansion with basically no difference! What a pain, and what a terrible design decision.\n\nAnd for the finale, Soulforge wasn't linear like in the original game, but it wasn't interesting either. The first room you start in looked cool, then everything else was just generic looking and full of robots. I understand that it fits the story (the Metal Age!) but it didn't make me want to keep going. And that ending cinematic, wow! The ending of the first game wasn't the greatest, but still much better than this one. It seems that Looking Glass really didn't know how to end games, between System Shock 2 and these two Thief games.\n\nAs a side note, mentioned above, Karras had the worst voice of the game. So terrible. He sounded like he just had this nasal jelly mass stuck in his throat. There is some weird, annoying cartoon character that it reminded me of, but I can't remember for the life of me, at the moment. I know that Stephen Russell did the voice and he also does many others, included Garrett's! But Karras is so different, and literally I had to mute my sound any time his voice was prominent throughout the game. I can't really say there have been many voices that have caused me to do that, and it was only slightly worse that all of the robots spout his voice too.\n\nIn the end, I was really impressed with about half of the game, neutral for a little piece, and then very disappointed with the last third. Do I recommend that people play the game? Sure. I enjoyed it for a good while, much more than I did the first game.

It’s outdated by today’s standards, but seeing that it was released in 2000 its aged pretty darn well. This game defined the genre of stealth for me. There is nothing like reallocating wealth while moronic guards struggle to find you. In order to assist the focus on stealth, Thief II has large levels, which are strategically populated by enemies, items, and objectives. There’s even a multiplayer mod that can be found on the internet that works with the steam copy of the game. If you’re a die-hard stealth fan, I would highly recommend this classic.","November 25, 2013","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has anything you'd want in one, different difficulties, all giving you different tasks to complete each mission, multiple ways to get the job done, and (mostly) clever AI. I wish I would've found this game sooner, it's one of the most explicitly stealth oriented games I've ever played. It also removed the annoying dungeon-crawling levels from the first game, replacing them with no-violence stealth missions. Unlike most modern stealth games, this one doesn't let you get away with getting spotted by killing whoever has seen you, you'd better have some flash bombs or a good escape route, or else the only way you're leaving is in a bodybag.","September 11, 2014","true","32.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The improvments are minor but helpful (invisibility and free fall potions and more dynamic mapping come to mind). Additionally some of the missions were more interesting this time around especially the kidnapping mission with it's moving objective (even though it was in a re-used map.) Alas the game seems to fall apart on the last few scenarios with a two-part misison that's unnecessairly redundant followed by a fairly unforgiving final level.

Thief II was totally worth the $1.50 that I scavenged  from around the house. I still think the game is worth the money at full price. There is surprisingly a lot to this game for being an oldy, but this one is a goody. There are so many mechanics to just experiment with, like all of the arrows in the game. These include Noismaker arrows, moss arrows, water arrows, fire arrows (Which explode and defy the laws of physics), rope arrows, broadhead arrows, and many more other weapons or tools that are fun to experiment with. The last thing I will mention, for the sake of not making this a very lengthy review is that each level is really up to you on how to finish it. There are several secrets i  each level, most of the time a secret switch or lever, so this can aid you in the level. And that is where I will end this review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caseykgg/recommended/211740/","caseykgg","Man-G","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caseykgg/","307 products in account","This is my second review for the second game in this eponymous stealth series, enjoy B's.\n\nPro's: This game, just like its predecessor before it, really makes you feel like a Thief. When all the cylinders in your brain are firing off at perfect formation you will honestly feel like no one can stop you from "borrowing" their precious goods. The game is a direct follow up to The Dark Project (Thief Gold) and continues pretty much right after the first game, give or take a month or two. One thing they really improved upon in this game is the level design. I didn't think they could make it any better but it's even more logical now rather than Maze-like. Thief Gold also had logical level design but some of the levels were more like Mazes than a real tangible place that you could believe existed. In this game it feels more grounded than the first and more tangible, you rob a Bank, Frame a City Watch guard, Tail an informant, Crash a party and rob the denizens of the City, and help a friend rescue his unrequited love. All of those things add up to an experience that permeates into something so immutably real that I almost forgot I was playing a damn game.\n\nAnother thing that really helps you get immersed is Garrett himself, he now talks and comments on things way more frequently and has more character depth overall. Which in turn makes him even more likeable than he already was. Without spoiling anything there is one part where you break into some ladies home and Garrett just calmly says "Don't mind me ladies, just passing through" it really makes you feel like he is more than just a cypher for the player. Another real huge improvement is the inclusion of proper secrets in every mission. Most missions can have up to 8 or more secrets for you to find and they can be as simple as a short-cut or something really nice like some loot for you to plunder.\n\nCon's: Once again there is not very many faults with this game but if there is one thing I didn't like as much as the first game it is the villain. He has a voice that sounds like a mixture of Cartman and Meatwad. Hard to feel intimidated by someone like that when I have that image in my head. He isn't a terribly written character and I really dig his motives and behaviour I just think a better voice could have gone a long way to make him seem badass. Maybe another complaint I can say is the final 3 missions are kind of "Meh" overall and the ending as a whole isn't as awesome as the first game.\n\nOverall Feelings & Score: I feel like this game is not only just a worthy sequel to the first game but it is also a damn fine game in its own right. I give the game a $ out of *...make up your own mind and decide for yourself if you can enter...The Metal Age. Mind your P's and Q's because your balls, are, about to drop sirs and madams, peace the F out!","February 13","true","24.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In comparison to the prequel it's only a slight improvement, but I think they could've made it a little bit better than they actually did. Like the prequel they managed to create an awesome atmosphere with the "poor" graphics and effects. One reason I just gave 6/10 is that most of the game looks 1:1 exactly the same like\nThief Gold.\n\nSound:     6/10\n\nThe sounds are quite good and the voice actors are doing a great job. Some sounds are really annoying (robots for example). Like in Thief Gold there is nearly no music. I know it's not necessary, but I still miss it.\n\nLevel design:     7/10\n\nThe level design is just as good as in the prequel. You can search for secrets and have more than one way to reach your goal. The atmosphere is fitting and the levels are well structured.\nExcept for one level, namely the last one. The last level is so frustrating. If you want to sneak the whole way through then you get detected the slow way. If you want to rush through you get detected fast. That is the only difference and the reason why I skipped the last level. And this last level degrades the Level design by 2 points: 9/10 => 7/10.\n\nGameplay/Handling/Equipment:     8/10\n\nThe good points: Like in the prequel you have a really nice arsenal for a thief. Plenty of arrowtypes, the flashbomb for your escape and so on. You still must get used to the controls but when you know how to play it you will like it. The playstyle remains pretty much like it was in the prequel. You sneak around, steal stuff, knock out enemies, etc..\nThe bad point: No improvements at all.\n\nEnemies/AI:     6/10\n\nWell the guards search for you if you are too loud and act really authentic. But robots act totally random and I don't get the point why they made them so annoying. Sure it's no problem to disable them but still I don't like the idea of them. They didn't improve the AI from Thief Gold to Thief 2 so I just give 6/10.\n\nStory:     4/10\n\nMaybe it's just me but I don't like the story. It's boring and I miss the "magical" part of it. The target is a guy who wants to kill people with poison and created robots to protect himself. I don't even know how to make it sound better.\n\nCritic summary:     6,2/10\n\nPersonal fun rating:     7/10     [good game]\n\nAll in all a good game, but the developers didn't make real improvements. I recommend the game if you played Thief Gold, otherwise I don't. Since the game isn't very expensive: Give it a try.","July 9, 2014","true","38.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You could carefully sneak through the dark and bypass them, you could use an arrow to make a sound, drawing them away, or find a hidden passage in the wall to sneak behind them.  This is what makes the game so great, you have options you can use and not keep things so linear.\nThe difficulty also makes the game great.  There is no indicater of any kind to tell you there is a guard on the other side of the wall.  You have to use your ears to listen to footsteps, occasionally whistling, and eyes to see if that guard is carrying a key to unlock a door with.\nOne of the cons I can say about the game is the controls at times can be a little frustrating to deal with.  Sometimes you want to climb up a short wall, quietly, only to have Garrett not only miss grabbing the wall, he may make some noise too, alerting the guards.  I had a similar problem with ladders, with him not dismounting from the well.\nThe cut scenes are kept short and in between each mission.  Most of the story is told from reading parchments, books, and listening to game characters talk amongst themselves.\n\nIf you're looking for a stealth game that IS superior to most other stealth games, like Metal Gear, I would highly recommend this game ot","January 14","true","49.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If each of them gets 10 points (so a total of 40) and you break it up here's the ranking:\n\nTheif II: The Metal Age 50/10\nThief: The Dark Project (Gold) 10/10\nThief: Deadly Shadows 5/10\nThief -25/10\n\nBut that includes 3 stories for another time.\n\nI do have to mention Dark Project/Gold briefly since Thief II would not exist without it.  It really is a fine game in its own right, the best Stealth Game up to that point.  However, it still relies too much on combat (and those damnable undead). The story, however, is worth it.  Which leads to Thief II -- apparently Looking Glass Studios realized that the combat was the least favorite aspect of the game and made it so you can avoid it entirely in Thief II (if you choose).  You may get seen and want to fight your way out (or have to I suppose) and you are not entirely without resources.  However, you CAN get through it without ever swinging your blade.  That, in conjunction with the story, propelled Theif II to the top of the stealth charts for me.\n\nDo not look for visuals that have withstood the test of time.  They are dated, but they are sufficient if you aren't a snob, and the aesthetic works perfectly.  Do not look for this if you want to run and gun through levels putting arrows into the eye sockets of every guard you see while simultaneously slicing and dicing others who happen to get to close.\n\nDO look for an amazing stealth game with a solid story that builds from at first trying to scratch out a living to getting embroiled in events beyond your control.  DO look for secret rooms, safes, stashed of loot.  DO be patient and learn the guard's patterns.  But mostly -- DO PICK UP Thief II: The Metal Age (especially during this stealth game sale!).\n\nOne last thing -- DO NOT pick up Thief (the reboot) as it has in common with the true Thief games only the title and the name of the protagonist.  They are as different as having a fire and being on fire.","October 14, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are new variations to missions and different challanges that make a more well rounded experience. New Enemies to circumnavigate and incapacitate. The World feels bigger and more imersive, and the story with a well developed villian interesting twists and suprising character reveals is pure genius\n\nThere are some little flaws with the game, but that might be down to my skill as a player or the age of the game. The Watchers and Children of Karras do feel a lot like the undead from Theif 1 and the Bank mission does frustrate due to the material of the floor.\n\nBut these are little details, Thief 2 is a must buy for any stealth game fan and a reminder as to why the Thief series are the best in the genre.","September 2, 2015","true","89.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, now you can. There is no excuse. You must play it and adore it, bowing down at its digital feet...assuming you like stealth, of course.\nThis is the original of deep stealth games with the most immersive world and "I-wanna-party-with-youuu"-level-of-cool protagonist. You use light, sound and skill to reach your objectives in any number of ways, none of that "mash button to hide on this linear path" nonsense here. You can choose your method of completion...whether it be hack everything with your sword (good luck with that) or by becoming ultimate shadow vapor mist xtreme master thief (i.e. you can set your difficulty to hard if you want to be punished for knocking anyone out).\nThis game has been my favorite since its release in 2000, as my friends would probably like me to shut up about by now. I replay this thing almost yearly, perhaps from obsession, but also because it is that good and there's just no satisfying that stealth itch quite the same way in other games. Truly though, this game is what pushed me into the deep end of my love for games and I think it still holds up, despite old school graphics that may bother some people.

And this was what Thief II: The Metal Age brings us. So, if you played the first game, you must really play this one and you will not be disappointed.","November 2, 2015","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Though  it doesn't have the same 'horror' element that the first game had, it's still very atmospheric with an incredible ambience that will suck you in to its dark, treacherous world and it won't let go until Karras closes the doors to Soulforge, forever sealing his fate! (yeah, more on Soulforge later).\n\nAll of the original Thief gameplay mechanics are still in place w/ added features: the stealth is in full effect with deeply complex missions and large maps that allow for multiple routes to completing objectives, all the sexy arrow types you loved from the first game are back (now with vine arrows), all of your original gadgets are back (now with scouting orbs, and in rare cases explosive devices), there are new enemy types (most notably female soldiers) and of course a new antagonist (alas, Constantine is no more, but Karras is easily just as much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as he was, so it's cool, and there's even a ghost pirate at one point if you can find him and his glorious pirate booty....um....let me rephrase that, I mean his treasure).  Oh, and I almost forgot one of the coolest upgrades, the cinematics between missions (some play out like storyboard drawings but others are actual cinematics and there's sorta one when you die too, but obviously that's not as cool as the others).\n\nNow back to the final mission, Sabotage at Soulforge, Karras' stronhold, his HQ, the locus of his nefarious activities, yeah you get the point.  Being a final mission you'd expect some level of challenge and complexity and Soulforge certainly doesn't disappoint. But seriously, this mission for me was so vast and complex that I spent nearly a quarter of my total game time wandering its darkened corridors with like negative 5 hitpoints at some points, all while trying to figure out where I should go next and how not to get killed by Karras' mechanoid creations. After finally beating this mission, I almost felt like I couldn't recall an earlier point in the game but Soulforge.  It was as though the entire game took place in this one hub-like area.  Mentally, I was nearly defeated by this final quest but I persevered in the end and so Karras can suck it!\n\nIf you like Thief you'll love this one just as much, if not more so.  Get it on sale when you can but as far as classics go, it's a must own even if you have to pay the full price and there is so much depth and challenge that you'll be glad you made the purchase in the end.","August 14, 2015","true","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Supernatural enemies are traded out for mechanical ones which have easier to understand AI. Though the shift to a more industrialized setting gives the impression that there'd be more repetition in visual design don't be fooled. Maps are more detailed than in the first game. New items are introduced, filling a variety of roles that provide for more freedom of gameplay. Also female guards! You wouldn't think it but this adds a surprising amount to guard interactions and I really can't think of any negative outcomes of it.\n\nYou absolutely owe it to yourself to play this and Thief Gold, if you've played one without the other you're missing out of the the definitive Thief experience.","August 16, 2015","true","67.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game had me pulling all the newly found gray hairs out of my head, and I was so disappointed. I wish I had the same experience as the other players who write, "this was one of the best games I've ever played", but I didn't and I can't fake that I did. It had some shining moments, but were vastly overshadowed (literally) by certain other gameplay characteristics.\n\nI feel like I could gripe forever about it but I'll keep it short (I'll try). I did play Thief Gold and enjoyed it a lot. While there were some things I wasn't a fan of, I was able to get over them and still really enjoy the game. Hoping for the same experience in Thief II, I was let down. My biggest gripe of the game, which sounds silly until you play it, is the game is SO. MOTHER. EFFING. DARK. This alone, ruined the game for me. There are 3 or 4 missions I know off the top of my head that I played for 4-5 hours EACH and still couldn't complete the level, only to consult a guide, and only to find out there is a door or ladder or key or something that would advance me in the level. And what held me back from finding it was that it was hidden in the darkest, most pitch black area of a random room. I can't harp on it enough, no matter how much I adjusted the gamma option, or my brightness on my monitor, it never improved. Again sounds silly, but I was physically incapable of finding these things because of it being so dark. The first game was dark too, but not to the extent to where you actually can't see what's ahead of you. There are flares added to the game, but they really don't offer much help. It brightens things up about 1 foot around you, and then disappears after 10 seconds or so.\n\nThere are other things that bother me about this game, but that is the main one. I almost feel like that if that one thing didn't affect me so much, I'd be able to look past the other things like I did in the first game. I was so determined to beat this game and just completely remove it from my computer. To be stuck in a level for 4-5 hours only to find out that you need to walk through a door in a room you've been in several times already, is something I never want in a game again. Missions like Kidnapped, Casing the Joint, and the final Sabotage at Soulforge, are the bane of my existence in this game. If you buy it, I just hope you have a better experience than I did.","July 24, 2014","false","34.4"," 21 of 102 people (21%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","21","21","102","4","3"

I couldn't get into its story and atmosphere because of steampunk elements but you might like that. Graphics are outdated but no matter.\n\nThe game has really dark places. You should make a gamma adjustment because after a while your eyes getting tired.\n\nThere is also some silly things like sounds. You can't turn off music. The proper solution: You should carefully edit a file named "snd.crf"... Basic solution: Turn off ambient sounds totally from options menu (that also removes sounds of birds, insects, wind and something like that). The other thing is some sounds are really disturbing and repetitive.\n\nDon't hesitate and buy if you love stealth.

I had a difficult time trying to follow along with the story in this game, I suppose the "world" it's set in doesn't make much sense to me. Not to say that it's bad, the story and dialogue is actually one of the strong points. The weak points were in the controls and I suppose some of the stealth mechanics. Jumping was far more difficult than it should have been, as well as climbing. I'll give stealth mechanics a bit of slack though since even top developers today still can't get it right. It does make for some hilarious bugs at times though!\n\nNote: I never played any of the Thief series as a kid. I recall getting one of them with a video card I bought way back when though I had no interest in the game at the time. So I suppose you could say this review isn't biased by nostalgia. I would highly recommend installing the TafferPatcher mod for this game as it completely overhauls the textures and some of the rendering engine.","July 5, 2014","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The engine is just a little clunky, yet versatile enough to do some sword fighting with guards (blocking and parrying attacks galore!) and fending your way such across missions if you so desire. Of course, you can scale the difficulty to expert and go for a strictly no-kill deal with tougher objectives—and those are equally awesome—but the fact that I don't have to play it exclusively as an "avoid being seen or be maimed by a civilian" is what does it for me.\n\nWhether you pick up Thief: The Dark Project or Thief II: The Metal Age, look up a simple tweaking guide on Google to get the most out of the game. Steam already makes heavy use of some of these just to get this engine running on mostly anything, but you probably won't be able to play on more than an 800x600 resolution without manually messing around with one of two files in your Steam folder.

It's really hard for me to pick out anything bad to say about this classic, to be honest. And this isn't nostalgia talking, either- I played and finished this game for the first time in the past year. The characters are interesting, looting everything that isn't nailed down and working to get every last scrap of loot and secret adds some nice replayability, the stealth relies on both line of sight, shadows, and sound, and you will probably want to punch the main villain in the face by the end of the game, along with his love of marbel and metal flooring. The only thing that I don't love is how the old graphics make everyone look like a paper mache monstrosity, but I'm pretty sure that there's probably a mod out there to fix that.\n\nSeriously, though.

The core gameplay remains almost entirely unchanged, the engine is identical, and there is only a minor difference in graphics.\n\nThis game very easy to sell. Did you like the great voice acting, excellent level-desing, outstanding atmosphere, and the innovative, stealth-based gameplay of the first game? Did you hate the levels that featured unkillable zombies and various other creatures? Well, there are hardly any zombies or creatures (you have to go out of your way to find them, and they're very easy to avoid) the voice acting, gameplay, and atmosphere are the same - and the levels are EVEN BIGGER. Thief 3, Thief 4, and Dishonoured can go sit in the corner and cry.\n\nOne level in Thief 2 has you sneak through an entire town (you can tip-toe on the rooftops, or you can creep through the shadows of the streets) - which culminates in raiding a six-storey high mansion. This is without loading screens, and there are millions of hidden nooks and crannies where you can find various goodies to steal. Another level has you travel through a ruined Aztec city, and another a jungle filled with treehouses. Aside from perhaps 'Deus Ex', this game has the largest and most detailed levels in gaming history (and by 'detailed' I mean rooms with furniture and books you can read, and fireplaces that lead to secret passageways - not 'detailed' in a graphical sense)\n\nWhilst I recommend playing 'Thief 1', and even 'Thief 3' (avoid 'Thief 4') if you must only play one Thief game...make it this one.","August 1, 2014","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anywhere I didn't see games devoted to theft with such bright plot where are bound paganism, a brotherhood award, the greedy nobility yet, to indulge and simple street guys who left the main hero of game - Garret. The most important quality in game, however I think and for other representatives of troublemakers too. As fine it is realized here: it is necessary to move slowly, on silent surfaces, for example a grass, boards or carpets, thus to look for places with a dense shadow and if it isn't present that to nestle on walls, or to squat round the corner.\n\nThe GUARDS are CLUMSY: The guard can't call the worthy opponent of the thief. These idlers are too careless, clumsy and silly. Even if they will hear you, first can think that it mice, either a fireplace, or a copper peep. In the dark they are blind at all so it is possible to make surely roundabout maneuvers for a back of the victim. In a situation when the policeman will notice you, he of course won't run to give the alarm, and will go to act heroically to punish the thief, in this case we will be able always to give it the worthy answer, behind Garret's shoulders always a huge arsenal from arrows (simple, water, with a rope, gas, fiery), a sword, a bludgeon, potions of life, water breath, a bomb and of course a compass.\n\nI absolutely accurately see an appeal of developers from Looking Glass Studios to decrease in violence in game and in life. Game encourages theft, not a robbery and murders. At the difficult levels of game, murder are forbidden at all and game overo'm are punished. Mirnyi, innocent inhabitants and servants, it is so easy to calm with one blow bludgeons, as well as guards. With the zombie conversation short, is evil spirits and the evil, and it is necessary to fight against it!\nWe will sum up the results: Theft it not such the big evil as within game and life, it was and will be always, only in that as it to call a question, and under what look a tax. A banal example it is possible to give the taxation. Let the state steal from us in a type of tax and we will steal gold candlesticks from rich lords of the game Thief.\n\nAll series of games is excellent is: Thief, Thief 2, Thief: Deadly Shadows.

And never gave it back! Looking Glass took the revolutionary concept of the the first installation and brought it to perfection. Thief 2 gives you a lot of options, big levels and lets the player freely find his own way to the goal. The game is more about problem solving then it is combat. Who things power fantasy has to be about killing and murdering, never tried to get around one guard without getting seen or even noticed. Be smart, be observant, be quiet and become a master thief.\n\nThe game of course suffers of its old age. All the objects consist of only a few polygons, there aren't complex lighting and shading systems at work (which is a shame for a game about shadows) and the environment can look empty or sterile at times. But it isn't unplayable either. If you get use to the graphics, Thief 2 shines with a very interesting world of little stories, fantastic level-design and impressive sound-design.\n\nThief 2 is still the stealth-game in gaming-history.\n\n","July 1, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stealing everything, hiding bodies in dark corners of the house, and a cynical gaming motive just made the immersion into this game that much better at the time. When this game was on sale, I just couldn't help myself by trying it again in this current age. This game had great stealth mechanics and I believe it was revolutionary for its time. Now with updated graphical stealth games this old and dusty game has its pros and cons.\nThe Pros\n- Stealth game-play, with the higher difficulties not allowing to kill anyone. You play as a Thief not a Hitman\n- Open ended map. There are many ways to get your objective(s)\n- Secrets. The game has bonus secrets, either to benefit the mission or back-story on the game\n- For a completion-ist, hours of game-play\nThe Cons\n- The game's graphics is similar to Tomb Raider 1.\n- Player needs to be patient\n- The AI isn't the sharpest\n\nOverall the game is fun, 1st person, single player game. The game is old and dusty but can keep a player, like myself, lurking in the shadows pickpocketing a guard. Just remember that those water arrows are more helpful than ordinary arrows. If you get tired you can save the game and come back later, or try a different route.","May 3, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While here the equipment selection has been improved, the areas expanded, and the missions more varied, I felt that The Metal Age was a bit off in terms of atmosphere and occasional design flaws, on top of bugs similar to those of The Dark Project, which I have just come to assume are inherent problems of the Dark Engine, which both games utilized.\n\nThe levels are large, and use a color and texture palette more believable than that of the first game. Personally, I liked the fantasy-looking themes of The Dark Project, compared to the industrial feeling of The Metal Age.\nMore space brings more to do, and while more challenges are welcome, the gameplay feels weak when the levels only allow one entrance to a particular location, and this will happen much more here than in its predecessor. As much as I hate hand-holding, I hate a lack of direction a tiny bit more. The Dark Project was good at giving the player direction through in-game literature and dialogue, and this sort of help is not as available here.\n\nI wouldn't have such a problem with confusing level design if I was given more freedom to explore, but enemies are quite plentiful in this entry, along with many types that are only susceptible to explosive weaponry, limiting possible approaches and damaging that appeal of the game. While human opponents are usually easily dealt with, the mechanical enemies frequently chew up inventory items, often resulting in death when there are just too many to either destory or avoid.\n\nThe inventory holds a larger variety of equipment, but due to the sheer volume it can be a pain to navigate when having to do so quickly. The usefulness of some items has changed. The game seems intent on giving me plenty of water arrows, even though most of the light sources are electric lamps, and there is very little blood to ever have to clean. Fire arrows are much more helpful, but now quite rare. Maps are a big improvement over the previous game. Rather than being given my general location, I am now told which room I am in, which is helpful in areas where the rooms look the same.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it, but due to its difficult-to-manage size, I felt like it lacked some of the cohesion present in The Dark Project.","May 13, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A sardonic and witty character whos stealthy prowess is legend. I love this game and another Warren Spector game called Deus Ex. Both are marellous but in different ways.\n\nThis game makes sure your always outnumbered and outgunned so combat almost always leads to your doom which makes the game far more intense. Each footfall could alert a guard and shadows become your friend.\n\nI recommend this as one of the best stealth games ever made.\n\n"praise be to karas, blessed are thine welded"","July 20, 2012","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics aren't amazing technically, but the mix of gothic, steampunk, art deco, and medieval styles and architecture more than make up for it visually. If you're so obssesed with resolutions and the rest, download a 1080p patcher to fix this. Besides, the technical stuff is simply a speck on a brilliant masterpiece of a game. Also, after you've finished the main game, be sure to play the unofficial expansion, Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age, as well as over 600 different fan missions to further immerse yourself in this incredible world, made by a still dedicated community (check ttlg forums or the thief wiki for them).

Even though a lot of the stealth mechanics don't make much sense, such as a guard not being able to see you should you be standing inches away from them if you're in a dark spot of a brightly lit room, everything about this game is FUN. You'll spend about 40-60 minutes in each level, and that's if you're ignoring picking up all of the loot that's scattered around.\n\nThe story, in comparison to the original Thief, is very well written and intriguing. The plot in the original had you fighting zombies and tomb raiding, while in this game, the focus is on the transition from a dark ages fantasy game to "The Metal Age". You don't feel so much like a spelunking knight with a sword and bow and arrow, but an actual thief, taking on bank heists and even sneaking through a medieval police station and stealing from the evidence vault.\n\nThe screenshots displayed on the Store Page really don't do the game justice. For a game from 2000 the graphics have aged tremendously, and the lighting and texture work look fantastic to this day. My favorite level is the bank, just because of how spectacular the green tiled floors, wooden walkways, and red carpeted offices look.\n\nNot only do the levels look incredible, but they have some pretty great layouts and the level design is ingenious, inventive and sprawling. After replaying the bank mission so many times I've found six different ways to enter the building, and there are so many different routes you can take to get to the vault without being spotted it's insane. From crawling through a vent and dropping down into the offices adjacent to the vault room, shutting down the mechanical faces (which act as cameras hanging from the ceiling and spinning around trying to spot you) by flipping a switch on the third floor and going through the teller gates, or going through the lions den and using a rope arrow attached to the ceiling to cross the Guard's Room and into the backdoor of the vault room.\n\nI also love that each section of the immensely huge levels has a little nugget of dialogue to be heard that are entertaining to listen to and informative. The voice acting isn't great, but I always ended up quicksaving each time I heard a guard speaking with another guard so I could hear the full thing and then quickload so I didn't lose any time. What is really well done however is Garret talking to himself, usually stating the obvious but it helps players stay on track when he explains something to himself the player might not already realize. His little quips and things he says never get old, even after you've played the same level three or four times.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an outstanding gem of a game that you would be doing yourself a disservice not to play.","April 16","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Newer cars are better than old, that sort of thing. The stealth genre is the only thing where this doesn\'t seem to be the case. Not to say that there aren\'t good modern day stealth games, of course there are. However, as of right now, none of them have seemed to surpass Thief 2, just offer and equally good experience, despite Thief\'s age.\n\nI won\'t go crazy on this review, but here is an example. Hitman is a stealth game of sorts, and as most games do, it discourages you from killing bad guys. The less bodies the better. How does it do this? With points, a negative effect on your over all proformance review, just some numbers on the screen. And thats all fine and dandy. But what about Thief.\n\nThief is entirely organic, as it encourages you to be as stealthy as possible in a totally realistic way, that is much more planned out, while avoiding the whole issue of pulling you out of the experience, reminding you that \"this is just a game\".   If you encounter a guard, you could try to sneak around him. One small mistake could get you killed though, so why not knock him out? You could, but then you have to worry about the body, which if not well hiden enough, could ruin everything. Meanwhile, killing him would be even worse, since that would not only make a body, but also a blood stain, which would require a water arrow to clean. This natural progressing of actions and consequences encourages you to play with as little encounters as possible, instead guiding you to learn to sneak past guards without ever interacting with them in the first place, being the ultimate ninja. But this doesn\'t feel gamey, and doesn\'t feel arbitrary or tedious.\n\nThis is just one of the many reasons why Thief 2 still stands up as a great stealth game. Buy it, then download tafferpatcher, a program which helps the game run on modern computers. Don\'t worry, it is stupid easy, just download the file, and launch the executable, it takes all of 30 seconds. Plus, there are thousands of fan made levels which the community has made, providing hours of gameplay beyond the base game, so have fun!","June 1","true","141.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scroogs/recommended/211740/","scroogs","Koogs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scroogs/","83 products in account","It's a game where you steal stuff in a medieval steampunk setting.\nI recommend that you look up the plot summary of the first game before playing this game; there are a few plot points that you will miss if you don't. You can very well skip the first game and just play this one. You will miss out on the first game, but this game is the superior one, and I don't think that you'll lose too much if you play this game before the first one, save for the lockpicks not being in the first game until much later in the game.\n\nThief 2 is a pretty old game. You'll have to re-bind controls right away (F is crouch, for example), movement is less smooth than today's games, and combat kind of sucks. Luckily, the movement is easy to get used to, and you're never supposed to engage in combat anyway.\nThere is a bit at the end where the same map is used for 2 levels, and I'm not a fan of the final level, but the rest of the game is so excellent that it outweighs all the negatives in my eyes.\n\nSeriously, this has to be the greatest stealth game in existence. Stealth is based on line-of-sight, whether you're in a shadow or not, how much noise you're making, and even if you have something reflective in your hands.\n\nThere are also a metric buttload of different entryways and routes that you can take. You could play this game over and over for years and never know about a certain ledge that you can jump on if you jump just right that gives you an entirely new perspective on a level. There are also a ton of secrets in the vein of Doom and Doom 2. The great thing about these secrets is that they're never hidden in a way that makes no sense. If there's a wall that slides away, then there's a button, or a movable torch-holder, or a bookshelf with a pullable book, or something else similar that's somewhere closeby.\n\nThis is all I have to say about the game\n\nIf you don't own it, start owning it.\nIf you've never played it, start playing it.\n\nUnless, of course, you don't want to give money to Eidos & Squeenix\nThe orignal developers aren't going to see your money if you buy this, and the Thief reboot already crashed and burned, so buying this game doesn't really do anything other than give a big publisher money. That being the case, there are- other- ways to get this game.","June 3","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
