Please, don't buy this game, no matter how cheap it is.","March 24","false","0.4"," 122 of 149 people (82%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","82","122","149","28","6"

It shouldn't be on steam or it should be free.  There isn't any positive to mention except for the developers enthusiasm?  At first glance, I can't tell if this is a retro throwback, a roguelike or some adventure with no plot/story but it clearly doesn't work at all.\n\nEach time you die you have to go back through the boring vertical slime corridors, then back onto blowing up or attempting to blow up giant slimes with bombs, its boring through-out, has clipping issues and sprite collision is iffy too.\n\nI honestly recommend either scrapping this, or re-making it.  Roguelikes or Roguelites, are perhaps the hardest games to make - the balance between frustration and playablity is key, and that line between them is very fine.\n\n","April 18","false","0.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

You cant kill any, you have no weapons remember.\n\nOh no, you character moves slow and doesnt like to be controlled in an effective way based on avoiding the slimes.\n\nI give up.

It isn't deep at all and it gets repetative fast but still has a charm to it. It controls moderatly well and the skills as you level up actually have a sense of progression to them. The key binding is only "secret" past the first screen- after that it is simple to find what you need.  You can't expect much for the price, but what there is is at least good as most cheap mobile apps.","May 5","true","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

As an aspiring developer who wants to make games as a hobby, I was happy to have purchased this game.\nI can see the things that I would want to incorporate into my games and other things where I would take a little bit more time to enhance.\n\nRegardless of my level of enjoyment of this game, you can tell that the developer spent a good deal of time on this. It seems the game was built using C++. I'm curious to what the result would have been if the developer used a pre-existing engine.\n","March 25","true","25.9"," 17 of 76 people (22%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","22","17","76","8","3"
