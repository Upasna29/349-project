Is 1953 a terrible game? No it does have some redeeming features. But it has some little problems punctuated by one MASSIVE issue and I’m left thinking I should dissuade you from making the purchase.\n\nThere are plenty of adventure games, many right here on Steam, that deserve your attention more. Even when you narrow it down to the “horror”-niche of point-and-click adventure gaming there are other games like Scratches and Dark Falls (or hell, even Amnesia and Penumbra to an extent as long as you are willing to toss the point-and-click out) that are infinitely more enjoyable. But, if you’ve exhausted your options then this game might be worth your time, it’s the bottom of the barrel but it does manage to do a couple things right.\n\nIts greatest sin is committing the point-and-click taboo: pixel hunting.  That line is probably enough to send plenty of adventure veterans running for the hills. Pixel hunting is perhaps the biggest factor separating a good game from a sub-par or downright bad one. A good game cleverly takes your eyes to certain things while still being subtle, a bad one requires you to find the exact hit-box on the screen the developers arbitrarily decided to make a key point. Often with little or no sign that you need to interact with that area. And even once you do find it if you haven’t already collected the necessary shiny mcguffin (more pixel hunting) needed to interact with that area, then god help you.\n\n1953 starts off down this road instantly when I found myself trapped for about 20-minutes in the first two rooms. Eventually I found a floor panel that you have to pull up. The issue is not only was the panel in complete darkness, with little to suggest anything of note, but the hit-box for selecting it was painfully small. A rather simple puzzle was thus rendered an exercise in frustration based not on my ability to understand what needed to be done, but on the games inability to show me where I needed to go. You don’t need to shepherd your player like a 2-year-old and force their hand, but you do need to give some sort of indication that an area might be important. Rather than expecting me to find the one tiny pixel in an un-notable black floor that forwards the plot.\n\nThings open up a bit from there and you get to do a little exploration. But you still find a lot of this happening where you missed that one container from 30-minutes ago. And so now you have to revisit every room and scan it in slow-motion as not to miss the cue that you’re over something important.\n\nAfter that little rant you’d think I’d be hard pressed to say anything good, and don’t get me wrong this is a huge negative that detracts from the enjoyment considerably. But as I said it does some good things.\n\nThe atmosphere is oppressive and though it’s never frightening it does manage to make you uneasy, despite knowing nothing would happen I still found myself nervous in dark areas. The story (as far as I’ve got) is decent, it’s pretty rote and predictable, but it’s done with enough care that you at least feel invested. Though your surroundings are bland, gun-gray concrete rooms and other traditional industrial clichés they’re all rendered carefully. Machinery is caked in grime, walls have been carefully rendered to have unique pitting instead of repeat textures, and various odds and ends lying about give the impression that the area was lived in at one point. This is backed up by some excellent sound design that throws all sorts of eerie clanks, hums, and hisses at you. Additionally the game occasionally hits a stride where you don’t run into too much of the dreaded pixel hunting and for those brief periods is quite enjoyable.\n\nI will mention that most of the puzzles so far have been rather easy, but I also haven’t reached the end-game. So far the challenge has been less about solving the puzzles, and more about finding the necessary items to get the puzzle moving.\n\nAnd in the end that’s what’s running me off. I may never finish 1953 because while I love what they’re trying to do here, every time the atmosphere and story try to soak me in that’s all shot out the window the moment I then have to comb my surroundings with a hawk-eye for 30-minutes to proceed. I want to like the game, it got so much right but when you solve a problem in an adventure game you’re supposed to feel gratified. Part of adventure games is your own wit, but the other part is the cunning developers making you THINK it’s your own wit. Crafting things in such a way as to mentally test you, but not to the point of frustration. And that’s the issue, when I finally solve a problem in 1953 I don’t feel like I’d accomplished anything, I just felt grateful I finally stumbled across the latest key item and can get this over with.\n\nAnd that’s a death sentence for an adventure game, at least for me.","February 12, 2014","false","2.3"," 56 of 72 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","56","72","0","8"

However what we have here is a typical point and click adventure game.  Its short clocking in at about 1-3 hours to complete, which is nice as a mini game or proof of concept but not really a full game.  At least in the short time that KGB is with you its fun.  It has decent puzzles with straight foward elements that will be solved easily by adventure vets.  The story is a decent one until the last 80% when it goes off the rails in a roswell aliens sort of way.  I really think a more serious attempt at a plot and about 3x the length would have made this a classic.  There is so much history and cool themes they COULD have used with this story yet for some reason they decided to go silly.  Its poor ending and microsopic length hold back what could have been a very deep and rich adventure game.

The game is set in a WW2 Soviet bunker or some kind of an underground facility where the player finds himself trapped in. He knows nothing about how he got there, but we learn throughout the game more and more about him and the world around us. The game is played in first person view.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the atmosphere, at times I'll admit I had a chill feeling going down my spine, yet there is no real threat in this game. Extremely well done on that part, and the gameplay is what you'd expect of this kind of game.  All the puzzles make sense and you have to find clues in the environment to solve them and are never out of context.\nThe game itself is not very long 4-5 hours to finish and it kind of ends leaving you wanting for more, at least that's how I felt. Too bad, because a proper ending would add more to the overall score.\n\nSo, to sum everything up:\n\n+ great atmosphere\n+ interesting puzzles\n+ good story\n\n- but ends abruptly\n- short\n\nI recommend it to all adventure fans looking for a nice, atmospheric game to activate their grey matter. 7 / 10","March 10, 2014","true","5.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","1"

I'm still a little confused with the story, especially the ending. I also had a difficult time figuring out several of the puzzles. Many of the clues were overly cryptic. The game is quite short and most of the play time will be spent figuring out these cryptic puzzles and reading random documents. For me, the atmospheric music was the highlight of the game--setting a very eerie mood.\n\nAlthough it wasn't a bad game, I really can't say it's something I enjoyed.\n\n"Live your life so that people remember you with a kind word."

You'd think KGB 1953 would be really fun to play with all those things considered, but it strangely wasn't. It was actually pretty frustrating.\n\nI'm left wondering just where the story started and at what point it ends. There are plenty of documents and files to read as you progress through the game to flesh out the situation and provide hints and clues to puzzles (and why you're in the bunker) but you never really get any resolve. It's just one big 'what' moment.\n\nOne big 'what' moment dotted with lots of smaller 'what' moments in the form of some of the most mind numbingly frantically click and hope puzzles I've experienced in a point and click. Some of them are pretty clever, while the majority rely on you being able to distinguish collectible items from the backgrounds they're hiding in.  So you'll find most of time just clicking and hoping and wondering where the logic/reason was behind the solution.\n\nIn the end KGB 1953 is a game that should only be experienced by people who want to experience just how odd this game is. Point and click fans might be disappointed by it, and those new to the genre should avoid this completely.","November 13, 2014","false","3.3"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","3"

I have had a bit of a magpie instinct over the last couple of years, and have bought almost every bundle and stockpiled my games. Now my library is quite big with the vast majority of games untouched. I have decided to play through all these games and write a review for each, in order to make sure I do not miss any I will be playing them in alphabetical order. I am likely to keep adding bundles and I don't know if I will ever catch up, but it's going to be a lot of fun!\n\nSo 1953 - KGB Unleashed, do I recommend it?\n\nIt's only just a yes but with a big asterisk which we will now go into.\n\nI personally really enjoyed this game, but I can imagine that it will not be for everyone. This was a game that I wasn't particularly looking forward to when purchasing the bundle. I was expecting it to be a run of the mill great war first person shooter, but initial impressions and cynicism of the gaming industry can be deceiving! Much to my pleasant surprise. The game is actually a lot more like Myst, a modern first person point and click adventure game.\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of Myst 5 I think it was. It has the same pre rendered backdrops and the same “spherical” looking system. Your character will walk forward and stop in certain spots and you can look all around him with the mouse including up and down and a full 360 rotation. If you hold down the mouse button it rotates faster which I found myself doing a lot. It's a single click to interact with the world, move or pick things up. Right click opens your inventory which shows all the items your character is holding and gives you access to all the documents you have read.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are very strong. I enjoyed them a lot. Most of the puzzles have quite a cryptic solution, but the documents you read contain clues, and they are just the right balance, the puzzles really are some of the very best I've ever seen in an adventure game as the difficulty to satisfaction ration is spot on. This is a game that will make you think. Which I very much enjoy. There is only one puzzle that relies on trial and error which is kinda a negative however the documents make you aware of this.\n\nSo why is this game only getting a slight recommendation? Well there are a few reasons. The graphics are fit for purpose but they're not really anything that special, considering they are pre rendered too, although I don't see this as a bad thing. The game has a very eerie and oppressive nature to it, and as such there is a lot of dark rooms with low lighting which makes finding items annoying. Some rooms I had to enter and leave many many times before finding what was actually quite a big item. This is helped somewhat by a cursor that changes when it is moused over something intractable but you do feel that you are back in the old fashioned pixel hunting days. Although this may not be a bad thing, adventure games need a little bit of frustration otherwise they end up far too easy.\nAlso the amount of reading you have to do is likely to annoy some gamers, but that kind of gamer probably doesn't like adventure games. I am someone who likes flavour text, I read all the books I found on skyrim and I read mmo quests so this didn't phase me.\n\nIs this game art?\nThe philosophy behind art is a hard one to pin down on, I used to think that if a game makes you think after you have played it then it qualifies. Something mindless and instant gratification doesn't count using this rule, but can you really say space invaders isn't art? Hmm....well this is a discussion for another time. I do think it is an arty game though! It has a very tense atmosphere and it treats you with respect with its puzzle design. The shadowy operations of the bunker and the more philosophical aspects of this game will give you pause for thought and I expect to take the memories of this game with me for quite some time as I reflect on what was quite a detailed storyline.\n\nI can imagine the people who like this game feel the same way as me and the people who dislike it will really hate it. It was a positive experience.\n\n6/10 Slightly above average - It's certainly worth a play if you already have it like I do.","June 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","1"

I'm pretty forgiving of point-and-click games, and honestly more things should make use of the brutal, almost alien Soviet aesthetic. It started well enough, with my character waking up in the bowels of some Cold War bunker with only emergency lighting to guide him. The rooms are pre-rendered and you can pan your view around to examine them, but movement is solely clicking through different static scenes. There is shockingly little to interact with in each scene, and your character will only comment on things that block his progress, and infrequently at that. The atmosphere starts out plenty oppressive and mysterious, but the puzzles and the terrible voice acting quickly do away with that.\n\nAnd my God, the puzzles. It took me over 10 minutes to solve the very first one in the game because you have to find a loose panel under your feet in the dark, and then solve a math problem based on a number you might not have paid any attention to. I quit in the area after that after finding a punch card, a pencil, a key that did not unlock any of the three locked doors nearby, and a radio that you could tune that might be a puzzle. I can't see anyone but the most meticulous puzzling grognards having fun with this.\n\nIf your dream game is boring, obtuse Soviet MYST, then you might like it.

Anyway, the story is about a Soviet waking up in a strange place, just at the moment when Staline dies. Your goal is to solve puzzles to escape this weird bunker.\n\nI don't know why KGB Unleashed but it's clear that the game wants to show secret experiments and that as you lost your memories, you don't even remember how come you've arrived. Besides, you will have many many questions, that will be still unanswered at the end of the game.\n\nAnyway, it's a point-&-click game, where you're solving puzzles thanks to clues around - some are easy, others are harder to understand. You're travelling from a room to another room and several times. You're also guided by a mysterious voice.\n\nThe graphics are correct, though you're into a bunker or an underground facility, meaning that the ambiance is kinda cold as you're alone. Everything is set to make you feel like anything can happen, as if there was a mysterious entity.

For those on the fence about buying it, please note that I tried to keep spoilers at a minimum.\n\nThe story that's there is fun but incomplete. The story is you're a soviet electrician that wakes up stuck in a bunker. Alarms are going off, so either something really bad happened or it's time for a regulated soviet union smoke break. Either way, you probably want out, so that becomes your drive to rifle through everyone's office supplies to try and figure out what your comrades were up to (not your drive to figure out how to exit the bunker somehow.) 90% of the story is presented through documents just lying around, and the other 10% presents itself through glorious C-tier voice acting. What I could make of the overarching story was good fun, but again, by the end I really felt it wasn't finished and that's really hard to look past. It's unreasonable to expect the game to follow up on every little game world detail, but KGB Unleashed introduced concepts that could have had huge ramifications for soviet electric man, then did nothing with them. The ending doesn't acknowledge or talk about anything in the bunker at all, which soured most of experience for me.\n\nI didn't care too much about the puzzles. They're very cryptic in the "I didn't even realize I could do that with the camera" sort of way. I got stuck in the very first puzzle room for like 30 minutes, so I ended up using a steam guide from then on for the rest of game. That might discredit me quite a lot in talking about this, but having beat it, I can safely guess that I would have given up otherwise. It's a mixed bag of hard puzzles that require ingenuity and puzzles that just require you to figure out what background object isn't just part of the background. The store description for KGB lists "Staggering puzzles and many challenging mind game" as a feature, which is accurate, but I would argue that's not really a good selling point in the way it's executed.\n\nArt in this game is mostly okay with some sparse highs and lows. Before go on, I feel obligated to point out that there are no resolution options or meaningful graphical settings to change. I'm not sure how average that is for these kinds of indie point and clicks, but I thought that was weird. That being said, stylistically it does achieve it's goal of making you feel like you're wandering around a 1950s soviet bunker. It especially excels when it starts getting into some of the later stages of the game because of how much it contributes to accentuating the fact that you're alone and vulnerable. Moments like that where the art lends itself to a greater purpose are few and far between though. As for the lows, I'm just gonna say all in-engine cutscenes.\n\nSound design is bad. It's really bad in the beginning with the alarm that goes on until you finish the first puzzle. It's nothing I feel that needs in-depth discussion though.

However, I did have a thoroughly enjoyable experience thanks to this game immersing me into a largely suspenseful and paranoia-ridden environment.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSetting the scene: I wake up in a small room with no memory of how I came to be where I am or any clues as to what my purpose ever was. The only objective being, to escape and find out what happened along the way.\nImmediately you'll have to dust off your thinking caps and slam those bad boys on, because puzzle-solving is key here. Observe your surroundings, be perceptive, and try to build up the story behind the place. I honestly went in with no expectations and got a fun 4-5 hours out of it. It might seem a little dull at first, but it gets far more interesting in the second half of the game.\n\nSome puzzles are easy while others require a little more thought put into how they are solved. A couple times I almost gave up because it didn't seem at all logical. But persevere and you'll get your money's worth. I admit, this game could have been made better in regards to finding certain objects that require you to progress further. It just shouldn't be that hard at some points. But it is and can get quite frustrating finding some small object or knowing how to use it. Another thing that I found this game lacked is a little more closure once you neared the end. Some questions were left unanswered and I really wish they hadn't done that, seeing as how I was so drawn in by the atmosphere and dark story-telling.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to people who enjoy adventure games in general, and to those who love a bit of 1950s Soviet-themed (fake) history with legit themes thrown in. I especially enjoyed reading the patient files and information files on the poisonous gases (they turned out to play a part in the game). The radio puzzle was a nice touch, though I'm not sure if the speeches/songs featured on the device are actual recordings or just created specifically for this game.\n\nNow, for some inexplicable reason, I seem to have a craving for some creepypasta...","March 25","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While this game has a deep atmosphere, a dark and intriguing back-story and somewhat realistic graphics, it is all downhill after the first room.\n\nThe basics are summed up on the store page so we don't need to go into those little details. The game itself is a Point-&-Click puzzle game, a genre that certainly isn't for everybody but can be very enjoyable if done correctly (see Monkey Island for example), 1953 - KGB Unleashed is not one of those games.\nFor starters, the interface and menu style feel really amateur when compared to the rest of the games art style. The puzzles that are presented to you almost instantly are either extremely difficult or make little to no sense, the examples I'm about to give may spoil the game for anybody interested in trying it out so read on at your own risk.\n\nOne or two of the tasks you have to overcome are relatively easy, such as the voltage puzzle in the first room (even though this involves the dreaded pixel-hunting at first) and there is another puzzle a little bit further in where you have to repair a cable, these are examples of the easier puzzles, and then there are those that make absolutely no sense such as tuning a radio very specifically to open a hidden passage... yes... seriously... these are the instances I'm talking about that make absolutely no sense.\nYou get vague instructions and hints from picking up documents and reading notices as you go through the game, plus you have to look very carefully at everything you come across to get hints and pay close attention to the little details of the rooms you are in to acquire certain objects that are important, or again, pixel-hunting, these aspects are interesting but equally annoying. If it wasn't for an online walkthrough I stumbled across, I don't think I could have ever figured out that the radio tuning opened the secret passage. There is also a part where you have to place a certain object in a certain room atop a certain crate, something that you could only figure out purely by chance / trial and error.\n\nFinally, the game is short, very short, the hours of play people build up are purley based on the amount of time it takes you to figure out some of the absurd and extremely difficult puzzles, once you are all clued up and give it another play through, it can be completed in no less than 20 minutes.\n\nSo that's about it for this game I'm afraid. I don't like giving games negative reviews, really, but all good aspects of this game are hugely overshadowed by all of it's negatives. This could have been something much more, it's a shame. I would say buy it in a sale or a cheap bundle (like I did) if you're still interested in trying it, but it is highly likely that you'll have to consult a walkthrough more than once.","November 24, 2014","false","3.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I think that abandoning the sound-based puzzles helped a lot (you had to have a genius-kind of ear to solve the last Sublustrum's puzzle). The only exception to that is the cigarette-cases order: I would never think of connecting the actual hint with them.\nThe atmosphere though is absolutely stunning. With little budget and resources, the graphics and minimalist effects work great.  I liked the flashlight's effect in a shooting gallery, connected to subtle sound/voice effects.\nAlthough extremely short (takes ~3 hours to complete), it offers a solid dose of bonus exploration: notes, reports, photos, book fragments.","December 27, 2013","true","3.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

However I feel like this game is nowhere near worth what the asking price is, and even though I only got it for a buck or two on sale, I still regret buying it.\n\nI love cold war era stories, and so I thought this game was right up my alley. It's a point and click, and while I'm usually hesitant to BUY point and click games (some of my favorites like Submachine are free) I saw the cold war style and thought it might be worth the couple dollars it was selling for.\n\nBoy was I wrong. This game has a great story (albeit very short) and I thought it was pretty interesting. The puzzles were hard, and kind of abstract, but most point and click games are like that anyways so that's kind of a moot point. The music is pretty awesome, the graphics are beautiful, and the controls are pretty straightforward. The game is pretty reading heavy, and while I'm fine with that, others are not. The biggest gripe I have with this game is the english voice acting, because honestly it's subpar at it's best. You can obviously tell the cinematics are tailored to have the dialogue go on longer, and it seems like the voice actors for the english translation just wanted to get through with it as quickly as possible. The main character had an okay voice, the loudspeaker voice was just laughable because he sounded like he was just reading the lines, and honestly, the best voice actor in the game was the one guy you talk to on the phone for like a minute.\n\nThe biggest problem overall is the fact that this is a pirated english version of the Russian game "Phobos 1953". I don't know if the whole quarrel between the Russian developers and the pirates has been settled, but when I learned about this, I felt wrong buying it, even if it was like two bucks. Overall, don't buy this game. If you are so curious, watch a playthrough of it online or something.

Its difficult... VERY difficult, and to be honest, i don't know if i would have been able to complete this game without using one of the guides. 1953 - KGB Unleased isn't like your everyday  'Point & Click' games, it has that, eary, conscious feeling through-out the whole game, the puzzles are very very hard to solve, especially if you don't have the patience to wait and think things through... like me! Another frustrating thing was, even though there doesn't seem to be the presence of any AI or anything that could be with you, there's a few times where you have to backtrack to a previously searched location to find an item that wasn't there the first time... Besides the frustration for the first hour or so before consulting a guide, it's worth a play, providing you can get it cheaper than the top price, the eariness keeps you on your toes from start to finish. 6/10","July 7, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Either had their good points, mostly they had a story, atmosphere or visual. Now KGB Unleashed has these.\n\nThe visuals are really fine, somewhat photorealistic. The lights and shadows are making the atmosphere creepier, which is a good start from the base of the story. Who haven't heard about the brutality of KGB? Or their interest in paranormality and the borders after ethics in science? Well, the story isn't the strongest part of the game, and could handle more (in fact much more) about this stuff. And thus, it's making a short game, easily played through not even in 3 hours, But hey, the atmosphere makes it up. The puzzles aren't in the game: they are in your head, when you are trying putting together what has happened in that facility and the test subjects...\n\nSo basicaly, it's a good detective game, making you to think about and putting together the pieces.

You wake up with amnesia, and are trying to piece together your location and purpose. This game is quite short, can be completed in around 2 hours. Most of the story is gathered from picking up documents or the very sparse cutscenes. There is a good eerie atmosphere that permeates throughout.\n\nThe graphics leave a lot to be desired, and many of the points of interest feel like pixel hunting. The resolution is quite low, which can make objects hard to find. The voice acting can be hard to hear and understand at times.\n\nOverall, I don't feel this stands out against the many other great adventure games. It is short enough for a quick playthrough in an evening, but I can't say it's worth the time.\n\nGrade: D+","June 12, 2014","false","1.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The impression that I get is that the game was cut somewhere in the middle of the story line, for whatever reason. The end and what you experience minutes before just don't fit together.\n\nSome players already said they found the puzzles hard to solve. I think that most of the time there is a logical way to solve them - you get a lot of information you need by reading the reports you find. I missed a clear signal that I really solved the puzzle - for example, when I got the right frequency on the radio.\n\nAbout sound and graphics: Although the soundtrack is atmospheric and very generic, the places you visit are insensate and rigid. At one point, you inhalate some sarin which makes up some nice effects like a blur (no, not motion blur.) or blood red framing. but that's it.\n\nGraphics are ok, but you don't go for the high end polygon count in a game like that.\n\nOne groundbreaking gameplay element that should be mentioned implicitly is the door-opening eyeball. You have waited a long time for developers to come up with some nice gameplay thingy that cuts the edge. Simply put the eyeball through a hole to get to the other side from where the door is locked, and the eye will open it for you. nice.\n\nIf you are not in for the eyeball, I cannot recommend this game at all.","December 8, 2013","false","3.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I just kind of bang it out, but I make sure it’s at least proper. for this time, going into the game’s dumb title 1953 KGB UNLEASHED, there’s one monument I can give to this game that lets it stand above anything else. the first ten minutes of this 1954 KGB UNLEASHED are the most annoying out of anything, ever. it is dark, so you aren’t allowed to interact with anything, except for certain things. since it’s dark, making out anything is a chore, and once again, when you do make something out, it’s dark still you dork. figuring out what to do isn’t an explorative trial and error, but a frustrating trek of prior knowledge. that wouldn’t nearly make it to the most annoying thing in a videogame ever, however, there’s one other great affliction: a siren is blaring. every second your earholes are graced with BEEEZT BEEEZT BEEEZT BEEEZT beating over your skull that you haven’t solved how to turn on the lights yet. absolutely insulting. maybe, brilliant, in how it’ll never fail to get a rise out of a person.\n\nright, so, I’m already majorly off-topic and off-voice for recent track record, so I’ll hit to the heart of the above: the game is pretty good after the opening. just realize it’s absurdly hard. the only adventure game I’ve personally played that came close in abstraction was anchorhead and I know there are many more, so if you want super extra hard puzzles this kgb unleashed has them. its crowning achievement was when it expected you to tune into a very specific station with the proper settings on the radio, alluded from two very different documents, and being on that station opened a door in the cupboard of all the freaking places. absolutely schizophrentic, I love the ideas at play here. however, it could have really benefited from a hint system. it might seem counter-intuitive to their cryptic philosophy, but if the player has no drive to paranoically pour over everything they’ve read in game to make a vague connection, then they will quit. the drive only comes with investment and that’s not something you should expect from twenty minutes of the game.\n\nso, it’s not accessible. it doesn’t offer any renovations to the myst formula, quite honestly the movement in the game is oversensitive and confusing, so I conclude that phantomery really didn’t care about engaging the player. the curious dread kgb unleashed instills doesn’t rear until the second half, so it’s not as if it’s interesting to carry itself, especially considering its terrible introduction sequence. in how strictly it adheres to a traditional aesthetic is commendable in note of its logic smashing difficulty. commendability doesn’t equal fun. whether you can stomach the game is up to how much you’ll forgive. despite so much good about the game, it’s forgotten what year we’re in. being traditional is one thing, it is mostly a very good thing, but ignoring modern development in that process is being blind. it wouldn’t have ruined anything to make the game comfortable to play.\n\nmost striking about the game isn’t its graphics - though they’re close - what’s striking is its very accurate translations of text. excuse me for calling them historical, because I’m not well versed in what the KGB was actually like, to me they read in way that can only be called authentic. the quality of the period documents is on par with the 39 steps and that is a very high compliment. I wanted to find and read all of the papers because I’m a writing nerd. each one kept me rapt with its attention to detail. if anything keeps up the unleashed’s forced russian setting, it is these documents overwhelmingly. interestingly, irritatingly, the translation efforts to the things the characters actually say, you know the game’s story, is pitiful in comparison. nevermind the banal voice acting. I’m getting ahead of myself, there’s some more good to be had.\n\nI didn’t know this game was horror. by the way, this game is horror. gotta play games blind that’s the wasnotway. honestly, it’s good horror. it is not ashamed of delving into stereotypes. it’s about paranormal radio frequencies and voices of the dead. super powered ghosts and whatever. it tinkers around with baby philosophy like a good b-rate. most of all, though, it instills actual dread. whenever the lights are off and you have to navigate by flashlight it’s nerve-wracking. ambience will play identical to normal sound effects and you’re not sure if you did something on accident or if… well, if you’re not alone. as you unravel what happened, whatever happened also draws closer to you. you’re stuck being oblivious and unknown, while being overwhelming by the main character’s physical sensations of fear. documents you read cement these symptoms as a common reaction to being in the facility. irrational, absolute fear, that isn’t created by the person, but was bodily - as the unleashed says itself, was always there, pressing down.\n\nthe art is splendid, if funneled in vision. I can’t comment on its accuracy because I haven’t seen a russian bunker, or been trapped in one!!!, but despite the game’s documents, accuracy really wasn’t their deal. with the palette in mind, phantomery wanted an organic but oppressive environment. they use descension and darkness as tricks to speed it along, because there aren’t very many locations, and nothing up until the end really has any fantastical or shock factor to it. I really liked what I saw in the game and I feel like they could’ve have done it. their ambition to go above and beyond being a warehouse prison never fully materialized though. I stand by that the art is splendid, it is just stuck on a dull note. it works to cement, it’s just not quite impressive. too familiar for a horror game set in somewhere which by all respects should come across as unfamiliar.\n\nunleashed’s setting does more harm than good. though I admit I don’t know what was lost in translation, nothing besides the already immortalized documents give any authenticity to some kind of KGB UNLEASHED. you do explore a soviet bunker. beyond that, nothing at all is about soviets, or the KGB. nothing was unleashed. that boils down to a poor title choice, which is something I don’t need to rip at too much. what does exist is an absolute contrast to the writing found in the documents. the main character and the few people he converses with are unconvincingly acted with generic motivations, the rooms could have been part of any underground installation, and the paranormal aspects of the story don’t depend on being rooted in the past. the greatness of its accuracy becomes a weapon against itself because none of the game relies on it. it’s just situated, reminding you that this is about the KGB UNLEASHED, in a place that has no trace of the kgb. without all of the narrative linking up, the game’s purpose falls a little limp.\n\nwhat 1953 kgb unleashed delivers is a no-holds barred, no luxury given, absolutely traditional point-n-click with an interesting but not fully developed story. if you can forgive everything for the paranormal, it’ll be more than satisfying, because those aspects are done well. if you lust for a national treasure level of abstraction in your puzzle solving, phantomery has your bases covered. if you’re looking for a polished and sophisticated game, this ain’t got those definitions. if you want to relax, be lightly stimulated, and unwind to a good story, then there’s hundreds of other games to play. the unfriendliness and uncomfortability of unleashed drives in its oppressive atmosphere, yet that’s defending bad design choices in retrospect, masking their lack of awareness to a greater purpose. I’m alright with doing that. it’s a hell of a disorientating ride, its bad gives its good the proper momentum to overwhelm, and that it does.","April 2, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In KGB Unleashed it’s the usual journey of solving various puzzles and figuring out the meaning of various objects in each room. This game features more of the latter rather than the former. More often than not, I struggled to progress due to the obscurity of some elements, and despite the fact that I agree with the logic of each puzzle and the idea behind it, I believe it could have been far better designed. Many elements were misleading, or failed to emphasise the reason for its use. There are several examples I could give, one of which was a simple switch in a safe which gave no indication of what it did, yet it unlocked a door in another corridor that I did not realise until I had backtracked through most of the game to try and discover its purpose. In another part of the game, you have to descend a trap hole and there is a crate in the hole. Your cursor highlights to indicate there is something you need to do with the crate, but while I spent almost 10 minutes trying to open it, turns out it was actually where you had to put the tape recorder. Confusion like this could have been easily avoided by making the object anything other than a crate; a crate I had to break open not two rooms before.\n\nI almost quit outright in frustration upon the first 10 minutes of starting the game. I don’t know if it was just my settings, but the initial two rooms are dark, so you have to strain your eyes to hardly see anything and the incessant alarm tone became annoying and headache inducing very quickly, beating the puzzles to the punch. The game significantly lacks any Russian undertones, with the main character voiced with an English accent. Aside from some radio stations and a few scraps of propaganda, the game could be set in the USA or England and you wouldn’t notice any difference.\n\nThe ending became downright bizarre, ending very abruptly with little resolution. In the last area, you find a glass (hopefully) eyeball which you roll under a door. You can then look through the eyeball as if by magic and somehow that opens the door. Now here is a big spoiler for you, but the game stops, tells you that guy who has been talking to you is dead and then shoos you out the exit. The exit, by the way, is a subway tunnel that somehow goes directly into a bathroom and the wall just disappears after you pick up a subway token. It almost seems as though the developers gave up at this point, or just didn’t know how to end the game. It was an abrupt and confusing ending that severely jarred the experience.\n\nAside from me failing at puzzles, the game also failed on technical levels in many places. It’s very slow to load, which is very unusual for my high-end PC. It could take as long as ten seconds to load one room, yet I can load Fallout New Vegas with 50+ mods faster. It only had to do this once per room though, which reduced the annoyance, but it’s still unusual for a game of this era. I also had trouble with sluggish cutscenes that left me locked in the cutscene long after the dialouge ceased. There was also no option for subtitles, which was a bit problem for me when there was poor audio quality dialogue and I couldn’t understand what was said, making me miss what may have been important plot points.\n\nThe game looked decent, and the mood was set as it should have been, but it felt empty and void of any character. With constant backtracking to and from rooms, I tired from walking the same slow corridors over and over. It became a grind and that’s no fun at all.\n\nAn engine that just isn’t up to scratch, inconsistent gameplay and design ruined this game, which showed great potential. Some may enjoy the puzzles, I know some people who will get more satisfaction from games such as these than I do, but the price, the length of only a mere 2 or 3 hours coupled with all the letdowns made KGB Unleashed a great disappointment.\n\nAnd where was all the Vodka?

As a point-and-click adventure game, it does create a nice atmosphere. Some of the puzzles did not seem logical to me, so I had to consult outside help (a.k.a. YouTube) to get past them. The voice acting is a bit weak. I expect there was little to no direct given to the actors to let them know the context in which each line would be used in the game. I also had a difficult time understanding one of the voice actors because he was speaking so softly. Curiously, none of the voices have a Russian accent. I noticed several typographical errors in written documents. Given that the game was most likely originally written in Russian and later translated to English, I can understand these mistakes can happen. None of the typos affects the ability to enjoy and play the game, though. The ending is rather abrupt and seems to have been quickly added to complete the game as though finances had ended. Strangely, the ending does not answer any of the questions and seems more like the ending to the film "Raising Arizona" than a game titled "1953 - KGB Unleashed".\n\nAll told, I cannot recommend the game at the current price $9.99. I can, however, fully recommend the game if it is on sale or part of a bundle. It is unfortunate that Steam does not have a "Mixed" option for the "Do you recommend this game?" question.\n\n\nFollowing is a list of tips that may help you get more enjoyment from the game. Those that do not want help, should skip this section.\n\n1. This is not a hidden object game, so do not try to play that way.\n2. The mouse cursor will change when it is over something with which you can interact.\n3. If the mouse cursor indicates you can interact with something, but clicking on it does nothing, maybe you need to use something from your inventory.\n4. The beginning of the game is very dark and I could see very little. After increasing the brightness setting quite a bit in the game's settings, I was able to proceed with the game.\n5. You will need to do some backtracking, but not an excessive amount.\n6. Read all of the documents. Not only do they provide a great deal of the post-WWII Russian atmosphere, they also provide clues.","November 8, 2014","false","4.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You wake up in a bunker under Moscow and need to get out, discovering some weird war-experiments in the process. It is atmospheric, I will give it that and it looks good considering you are just looking at prerendered backdrops (at 1024x768px resolution!) with the occasional movieclip happening here and there. You can move the camera-angle, kinda like those "panoramic view" quicktime movies/flash apps that were popular some years ago - but that is about it, the game is otherwise almost completely static. Music and sfx are a mix of industrial noises you would expect in a bunker and some dark ambient tunes for setting the mood.\n\nAs I said, it manages to create an eerie atmosphere with very limited resources - but it is not really gripping. The "storyline" and I use that term vaguely, doesn't seem to go anywhere and the ending is plain weird (and not in a good sense) - almost feeling like they ran out of funds and had to finish it off. The topics covered in the story seem forced to sound deep but they are not really fleshed out in an yway, leaving you high and dry with some nice ideas but nothing substantial.\n\nThe puzzles while pretty decent in concept suffer from the very real chance to miss an important item and there being no clear indication what you can take or interact with until you have "scanned" the entire screen with your mousecursor, which made the game feel rather tedious (did I mention you can turn the cameraview 360 degrees? Have fun "pixelhunting"). Solving the puzzles is fun though, most of the solutions have you carefully study all the manuscripts and documents laying around, it can be overwhelming at times since you collect a nice amount of files along the way but I liked what they came up with for "bunker puzzles". Particularly the (almost) final puzzle with the postcard was great fun when it finally "clicked" - so there is definitely something good going on there. And most of the stuff is quite logical when you think about which I appreciate. However, a lot of the tasks require backtracking between the few locations and it can become irritating to frustrating if you get lost because you overlooked a minor detail.\n\nAll in all, the game feels dated - only running for me on "prehistoric" hardware did not help either. And despite the great setting and a few good puzzles there just isn't anything here to keep you playing and when you actually got into the groove of the game, it is suddenly over leaving you behind unsatisfied. It still might be worth it, if you are into the setting but otherwise it is just a kind of poorly written "short story" with a bit of a point'n'click adventure wrapped around it.\n\nNot really worth your time in my opinion.","December 31, 2013","false","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game has a great atmosphere, well done (albiet tough to follow) puzzles, and really unnerving documents that fit the setting. You really get the sense that you were left for dead in a old Soviet bunker and you're discovering through rooms and the many found documents of brutal experiments and executions that have taken place there.\n\nIf only the game didn't end so abruptly... Just as you find yourself getting deeper and deeper into the bunker, the game is building up to finding some really horrific stuff... A wall blows up and you walk out and the game ends.. And not only that, the character goes on to narrorate that he lives a long and happy life not once even referencing or questioning the events that took place. It comes so sudden, its almost like you can literally see the point where the devs hit the budget limit. Its a real shame.\n\nRegardless of it's awful ending, I do recommend 1953: KGB Unleashed.","October 10, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I wont over- embellish, but let me sum up why I am so dissatisfied with it. Main point - it is so short that it literally felt like the demo version. In fact, I have played games whose demo is longer than this entire game. You are thrown into the game as quickly as you are thrown out. There is no "welcome to the game" feel. Most games slowly set you up with simple tasks which prepare you for more challenging ones later on. With this you are thrown into a stagnant, colorless environment where nothing stand out, making it very frustrating when it came to solving a puzzle. The game actually started to get amazingly engaging and exciting. The music and sound effects are excellent, as was the direction of the story. This game really has amazing potential, but it ended so fast that it felt entirely meaningless. It is a weak, easy-to-forget game, simply because I just played and paid for a demo.

Nothing!\n\nBefore I start on my usual throw this abomination into the 410 shredder let me just say that there will be spoilers in this rant especially regards to the ending. Personally I feel that I am not ruining anything, but saving mankind in general (never thought of me as a savior did you?) from a fate worse than being locked in a room and forced to watch pride and prejudice.\n\nHow about we first start off with the mystery that no one knows even if this is an illegal game on Steam or not? A Russian web site link here provided http://gmbox.ru/…/igra-fobos-1953-byla-nelegalno-vypushchen… claims that '1953 KGB Unleashed' is a pirated renamed English copy of their game 'Phobos 1953' and that they have not been payed a single cent for what they are entitled to according to developer George Beloglasov. While other rumors have begun to circulate that the original developing company Phantomery Interactive Studios have since disbanded and again other rumors state that the developers signed over full rights unknowingly to the publishers and have no entitlement. With all that being said, basically no one has any idea what the truth is as no one has confirmed or denied any of these rumors. In fact some rumors have even stated that the developers knew what a dogs breakfast this game was and even chose to sell all rights to it. What is the real reason? Only time will tell.\n\nThe game advertises itself as a First Person Adventure and I myself personally bought it under this premise. This is very misleading, it's simply a point and click adventure, a 2d game disguised to look like a 3d game. To be even more precise its an extremely anal pixel hunter as the frames to click on are often so tiny and obscure, that it will often take you a billion random clicks before you find what your suppose to click on. This is done purposefully as the developers themselves know that the game is extremely short and the amount of puzzles needing to be solved are a handful, so they have evidently chosen to stretch the game out by making it a laborious click and find chore.\n\nThe graphic presentation in this game is actually really well done and more often than not it is nearly quite photogenic. The game begins with Moscow as it would appear during that time period with life buzzing around the streets, the camera then pans down through the ground and into a secret bunker under the streets where the character you play begins to gain consciousness with memory loss as to who he in fact is. Paperwork on him suggests that he is some type of maintenance man and he has awoken in a closed section of the a bunker with a blaring alarm caused through some type of industrial accident.\n\nIt is actually quite an impressive introduction into the game, but unfortunately then the game begins. First your greeted to the sound of an emergency alarm which is more grating than an alarm clock on a new years hangover. Seriously it just doesn't shut up, couple this with the fact that your in a dark room and you have to find something to click on which is the size of a penny does not make for a fun time.\n\nAs you progress further through this bunker your character begins to remember that he was in fact a maintenance man sworn to secrecy not to divulge any secrets about the experimentation's that they were performing here. He was hired on a whims notice given the task to fix certain machinery which was crucial to 'the experiment' before the accident happened and he awoke. Wandering further and further through the small labyrinth of corridors and rooms you learn of the KGB's secret experiments that range from biological to electro-therapy and even into ESP and telekinesis. Here's where things begin to get creepy. Certain documents littered around the floor show that those being interviewed were able to control objects with their mind and even people, forcing them to do things that they normally would not. They claim that in order to do this they have to empty their mind and that sometime that they can bring things back with them.\n\nBefore you know it, now enters the concept of the supernatural as the 'experiment' that they were fundamentally interested in is communicating with the dead, especially with the people that they had just killed. Your character is then given the task to reproduce the experiment in order to understand fully what was going on.\n\nBefore I go on, I forgot to mention that you soon discover the fact that your not alone and that there is both someone who is somehow tracking your every movement and communicating to you through the loud speaker. He sounds like Mr Jigsaw from all the 'Saw' movies and talks in riddles as if this is all some sort of test. You further communicate to someone else over the intercom who you find is trapped in another compartment in the bunker.\n\nOk going back. While you recreate the experiment you discover a door where your esp begins to flare up and tells you that there is something extremely evil on the other side of the door. Don't worry you never find out what it is, it might be more of the mysterious shadows that seem to zoom around chase you around down there and get your heart all in a flutter.\n\nAnyway after recreating the experiment successfully you mysteriously black out and awaken in another foreign part of the bunker not far from someone who has been freshly murdered probably the same person you just saved over the intercom. If someone who was part of the original experiments were forcing you to black out and commit these atrocious acts is never really explained, but it is possible.\n\nSo far the story at this point is somewhat semi plausible and interesting, this is the point where as I can tell two things must have happened. 1) The original developing company here disbanded and 2) The circus animals were allowed to take over and finish it off.\n\nAre you seriously ready for this? Your character through the power of his mind he is able to create a subway tunnel to appear in a toilet. Here, he discovers he can do practically anything with the power of his mind given the right fear.  In fact he was even able to use a not connected eyeball, place it under the door, and by using the power of his mind, see the lock on the other side of the door, and open it. After creating a whole subway tunnel with the power of his mind, he then goes on to live a normal and happy life. After all this your forced as a gamer to ask yourself 'what the hell is this crap I have just sat through?!'\n\nWould you honestly pay a builder who only builds you half a house? This was an awful lot like that. Why would anyone want to buy this when evidently only half a decent job done and the rest of it is just a rushed, cut every corner you can, story?\n\nThe game was originally designed to be a prequel to this movie.. link here provided... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489253/ and here is a preview of that movie ... http://youtu.be/Tiy5I5t3uzw which also received abysmal scores for shoddy finished work.\n\nIn final Thumbs down for something that could have been very promising but unfortunately badly orchestrated and even worse delivered.","January 1, 2015","false","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seriously it just doesn't shut up, couple this with the fact that your in a dark room and you have to find something to click on which is the size of a penny does not make for a fun time.\n\nAs you progress further through this bunker your character begins to remember that he was in fact a maintenance man sworn to secrecy not to divulge any secrets about the experimentation's that they were performing here. He was hired on a whims notice given the task to fix certain machinery which was crucial to 'the experiment' before the accident happened and he awoke. Wandering further and further through the small labyrinth of corridors and rooms you learn of the KGB's secret experiments that range from biological to electro-therapy and even into ESP and telekinesis. Here's where things begin to get creepy. Certain documents littered around the floor show that those being interviewed were able to control objects with their mind and even people, forcing them to do things that they normally would not. They claim that in order to do this they have to empty their mind and that sometime that they can bring things back with them.\n\nBefore you know it, now enters the concept of the supernatural as the 'experiment' that they were fundamentally interested in is communicating with the dead, especially with the people that they had just killed. Your character is then given the task to reproduce the experiment in order to understand fully what was going on.\n\nBefore I go on, I forgot to mention that you soon discover the fact that your not alone and that there is both someone who is somehow tracking your every movement and communicating to you through the loud speaker. He sounds like Mr Jigsaw from all the 'Saw' movies and talks in riddles as if this is all some sort of test. You further communicate to someone else over the intercom who you find is trapped in another compartment in the bunker.\n\nOk going back. While you recreate the experiment you discover a door where your esp begins to flare up and tells you that there is something extremely evil on the other side of the door. Don't worry you never find out what it is, it might be more of the mysterious shadows that seem to zoom around chase you around down there and get your heart all in a flutter.\n\nAnyway after recreating the experiment successfully you mysteriously black out and awaken in another foreign part of the bunker not far from someone who has been freshly murdered probably the same person you just saved over the intercom. If someone who was part of the original experiments were forcing you to black out and commit these atrocious acts is never really explained, but it is possible.\n\nSo far the story at this point is somewhat semi plausible and interesting, this is the point where as I can tell two things must have happened. 1) The original developing company here disbanded and 2) The circus animals were allowed to take over and finish it off.\n\nAre you seriously ready for this? Your character through the power of his mind he is able to create a subway tunnel to appear in a toilet. Here, he discovers he can do practically anything with the power of his mind given the right fear.  In fact he was even able to use a not connected eyeball, place it under the door, and by using the power of his mind, see the lock on the other side of the door, and open it. After creating a whole subway tunnel with the power of his mind, he then goes on to live a normal and happy life. After all this your forced as a gamer to ask yourself 'what the hell is this crap I have just sat through?!'\n\nWould you honestly pay a builder who only builds you half a house? This was an awful lot like that. Why would anyone want to buy this when evidently only half a decent job done and the rest of it is just a rushed, cut every corner you can, story?\n\nThe game was originally designed to be a prequel to this movie.. link here provided... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489253/ and here is a preview of that movie ... http://youtu.be/Tiy5I5t3uzw which also received abysmal scores for shoddy finished work.\n\nIn final Thumbs down for something that could have been very promising but unfortunately badly orchestrated and even worse delivered.","January 1, 2015","false","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In most other genres (puzzle games excluded), the player spends most of their time progressing.  In P&CAs, the player spends most of their time not progressing.  They spend in thinking about progressing--trying to figure out how to move forward.

Players must uncover the dark and horrifc secrets buried within, fighting their own paranoia along the way as well as the possibility of all-too-real terrors within the bunker. Are the voices emanating from all around you real, or just an hallucination resulting from your isolation? Will you manage to escape into the warm embrace of daylight, or will you be trapped within the foreboding menace of the bunker?\n\nOnly in 1953 – KGB Unleashed can the answers be found!\n\n“1953 – KGB Unleashed” is based on real projects conducted by the Ministry of State Security of the USSR (the former KGB). During that time they pushed the limits of human endurance, testing for the possibility of telepathy, as well as researching the psychological impact of fear on the human brain. The photo-realistic visual style of “1953 – KGB Unleashed” recreates the USSR of the fifties: the underground shelter’s interior is constructed using real Soviet military plans, and the materials found there are based on historically valid documents.\n\nExplore a hidden laboratory where such experiments were conducted in order to learn the truth behind the terrifying events that led to the closure of the project and the liquidation of its staff. An atmosphere of isolation and suspense pervades throughout, bringing you face to face with your own fears, while the voice of invisible “observer” broadcasts over the internal communications system.

The bunker the game takes place in is even, supposedly, based on actual design documents. The game itself is rather short: I finished in just over two hours. I’ll admit I used a walkthrough if I couldn’t figure out what to do in a minute or two.\n\nFor the most part the puzzles were quite good. Clues and items were fairly easy to match to the environment. Almost all the puzzles relied quite heavily on documents found throughout the bunker. This can make it difficult to solve puzzles if you miss something. One of the early puzzles makes use of a radio. I missed the first clue entirely, and didn’t connect the second clue until I read the solution. That being said, I think it was my favourite puzzle.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game was quite good. There were a couple places in the late game that I would definitely classify as creepy. The most disappointing thing about the game was the ending. It didn’t make sense, and it felt like it was cut short of the original intent.\n\nVerdict:\nGet it in a bundle or heavily discounted.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRILLERDUD/recommended/248490/","DRILLERDUD","Yao Mung","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRILLERDUD/","396 products in account","Watch the video version of this written review here: https://youtu.be/2SQEBNz-_SY\n\nI’ve never really been one for adventure games. For some reason, pointing and clicking my way through a story just never really gelled with me the way it does some people. And that’s a shame because I know I’m missing out on some classic titles such as Day Of The Tentacle, Grim Fandango, the Myst series, The Neverhood, The Monkey Island series, Full Throttle, the Leisure Suit Larry series, the Kings Quest series, Planescape: Torment, Sanitarium, I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, the Sam + Max series, or even Phantasmagoria…to name a few. For me, I have a patience problem when it comes to games like this. If I get stuck, I get flustered. When I get flustered, I get impatient. When I get impatient, I stop thinking logically. When I stop thinking logically, I halt all progress in my game. When that happens, I either quit and don’t come back for a while or I look up a walkthrough. That’s me. Criticize it if you must, but that is who I am.\nFor the purpose of reviewing the absolute astronomical backlog of my Steam library, as well as the folder of independent games I have separate from that, as well as the various games I have on physical CD, I’m not going to lie when I say I powered through 1953: KGB Unleashed. Every time I got stuck, I had a walkthrough ready to get me out of the sometimes embarrassingly easily-solvable problems I had. Not because it’s a bad point-and-click style adventure game, but because it’s not usually the kind of genre I’d find myself playing, let along reviewing. And if I want to get through this backlog, I can’t be wasting my time trying to figure it out on my own if I seriously don’t know what to do. Is that compromising the integrity of my journalism? When I heard about The Secret Of Monkey Island 2’s “ Monkey 2 Lite” difficulty mode, which streamlined the entire game and either held your hand when solving puzzles or just took you right past ones that were intended to be solved, my reaction was a hearty, “Great!”. The back of the box even states that this mode was perfect for game reviewers. Many might take this as an insult, but I don’t care. My point is a matter of preference. I’m not the type to be reviewing these types of games. Yet I wasn’t going to skip over 1953, because since it was in my library, I had to give it a shot. I don’t know why I bought it, but I did. Better get my money’s worth. I think it was on sale one day and it looked interesting, so I picked it up. Damn Steam sales will be the death of me.\nI’ll give credit to Phantomery Interactive, they’ve created a really nice atmosphere in this Soviet bunker you find yourself in at the beginning of the game. Each environment is very well drawn and/or rendered, so the eye-candy is on a good level here. The sound mixing is also done very well. The voice acting is the lone hiccup here, which is an odd one because your character sounds very Midwestern United States-y for a native Russian. Even if they couldn’t spend much in terms of voice actors, even just having someone do a bad Russian accent would have been better in this situation, because each time the main character speaks to himself it just takes you right out of the well-crafted Russian atmosphere you’re in, which you don’t want to happen because the environment and its atmosphere is the best part about this game. The puzzles had me stuck on more than one occasion, and not without good reason. A couple require a heightened ability to comprehend how some things are supposed to work. My dumbed-down description of them speaks to how different they are. There’s not a whole lot of fetching-missing-objects-in-order-to-fix-plot-devices-type adventuring here. In the first ten minutes of the game, I had to repower a generator by flipping switches in what looked like a parallel-wired control panel on the floor. I guess I had to flip the right switches that matched the voltage on the generator itself, but each switch had its own numbers that made no sense to me and that was the first time I had to consult a Youtube walkthrough. There’s another one similar to that later in the game, and getting between those comprehension puzzles is no big deal, it’s just that I can only fiddle around with switches for so long before I get impatient and immediately look up the solution. I tried to play this game as straight as I could, I really did, but I don’t make these connections as well as other people who love adventure games do. It’s a wonder that I got out of The Connection alive.\nSo with the help of a walkthrough, I got to experience the mystery of this bunker and….it wasn’t a real compelling one. The majority of the exposition was delivered through files and papers you happened across in the different rooms, save for a couple of flashbacks to previous events playing out in the same room you happened to find yourself in. And usually after you’ve done some important puzzle and return to the hallway that connects many of the rooms together, a voice will come on the loudspeaker, speaking directly to you about some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and then you’d expect to regain control of your game but for some reason you just linger there for about ten seconds before you’re able to move around again. Did they want some extra time for the man in the loudspeaker’s words to sink in? Because I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t really listen to him.\nBut at least there’s the added intrigue of who this guy is, and you have another objective to go along with getting the hell out of this bunker. The story moves along and takes a little twist before the end, but even when you find an exit of some sort (and this is probably considered a spoiler, but you have a right to know before you put 3 or so hours into this game)…absolutely no resolution is offered after your escape. Why were you there? What is to come of all this laboratory testing and disease research? Is anybody else who was there before even still alive? None of this is answered. Instead, the main character tells you how he lives out the rest of his life, completely neglecting to mention if he followed up on this mystery or just counted his blessings and left that for somebody else to figure out. It’s a real odd choice to end a story like that, offering little to no explanation, and it almost completely nullifies all the time I spent getting this American guy out of a KGB bunker. So much care seems to have been put into actually creating the game, it’s a wonder why they didn’t dream up a story to match that level of effort.\nSo if you really like adventure games, this is a competent one. But view it as an exercise for your point-and-click adventure game capabilities, because according to the game itself, that’s not the focus here.","April 12, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You wake to find yourself trapped in a room. Slowly you ♥♥♥♥ together the world around you in this point and click adventure. Set in Soviet Russia [Insert Soviet Russia joke here] bomb shelter you must escape the ever interesting atmosphere to get out alive.\n\nAppearance: The game is a P&C adventure with many twists and turns. The visuals are stunning and the music plays into the theme perfectly. When needed you will find yourself feeling rather tense as you continue the story, which of course is an excellent trait for a game. The controls are pretty good with solid movements. This takes a page out of the Myst world by having you move screen to screen without fluid movement.\n\nGameplay: This takes a page out of the Myst world by having you move screen to screen without fluid movement. You wonder around the world interacting with objects as needed. At some points it became incredibly difficult to solve the puzzles without the help of a guide. Sadly I had to resort to this at certain points. A lack of help raises the difficulty which may be more than some gamers wish for.\n\nAchievements: No achievements other than enjoying the game.\n\nBottom Line: This game is a fairly fun game to play. It's a few hours worth of gameplay and the story is a joy. That being said it looks like it retails for $5.99 USD and honestly I would pay full price for this. Its an OK game with flaws perhaps when its on sale or thrown in with a bundle it could be worth it.","June 12, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm saying this because the puzzles are way, way too hard for a casual gamer or a gamer who doesn't usually play these kind of games (like me). By using a walkthrough, I was able to enjoy the atmosphere and the story to he full extent without beating myself over the puzzles.\n\nThe atmosphere is terrific. You can feel the desolation, desperation and hopelessness in the claustophobic environments. The graphics are nice, the sound effects are superb, and the soundtrack fits the game like a glove.\n\nThe story is very intriguing, and it has a very big potential but the lackluster (though the word lackluster is a massive understatement here) ending ruins the gravity of the setting. It feels like they had to rush the game at the 90% mark.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you're willing to play it like I did. If you're going to solve the puzzles yourself, don't bother with buying this game.","January 30","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be fair, I'd actually disagree with a lot people saying this game is the ultimate pixel-hunting offender. I don't think the puzzles are good or interesting, but clickboxes for most objects are large enough that if you're just moving your mouse around the screen a couple times attempting to find interactive things, you'll find them.\n\nThe best thing it has going for it is the atmosphere it creates, undoubtedly. It is genuinely creepy, nervewracking, and just... it just feels wrong at times. Like you're investigating an unholy site that needs to be forgotten, and I suppose that's what the game tries to convey so it succeeds in that respect. The ending is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥ and makes 0 sense, and not in a good way where you're asking questions. In a completely anti-climactic way that makes you wonder why you wasted your 4 hours. Probably one of the worst, most "OK! Cut! We're outta money/ideas" endings I've ever seen in any piece of media--movie, video game, book, tv...anything. It's awful.\n\nSorta just not really worth the time.\n\n________________________________________\n\nPros:\n\n-Creepy, unnerving atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n\n-The worst, most awful, dumb ending that shouldn't have made it into a product that leans on it's narrative and theme.\n-Boring, dumb, occassionally unintuitve puzzles.
