It isn't that expensive for what you get out of it and it is still fun to play after you finish the game just to try and beat your own scores etc.\nYou run, jump, smash and fly your way through more than 45(!) weird and well designed platform levels with low-gravity, world rotation, giant monsters and swarming missiles. There are so many different and interesting concepts in this game and it is just a good time :P\n\nAs I was jumping my way through the game I constantly found myself headbanging to the music and just having a lot of fun. As of the story, there is not that much too it, it mostly contains of butts and bad puns. So if you were looking for a brutally difficult platformer with a "good" story, this might not be for you although I enjoyed every bit of it!\nSomething else to note is that this is a very over the top game with a lot of flashing lights so if that is what you're looking for then go ahead and buy it ;)\n\nElectronic Super Joy is an overall satisfying and well done hardcore platformer filled with bad puns, awesome electronic styled music and more(see disclaimer at the start of the game).\nIf all of the above or some of it is to your liking then this game is for you my friend! :D\n\n- Liam","November 29, 2013","true","48.7"," 88 of 105 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","88","105","0","4"

Great artstyle and level design. Some levels might get frustrating after failing a few times in a row and some of them really got my nerves on, yet, I managed to not rage quit a single time throughout the entire game which makes me feel great! Now, I gotta be honest, the soundtrack plays a HUGE role on how you actually experience the game, it's really REALLY good! I honestly don't know if playing Electronic Super Joy with the sound and music turned off would make it an interesting and enjoyable game but what matters is that the soundtrack was made to be played along with the game and it fits perfectly. On addition to the "Story Mode", you can also unlock 4 levels by collecting stars that you can find in each level and there's an infinite mode which puts you on a series of levels until you fail, the trick is that if you go and play Infinite mode again you'll probably play different levels. I believe I have nothing more to add, Electronic Super Joy is a great game and it features an awesome soundtrack, you should totally check it out if you're a fan of platformers or electronic music!","October 13, 2013","true","4.1"," 42 of 58 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","42","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/recommended/244870/","thistauruslovesgames","Hermix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/","193 products in account","Electronic Super Joy. A 2-Dimensional partially-difficult platformer with fitting electronic soundtrack (courtesy of EnV) and simple yet vivid colors.\n\nMajority of the game is a basic story. The Wanderer (You) runs off in search of the Evil Wizard, who so happens to have his (your) butt. He shall seek VENGEANCE for his booty!\n\nThe objective of the game is to journey throughout a puzzling world, from one portal to another. As you progress in the game, various enemies and obstacles await your way, doing whatever they can to stop you. Your character's powers vary on the particular stages that you enter, but (as far as I know) he is able to stomp, double jump, and fly. If you keep watch of the stages, you'll see white stars; when all are collected, they unlock one last world that's separate from the main three. Legitimately, there are three bosses, two are a part of the adventure and one that's included in the fourth world.\n\nMy opinions of it all:\nThe Good\nUpon first playing this game, I nearly finished half the game in several sleepless hours (staying up during the evening hours and into the morning hours of the next day). With that being said, I fell addicted to this game just as fast as I did Super Hexagon. Like most games, it starts fairly easy and gradually becomes hard upon reaching the end. Though levels on the first go easily frustrated and angered me, I managed to still like the action. If it wasn't for the amazing soundtrack, I don't know; I may have just given up and stopped playing this game for some extended period of time out of complete rage. And those achievements; they add more challenges to it all for any that want to prove themselves to be hardcore or professional in the name of gaming.\n\nThe Bad\n(It's an indie game with patches and updates, so I should have already adapted to some of the following you are about to read.) I experienced what may be considered a bug when it came to saves. Returning back into ESJ, I noticed that everything had been erased, though Steam still presented the achievements I've received when I last played. Uhm, I also witnessed a slight overuse in lasers for several stages as well, but that's what makes them more of a challenge. And aside from the enraging difficulty that the creators and developers have made all of this to be, I can't really find any other issues or tweaking suggestions.\n\nOverall\nRecommended that you give it a try if interested in this game. Acrade-styled and filled with action, Electronic Super Joy has managed to make me laugh, scream, cry, and face-palm so many times and in so many ways. If it ever happens, I would love to see some more adventures implemented into this game in the future. And to conclude this section of the review, the music, it has to have your butt moving somehow... even if you're not a fan of the electronica genre.\n\n--Sir Shinigami.","March 3, 2014","true","72.7"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","1"

If not, play Electronic Super Joy!\n\nThis game is fantastic! Sometimes is a bit unfair, but that's how masocore games (trial and error) are supposed to be. At first, you'll lose the count of how many times you died, but with practicing you won't believe you finally passed that damn level! The pulsing music will get you pumped and also helps to make the experience much more enjoyable. There's a lot of replay value if you try to improve your times and/or want to get the achievements.\n\nIf you liked ESJ I recommend to buy the mini-sequel "Groove City". It's much more shorter than this game, but has a level editor and a lot of community made levels. It means even more replay value and some crazy stuff fans created.\n\nI think Electronic Super Joy worth the full price, but if you buy it on a sale it's an absolute steal. Even if you're not experienced with masocore games, but are a fan of old-school platformers, you'll like ESJ.

If I were to give this game a more conventional rating it would be something like 6/10.\n\nFirst, the derivative bits: It's another "faux retro" platformer scored with electronic music and made a low tech art style, built to encourage 100% completion and intending to keep you playing by being brutally difficult. In this regard it's in the fleet of games where Super Meat Boy has been serving as the flagship.\n\nSo what about the differentiating aspect? The mix being attempted is just too difficult to pull off without compromising something without robbing the sensation that the player is able to master the game. Essentially the problem is that the game seems to be trying to marry games that have a highly mobile, bullet spamming protagonist who can dodge just about everything and constantly shoot with precision platforming, which simply doesn't work. The design choice seems to have been rather than compromising on the platforming to make an interesting platformer-bullet hell hybrid (Drunken Robot Pornography does quite a great job at this), or compromise by making the bullets easily spoofed and prone to the kind of memorization and reflexes you use on precision platformers, they chose to try and be uncompromising on both fronts. I don't think it works because it robs me of the illusion of controlling the course of gameplay; after beating a difficult level on Dustforce or Super Meat Boy I feel proud of myself, but this game more makes me just feel lucky.\n\nI should clarify that most of the game is not like this, I only point it out as important because I think these segments are what truly set this game apart. I think this important distinguishing trait did not play out very well.\n\nOther than that the game is competent but doesn't really add anything new or special to other precision platformers. A similar game with somewhat similar (but better) art would be They Bleed Pixels. It is an easier game but it captures some of the bullet hell ideas in a similar fashion to this game on limited sections on later levels without compromising on the important illusion of control a precision platformer needs.","December 21, 2013","false","3.3"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","34","56","2","2"

This entire journey is to find and defeat the one that took his butt. The story is really simple, and is told through quick dialog that's thrown out to you as you go through the level. It doesn't take itself seriously, it's very silly, and you'll get some laughs out of it.\n\nGameplay is very addictive. It mostly involves around precision platforming, an endurance race outrunning the screen while dodging obstacles, or surviving an onslaught of missles which you need to get rid of. There are 5 worlds with 20 stages each, lasting any time from 10 seconds to a couple minutes; with the exception of World 4). It sounds short, but it's a hard game. A very hard game, later on. You need to bring your platforming A-Game if you want to survive the difficulty it brings.You can think of it as Super Meat Boy, but a little less extreme. As you can tell, this game would be ideal for platforming lovers and gamers who love a good challenge, and I'm both of those. Achievements further reward your skills with painful goals such as earning zero deaths on each level, or beating all the time trials. If you love challenge, and want to be tested, this is for you. For other game modes, there's Infinite Love Mode, where you try and go through as many microstages as you can in a row before you fail. There's also No Checkpoint Mode for the most hardcore players out there.\n\nThe soundtrack is one of the highlights that everyone keeps talking about, and rightfully so. The game offers many tracks to keep your spirits high and your ears a lovely taste of music with each step. For most people, it's what keeps them going, and offers motivation to move on  to continually hear the amazing beats this game pulls out. I suggest you find the soundtrack when you can.\n\nOverall, Electronic Super Joy is a fantastic difficult platformer with stellar music and a hearty challenge that platforming enthusiasts would surely love, and achievement hunters will get a run for their money.\n\n8/10","April 8, 2015","true","12.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowd63/recommended/244870/","shadowd63","Mykatracerasu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowd63/","78 products in account","Electronic Super Joy\nVisuals:\nThe game’s visuals are dynamic and wonderful to experience. It is apparent that every visual style done between levels has been manipulated to make every level dissimilar from each other. Therefore, traveling from level to level is never tedious and is instead always a pleasant surprise. Although the foreground is black, it is ripe with detail while backgrounds are bright and a great contrast to the monochrome foreground. Small things like the moving pieces in the background are a faultless addition and sync perfectly with the music. It’s not photorealistic, but for a game like this, it has no need to be.\n9/10 – Damn near close to perfect.\nAudio:\nI’m a musician myself. I know that it takes a certain level of self-control to be able to write multiple brilliantly catchy pieces without making them sound too similar to each other. EnV did a wonderful job here. To be honest - the "electronic-only" music isn’t really needed because through development it could have been any style (it’s most likely there because “Electronic” is in the title, duh) but it is well integrated, and fits nice and snug in an essential part of the game that is very hard to explain in words. It works, whether someone is crazy over electronic music or not. In terms of SFX; jumping, smashing, double jumping, those arrow or star thingies, and checkpoints are spot on. (Guys, where did you get the SFX for the PG Checkpoints? Did you record them?)\n10/10 – Perfectly Integrated.\nPlot:\nThe Plot is ludicrous. Absolutely ludicrous. I was actually surprised to find one to be honest – a hardcore platformer really doesn’t need one. Long story short – your butt is stolen and you need to get it back “Taken” style. That's as developed as it gets, and I don’t want to go into ESJ’s anatomy to see how that’s possible and open up a ton of plot buttholes on the way, so that’s all I’m saying. However random it is, and however unneeded it is, I have to rate it how bad it is. Sorry guys.\n3/10 – It’d be a 2 if it wasn’t random enough to be fairly amusing.\nGameplay:\nWell guys, here we go. The skeleton of any platforming game is the gameplay. I am glad to report that controls are tight as they should be. Gameplay is fun too, to an extent that new players will find picking up the game a perfect challenge while older players will be able to still enjoy the 2 button controls (4 if you count quick re-spawn and restart). The difficulty curve has no real spikes, so the game paces itself very well. Level transitioning is fluent and instant, which can lead to some frustration, but all caused by the player. Even though there is some difficulty to them, some levels are actually enjoyable to play, not matter how hard they are, which is something that is very hard to accomplish. Simply put, you are always put into a situation where you die because it was you that did something wrong, not the game.\n8/10 – Very well done.\nReplay-ability:\nEver since the invention of leaderboards, games have always existed to see who is better. Life’s a competition right? Electronic Super Joy has a brilliant leaderboard where checking individual levels, worlds or the total time is available. Apart from this, the game has very little replay-ability. There is the infinite love game-mode, and I’m sure that developers will add more game modes over-time, once you get the 25+ achievement then there is no more incentive to play. On top of that, it seems that the game is way too short for it’s own good.  That’s just a personal gripe though.\n6/10 – Fairly re-playable, but not for too long.\nConclusion:\nIn the end, Electronic super joy comes off as a very strong platformer, and it's my personal favourite for this year. I hope to grind more into this game getting to the top 10 (My OCD won’t allow #14 global rank) and I hope that everyone else that reads this hopes to join me. What a gem.\nOverall Score: 36/50     Personal Score: 44/50","December 25, 2013","true","22.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Just as you are getting use to a power and getting good with it, the powers switch. I can see how some would like this constant change up but it felt as though there was lost potential, with no levels requiring the player to use each power skillfully like fly smash and double jump.\n-A world of levels is locked behind collectibles (admittedly this world only consists of 5 levels).\n- I did not find the humor or story of the game amusing personally, so I turned on the pg mode to get rid of the obnoxious moaning sounds after EVERY death and just enjoyed the tunes.\n\nAlthough it looks like a lot of cons and only 1 pro, I did enjoy the game very much, and would recommend it at this low price.","May 21","true","2.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

It's a stylish seizure-inducingly fun game, but unfortunately falls short in a lot of ways. Simply contrasting it with Super Meat Boy, you can understand in what ways it falls short. For one, the main game is incredibly short at around 2 hours for myself. For being a  'difficult' platformer, I only struggled for any significant amount of time on 2 or 3 levels. The mechanics of the game are fairly simple and effective, but almost get a tad boring. Certain aspects of the game like sexual moaning at checkpoints and lock-on missiles are ok at first, but get quite tiresome after the first 1000 repetitions.\n\nEither way, ESJ is a polished and entertaining platformer that is worth picking up on sale.","May 26, 2015","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I mean, it's good and all, but it somewhat falls flat on some key points.\n\nThe story in the game pretty much consist of putting the biggest number of obscenities possible. Thankfully, you can easily skip it.\n\nFor the Gameplay, it's quite spot on. The controls feels a bit clunky at first, but once used to it, the are quite good and responsible.\nOne of the problem lies in the level design. So many times, I died because it was almost some pixel perfect ♥♥♥♥. I know it's advertised as "hardcore", "challenging" and all, but it's so frustrating.\n\nIf there's one thing about the controls that I hate, it's that you can jump 3-4 frames after dropping of a platform, making a longer jump. It's never explained anywhere, and it seems mandatory to do in the couple of last levels.\n\nFor the soundtrack, it's simple. If you like electro, and you like what you heard in the trailer, you'll pretty much like it all.\nYou should go for it if you're looking for a challenge, an hard as nail platformer.\nPlease note that the game is quite short, but you'll surely spend lots of time trying to beat those levels.","March 26","true","7.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The visual style whilst rhymically mesmerizing matching the beat of the music, can cause motion sickness so take that into consideration before purchase. With a hilarious over the top story Electronic Super Joy never takes itself too seriously which is enjoyable even if your struggling with a level. Never once did I feel cheated as the level designs are fair with an exception or two, and with enough tries all are possible to beat. The game is relatively short in retrospect, however the high diffiuclty will easily add several hours onto your play time as it is likely you will have to retry several levels.

It starts off with a bit o' exposition to set the scene. The dramatis personae: a guy that can run and jump. His harrowing journey has taken him many places and taken much from him. Most importantly, he lost his butt to a Groove Wizard.  It's your job to guide him through his most worthy of quests: to avenge that badonka-donk.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is this game brings the colors and it brings the beats. The backgrounds are a deliciously seizurey array of colors, but they fall just short of being the eye-bliss that they were clearly intended to be. The music is electronic wub-wub ear joy that made me want to pull out some glowsticks and get felt up by the nearest European. Mix that together with the bleak, monochrome foregrounds and you get a sort of oppressive-but-fun atmosphere, like some kind of mandatory dance party in a dystopian police state. However, that's not the whole formula. Lastly, we need to add some love. Some definitely not PG-13 love. When you die or reach a checkpoint, you hear moans, "oh yeah"s, some dude saying "ohh la la" and even some heavy breathing. Clearly, this game is intended for an audience that knows where babies come from.\n\nAnd believe you me, you'll have plenty of chances to hear your computer getting hot and heavy with some sound files because you're going to die. A lot. Unfortunately, the checkpoints are spaced too close together, robbing the game of the hardcore-ness that it seemed to be shooting for, instead leaving you with a series of bite-sized chunks of platforming to memorize and toss away. However, those bite-sized chunks happen to have a lot of variety, off-beat humor (the first boss is the Pope in a spaceship) and, well, fun. Of course, it can be made hardcore-er by trying for runs where you don't die or beat a time goal, but I never found myself interested enough to bother.\n\nElectronic Super Joy falls a little short of the bar set by other recent hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but pulls what it has together well enough to make it well worthwhile for any fan of platformers. What the game lacks in polish and length (sorry, no level editor) it makes up for in humor and general originality. At $8.00, it's definitelyworth picking up, even if it isn't on sale.","December 27, 2013","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

An deviously challenging minimalist platformer, it jogs along at the frenetic pace of its pulse pounding sound track, never once caring if you can't keep up so long as the beat keeps thumping. The music is the heart and soul of the experience, synchronizing with the levels to create a unique and irresistibly catchy game that doesn't need to reinvent its gameplay to remain fresh.\n\nDespite the somewhat small supply of them, the level variety is far more inventive than most games of the genre, cleverly utilizing its fantastic visuals and music to continually test your reflexes while also giving and taking new moves from you with reckless abandon. One moment you will be smashing jump pads to cross humongous gaps, the next the entire level will flip on its side and still require you to complete it. ESJ is full of memorable sections not because you will likely spend several hundred lives completing them (which you will), but because they are so original and surprising and yet so quickly tossed away in favor of something new and exciting.\n\nBut in the end it all comes down to the music, the sweet sweet soundtrack to your demise that is simply incredible, easily ranking among my favorite OSTs of the year. No matter how many time I died or wanted to snap my controller in half out of frustration, the electronic bass heavy tracks kept me coming back (not only in game, but outside it, it's that good). When pared with the outwardly uncomplicated but highly stylized graphical style it is hard not to become entranced by the beat, making it very bothersome to try and pull yourself away.\n\nIf you can handle the arduous challenge and are a fan of tight platforming, stop reading this and buy Electronic Super Joy! It's an incredibly well crafted mix of electro music and triumphant gameplay, with a wicked sense of humor and a slick presentation. It might be but a few hours long, but with beats like this you know you'll want to come back for seconds!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 1, 2014","true","3.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

It's a sloppy "tough" platformer that has lousy hit detection, is poorly paced, and has completely unfunny "monkey cheese" humor. If they're trying to make it goofy, weird funny, they failed pretty hard. Getting revenge on your butt? And that whole episode with the Pope? C'mon, that's childish stuff. There's no one aesthetic bringing it all together, either - the rave music, the gameplay, the humor, it just doesn't mesh well. By the time I had to repeat the frustrating stages over and over again and listen to the fake "moaning" noises each time I respawned, I got sick of it. (On a side note, Valve, the six letter word that starts with "o" is not a swear.

The humor is sharp and the music is awesome, and while there are many platformers that are "challenging," Electronic Super Joy feels more like Super Meat Boy on LSD. Infinite checkpoints (complete with sexy moans and oh yeahs) make sure you're never too far off course, and the gameplay is tight and constantly changing. The final boss in particular is a nerve wracking experience in that I personally both loved and despised, for it took me far too many tries to finish even though I knew what I had to do.\n\nThis game is not for the faint of heart, and there were plenty of areas that made me stop and take breaks after many frustrating failures. At the same time, the game is not strictly a barebones platformer. Many mechanics are implemented through out such as changing gravity and a constantly changing move set, but there are plenty of moments where ESJ becomes more like a bullet hell shooter, keeping the freshness around even after I felt I'd seen it all.\n\nIt feels unfair to compare this Meat Boy, for the platforming has a very different feel than many games of the genre, nor is it as nearly precise, even though it demands it. This often led me to most of my frustrations as I found it harder and harder to play out what I was supposed to do, for the controls can be extremely touchy, even with a gamepad. There were plenty of moments where my palms were sweating less out of nerves than frustration, but these sections are not common and did not ruin my enjoyment.\n\nPlenty of modes are offered as well, including an endless runner that I enjoyed a bit more than I should've. There are also four bonus levels that you can unlock once you find all the collectable stars, but they pose a challenge that far exceeded my abilities, as I only managed to complete one of them. I got half way through the second before being driven insane by some of the obstacles, and the other two including I tried a few times before calling it quits. Completionists will enjoy the increased challenge, but for me the fun quickly waned.\n\nAll in All, Electronic Super Joy is a fantastic but flawed game that far surpasses most games that come out of the indie scenes. Strikingly unique but with a familiar feel, this game will leave you with a lasting impression and a sense of accomplishment time and time again.","December 3, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emcitement/recommended/244870/","emcitement","emcitement","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emcitement/","181 products in account","♥♥♥♥ing awesome electronica music, solid platforming, colourful backgrounds, and girls moaning at every checkpoint.\nWhat more could you want out of a platformer?\n\n... well, I guess the answer to that is a game that isn't slow, buggy, and filled with pointless gimmicks to make up for the lack of anything unique.\n\nElectronic Super Joy is a game that has a lot of potential and looks like it'll be great, but falls flat on its face once you dive in.\nLet me explain why.\n\nThe first thing was my controller just didn't have the right buttons mapped. Now this isn't an unknown problem for the gamepad I use if I'm not using x360ce. I'm guessing x360ce for some reason doesn't work for this game which is a real bummer and put all my controls everywhere. Considering out of over 100 games I've played with this gamepad using x360ce and this is the first one that's given me problems I'm going to have to count that as an obnoxious negative.\n\nAnyways, once I got going.. It sounded amazing. This game has some great music. I can't say much more. It wasn't memorable though. Not necessarily a downside, but lets just say I let the game idle on the title screen for an hour without bothering to mute it in order to get the trading cards.. after turning it off, I couldn't remember the track I had been listening to the whole time. Speaking of the title, it doesn't loop properly and just fades out before replaying. I wouldn't be surprised if other music in the game was the same way.\nRegardless, the music did sound great. I loved the style and it was very energetic.\n\nVisually.. its kind of.. boring. Yeah. Its boring. Look, I like my share fair of retro pixelated graphics but this game's art is plain lazy. Yeah, the backgrounds are colourful but they're not much more than basic colours thrown together.. Throw some black blocks everywhere and that's all there is to it. The character you play is just some black pixels. Uncreative and more forgettable than one of those games where you play a blob.\n\nAlright, so the gameplay. The control.. was... Okay, well I immediately thought the game felt slow. It feels like a game that should have a run button. Imagine playing Super Meat Boy or Mario without ever using the run button. That's what this game always feels like. Speaking of Mario, imagine playing Mario and dying everytime you jump on an enemy. Yep. You can't kill enemies by jumping on them in this game. Instead, you have to jump and then use an attack in mid-air that slams you down on to the enemy. Honestly, it just feels pointless and would be better off with a standard jump-to-kill method.\n\nSo its a platforming game.. with a lot of platforms that seemed to always be above bottomless pits. You jump here, you jump there. It worked and felt pretty solid. But the levels had some kind of silly gimmicks. There were things that launched you in the air and teleportals that were cool. Though one problem was the levels are set up so sometimes a teleportal entrance requires you to run a direction that'll immediately kill you after you teleport unless you completely let go of the movement button. A bit annoying, but not that big of a deal. Also, how many levels will the screen constantly scroll in? Those are in a lot of games, but just in my first few levels it was all I was seeing. It wouldn't be so annoying if the game was a bit faster but it just isn't due to the lack of being able to run.\n\nMost of the gimmicks were just plain bad. In one level, the visuals were so crazy that it gave me a headache and made me dizzy. It was a pain to try and play through all that was going on. Hard to explain over this, but if you end up playing the game you'll see what I mean.. and you won't like it.\n\nAs for the actual difficulty, the game was tough but it didn't feel overly hard. However, being tough early on makes it seem like it could easily be one of those games with a stupidly hard difficulty curve late-game. Unless it has a flat difficulty curve. The things that felt hard weren't even pure user error, but failing from silly gimmicks that felt forced in to try and make this game more unique.\n\nThe game seemed kind of buggy. One level the music went absolutely apeship and was just a huge distorted wall of noise. At first I was questioning if it was intentional but the longer it went on and the worse it got I knew it couldn't be. It just sounded absolutely horrible and cringe-worthy.\n\nDo I think people could like this game? Definitely.\nDo I think its a bad game? Not at all.\nBut I feel it has a lot of problems and just isn't too great. It has potential and could easily be turned into something awesome, but when has a released game ever been completely reworked? Its been a long while since I played this game, so maybe its changed for the better now.. but because of how awful my first experience was with it I won't be giving it another try.\n\nIf you really want to then its worth checking out I guess to see if you might like it, but I don't recommend it. There are so many other platformers out there that do all this game does and more while doing it much better.","March 6","false","1.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

While the music was decent (the one gripe I have is that the background voices make sex noises and it's awkward explaining to people who hear it what is actually going on) my main problem is the mechanics.  The controls are crap.  Not the key bindings (the default ones suck but you can rebind them) but the actual platforming.  The only control you have over the character is timing.  To a certain point, platformers are pretty timing heavy mechanically but in Super Meat Boy and pretty much every other good platformer you have some way to increase your jump distance, either by running, or jumping off of a wall.  This game has no run button and so little control over the character's jumping that the gameplay boils down to clicking jump in the right pattern.  Instead of feeling punishing but fair, it feels unfair and like you'd be better off getting a bot to beat the game for you.  Imagine Dark Souls without a roll/dodge button.  It wouldn't be any fun because you don't have the precise control over the character that the enemy design requires.  That's how the levels in this game felt.","September 15, 2014","false","1.3"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

Sorry, Michael, but Super Meat Boy is slighty better. :(\n\nBut don't get mad, Michael:\n9/10","January 27, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If not, you can have a good time.\nLevel design is pretty well thought-out, but there's some cheap shots and unintuitive segments.\nThe difficulty varies from moderately to very tough, and for a greater challenge there's incentives for no death runs, speed runs and collecting bonus stars.\nIf the premise doesn't put you off, you'll probably enjoy this game!","May 18, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So if you're after a more casual platformer this is not the game for you.\n\nThe music is good, but the sound effects can get a bit annoying after a while, so I just turned those off.

As such, I wasn't too sure quite what to expect going into this game. I will say that this game is largely easier than what I expected, ranking in terms of difficulty around Light World Salt Factory to start and ending around Light Hell. There really wasn't too much of a difficulty curve, to be honest. However, I've also been one of those people who has been somewhat against the influx of "masochistic platformers," 'cuz they're usually not all that fun. Does this game manage to break the trend? ...kinda.\n\nPlatforming in ESJ is about as simple as it gets; you can move left and right and jump. There's no momentum to your run, and you can control the height of your jump. I will say that the game is much slower than what I expected (also maybe for a good reason, since the game doesn't handle fast scrolling all that well), which can throw you off for a bit. There's actually only three other gimmicks you get throughout the game: a slam attack that moves you straight down, allowing you to kill any enemies in your path, a double jump that you get for all of five levels and have arbitrarily taken away from you, and flight which you get for like the last three stages and that's it. There's also your standard fare of obstacles: lasers, portals, mid-air jumping arrows a-la Jumper, and a few others. The enemies are largely unimpressive and consist of enemies that either walk left to right, shoot a slow-moving projectile, or have a laser coming out of them. They're usually not a big deal at all to deal with, but the laser enemies do require a bit more precision to eliminate than they honestly should, considering that they're standard enemies. Boss fights are pretty much just about dodging projectiles and hitting the weak point.\n\nThis all sounds like pretty standard fare, right? Well... you're right. There really isn't much else to this game. There's no trial-and-error gameplay and all levels can be beaten first try if you're good enough, but there just isn't much substance to the level design. It just feels like it's going through the motions that other games went through, of which, the short length of the game certainly does not help. I got very close to completing all the stages but stopped on 4-4 because it took a design page from I Wanna Be the Boshy's design (one that I certainly do not approve of), and even then, this game only took me about three and a half hours to beat. Even as a "masochistic platformer," there really isn't much here. All the extra gameplay comes from either no-deathing or speedrunning the stages. Other than that, it's just... okay. $8 is about right as a price; it's about as long as an average movie and just as satisfying, which is to say as satisfying as peanut-flavored packing peanuts: maybe alright in your mouth for a few seconds, then you realize that it's just filler. 6/10.\n\nStory: Ehh, the humor is take it or leave it. You could fit all the dialogue in-game onto one page of a single-spaced Word document, so I'm not gonna bother rating it.\n\nGraphics: I'll just get the technical stuff out of the way; the game fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without any hassle. As far as graphics settings, you really shouldn't need them. If you do, you should probably think about updating your system. As for the graphical style, it's alright I guess? Again, this is something of a take it or leave it thing. Levels usually only have two or three colors to them (excluding black for the stage and your character), but there's a lot going on in the background. I'd again refer you to my peanut-flavored packing peanut analogy as far as my opinions go on that matter. As for the pixel art, it's fine. Nothing impressive, though. There were a few moments where the background/foreground elements hid some parts of the stage, which is always frustrating to die to something you can't see because the level designer put too much stuff in the way. Again, this is just okay at best. Passable. Average. 2/5.\n\nSound: Yes, they use porn star sound bytes for the checkpoints. Yes, it does get a bit annoying after a while, but I was able to drown it out. As for the music, it's loud screechy techno; if that's your thing, you'll like it. If you're like me, you'll get bored with the music and put on your own. There really isn't anything else to talk about here. 2/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 6/0/2/2; cumulative score of 5.0/10. I've opted to lean on the side of recommendation just because there *is* some fun to be had here; it's just that it becomes so painfully mundane after a while. Not terrible, but definitely a one-and-done game, which for something as short as this, may not be good value for your money.","January 8, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, I know what you're saying- "Ugh, ANOTHER indie platformer? Don't indie devs know how to make anything else?" Well, I wanna say that this game is different from the rest. It has a killer soundteack, is extremely fast-paced, brutally difficult, and may cause siezures with it's flashing colors. Basically, it's the platformer version of Super Hexagon. And yes, like Super Hexagon, this game loves to focus on time. However, this one focuses on how fast you win, not how long you survive. So, what is there to say about this game? Well, if you love difficult games, this is for you. I personally LOVE it. I am the guy who loves brutally difficult games such as Binding of Isaac: Wrath of the Lamb, FTL: Faster Than Light (The Normal difficulty. Seriously, why is it called "Normal"?), and Super Hexagon. I also am a fan of games with great soundtracks, which all these are, and the faster, the better. If you like games such as those, or are looking for a game that is just different, this is for you. Also, if you like this game, I HIGHLY recommend the other games I listed if you don't own those yet.\n\nOh, and I would like to touch base on the Infinite Love mode. Basically, it's an infinite run of the game. However, as you progress through the screens, the game adds more missle launchers and other enemies to the same levels you've played before. It's really fun for people who are either stuck on a level and want to try something else, or people who just want more from this game.\n\nOverall, this is just a game you cannot pass up, especially since you can grab it plus the bonus content pack for $3.75 during the winter sale. 9.25/10!

Its cheap when i bought it (before 28 January). Its funny with bad puns no joke the puns are funny they make me cry with laughter. If you want a long, fun retro game this is the one you would buy. Its kinda like Super Meat Boy but in the retro zones. Its a nice game and very fast. For example you get to a platform on the right in 5 seconds so you gotta think where to go and stuff like that. Im easily giving this game a 10/10 Amazing game. You shoud buy this game.","January 22, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm a little embarassed to admit that I haven't even been able to complete World 1 yet; I find too many games that claim to have "Super Meat Boy" levels of difficulty, but this is one of the few I've seen that is both that challenging and that well designed. It's engaging enough that I find myself coming back to it time and time again. A large part of the appeal is the soundtrack, which is one of the few video game soundtracks that I am glad I own. I'm a huge fan of the graphic style as well; the simple, monochrome foreground and the frenetic, multicolored backgrounds contrast well. There's an Infinite Love mode where you can play a randomized selection of short levels. I haven't been able to get very far, so I don't know how many levels there are, but it's a neat addition.

The music is really good, and I often found myself dancing while trying to pull off some tricky sections.\n\nThere's not a lot to say about this game.

Players find themselves once again playing as the self-motived Dr. Neil Watts who works for Sigmund Corp. as a scientist who mentally fulfils the wishes of the dying. The game follows pretty much the same formula as its predecessor of telling the story of a person's life backwards in time from death to early childhood, except the subject of Electronic Super Joy is an elderly Armin van Buuren. Armin's dying wish is to put on the best rave to ever grace the planet earth, thus unifying the human populous through electronic dance music. Unfortunately, Electronic Super Joy does not do away with the quick-time event sequences which proved to be the low point of "To the Moon". One particular QTE sequence which I found most annoying is when the player must take control as Armin van Buuren and perform a rave by completing quick-time events for 6 hours without any pauses or checkpoints. While this sequence was ultimately satisfying, I fear it may deter many from experiencing this game's brilliance.","November 25, 2013","true","0.3"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","1"

Most of the gameplay consists of repeatedly outmaneuvering slow-moving packs of homing missiles that have accumulated on your trail, which is frankly a pain in the ♥♥♥.  The graphical style is sometimes appealing with its clean vectors and world tilting, but that superficial element represents the game's best feature, unfortunately.  There's also this weird sleezy character (erotic moans and sticky walls) and arbitrary, immature humor (my butt is gone, and now i have to kill the pope) to the whole affair that does nothing for me.\n\nElectronic Super Joy isn't a bad game, really, but it simply isn't good enough to be worth your time in this golden age of entertainment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BeeshWiz/recommended/244870/","BeeshWiz","Kuba "Lester" Wiszowaty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BeeshWiz/","85 products in account",""Electronic Super Joy" (Im putting in in quotes instead of italics because it is the video game equivalent of a short story) is a game. That is all that can be said. I recommend this strongly with every raver fiber in my being and believe this game to be the reason that nVidia shield was invented. This game is a fun time-killer to play at LANs or anywhere else you might find yourself and a fun way to challenge friends. I would complain about the difficulty but this game is supposed to be difficult, so you really only have yourself to blame if this game is too much. For a rating out of 10, I give it a 7.5 for a few things:\n1. The resolution is not 1080p (-.5)\n-I understand this game isn't made by Crytek or Dice so it doesn't need to have nice graphics, but its resolution makes it almost impossible to livestream/record in proper aspect ratios.\n2. The Soundtrack (+3)\nThe music in this game is incredible. Its such a variety of different EDM tracks and really supports the games title and everything you should expect.\n3. The Mechanics (+4)\nThe Mechanics are excellent, whether I launced the game through big picture on an Xbox 360 controller or playing with a keyboard and mouse, this game has responsive and "butter-smooth" controls that rival even that of the great Super Meat Boy.\n4. The humor (+.5)\nThis game is very light-hearted, and at times makes me laugh out loud, and at other times makes me wanna smash my head into a pickup truck going 70 KPH. The humor enhances the experience and makes the game more enjoyable despite the difficulty.\n5. Some Cheap difficulty (-1)\nYes, this game is hard. I know its supposed to be. But I will have to take off some points because the game even on World 1 feels impossible, with only one possible way to beat a level forcing a gamer to ditch their old way of playing, and we all know breaking a habit is a very hard thing to do.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope to do more in this style for other games in my growing library.\n-Kuba","December 22, 2013","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

You will also encounter levels that rotate or move. I'd recommend having a look at the gameplay videos to see if you like the visuals of it.\n\nPlatforming is pretty similar to what we've grown to expect in the precision platforming genre - jumping off walls, various terrain (like ice), "downwards slam out of a jump" to take out enemies, etc. Nothing too out of the ordinary here.\n\nThe music is just awesome. I'd say the soundtrack is probably the best that I've encountered in the genre. It could be a matter of taste, but everyone I talk to enjoyed the soundtrack.\n\nTo sum it up I'd say Electronic Super Joy delivers good old precision platforming hell in an interesting and appealing package.","December 25, 2013","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead, it was brimming with creativity and another great plus: was quite challenging. I find games like this, meatboy, dustforce, and VVVVV to be sort of theurapeutic in a way. They challenge enough to take your mind off the various oftentimes stressful experiences life can throw at you. It might seem contradictory to think that the games that take the most effort and skill end up being the ones that relax you. Maybe for some people it doesn't make sense, but for me all an easy game does is leave me with my thoughts. I need to be occupied and challenged, I need to feel the sense of accomplishment for beating a game. This did that for me, despite its length, which I have no complaints about either way.\n\nAlso damn, does this ♥♥♥♥ing game have style.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BeeshWiz/recommended/244870/","BeeshWiz","Kuba "Lester" Wiszowaty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BeeshWiz/","85 products in account",""Electronic Super Joy" (Im putting in in quotes instead of italics because it is the video game equivalent of a short story) is a game. That is all that can be said. I recommend this strongly with every raver fiber in my being and believe this game to be the reason that nVidia shield was invented. This game is a fun time-killer to play at LANs or anywhere else you might find yourself and a fun way to challenge friends. I would complain about the difficulty but this game is supposed to be difficult, so you really only have yourself to blame if this game is too much. For a rating out of 10, I give it a 7.5 for a few things:\n1. The resolution is not 1080p (-.5)\n-I understand this game isn't made by Crytek or Dice so it doesn't need to have nice graphics, but its resolution makes it almost impossible to livestream/record in proper aspect ratios.\n2. The Soundtrack (+3)\nThe music in this game is incredible. Its such a variety of different EDM tracks and really supports the games title and everything you should expect.\n3. The Mechanics (+4)\nThe Mechanics are excellent, whether I launced the game through big picture on an Xbox 360 controller or playing with a keyboard and mouse, this game has responsive and "butter-smooth" controls that rival even that of the great Super Meat Boy.\n4. The humor (+.5)\nThis game is very light-hearted, and at times makes me laugh out loud, and at other times makes me wanna smash my head into a pickup truck going 70 KPH. The humor enhances the experience and makes the game more enjoyable despite the difficulty.\n5. Some Cheap difficulty (-1)\nYes, this game is hard. I know its supposed to be. But I will have to take off some points because the game even on World 1 feels impossible, with only one possible way to beat a level forcing a gamer to ditch their old way of playing, and we all know breaking a habit is a very hard thing to do.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope to do more in this style for other games in my growing library.\n-Kuba","December 22, 2013","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

You will also encounter levels that rotate or move. I'd recommend having a look at the gameplay videos to see if you like the visuals of it.\n\nPlatforming is pretty similar to what we've grown to expect in the precision platforming genre - jumping off walls, various terrain (like ice), "downwards slam out of a jump" to take out enemies, etc. Nothing too out of the ordinary here.\n\nThe music is just awesome. I'd say the soundtrack is probably the best that I've encountered in the genre. It could be a matter of taste, but everyone I talk to enjoyed the soundtrack.\n\nTo sum it up I'd say Electronic Super Joy delivers good old precision platforming hell in an interesting and appealing package.","December 25, 2013","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is, in large part, because I felt that the deaths were unfair (or inaccurate), which is pretty unacceptable for a platformer. I can understand this if I was just sucking, but I don’t think that this was the case. It’s a shame, too, because it has a nice aesthetic and music, but I just can’t get over the annoying – and seemingly unfair – constantly deaths. I can’t recommend this game.\n\nAnd, again, for some reason it's showing 0 hours played -- I've played approximately two hours.","January 1, 2014","false","0.9"," 26 of 52 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","26","52","0","0"

The game tries to provide some variety by occaisionally giving new abilities (ground pound, double jump, low gravity) or taking ones you've had for a while, but these changes are pretty short lived and don't really make you play too differently.\n\nThe difficulty is your standard indie platformer difficulty. It's precise but not really hard due to instant and unlimited respawns. As always, the "real" challenge is probably speed running or no death running the stages in quick succession. My only real gripe with the difficulty is that rather than ramping up, it tends to stay constant throughout the game but with occaisonal random feeling difficulty spikes where the game suddenly demands pixel perfect precision out of nowhere. It can be a bit jarring.\n\nAlso for a game with "bite sized" levels and challenges, it's pretty short, with only really 2 hours or so worth of stages.\n\nAs for the aesthetic, I recommend turning on "pg mode", not because it isn't sfw, but rather because...well it's annoying. The humor here is probably more grating than any Team Meat game, which is saying something.\n\nIf you're a big platformer buff it's probably serviceable, but coming to this game shortly after playing games like Volgarr The Viking, They Bleed Pixels, Mega Man Zx Advent, and Rogue Legacy, it felt solid but underwhelming.","December 29, 2013","false","1.6"," 24 of 48 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","24","48","0","4"

In Electronic Super Joy, they kill you instantly, which is somwhat annoying when even the first few levels requires significant backtracking with little leeway for error, meaning I found myself dying needlessly, as my character touched the edge of the screen before he (would have) touched the teleporter.\n\nAdd to that the lack of acceleration on the main character, levels which are monochrome and hide the platforms from you frequently, a inconsistent frame rate (I strongly suggest you go into the options and turn frame locking on) and no leeway when it comes to pixel-perfect jumps, it seems to be making a point of being difficult, when it could be a significantly more enjoyable platformer, in the vein of the Trials series.","June 21, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I relay can't think of any noteworthy aspect of this game that would set it apart from all the other platformers that are out there. Most platformers have a distinctive gameplay mechanic that make that particular platformer unique. This does not. Which doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad game, but you really have to be a 'platforming enthusiast' for this game to keep your attention. Also, I don't know why, but the controls didn't feel as good as, for example, SMB controls. I really don't know why. Maybe I just bad... Yeah, I'm probably just bad.\nAnother thing I found a bit disappointing was the graphic style. When I looked at screenshots and videos of this game I found it visually apealing, because I really enjoy games with minimalist graphic style. Unfortunately those screenshots ware small and once I loaded up the game it looked very lackluster in full screen mode. The thing about that sort of ascetic is that you still need some kind of detail otherwise it just looks boring. There are moments when a lot of stuff is going on at the same time, and those moments look grate, but unfortunately they are few and far between. Majority of the game has so little elements on the screen that it's jut boring to look at.\nThe only Exceptional thing about it's game is it's soundtrack. Electronic music isn't really my thing, but I really liked this one.\nIf you are really desperate for a platformer you could definitely do worse than Electronic Super Joy. But the soundtrack I recommend to everyone.","November 27, 2013","true","3.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I really REALLY would. It's so cute and I love the pixel art and the music is freaking awesome. But sadly I would recomend this game to almost nobody. Do not be fooled by this game. It does not care about you. It is not your friend. It wants you to burn in hell to an awesome sound track. I gave up in under an hour because this game is so insanely infuriating. It demands an ungodly amount of percision from the player and the contolles can't deliver. So much that I would narrowly miss a platform 5 inches from the goal that took me five minutes to get to then I'd just have to try again from the check point. In my opinion, for a game this difficult, there should be more checkpoints. At least for the beginning story line and have alternate levels that are more difficult. Then you could slowely get better through the main story and enjoy the more difficult challenge later on. There is no difficulty curve in this game. It starts at ♥♥♥♥ you difficulty and seems to just continue with ♥♥♥♥ you through all the levels. Also I had multiple times I died and didn't know why. It could be I missed something because the screen is so hectic but I actually really like the way it looks. Also I had a weird glitch that the music just broke and didn't play the way it was supposed to. I really want to like this game. But it is to teeth grindingly, butt clenchingly, self mutalatingly difficult that I can't even play it without wanting to physically harm myself and the evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that made this game (side note I don't hate the developers I really like this idea but it could have been so much more beginner friendly and difficult later on. That would've been brilliant and then I'd totally love this game). The platforms seem too inconsistantly distanced and there is only one jump hight, (you can't tap for small hops or hold for longer leaps) it just made the game really unplayable and I really pushed myself to continue but after the missles were introduced and i got killed by a chain for no reason I quit, tried the other modes, then rage quit the whole game. I'm getting a refund. I can only recomend this game to people who absolutely love having their testicles smashed with a tire iron because you're already crazy so this game shouldn't be too hard on you. If you want a platform game with fun music there are others a lot better then this. Electronic Super Joy is the extreme opposite of anything even near the feeling of joy. I'm just really let down by this awesome game with so much potential. If you have a youtube channel this would be great for rage reactions. other then that, don't try to play this game for fun. It's not. f you read all this thank you for giving me your attention I really didn't mean to rant this long and if the developers read this I love you and please try to make this a bit more beginner friendly at least. It is such a cool game and so god damn cute I'd love to play this and not have thoughts of ripping my own head off and throwing it at you. ^3^ b (first review btw so feel free to criticize and tell me what else I should take into account if I ever have the urge to write another review thanks)","May 23","false","0.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","43","3","7","5","4"

It's a precision platformer with a very prominent soundtrack. Basically the game doesn't have much going for it other than Hey guys it's REALLY HARD and Hey look it's PIXEL STYLE. The story is so intentionally dumb that it loops back into being actually dumb.\n\nThe difficulty curve/checkpoint spread are kind of arbitrary. The missiles are annoying whenever they show up. Somewhere around World 3 the challenges just... stop being fun. I found myself pounding the reset key to skip the death animation and getting irritated at the sex noises that plays when you die for some reason.\n\nGood thing World 3 is the last one, then!

Every challenge in this game is about extreme precision jumping and timing, and slipping up even the slightest means you're back at the checkpoint.  It's incredibly frustrating that there's no room for adjustment or freedom between each of your jumps, and the resulting level design is like a gauntlet that tests your patience like a game of Operation.  There's a distinct lack of reward when beating a level besides continuing the tedious routine the next level.\n\nPlus, the physics are the most unintuitive I've ever felt in a platformer; your jump speed is faster than your move speed, and it just draws such a huge disconnect for me, I can barely tell whether or not I'll make the jump and I often overcompensate a jump.  When double jump was introduced, it was a brief breath of fresh air that I'm actually given a bit of breathing room.\n\nAesthetics are pleasing and play an interesting role, but that's all I'll say in its favor.  Save your steam money for Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV, which have actual interesting level design (at least the latter in my experience).","December 24, 2013","false","1.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Less Super Meatboy and more The Impossible Game, which is that flash/Xbox360 Arcade game where you are a cube that is automoving across the level and have to make a series of increasingly difficult jumps across floating platforms of varying sizes, and some spikes. ESJ doesn't automove but the levels do autoscroll, and it is solely based on making a series of increasingly difficult jumps across floating platforms, and some spikes. Sluggish and imprecise movement makes dealing with the autoscroll that much more annoying, plus all the traps are less tricky exercises in manipulating your movement (ala Meatboy, or meshoff's Punishment 2: The Punishing) than they are transparently hosspucky gotchas that prey upon the game's bad controls and autoscrolling. Mind you, they aren't witty gotchas in the vein of I Wanna Be the Guy or Eryi's Action. Rather, the level design is simply tedious in how desperate it is to bust one's spheres about jumping on slim platforms.\n\nAlso the graphics are nowhere near as flashy as one might assume, and the game plays a sample of someone moaning extremely loudly every time you die. There's a lot of dying in this, so this plays every few seconds. You can turn it off ("PG mode," as if I weren't the type to be jerking off to some nasty-as-hell porn up on this internet, 24/7), but I bring it up because it is indicative of the level of thought that went into the thing. Don't even get me started on the story, which emanates from the realm of monkeycheesefart/You Touch My Tralala.","July 25, 2014","false","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not because of the controls, they're tight. It's not because of the level design, it's good. It's a solid platformer with good variety.\n\nThe problem, for me, is in the presentation. It's a electronic music-themed game, with flashing lights and strobe effects and all sorts of distracting stuff. And it gives me a headache in less than 20 minutes. And it usually comes with some dizziness and nausea.\n\nI might just be wimpy, but it's never happened to me with any other game. If you happen to have a strobe light in your bedroom so you can practice your Melbourne Shuffle and you like platformers, you'll probably like this game. On the other hand, if you have any sort of tendency for motion sickness or seizures or something, I strongly suggest avoiding this game.","September 22, 2014","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When it says it's brutally hard, it's not kidding. Everything about the game is out to kill the player over and over again - the camera panning especially. It races across the level leaving you desperate to keep up, and then, as soon as clouds of missiles are being fired, slows to a snail's pace. Checkpoints are often few and far between, with convoluted strings of blocks, lasers, hungry monsters and almost impossible jumps keeping the player repeating the same segment of a level for several minutes.\nThat said, if I keep the game's purpose in mind it's easy to see that it succeeds. The difficulty is as advertised, of course, the music is nice and there's something really addicting about the game in general. It frustrates me to no end, but I have fun regardless, and when I do quit it's more out of tiredness and a sense of "I should really go do something else" than out of pure rage. However, I think if I hadn't caught it for seventy-nine cents during a flash sale I would be disappointed... because at the end of the day it IS that hard and the flashing lights ARE that headache-inducing. I can't post this review with a big fat thumbs up on it, but I do recommend it to anyone who happens to be into platformers and likes a real challenge.\n\nAlso, there's a 'PG Mode' in the options menu that can be turned on when the player tires of the... oddly emphatic... checkpoint voices or the odd swear.","December 21, 2013","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

On the other hand, Groove City isn't as worth it (the performance is pretty bad and the level design doesn't add much).\nOverall, extremely fun!","October 30, 2014","true","34.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I thought this was a really nice game, a platformer, and I generally like platformers. The concept itself isn´t that bad, but I really miss the option of CHANGING KEYS. That would make the game 200% easier. Keys are "Z" for jumping, "left and right" for moving, it´s REALLY annoying if you play, like me, with "WASD"  for normal. (And on european keyboard, where Z is changed with Y.) I have NEVER played such an annoying game before, I even started to rage here. It was completely unneccessary for me to buy the game+ Bonus Content, I hate to play it. Sorry for everyone, but before Keys can´t be changed, I will not like this game. Even when it has nice styles and awesome music, worse gameplay ruins the rest. If you get along with the controls, this is probably a nice platformer for you, otherwise I do not recommend this.","February 19","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The music, the visuals, the story, and the gameplay all make you feel confused. The soundtrack is the best part of the game hands down. I never liked electronic music, but I love this soundtrack. The visuals are very primitive, but the backgrounds are incredible. In gameplay sometimes it is hard to tell what something is because the graphics are limitted, but you better get used to dieing because that won't be the only reason. It is BRUTALLY hard!! Think Super Meat boy meats Super  Hexagon. The controls are very random with tightness because the levels have different gravity. The story is simple, funny, random, and completely offensive. Don't play this if you are easily offended.

Despite unashamedly being a Super Meat Boy rip-off (you can tell that from the title!), the game is well-made. The best example of its polish is the collision detection, which is very precise and required for this type of platformer. The frequent checkpoints, varied levels and colourful backgrounds help keep rage quits to a minimum.\n\nTwo slight gripes which may put people off. Firstly, I am playing this on a mac. The first time I loaded the game it froze at the title screen. To address this problem, I had to run the game in development mode. After changing this setting, the game worked flawlessly, including access to steam achievements.\n\nThe second gripe will be a deal breaker for some: the electronic/dubstep soundtrack. If you cannot tolerate this type of music, you should avoid this game. Every level has a thumping electronic soundtrack in the background which I imagine would be extremely offputting if you don't like that type of music. However, I found it ok and often at times found myself enjoying it.\n\nA must buy at $0.79. And otherwise recommended!","December 25, 2013","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Games like Super Meat Boy and Dark Souls are difficult games, but the reason that they're so fun is not only because they're so difficult, it's that they are mechanically interesting as well. ESJ never really gets more interesting than avoiding homing rockets. Not to mention that the game seems to have been written by a "lol so randum" middle schooler.\n\nSo basically, Electronic Super Joy is a good EDM album that comes with a pretty bad game.","April 18, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do you like kick-♥♥♥ electronic music? Do you have an odd sense of humor that involves evil Groove Wizards stealing butts? If so, then this game is for you!\n\nIn Electronic Super Joy, you play as a nameless protagonist who's a serious badass. Even though you lost an arm in the Disco Wars of 1515, the War of Rock 'n Roll claimed your eye, and defeating DJ Deadly Skillz cost you both legs, you jump and smash your way through 4 rediculously difficult worlds on a fantastic adventure to recover your most prized possession: your own ♥♥♥! If that's not enough, there's a kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack that's not just there for background music, it's the driving force that keeps you going throughout this pixelated, adrealine-rushed, rave-fueled (and sometimes seizure-inducing) adventure.\n\nWhen I said this game was hard, I'm not kidding. Just when you think you've mastered everything about this game, it throws a wrench into the gears and slaps you in the face with some new mechanic that'll force you to adapt and change your playing pattern. The difficulty seems to pay homage to many difficult platformers from the past, such as Contra and the NES version of Ninja Gaiden.\n\nThe graphics, although not important to the overall game, cast all the characters and landscape in shadow, while the background is alive and animated. Sometimes I seem to get lost in its beauty.\n\nThe controls, gamepad or keyboard, are perfect and well-responsive. When you ♥♥♥♥ up in this game, it's usually your fault, and you know that.\n\nAnother large part of the game is its humor. Checkpoints emit sexual moans and groans that will likely catch players off guard at first, but after a while, they'll seem fitting in this world full of bright colors and awesome music. Foul-mouthed characters adorn the landscape, such as the insanity-stricken Pope who threatens to shoot you down in his flying Popemobile.\n\nThe only downside I can find with this game is that the smashing attack is a little too accurate. Often times I find myself dying from missiles I clearly smashed beforehand, and this lead to many frustrating moments.\n\nAll in all, Electronic Super Joy is an original, artistic platformer that'll keep you entertained for hours. Now go and get your booty back from an Evil Groove Wizard!","January 25, 2014","true","12.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it may be frustrating at times it becomes very rewarding when you finally get past that part or get that collectable. This game has quite a few different elements involved in the platforming. In the begining you can only jump. Then there are levels when you can do crazy stuff like flying, double jumping, sliding and ofcourse smash. All of these things combine for a really neat platformer.\n\nThe music in this game is also great, that is, if you enjoy that type of music. Electronic Super Joy is based a lot on the music so I would recommend playing it with your sound on.\n\nAt the end of each chapter there is also a boss battle. These boss battles are very difficult and each one is difficult in it's own unique way.\n\nPros\n- Difficult yet rewarding.\n- Good music.\n- It looks good.\n- Good use of checkpoints\n- Achievements\n- Challenges (0 Deaths and Collectibles).\n\nCons\n- It can and will make you rage.\n- Seizure inducing.","December 23, 2013","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You ARE going to get a seizure....but you are still going to have a good time. This game is another one of them "Rage games" You will rage....but you are going to be freaking rocking the hell out to the kick ♥♥♥ Music. The controls are slightly slippery, The Checkpoints are slightly far from each other but this game is less of a rage game more than a trial and error game, So it's not technically a "Rage game" Because every fault that happens is YOUR Fault. The difference between a rage game and this kind of game is that rage games are highly unfair and every single death is not your fault, it's because the game is trying to get under your skin, it was specifically designed to ♥♥♥♥ you off. THIS game however does not qualify itself to be titled a "Rage game" As every single "Death" or fault that happens to you is your fault. The game isn't unfair, or trying to kill you and give you a heart attack it is fair, although very very hard, even at the beginning. The main problem is that the movement keys are only SLIGHTLY delayed, you press the right move key for a brief second, there is soem delay before he Stops. Now, for the positives, this game is Freaking awesome, It has very slight yet very noticable crude comedy, nothing like south park bad, but the innuendo is there, (Love the checkpoints, give me all the checkpoints! X3 ) The levels are slightly simple yet very challenging and never boring. The greatest thing about this game is it's soundtrack, Holy, freaking, Hell, this soundtrack. This music is seriously all you need to have a good time, the music make you literally want to get off your Non-existant butt (In-game joke) and start shaking what you don't have. Get out your glow sticks boys, this is going to be one hell of a part-ay. If you like kick ♥♥♥ music, a difficult challenge, and platforming games, this is the game for you.","August 15, 2014","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You ARE going to get a seizure....but you are still going to have a good time. This game is another one of them "Rage games" You will rage....but you are going to be freaking rocking the hell out to the kick ♥♥♥ Music. The controls are slightly slippery, The Checkpoints are slightly far from each other but this game is less of a rage game more than a trial and error game, So it's not technically a "Rage game" Because every fault that happens is YOUR Fault. The difference between a rage game and this kind of game is that rage games are highly unfair and every single death is not your fault, it's because the game is trying to get under your skin, it was specifically designed to ♥♥♥♥ you off. THIS game however does not qualify itself to be titled a "Rage game" As every single "Death" or fault that happens to you is your fault. The game isn't unfair, or trying to kill you and give you a heart attack it is fair, although very very hard, even at the beginning. The main problem is that the movement keys are only SLIGHTLY delayed, you press the right move key for a brief second, there is soem delay before he Stops. Now, for the positives, this game is Freaking awesome, It has very slight yet very noticable crude comedy, nothing like south park bad, but the innuendo is there, (Love the checkpoints, give me all the checkpoints! X3 ) The levels are slightly simple yet very challenging and never boring. The greatest thing about this game is it's soundtrack, Holy, freaking, Hell, this soundtrack. This music is seriously all you need to have a good time, the music make you literally want to get off your Non-existant butt (In-game joke) and start shaking what you don't have. Get out your glow sticks boys, this is going to be one hell of a part-ay. If you like kick ♥♥♥ music, a difficult challenge, and platforming games, this is the game for you.","August 15, 2014","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music, the visuals, the story, and the gameplay all make you feel confused. The soundtrack is the best part of the game hands down. I never liked electronic music, but I love this soundtrack. The visuals are very primitive, but the backgrounds are incredible. In gameplay sometimes it is hard to tell what something is because the graphics are limitted, but you better get used to dieing because that won't be the only reason. It is BRUTALLY hard!! Think Super Meat boy meats Super  Hexagon. The controls are very random with tightness because the levels have different gravity. The story is simple, funny, random, and completely offensive. Don't play this if you are easily offended.

Electronic Super Joy does very little orginal from a gameplay perspective - you'll jump and run across a bunch of fairly small levels.\n\nIt's comparable to games like Super Meat Boy in the that it is a difficult game, but it lacks the things that makes games like Super Meat Boy great. Respawning from a death isn't instant (unless you press the restart key, which will restart the entire level, and doesn't put you at the latest checkpoint.) The game's most difficult levels simply spam missiles that home on you, which quite frankly isn't very fun. Very rarely does the game challenge you in fun and interesting ways. There's occasional strokes of genius with the level design, but they are few and far between the moments that are rife with frustration.\n\nThe best thing Electronic Super Joy has going for it is the aesthetics, the neo-retro graphics fit well with the electronic music. With passable platforming mechanics, it's very hard for me to recommend this, except on a major sale. If you're looking for a challenging platformer, a game like Super Meat Boy fits this need so much better.","March 2, 2014","false","2.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I've kind of been jonesing for a Pope to murder since the last guy and the new one is still not quite ripe enough for a fresh murdering yet so this'll do in the meantime. It's kind of like what I said regarding Receiver. It's fun and satisfying and all but really it just makes you want to murder a real Pope.\n\n\nNow, I'm really loving this game so far and the soundtrack just kicks all sorts of ♥♥♥ and you can tell it does from the very first screen of the game. It's one of several ways that it's quite possibly even better than Super Meat Boy.\n\nI'll wait for you to stop gasping for a moment. Okay, so let me expand on that since I know what I just said is heresy (hehe, see what I did there). Even though I love SMB and always will, ESJ has been compared to it often and from my personal experience thus far the comparison is favorable. SMB has its own share of kick ♥♥♥ tracks to be sure but this game is packed with them. So much so that it's one of the few soundtracks I'm actually considering buying on Steam next to Rebirth's.\n\nThe gameplay is what it looks like, side scrolling platforming. Except it seems to have more variety by default than SMB by virtue of having an attack and enemies that can be killed. At one point it even turns into a bullet hell shooter for a little while. With suitably epic music and visuals. It's also pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult. Especially when the missiles start clustering up.\n\nNow before I comment on the aesthetic let me just say I'm getting just as tired of the monochromatic foreground/background thing that started infesting the place once Limbo was discovered as much as the next guy. But here it's done better than the screenshots are giving it credit for. The foreground and background scenery are animate and colorful and even have this lil' beat to the music going on. With all the visual noise that can start you'll be thankful that the interactive foreground and character is always one predictable color. It's not like that "we decided to be lazy and call it minimalism" crap. It actually has its own style.","November 19, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Which.  If it had been sold as sexualized, and it weren't, you know, the most insultingly fake porn sound imaginable, I could get behind.  The screenshots and description gave me more of the "psychedelic trip" impression, which was what I was expecting and wanting to play.  Perhaps for the author these are one and the same?  Knowing that doesn't exactly make me comfortable with playing his sex fantasy, though.\n\nThere is an option, "PG mode", to turn the noises off.  I tried it.  Didn't help - knowing that the author was viewing this entire thing as sexualized, plus the random inappropriate ♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, really spoiled it for me.\n\nActually, I would kinda like a refund. :(  I don't expect I'll ever be able to stomach this game, and I do feel quite lied to.  But I realize Steam doesn't do that.\n\nOh - and I am not epileptic.  But it was a real jerk move to display "may cause seizures" a manner that would almost certainly have caused them, before it could even be read.

Every challenge in this game is about extreme precision jumping and timing, and slipping up even the slightest means you're back at the checkpoint.  It's incredibly frustrating that there's no room for adjustment or freedom between each of your jumps, and the resulting level design is like a gauntlet that tests your patience like a game of Operation.  There's a distinct lack of reward when beating a level besides continuing the tedious routine the next level.\n\nPlus, the physics are the most unintuitive I've ever felt in a platformer; your jump speed is faster than your move speed, and it just draws such a huge disconnect for me, I can barely tell whether or not I'll make the jump and I often overcompensate a jump.  When double jump was introduced, it was a brief breath of fresh air that I'm actually given a bit of breathing room.\n\nAesthetics are pleasing and play an interesting role, but that's all I'll say in its favor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaibos/recommended/244870/","jaibos","ジャイボ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaibos/","12 products in account","Although I definitely think this game has more negatives than positives, I have to recommend this game. Despite the hype of the soundtrack, I really don't think its that original or good.I'm guessing most of the people who are in love with the soundtrack have never heard electro music before because the soundtrack is very cliche to the electronic genre. Not saying it's soundtrack is bad, but it sounds just like a ton of other electronic songs and it's not all that great. Next, the humor isn't very funny. It's kind of overrated and it reminds me of my scene phase. Colors everywhere, electronic music, butt jokes, and jokes about religion are all really childish types of humor and aesthetic. Not to mention the game's plot literally is based around finding this guy's butt. My biggest complaint would be the checkpoints. I feel as if there's too many checkpoints in places checkpoints don't need to be, and not enough checkpoints where checkpoints do need to be. In some levels, there's no checkpoints for about three-fourths of the level, and then there will be about 5 of them within the last quarter of the level. I remember one time there was a platform with a checkpoint, then another platform, and then another platform with a checkpoint. Yet I have just came across a level where there are numerous platforms that have sent me back to the beginning multiple times and I was just thinking, "we really need more checkpoints in this part". My next issue is with the pause menu. When you hit pause button, the only thing that comes up is the option to go back to the main menu. If you comply, you'll have to restart the level. This is an issue when I want to change the screen resolution and when I want to change the volume level. I think that it's logical for the pause menu to have all of the same features as the options menu on the home page at minimum. The last thing I have is that in some cases, the portal to the next level is hard to reach. It's sometime easy to miss when you have the double-jump effect, and when you're jumping from off a slippery platform. So many times have I accidentally jumped over a portal and had to restart from basically half way through the level. In games, there is a line between difficult and rigged, this game doesn't know the difference. This game pretty much requires no skill and just a ton of luck and dying. Although this game is classified as "difficult", really, it's more just badly designed. There are about two things good about this game. Number one is that although the game is full of color and rainbows just like my scene phase, the graphics look very nice. Number two is that it's highly addicting and it's good to pass the time. Overall, if you're looking for good plot with a professional layout, this game is definitely not for you and you shouldn't waste your money on it. However, if you're looking for a stupid game to pass the time with, it's probably worth your money.","June 21, 2014","true","25.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Checkpoints are fairly well distributed on the levels, and you restart instantly after dying, so you can die a hundred times and barely notice it.\n\nThe levels are original, and have tons of variety. They introduce new challenges and mechanics as you progress which keeps it fun.\n\nThe story is pretty dumb, but I will be honest and say I had a smile from ear to ear sometimes.

There's a lot of interesting platformer-y elements that can come together to make interesting levels.\n\nThe problem lies in that the actual level designs... fall flat, far too often. See, this game has missiles. And the level designer liked these missiles a lot. To the point where they are spammed, far far too much. It feels like the design process went as such: "Hmm, this level's okay, but it's a bit too easy. Let me just place a missile launcher or two in a random spot. There, much better!"\nBecause, frankly, a lot of these levels would be pretty good with less or no missiles! It's amazing how this one gameplay element has completely overshadowed everything else about the game for me. I'm insane and masochistic so I still aimed for 100% anyways, but I'm not really sure why.\nInfinite Love Mode is also a pretty neat idea but could be a bit better implemented; some of the submaps become literally impossible at 20+ portals, and a few of the submaps are far, far harder than the rest. Also, empty rooms that automatically end your run aren't very appreciated. I kind of want to see this mode tweaked a little because it's a lot more fun than the main game.\n\nAlso the soundtrack exists. I spent about 75% of my playtime with it muted since I kind of can't stand the soundtrack at all. So no real comment on it. Graphic style is also alright, nothing amazing but, it works. The trail of light behind the player character is pretty neat.\n\nI don't think it's the worst platfomer I've ever played (or even close to it) but it's not solid enough for me to recommend, unfortunately.","June 11, 2014","false","21.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

The game very quickly turns from "A is to jump!" into precision double jumping, auto-scroll and timing reliant sections. Outside of gameplay, the design and colour scheme is epilepsy inducing but genuinely fascinating and extremely well executed despite the limited palette. The music is not great; it's the type of dance music that is only remotely tolerable when you're dancing in a basement nightclub at 4am on MDMA.\n\nSuper Meat Boy still remains the ultimate platformer for players of all skill levels, but if you made it through the entirety of that game and are clamoring for more then this game may be up your alley. Everyone else should probably avoid.","July 21, 2014","false","2.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Music is good but the platforming is inconsistent.\n\nFor one it feels like they did a poor job of accounting for ceilings, often times I would jump off a platform only to bump into a low-hanging ceiling above me to lead to an untimely death. After awhile it just got annoying and felt less like my own fault and more like they really could have stood to design it just a little less frustratingly.\n\nFor another, the game lacks really anything special about it. The visuals are pretty bare bones, gameplay lacks much in the way of diversity in the levels, and your abilities are pretty weak. The stomp is interesting, it lets you slam downwards into the ground to attack or stop momentum, but it quickly loses its uniqueness. You get a double jump for the second world, but then lose it after, which is kind of lame because it misses out on potential it could have had with both abilities.\n\nIt feels like there should have been more to this game that just wasn't.\n\nMusic is amazing though.

And in short words comparison ESJ to SMB is like Terrorist Takedown to Call of Duty.\nBuy SMB instead.\n\nFirst of all - it's not hard. It's not brutal. At it's core it's pretty easy pixel-precise timing platformer. Time your jumps and you'll get used to the game in no time. If you played first wolrd of SMB - you'll get through game like a breeze.\n\nThere is some humor that doesn't go over the top and doesn't tries to hard to be more intelligent or more dumb. Yeap, there are bad puns. Yeap, they fit the game well. Yeap, it's amusing.\n\nESJ has some good ideas when levels are in the mix with visuals and sounds that make you wonder why they are seen so rarely among ton of absolutely tasteless unimaginative levels. Actually there is kinda dozen of levels in the whole game that actually somewhat fun and imaginative, and only half of them are good. On the other hand in ESJ... oh well, on the other hand there is s**t too. There is extremelly lazy designed levels where things are just happing at random. Where have you seen platformers that depends on luck? It's called bad design and it's boring. It's not frustrating, it's plain boring. You know, SMB had levels so wickedly good designed so you'll remember every challenge the game throws at you till the rest of your days.\n\nVisuals are lacking, just lacking. You've seen it everywhere. You've seen it better everywhere.\n\nAbsolutely tasteless electronic music (kinda what you expect to hear on mobile of kids these days among Skrillex and Deadmau5) - it pumps, it's dumb. You'll probably like it. I must admit I kinda like it too. Other sounds are just the same - some are barely there and others make no sense (turn on PG mode in options, or you'll be hearing 'o-la-la' ringing in your head for the next week).\n\nAnd the last and not the least. Does it worth it? Half a buck? Yeah, absolutely. Not because you'll get some joy there, but because you can't buy anything else with that money. Oh wait...

Trial by memory, clipping corners of boxes that ruin jumps (ala Super Funny Meme Boy), inconsistent rules, required pickups that can only be picked up when you touch the exact center of them, etc. Expect a whole lot of that and a whole lot of restarts because of it.\n\nI thought we'd have been done with this kind of thing after the 80s.","January 10, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Alas, when I got the game, I was quite disappointed finding out that the awesome background music has nothing to do with the gameplay whatsoever.\n\nIn my opinion, the game is pretty good. Visually appealing, great to listen to with a pair of bass-enhanced headphones. MOSTLY straightforward obstacles, and checkpoints just a little ahead of where the real danger is, giving a sense of achievement on each save. Storywise, ain't the best you're going to find. The only issue I have is that the jumping mechanism seems to be a little too precise/tight. I'd have to press jump ONLY AFTER I land, and not when I land, or I might miss, say, 50/50?\n\nSo, if you enjoy platformers or masocore games, go ahead, you'll enjoy the tiny lines of speech by those humorous little friendly passive creepos along your journey.

It is fun, addictive, but only for a while, after that... well nothing's left. After beating the game once or twice there's hardly any replay value which is unforunate. After a while, the game will be nothing but platforming with some smashing enemies once in a while, the hardcore platforming is the main reason to buy and or play this, it is good in its own merit, it is far from being a bad game by any means, but there's .. something I feel is missing .. The soundtrack did not catch me at all, like .. at all. Not because it was not well done, but because something else is needed for this type of game. The story and characters were nothing special, no gimmick, nothing catchy, nothing memorable or attaching.\n\nThe game's trippy graphics needs an honorable mention though, another great point is  how challenging it is, which makes it so addictive to play. High difficulty is always appreciated, so thank you for the challenges.\n\nin brief\n\nComposer - Did a truly decent job, but something else would have been needed to make this game more memorable. A few songs really manage to boost up the player, but in majority, it's forgettable, all you remember after that is a techno-like soundtrack, it does the job, a good one, but the game could have had maybe a bit more diversity.\n\nGame Designer - It's an indie game, I love indie games to a tee, your game is not bad by any means, but it misses some of the replay value to be found in other difficult games like I wanna be the guy, boshy, VVVVVV or SuperMeatBoy. The game sadly did not include enough bosses for it to be considered satisfying, at some point the levels would end up ' Just being another level ' and not something to be thrilled about.\n\nThe game has lots of potential, it is a good game, it truly, truly is, but you might wanna add more diversity next time and make the characters more fleshed out.\n\nVirtual Artists - Trippy ! You guys did a fantastic, phenomenal job, it was a unique visual experience and I'm thankful for that.\n\nYes, I do recommend this game because it's been fun to play it regardless, but I feel its characters, universe and story could have been much more developped.\n\n\nEveryone involved in the making of this game did a good job, hopefully this game will get a sequel improving on what's missing in this one.","April 23, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The graphic style is semi-minimalist (not like Thomas Was Alone, obviously) while still being flashy (if that's possible) at times, and the soundtrack sounds like something The Situation probably listens to while staring at himself naked in the mirror, right before he starts crying about owing tons of money or having a baby ♥♥♥♥. That is to say, it's really great if  you like EDM (or comparably dance-y).\n\nThe game itself isn't very long, however the replay value comes from trying to hit all the "gold" speed run times and getting all the other achievements. If you're into achievements, these will keep you busy for awhile. My suggestion is that you drink plenty of your favorite alcoholic beverage while going after these so that you don't pay attention by the 120th time you've restarted a level.","December 8, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
