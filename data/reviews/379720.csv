"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pa1nki113r/recommended/379720/","pa1nki113r","Bareback Bandito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pa1nki113r/","63 products in account","The single player campaign of Doom has exceeded all of my expectations I initially had toward it. My expectations were that I wanted it to be a great FPS game, and more importantly, a true DOOM title. I started the game on Nightmare difficulty right off the bat.\n\nYou will be fighting in the first 10 seconds of the game. Combat is challenging and very fluid with emphasis on speed, which they've certainly cranked up. Stopping is death on nightmare. Glory kills are satisfying, can be a ammo saver, and really don't hinder game flow at all, and can even be upgraded to perform faster (or toggled off in the options).\n\nLevel design is absolutely impressive. This was my biggest concern with Doom, and rest assured id FINALLY did it right. Non-linear, lots of exploration, plenty of secrets with hidden guns, secret level unlocks, and equipment.\n\nThe monsters are relentless. On nightmare you will get your ♥♥♥ kicked. This is a fact, and there's no way to circumvent this. I honestly felt at times that I was playing Project Brutality on "Last Man on Earth" difficulty. Monsters boast a variety of attacks, chase you down, flank you, and can be tough as nails (sometimes a little too good).\n\nWeapons look and feel satisfying, great attention to detail. You will use guns interchangeably, each has their respective uses. You'll have to search the environment for health and ammo, aside from the chainsaw kills on enemies, they drop little items- but enough to keep you going (i.e +5 health occasionaly or like 4 shotgun shells). The BFG literally clears an entire room in one shot, and I couldn't help but smile at the results. Upgrades and progression in this game are entirely optional, but really help shift the game to fit how you play (the air control ability is the best imo).\n\nThe graphics are incredible too, although you better have a strong card if you want to play on Ultra with anti-aliasing, etc. Uncapping framerate, setting your FOV to 130, tons of options to customize.\n\nAnd I have to say, Mick Gordon's soundtrack in this game is some of the best I've heard in a while. On the third level, I was literally head banging and rocking out to a soundtrack that felt like a crossbreed between Lamb of God, Celldweller, and Rage Against the Machine.\n\nOverall, I can confidently say that this is the Doom game we've wanted. We all can breath a sigh of relief now that the main portion of the game is actually well-done. That beta we played is absolutely no indicator of how the campaign plays in the slightest, and id did it right with this one. Definitely recommend this title as a gamer, a die hard Doom fan (still play the classic to this day), and FPS fanatic.\n\nEDIT: Since some of you do not take the time to actually explore the game's options and like to jump to conclusions, you can in fact start the game on nightmare. Ultra-nightmare is unlocked after beating the game, NOT regular nightmare.

His job was to make a DooM that goes back to the roots and feels like the classic games.\n\nNot really an easy task, considering DooM is one of the most hyped franchises of all time, and a lot of the fans have incredibly high expectations, some at such levels it almost becomes unhealthy. And when the hype is built into such astronomical dimensions, you might fail to see the game for what it is, leaving you to miss out on the 95% good, and focus on the 5% that is bad or less good.\n\nBut even considering what a daunting task it must have been for id to finally resurrect this dearly loved franchise, and even secure the future for themselves as a independent company. I have one simple thing to say.\n\nOh boy have they succeeded.\n\nMarty and his team of programmers, designers, composers, artists and advanced human beings has managed to revive the magic of the classic games. This game stands far, far, FAR out from basically all other fps games currently on the market.\n\nAnd what a true relief that is.\n\nI still have some bitter taste regarding the multiplayer though, which designs was outsourced to a company called certain affinity (id made the singleplayer and snapmap), and i can't but wonder if id should have made the multiplayer themselves. The multiplayer in this game feels like a vague impression of the singleplayer, they are really hard to compare. And it might have hurt the game's reputation, as this installments beta was not very well recieved on PC. Those that hated it, might never give the singleplayer the chance it deserves.\n\nBecause folks. id has done it. Again!\nIt would be a damn shame, if id wont make enough money on this game to inspire to produce sequels. The fans have been begging for a new DooM like this for over 20 years, and when it finally arrives, some mental patients complain that pick up items are glowing, or that the game has melee kills, or that doom marine looks like master chief, or that you can have emotes in multiplayer...\n\nGuys please, pick your battles. id has delivered, by a huge margin. They made the game we have all been asking for, and they have done it really well. There were so many things that could have gone wrong with this game, and if you ignore multiplayer, pretty much nothing did. I'm not saying the multiplayer is bad, but it is not on par with the singleplayer.\n\nid took a chance, they went back to their roots, they respected their heritage, and they listened to the fans. This game is FUN! Just like the classic DooM games was/is.\n\ni'm having just as much of a blast playing this.\n\nAnd i was there, 23 years ago, at the age of 17.\n\nI even remember to this day exactly where i was, in what house, in what city, at what time of day, when i first saw DooM being played on a 486 66mhz with soundblaster. My jaw almost detached from it's foundation. It was 1993, very few people had internet back then, me included. So when i saw DooM at my friend's house that day, it was like something i had never seen before, i was not even aware it existed. The sense of WOW hitting me in the face when i saw it, is something no other game has been able to do, it was so different and so gorgeous, i actually did not believe my own eyes.\n\nThe original DooM stands as a monument in gaming history and is even to this day one of the most influentual games of all time. These are not easy shoes to fill. And this DooM can never fill those shoes either, because the first DooM wasn't only fun to play, it was a technical marvel of likes the gaming industry has rarely seen before or after. But what the new DooM can do, is to continue the legacy and keep on walking. And that is what they have achieved.\n\nWhen you walk through hell, keep on walking.\nThe game is fast, smooth, awesome, gorgeous and bloody.\nThe soundtrack is amazing and combined with the sound effects it creates the atmosphere you felt playing the classic games. And combined with the fact that you never break first person view, and that this game has very few "cutscenes" you really feel like you are the man passing through hell to make a solid impression.\n\nYou feel like a complete badass, and the action starts pretty much 10 seconds after you load the game, and it never stops. And just like in the good old days, it feels good to get my ♥♥♥ (sigh) handed to me again. I went for Ultra-Violence in my first playthrough, and i don't recommend anyone to play on anything lower than this, exept if you are new to the franchise and fps in general.\n\nDooM is everything i ever asked for.\n\nThank you Marty, and your entire team!\n\nid is back","May 13","true","41.4"," 528 of 599 people (88%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","88","528","599","23","20"

They've managed to breathe new life into the Doom franchise by keeping true to the series' roots, while injecting it with a healthy dose of  modern design sensibilities. The end result: one of the best shooters on the market, and one of the best shooters of the last 10 years.\n\nDoom is fast-paced, frenetic, and surprisingly challenging. Many gamers will be surprised to learn that the game doesn't really hold their hand through the journey, but that's the beauty of it. With its sprawling maps and challenging battles, Doom will test veteran gamers on the higher difficulty levels--and that's a good thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/recommended/379720/","SavageBeastZero","SavageBeastZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavageBeastZero/","609 products in account","Summary\nWith the release of DOOM, ID Software has once again returned to form, bringing new relevance to a franchise that had laid dormant for over ten years aside from spin offs and re-releases. Although many worried that DOOM wouldn't impress upon launch, I can safely say that not only does it impress, but exceeded expectations tenfold.\n\nID Software has created another instant FPS classic that will leave you wondering why they ever strayed from this formula to begin with. With insanely fast paced action, fluid gameplay and fantastic graphics, DOOM is a nightmare come to life in all the best ways.\n\nWhether you're looking for an immersive single player campaign or an addictive multiplayer component, you'll quickly realize that ID Software and Certain Affinity were both successful in paying their respects to fans of the series by bringing them an experience deserving of its decade long absence.\n\nDOOM without a doubt deserves to be mentioned in the same bredth as its namesake and is a worthy successor to continue its legacy.\n\nWelcome back to hell\n\nSingle Player Campaign\nWithin the first few moments of beginning your DOOM capaign, you'll be thrust into action. Literally seconds after the opening begins, you'll be fragging demons like its 1993 again. No unecessarily legnthly cinematic cut scenes, just DOOM. You'll be immediately immersed naturally, taking on the role of the DOOM Marine and slaying demons on Mars in brutal fashion.\n\nAs you traverse the facility and Mars surface, you be engrossed by the incredibly atmospehric surroundings, which are created with intense gameplay in mind. You'll be moving and attacking with forward progression, aggressively destroying hordes of demons and leaving their lifeless remains in your wake.\n\nAs the incredibly unforgiving DOOM Marine you'll be ripping and tearing through seemingly impossible odds, growing ever stronger as you upgrade your weapons throughout the campaign. From pistol and shotgun, to the legendary BFG, there are quite a few weapons at your disposal to dispatch your demonic enemies.\n\nIn regards to story, it's there, but not in the sense of countless cinematic cutscenes as many of us are accustomed to, but instead naturally by collecting information and reading its contents. This is an incredibly welcome method of immersion that all but a few titles have recently engaged in the use of in game.\n\nConsidering DOOM's campaign welcomes the player to return after completing it, to play at a higher difficulty or search for secrets hidden in the world, this is an incredibly smart decision. There's nothing worse than having to wait through a ten minute cutscene when you've already beaten a game and simply want to return to the action. I commend ID Software for not going the cinematic cutscene means of story telling due to this fact and the game benefits greatly from this decision, you'll see.\n\nBack are the beloved DOOM elements such as searching for colored keycards to gain access to different areas of the map as well as searching for hidden areas or easter eggs (Which there are many, but I won't spoil them here). You'll be surprised at exactly how large the DOOM world is, if you decide to attempt to locate everything.\n\nAlthough some have completed the campaign in roughly 9 hours, they most definitely weren't taking advantage of the entire experience available. DOOM could easily take upwards of 20 hours or more if being played completionist style, searching for everything hidden in its world and that's only if you're playing on "Hurt me plenty", DOOM's normal difficulty.\n\nIf played on Ultra nightmare, even a highly skilled FPS player would have to put likley hundreds of painstaking hours to manage the same feat. So there's most definitely value to be found in DOOM's single player campaign alone and quite a bit at that to warrant a purchase.\n\nWith that being said...even if you're only interested in the single player campaign, I would give a resounding recommendation for all Steam users to add it to your collection, because it's not just a fantastic release, it's an instant classic.\n\nMultiplayer Component\nDOOM's multiplayer component is increedibly well developed, addictive and much deeper than it originally appeared during the beta. So much so, that I put roughly twenty hours into multiplayer within the first weekend after release. Surprisingly, as I played more and more I became less interested in wishing it was more like Quake and grew excited that it was the DOOM it had turned into being.\n\nFast paced, relentless and unforgiving, it was the DOOM I didn't realize I wanted until I got it and thank God I did. Totally unexpected, after much debate, it dawned on me that I now have a new favorite online shooter.\n\nOne of the first things you'll notice is that the hitboxes are much less forgiving in comparison to other FPS titles such as Call of Duty, Battlefield or Team fortress 2 and much more akin to the Quake hitboxes of old which is a welcome return. When you earn kills they're incredibly satisfying in comparison and I believe many other DOOM players would agree.\n\nYou'll start to make minute adjustments during exchanges with an enemy, that you never had to in competing titles. This leads to incredibly tense engagements on a regular basis, that truly makes the experience much, much more enjoyable in the long run. Although much less forgiving, it leads to a much more rewarding experience overall.\n\nThe multi-tiered maps make use of the double jump mechanic and using them on a regular basis is a necessity, but in no way feels over done. DOOM is a shooter and a shooter first, which means evading an enemy is unlikely, so although you'll need to take advantage of the available movememnt system, you can't use it as a crutch like in many other recent AAA multiplayer releases, so master movement, but aim and aim well.\n\nDOOM now has loadouts, each containing two weapons of your choice and a hack module system where prior to a match you can select up to four hack modules that can be utilized during a match. The hack module system is surprisingly really well thought out and increases the depth as well as balance overall.\n\nThe hack modules available each reward the player with slightly enhanced stats such as +5% armor or the ability to see your enemy through walls for 5 seconds after you respawn, but none of them create an imbalance at all. Like I said above they merely add to the depth and I find them to be a welcome addition to the overall multiplayer package.\n\nDemon runes are another gameplay addition that I find to be a quite enjoable experience in DOOM's multiplayer. Players can select either the Revenant, Baron of Hell, Mancubus or Prowler and each are able to perform differing attacks which suit certain maps better than others, as well as certain play styles. This truly adds to the depth of multiplayer overall by quite a bit.\n\nDemon runes become active on map after a certain amount of time has transpired and then the first player to collect it will become their chosen demon, that can then cause havok on the defending team. So, essentially, demon ruins are now the OP weapons of previous Quake games. Where all players are fighting to be the first to get them. So overall that gameplay aspect of Quake is here, just reimagined.\n\nIn closing DOOM's multiplayer isn't simply an afterthought, but a completely fleshed out experience that many players will find themselves addicted to for quite some time.

The beta was almost met with an outright hostility from most gamers and at one point hit that not-so-sweet-spot on the client where it earned itself a rating of "mostly negative". Considering the game was a few weeks away from launch and that the previous version - a continuation of what Doom 3 started back in 2004 and known simply as Doom 4 - had been scrapped entirely after nearly six years in development hell. It certainly didn't help allay fears when no review copies where shipped out to major gaming sites signalling what possibly looked like a lack of faith in the property. Maybe Bethesda already knew it had a winner on its hands so they where just showing everybody the middle finger? DOOM was always going to be a game that would sell and sell well, and like Bethesda's own in-house property The Elder Scrolls, DOOM pretty much comes with its own built-in audience. Thankfully I am happy to report that ID Software seem to have made a fine return to form with DOOM - This years loudest, dumbest, goriest re-imagining of a classic that is that rare breed of game that for once actually works perfectly as a homage for those of us old enough to remember what old-school actually meant (no health regen and no cover system)  and fast and furious enough with some modern aces up its sleeve as to appeal to the crowd weaned on the modern day shooter (such as upgrading all your weapons) without sacrificing and butchering the core. Most importantly it is just crazy fun to play and is the most enjoyable fps I have played in a good, long while.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=689989672\nIn many ways DOOM distills what was once old and great about the genre and combines it with the best of modern game design principles. Here simple little tweaks such as the player no longer needing to waste time reloading, not being required to hold down the shift key in order to engage a faster movement speed (that speed is now the default) to my personal favorite little tweak - weapons that have run out of ammo are no longer accidentally selectable when using the mouse scroll wheel until you have topped them up with more ammo. While none of this may sound revolutionary, I can not imagine going back to an FPS that employs those tiresome mechanics mentioned above ever again unless it is authentic realism I am going for in a shooter such as the ARMA series. The game now also features a far more modern day approach when it comes to level design. Levels are big and  sprawling and littered with achievements, secrets and challenges to keep you busy once you have powered through the main story-line. While initially they appear to be very linear -  a little bit of exploring off the beaten track soon reveals that while DOOM may not adhere to the open world design philosophy of today's modern game (something I feel is often more of a curse than a blessing) it does take what players seem to love about them (such as completing rudimentary tasks across a map) and integrates them seamlessly into the game. Rune Challenges (where the player gets to earn a rune that enhances power-ups or certain weapons) are littered across the game world for you to discover and unlock. Essentially nothing more than a series of time trials where you will have to beat the clock against certain enemy types or perform a certain number of tasks in the allocated time frame they actually make perfect sense in a far better way than stopping your questing in Assassin's Creed to suddenly collect thirty flags that have no bearing on the world or story-line or gameplay for that matter.\n\nUsing each weapon you are handed (the game is very good at giving you all the toys to play with right out the box and doesn't waste time drip-feeding you the junk at the start with all the best weaponry locked away near the end) and you can now build up proficiency in certain weapon types depending on how much you use the weapon during your run and/or by completing certain level tasks such eliminating certain enemy types with a specific type of weapon. Once levels are completed you can go back and run through them countless times until you have unlocked all the achievements, discovered all the level secrets and completed all the level tasks. If I have one complaint it is that some of the levels are just so darn large and go on for what feels like forever especially when you are hit continuously with an ever increasing hoard of enemies. Some of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are tough on their own but soon you will be facing up to 4 of them simultaneously and I found it can become quite a chore (and not to mention a challenge) to move past if you just happen to die just before the checkpoint is activated. Graphically the games looks utterly incredible and is very well optimized. Most systems should be able to run DOOM without any issues. The ID Tech 5 quirk of textures taking a while to load when entering new areas is back but it is not as bad as it was when RAGE debuted using the engine. Having said that ID Software needs to look at finally solving this conundrum.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=693219234&tscn=1464523996\nThe jury is still out on whether there will be anyone still playing the multiplayer component of the game in three months time. Personally I couldn't care for it as Doom was never about multiplayer having always been primarily a singular-focused experience and while some might find this disappointing this new version of DOOM never needed it anyway. Besides that is why ID software has Quake. Seeing as though Bethesda is moving through the ID catalog top-down I am sure it will be just a matter of time before Quake gets the once over.\n\nWhile ID software may have had great success in the early to late nineties with the likes of Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake the departure of key ID players such as Romero and Carmack (both Adrian and John) has seen the company flounder a bit when compared to its former glory days. Doom 3, while critically and commercially well received, was very different to the run-and-gun gameplay the series is known and loved for. Where Doom 3 had its sights set on revolutionizing the survival horror genre; its thunder and might was completely stolen when Capcom released Resident Evil 4 and RAGE amounted to nothing more than a pretty buggy tech demo for the in-house developed ID Tech 5 engine that saw the game fizzle and fade away faster than a demon with a doomslayer on his ♥♥♥.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=692415527\nDOOM's gameplay is decidedly old-school (with some modern twists) but it is all the better because of it. Fast, furious and frantic - The Doomslayer has returned. DOOM proves that old-school never really died. It is alive and kicking in the depths of hell. DOOM is one of 2016 great games. Don't let it pass you by.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 29","true","24.3"," 263 of 317 people (83%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","83","263","317","20","25"

Sadly, their latest efforts haven't been as successful as the original Doom and its sequel, or the Quake series. Rage, their first new IP in years, had pacing issues, and idTech 5, id's shiny new engine, wasn't as good as one would expect from id. One could argue that the last id Software game that felt right at home with their legacy is either Doom 3 or Quake 3 Arena (Doom 3 lacks the relentless action that made id famous but it delivered in spades if you consider the tech department)\nWell, I have good news for you, fans of the FPS genre! id Software is back, and better than ever. DOOM's singleplayer campaign is both modern and old school. It's incredibly good looking, runs amazingly well, and has a beautiful soundtrack.\nGone is the oppressive darkness and slow action that characterized Doom 3. Rage's poor pacing and graphics issues? Gone too. In their place, we can find fast paced action, a well thought upgrade system, intricate maps that remind us of a bygone era, and a tongue in cheek attitude that permeates the whole story mode. Doom Guy is here to kill demons and he won't let silly things like cutscenes get in his way.\nPrepare yourself for a journey that will take you to Mars and (spoiler alert, duh!) Hell itself in a quest to blow apart thousands of demons and use their entrails as health or ammo boosts. DOOM adds a new feature called Glory Kills, which lets the player execute wounded demons in exchange for a quick health top up, and believe me, you will learn to love it!\nSo yeah, id Software is back, baby!\nNow that I've relayed the good news, it's time for the bad stuff:\nThe multiplayer component isn't as good as the campaign, and it wasn't even made by the same team (it was outsourced to the same guys that helped build the latest Halo's online component) Movement is pretty fast, but not as fast as Quake 3. Weapons aren't pickups anymore (with some exceptions) and you build a loadout, similar to Call of Duty or Battlefield, to name a few modern shooters that use the same system.\nThe SnapMap system is interesting, but a fully featured mod suite would certainly be a better thing for PC owners.\n\nAll in all, I think that DOOM is one of the best shooters in decades, and any FPS fan should consider getting it. A botched multiplayer offering can't overshadow the fact that the campaign is a work of art and it can rightfully claim a place in history alongside Doom 1 and 2.\n","May 18","true","25.4"," 114 of 137 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","114","137","9","3"

I was very surprised that the story had so much more depth to it than I had anticipated.\n\nAs you progress through the campaign, you find several different weapons, and almost all of them are badass. On top of some already awesome weapons, you can also find weapon mods for each one to upgrade how you want. I found the plasma gun stun mod especially helpful for keeping demons off of my face, and the chainsaw and BFG are crazy fun to use. You will need to switch up your weapons as you run out of different ammo types, and  you will also want to mix in melee finishers as well.\n\nWhen demons get low on health they stagger for a short period, and when you see it, if you quickly get into range, you can perform a melee execute called a glory kill. The glory kill animations are bloody as hell, and it’s incredibly awesome each and every time. I haven’t been this satisfied ripping things apart since I played The Darkness II. The kill animations are short, and quick, so I never got sick of seeing them, unlike how bored the slow motion kill shots in the Fallout series got after the first few. Performing glory kills also awards bonus health drops, allowing you stay in the fight longer.\n\nThe boss fights each had scripted phases with unique mechanics. Bosses did a lot of damage if you failed to react properly, but once you learned the patterns, the fights were much easier. I really enjoyed the boss fights, It was nice to only have to focus on one enemy for a little bit instead of a whole bunch of them chasing after you.\n\nPros:‘run and gun’ playstyle is very enjoyable, and the combat is really fun and intense - keep moving, running, jumping, climbing, and fend off the hordes of demons spawning all around you!\nlevel designs are done very well, and running and gunning feels very fluid jumping from one place to another while fighting\noverall graphics look great (but they aren’t perfect)\namazing soundtrack throughout the entire game; it made the encounters feel like such a rush\nvoice acting, and other sound effects were on point as well\ngood story campaign, and there was a lot more to it than just killing demons (but I wasn’t too thrilled by the ending)\nseveral badass different weapons that you can mod, and upgrade how you want\ngood quick melee executions (glory kills) that are very satisfying\nseveral secrets, various weapons, mods, and upgrade items hidden around each of the levels (and a map to help you find them, once you find the map data)\nCons:some minor texture issues, but the game is so fast paced, that many people might not even notice\nexpensive season pass if you want to have everything when it first becomes available\nYou also find power-ups that can give different temporary combat bonuses, such as extra damage, speed, berserk, and invulnerability. You know you’re about to get slammed by demons when you enter a room fully stocked with health, ammo, armor, and power-ups.\n\nI can see some people wanting to replay on the hardest difficult and for achievements, but I don’t feel the need to play again. Multiplayer mode may have a good amount of replay value, but I’m not a big fan of arena or deathmatch, and after seeing the really expensive season pass that was put out after release, so I don’t think I will bother playing multiplayer.\n\nThe campaign took me roughly 11.5 hours on normal mode to complete. The game was really fun, and it was an enjoyable campaign, but I feel like everything was too well lit to be scared, so I don’t really think of it as a horror game. I bought DOOM at 25% off, and I was thoroughly entertained for the entire time I played it. I have no regrets with this purchase. I highly recommend this one to any fast paced FPS fans out there.","May 13","true","11.7"," 212 of 283 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","212","283","8","0"

But in terms of the campaign, it is probably my favourite fps campaign since F.E.A.R. with an absolutely stunning gameplay loop. Absolutely amazing stuff. I've been enjoying the multiplayer to, which isn't as brilliant as the campaign thus far but is still fun. Certianly not tacked on, but certainly not as good as the campaign.\n\nPros:\n+ the gameplay loop is just amazing, it does start of slow though, but it picks up pace very quickly.\n+ Runs Great (everything but shadows and Vitual Texturing Page Size maxed as the nightmare setting are not selectable unless you have 5gb of vram. Otherwise maxed and always above 60 with a 970).  * by using "+menu_advanced_AllowAllSettings 1" in launch options you can select the higher graphical modes and from an hour or so of playing completely maxed the performance hit isn't massive but it did cause some minor stutter for myself. However if you lock to 60fps this may not be an issue as the game didn't dip below that point).\n+ Guns are varied in use and fun to use.\n+ Fast paced, as in very fast paced though it does start of relatively slow compared to just a little later into the game.\n+ Sprint by default, though you can make your character move slower.\n+ Vartiety has been added with upgrades that add to the chaos.\n+ The game is gorgeous and the levels varied.\n+ The movement system is fantastic.\n+ Whilst no open world the levels are large and expansive.\n+ The verticality in said levels is used brilliantly to enhance the options you have from moment to moment.\n+ Enemies are nicely varied requiring different tactics to take out. Especially when you up the difficulty.\n+ Plenty of secrets and things to look around and find.\n+ Melee attacks are a nice addition that add some tactics for getting health back\n+ Minimal story with very few cutscene like moments so far (yes, doom should not be overly cut scene or lore heavy, it at its core is about killing demons). What is there however is done well, it just isn't front and center.\n+ The voice acting is suprisingly extremely good. There isn't much, but what is there all works as intended. Bravo, it would have been easy to have this let the game down.\n+ Loving the multiplayer, but if you didn't like the beta I can't comment as it may be similar (didn't play much of the beta myself).\n+ Though I wouldn't listen to it on its own, the music fits the game extremely well. Sometime a track will play when it probably shouldn't (common in games) but overall it fits very well.\n+Snapmap adds a large amount of possible content that so far has been quite good. Though only time will tell how much it is used.\n\n\nCons:\n- Whilst a nice addition to much emphasis is on melee finishers. It is at its worst at the beginning, but I can't help but feel it is something that could have been introduced later once it actually becomes used in a tactical manner.\n- No bunny hopping (why, god why) [edit: to be clear it was in Doom 3 and to me is a staple of id games since jumping has been in there games that sadly has been abandoned]. Many I know won't be bothered by this.\n- Textures are not poor per se, but certainly could be better.\n- Upgrades can be a little on the boring side at times, more health, armor, ammo etc. There weapon upgrades are good fun though.\n- Every time you change from single player, to multiplayer to snapmap the game exits and reopens. I minor complaint but still a little annoying.\n- Ending is very anticlimatic with clear sequel bait, which given id's track record may never come as a direct follow up.\n\n\nThe Neatral:\n+/-: DOOM is fast, like really fasst and thus unsuprisingly this game simply doesn't play very well with a controller. This is to be expected but if you intend to play that way expect your experience to be lessened. This really is a fps where m+k is neaded to play as it seems the designers intended.\n+/-: There may if anything be to large an emphasis on having color in every frame present. It isn't horrible but some darker areas would have been aprreciated. I imagine this is doubly so for massive doom 3 fans.\n+/-: There are many hoarde like moments where your basically put in an arena against swarms of enemies. I loved this especially because of the degree of verticality present. But I can see some disliking it.\n\n\nFrom the multiplayer i've played, I suspect it may only have TDM be active like so many rescent pc shotters sadly.\n\nReview to be updated as I play more.","May 12","true","25.7"," 763 of 1,095 people (70%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","70","763","1","50","78"

Well you better because this game is f***ing amazing!\nThis is a game that does not mess around, you are immediately thrown into the game without any tutorials (of course they appear on text later), you have your pistol and you kill, and not far after you get your sexy as hell Doom Suit..boom! Title Screen all up in your face! First blown load right there.\n\nYou guys think this has a story? Hahaha, f*** stories! You are a bulky b**tard with guns, demons use a portal to reach mars from hell, Doomguy f**** their s*** up with big bad *** guns of destruction, theres your story!\n"But Constable Dank you fat furry/weeb, are the guns back?"\nThen I would slap you for asking a silly question! Of course the guns are back! You got your plasma gun, shotgun, double barrell, chaingun, chainSAW, and what would a doom game be complete without the king of them all...the dominating BFG 9000, and all of these sexy toys of destruction do exactly just that. Instead of these wimpy COD guns that go...pew.....pew, DOOM cranks these guns up to f**king Saturn! When playing the game, these guns cause some serious...SERIOUS impact!\nThis is old school DOOM where as the demons are looking better than ever:\nHell Knights, Cacodemons, Imps, Revenants, Cyberdemon, and a few iconic bosses make a return as well.\nThe gameplay is so smoothe and fast, you never have a moments rest of killing the demon horde (with a few exceptions of finding keycards and the correct color skull to advance to the next area).\nAs you go through the game you will also have multiple paths of upgrading your DoomGuy, from punching little drones to add mods to your arsenal, killing demon hordes to upgrade your guns, and collecting balls of red energy to increase your health, armor, and ammo. (There are also some codex and doom figures to collect as well)\n\nThere is also a cool feature called Glory Kills in which all demons have their own death animation, want to make the Baron of Hell your b****? Well wear him down with your gun and then tear him a new one by punching, slicing, ripping into their flesh!\n\nMusic..oh sweet cyborg Jesus the music.\nMetal...Metal...Metal!\nGraphics look amazing, very atmospheric from the Mars Surface to the gates of Hell themselves that not even Dante could walk two feet without ♥♥♥♥ rolling down his legs!\n\nNot many problems I could find, just minor ones like occasional screen tearing and glitching through enemies and walls in a couple of parts.\n\nWhat else is there to say?\n"B-but Constable..do you r-recommend this game?"\nHELL yeah I do!\nGuns with impact, fast gameplay, music that makes metal fans rejoice, bosses that do not hold back!\nThis redefines what a shooter should be, and the grand daddies of the genre ID software have came back with a vengeance on this one.\nThis game is the defines brutal to the 10th degree, this game makes men harder than Wurtzite Boron Nitride and ladies wetter than the Atlantic Ocean, this game will make love to your girlfriend and then b**** slap you at the same time telling to go sit in a corner while you watch with your screaming.."Oh yes Doom, please give me that BFG!"\nIf this game called you a worthless pile of human waste, you would say thank you cause your DOOM!\nNot sure where I am going with these but..\nDOOM: BUY IT!\n","May 15","true","18.6"," 121 of 153 people (79%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","79","121","153","75","9"

The only difference is that Doom Guy's demons are very real and my demon is crippling drug abuse.\n\nThe interesting thing about the new Doom is that it really isn't a reboot per say, but kind of like a sequel to the events that happened at the end of DOOM 64, (By the way, someone ported DOOM 64 to the PC not too long ago, go check it out, it's kind of rad.)\n\nDoom Guy was captured and placed in a sarcophagus by his enemies, but after being retrieved by a team of UAC soldier's led by Samuel Hayden, and a second demonic invasion occurs, Doom Guy is released from his slumber to once again rip and tear.\nRip and Tear.\nLike the Doom comic.\nSee, I'm hip. I know things.\n\nWhat transpires is a 6 to 10 hour gauntlet of murder as the Doom Guy shoots, punches, chainsaws, cooks, cleans, files taxes, and goes on cute demon dates through the UAC facility that has been over run by...60,000 some demons, I think that was the number. But the story isn't important, even Doom Guy thinks the story isn't important, he just wants to show the imps and hell barons what the inside of their heads look like. I can respect that. So lets get to the good bits.\n\nTo say it simply and like a 3rd grader. DOOM is a love letter. Not just to DOOM, but the idea of DOOM and the idea of old-school shooters in general. You don't have to reload, you run surprisingly fast, you can carry all of the weapons at once, you can find power ups, and there are secrets on every level. It doesn't just feel like DOOM, but it almost also feels like QUAKE or even other games like Blood or Daikatana.\n\nI made that last part up. I fooled you.\n\nThe levels are wide and open and beg for you to explore to find all of their secrets and easter eggs. Each level has a set amounts of secret collectibles and rooms to find, and you're rewarded for finding them. Sometimes you get stacked up on weapons and ammo, sometimes you get max health, and sometimes you get a little toy to put up on your wall along with your anime figures you ♥♥♥♥ing nerd.\n\nAt first, I didn't like the shooting, it felt slow to me and lacked impact. But it grew on me as the game went on and they added more and more weapons to your arsenal. It's like getting one of those budget games for the PS1 back in the day and then realizing that it's actually super good later on. That or finding a burrito with only one bite in it in the trash.\n\nWho only bites once into a burrito? A communist, that's who.\n\nI don't know why, but I think it was just the standard shotgun for me that turned me off at first. But the other weapons all have this amazing “Oomph” every time you pull the trigger. Everything from the assault rifle to the rocket launcher look, sound, and feel like they painful. Which makes sense because they're guns.\n\nThe weapons don't only blow off  limbs,  but tear away at flesh and splatter the room with chunky bits you could probably make delicious soup with. It's this crunch behind the guns that a lot of shooters seem to lack, giving them weight and feel to them.\n\nThough I don't know why Doom guy even uses guns, considering the amount of damage he can do with his hands. The guy should look into boxing because he punches like three dump trucks going down hill at the same time.\n\nWhen you do enough damage to an enemy, you have the option of finishing them off with melee while they're stunned. No, it's not just a little Halo rifle butt or a knife from Call of Duty, get that preschool ♥♥♥♥ out of here. No, instead Doom Guy will dispose of the critter in a plethora of brutal ways from tearing off jaws, ripping off limbs, beating them to death with their own arms, or just flat out punching through their head. It's a nice change in brutality that, at least myself, am use to seeing in modern video games.\n\nAnd if all else fails you can just go the lumberjack route and slice them to bits with a chainsaw. Groovy.\n\nI will now talk about the multiplayer.\n\n\n\n\nI am done talking about the multiplayer.\n\n\nShould you play ROOM: The moving in?\n\nIf I have any actual complaints about Doom is that it kind of drags on near the end, and as weird as this sounds, maybe it could be a little bit more Brutal? I don't know, I just feel like there could be a bit more blood and gibs flying around, make it something soccer mom's take notice to again. Lets get back to 1999 boys, someone call of Jack Thompson, we old school controversy now.\n\nOther than that, DOOM is a pretty intense experience. It's kind of slow at first as it gets you into the swing of things, but if you stick with it, you're in for one of the most refreshing games in a long time.\n\nDOOM gets 4 comic book references out of a possible 3.\n\nGary Busey eats people's teeth to gain power.\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","May 29","true","9.7"," 116 of 147 people (79%) found this review helpful 95 people found this review funny","79","116","147","95","6"

Much like the original Doom games, not even 5 seconds in and you’re already shooting! There’s no cover system, it’s all about running around like a maniac killing everything in sight. This is what Doom 3 should've been.\n\n+ Executions (“Glory Kills”) with over 30 different animations; similiar to brutal doom.\n+ Great level design with large, well designed levels that often freely allow for backtracking.\n+ Tons of secrets with early weapon unlocks and other fun things.\n+ Nostalgic easter eggs, As expected from ID/Bethesda.\n+ Awesome soundtrack that sticks to the roots of the series; a mix of good old metal with electronic elements.\n+ Great aesthetic and visual fidelity. Not quite Frostbyte-level, but still very very good.\n+ Classic pickup-based health system; no automatic regen.\n+ Good enemy variety; at least 15 varieties.\n+ Great weapon variety. Returning classics + some new additions, with 2 mods and a set of upgrades for each (like Wolfenstein TNO).\n+ Carry all of your weapons at once and quickly switch between them (sadly not in the multiplayer).\n+ No weapon reloading. I pressed R anyway for the first 30 minutes out of habit.\n+ Fast load times.\n+ Suit upgrades as incentive to find all the secrets.\n+ Great story for a Doom game; good ending too!\n+ Runs smoothly at 60+ fps.

The full game offers more variety than the beta as well as SnapMap for a touch of creativity, but the core problems and imbalances still stand.\n- The Season Pass is said to only expand upon the multiplayer; I’d have loved more single-player content.\n\nA solid addition to the Doom-series and a worthy reboot of the classic titles.\nI hope we see a DOOM II!","May 19","true","24.8"," 72 of 82 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","72","82","6","0"

Have fun tearing monsters to pieces without worrying about the ethics of simulated murder because they are demons that would happily kill everyone in their sight!\n\nSingle player has a robust upgrade system that constantly gives you new toys to play with. There are challenges in the SP that incentivizes mixing your attacks up. Also, there are great rewards for exploration as well! In DOOM, there is also an automap that is clean, slick, and accessible. When I first saw the automap in one of the gameplay trailers, I knew this game was going to be polished.\n\nMultiplayer is great fun in general. Demon runes and power weapons strike fear into your enemies' heart, you will see them cower in fear as baron of hell charges head first into a fight. Snapmap is a great map tool, you can see that the developers spent time and effort finished the game before relaasing it.\n\nAgain, everything is completely polished and well made. I never felt i missed shots because of lag in multiplayer. I have not found a single glitch in single player. Great boss fights and when played on higher difficulty, it has a sort of dark souls feel to it, even though its supposed to be a FPS!\n\nSeriously, i can't undestand why IGN has given this a 7.1. Its simply objectively wrong when you look at what other crappy unpolished unoriginal games you can get for the same price. I have not played a more fun FPS for a long time. I felt my money was well spent on a great product. With an upgrade system, DOOM SP cannot be said to be repetitive because of the variety of attacks and tactical decision you can make in a fight. Multiplayer can be played well after the SP has ended, so the game simply has much more replayability than many SP only games we have today. In DOOM, you can go head to head with a demon horde.

Is this true to the original? My personal answer to that is: Who gives a sh*t? I only care about if it's a good game or not, but if you really want to know, DOOM is as true to the original as it could be. You can clearly see the developer's love to the original in every detail of this game. Maybe DOOM means something else to you personally, but I think what DOOM really is about, that is what the developers nailed.\n\nI should add that this type of FPS is my favorite type of game, like this game was exactly tailored to my taste, but that doesn't mean that others won't enjoy it, but for the game to truly shine, you have to play on the higher difficulties, and start dancing with the enemies. What the hell am I talking about? Dancing? Yes. That is a term I got from the "making of" of Serious Sam 3. In DOOM you get challenged in every aspect. You don't just have to aim good, you don't just have to choose the right weapon for the job, you don't just have to prioritize the right enemy, you don't just have to dodge projectiles coming towards you, you will face a threat from every direction.\n\nKleers in Serious Sam 3 are my favorite enemies, although many players might think they are annoying, but what's so great about them is that they get behind the player, which forces the player to watch his front and his back. In DOOM you have to watch every direction, because enemies can be everywhere, not because they just randomly come out of nowhere, but because every enemy in this game has unique patterns so that every enemy will challenge you in different ways. The possessed soldiers will shoot you from your front, the cacodemons will shoot you from above, the pinky demons will charge you and get behind your back, while other enemies like the mancubus and imps act like "artillery" fire.\n\nThe enemies are by far my favorite part of this game, not just from a gameplay perspective. Every single one of them is so badass, their design is unique, threating, but also consistent. The barons of hell are truly intimidating. But for every new enemy you face, you will also be rewarded with a new toy to play with, guns. And that is the second thing I love so much about this game. The weapon arsenal is just PERFECT. Every weapon has different strength and weaknesses, every weapon has it's role, it's place. The plasma rifle and gauss rifle, the assault rifle and the minigun, and the shotgun and super shotgun share their ammo, but every weapon is still viable and makes sense.\n\nWhy use the assault rifle when you have a minigun? Well, first you obviously get the minigun much later, but the minigun also has a long spin up time, so there are situations where you need to fire quickly, which is what the assault rifle is better at. Also the assault rifle is much more precise. The super shotgun does way more damage than the normal shotgun, but you have to reload after every shot, and for the normal enemies the super shotgun is overkill, which means you will waste ammo. The normal shotgun though has a much higher fire rate, and is also more versatile due to it's cool secondary fire modes. The gauss rifle is just the most badass weapon ever, but as the super shotgun, it is overkill against a lot of enemies, so the plasma rifle might be the better option. Also the plasma rifle has a secondary fire mode that can stun enemies.\n\nYou see, they put a lot of thought behind the weapon arsenal. The multiplayer actually has a lot more weapons, but those aren't in the singleplayer for a good reason. Then there is also the chainsaw and the BFG. I love how they gave the chainsaw depth with it's ammo. The chainsaw has very limited ammo, but can insta kill enemies. To use it on heavy hitters though, you will need more ammo. Also killing an enemy with the chainsaw gives you tons of ammo for your other weapons, but to use it, you have to get close. Use all your chainsaw fuel to take out a huge threat? Or use it on smaller foes in safe situations to get some ammo? Like the BFG it is also a last resort weapon.\n\nThe third thing I love is the level design. The world is linear, but there is tons of exploration. That means that the experience is always guided, focused and extremely well paced, but you always have places to explore, find secrets, do challenges. That also kinda allows you to affect the pacing of the game yourself. The same is with the story. You can completely ignore it, or you can read through the codex entries which actually reveal some cool lore to you. I was surprised by how little this game cares about it's story, and that is awesome. I didn't think a game like this could come from the AAA industry in this day and age.\n\nOn the surface FPS like these might look like dumb games, and there are a lot of dumb fps, but this one has depth, it has a ton of depth, packed into extremely satisfying gunplay, badass enemies, and great and varied levels.\n\nDOOM is DOOM.\n\nBuy it.","May 16","true","36.2"," 107 of 142 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","107","142","8","2"

There's something beyond being the most solid FPS and incredible bar raiser in terms of single and multiplayer.\n\nSnap Map is what I expected- Little Big Planet: Doom.... But even more insane than that.\n\nI never planned on spoiling admittedly little things, such as encountering monsters via Snap-Map I haven't yet faced in the campaign. Little stuff like that I'm OCD about. I want the fanfare, the setup and introduction of the enemy I know they'll recieve.... But holy ♥♥♥♥. It was worth it. Spent countless hours iterating on my own campaign with custom use of the incredible tracks provided in the game. (Mick Gordon is a ♥♥♥♥ing boss) .... Incredible design. It's every bit an SDK, Garrys Mod, and more. If you're smart with logic, boolean values and modifiers, use of and-if etc etc etc.... You can make pretty much whatever the hell you want- with the most iconic setting, arrangement of guns, and enemies ever. Be happy that Doom did this kind of content before some generic man-shooter. You can legit make your own experiences or simply play others in a streamlined way that makes this game STUPID in terms of value. Stupid in a ♥♥♥♥ing good way.\n\n\nTL;DR-\nIt doesn't just make a fan of the game that grew up with it, like me, lose their mind over the fan-service. It sets itself far above the rest by being a solid game in its own right.\n\nAnd then there' mother-♥♥♥♥ing Snap Map.

With all the reimaginings, reboots and sequels to stuff two decades old going on lately, you’d have to be a zen master to not experience a certain sense of weariness kicking in. It doesn’t help that those warmed up retellings tend to be utter crap.\n\nThe original Doom is the OG of first person shooters. While it wasn’t the first FPS to ever be developed, it certainly was the most influential one, popularizing both the genre and PC as a platform for games. Kids all over the world craved it like it was digital crack. Offices had to ban Doom because it decreased the productivity of the employees drastically. University networks were crippled under the sheer load of people downloading and playing the game. If you were young in the early ‘90s, you had heard of Doom. There was no way around it. And that was long before video games became as popular and common as they are now. Practically overnight, Doom made its creators millionaires.\n\nThe creators calling themselves id Software, those were just a handful of nerds fueled by their love for video games and heavy metal, both of which were reflected in their game. In Doom, the player rushed through sci-fi inspired, maze-like levels filled with hellish imagery while gunning down demons left and right. But not only your reflexes were tested: Secrets were sprinkled all over the levels. The game encouraged exploration in order to have an edge over the satanic spawn. Often it was flat-out necessary to advance since the keycards unlocking specific doors were hidden quite well. It was fast, it was gory and it was quite the looker - 3D graphics were still a novelty and Doom achieved visuals never seen before while still being relatively easy on the hardware. In a way, it started the arms race of each new game trying to one up the last one in terms of graphics that lasts to this very day.\n\nDoom’s pop cultural impact was so huge, so undeniable, that the mere idea of a reimagining must seem like blasphemy. Much has changed since the early ‘90s. While Doom defined an entire genre in 1993, it’s just one of many first person shooters now. Other titles such as Call of Duty or Halo are considered the genre standard nowadays. The industry expanded, genre conventions changed a lot and so did the audience - not for the better, some would say. Storytelling is important now and a run and gun shooter like Doom may seem archaic in comparison. Plus, id Software is id Software in name only since none of the founding members are still working at the company. When the new Doom was announced, it had all the telltale signs of a cynical cash grab meant to sell by legacy only. Fans were worried that their holy cow would be turned into yet another generic first person shooter aping the conventions of other titles. But somehow, id Software pulled it off. They managed to do the original's roots justice.\n\nJust so we’re clear here: id Software had some pretty big shoes to fill. So big, in fact, that nobody in his right mind could possibly expect them to make another game as revolutionary as the original Doom. The goal rather seemed to be to introduce the frantic playstyle of classic first person shooters to a new crowd possibly unfamiliar with the original. The speed, the gore, the key hunting - it’s all there. If you grew up playing FPS games in the ‘90s you will feel right at home since the progression is almost identical: You get dropped in a new area, blast every demon in sight into bloody chunks while gracefully dodging projectiles and avoiding melee attacks. Once the last demon has been slain, it’s time to search the area for ammo, health packs and everything else that might give you an edge in upcoming confrontations, or unlock that one door that’s keeping you from advancing. The levels are surprisingly layered due to a high amount of verticality - even if you use the automap frequently, chances are you will miss many secrets regardless. Then you run into the next demon horde and the cycle repeats itself. New are the designated arenas that will shower you with enemies at the push of a button, allowing for some careful planning that is pretty much mandatory at higher difficulties.\n\nWhat’s in here is just as important as what’s not. There is no regenerating health, no iron sights, no limitation regarding how many weapons you can carry and no excessive amount of cutscenes. The new Doom drops you into the action and pretty much leaves you there for the entire duration of the game. However, the world has kept turning since 1993 and some adjustments are to be expected. For instance, Doom has canned instakill animations performed on stunned enemies that drop ammo and health packs, depending on how urgent you need them. And like every action game these days, it features upgrade mechanics. Most of them influence the weapons’ secondary firing modes, but some work like the bandolier pick ups from the Quake series and increase the maximum amount of health or ammo you can carry. This alone may be enough to scare off purists.\n\nLegitimately underwhelming is the art department, be it enemies or levels. It’s by no means bad, just unremarkable. And for a game dealing with depictions of hell, the new Doom is surprisingly tame - not so much in terms of gore and more regarding disturbing imagery. Even the oh so scolded Doom 3 had twitching, vivisected men hanging from the ceiling. You will find nothing along those lines here. Also, I like to think that music played a part in the original’s success. It set the pace and pumped you up while you blew holes into the minions of hell. The new game’s industrial soundtrack is loud first and foremost and features many throwbacks to the iconic themes, but more often than not it sounds like it was created by discount Trent Reznor and loses itself in trivial creaking that doesn’t go anywhere. Additionally, the multiplayer is straight up deadweight.\n\nSo frag it like it’s ‘93? Not quite, but for the vast majority of it. Doom is definitely worth a look, whether you’re starved for a classic first person shooter or not. Apart from a few modern elements, it’s a rather accurate replication of that experience. It won’t leave a mark like the original did and it probably won’t revive oldschool twitch shooters, but it’s a fine game. Double so when taking into account how much worse it could have been.","May 15","true","37.6"," 63 of 78 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","63","78","4","4"

Doom, simply-put, is absolutely incredible. This game has greatly exceeded the somewhat high expectations I had set for it after watching a solid amount of footage before release.  The visuals are absolutely stunning and the game runs very well on my 7/10 PC at max settings.\n\nYou're thrown into action almost immediately, the basic and near-perfect gameplay formula shining right from the start.  The fluidity of the movement, the fast-paced, feel-like-a-badass combat, and the perfect execution of weapon indroduction, upgrade pace and variety.  It's as the developers said, the game is a frantic chess board, of sorts, in which your enemies take their spots and you quickly formulate, execute and constantly re-evaluate your approach to every battle, as it progresses.  When you become comfortable with all the pieces the game offers you as you play through it, every battle almost feels like a dance.  Constant weapon swapping, leaping from platform to platform, never stopping to breath until the music slows down.  It just feels so damn natural and perfect.\n\nHalo 1 was the first time I played a FPS and thought, "this formula is just so perfect that I could play the game over and over again and never get tired of it"(which I did).  Well, I'm here to say that Doom is as close to formula perfection as I've seen since the first Halo.  That's not to say that the two games are similar in how they play, just that each design element has been so perfectly-crafted and results in such incredible synergy that something special is born as a result.  Doom is special, there is no doubt about that.\n\nI've played countless FPS games over the years and I'm confident in admitting that Doom is the most fresh and most fun FPS of this generation.  This game is going places, and I couldn't be happier.\n\nPros:\n-Incredible visuals, both technical and artistic\n-VERY well-optimized, I'd estimate about 60fps average throughout most of the game at max settings\n-Near-perfect gameplay formula, resulting in a foundation that could support an endless amount of content\n-Frantic, gorey, visceral combat that NEVER gets old and plays out differently each time\n-Excellent weapon and gear upgrade systems that encourage you to explore the gorgeous maps for secrets\n-Fantastic arsenal, a gun for every situation.  Even at the end of the game I found myself constantly swapping between 5-6 guns, not including the mods being swapped on each gun, which can drastically change the way they function.\n-Surprisingly-long campaign with excellent pacing and environmental variety, considering the source material\n-Dialogue is very well-delivered and never induces cringe or slows down the pace of the game to undesireable levels\n\nCons:\n-Player and monster-created light sources don't cast shadows.  This is a pet peve of mine when it comes to games with amazing lighting systems.  I understand the implications on performance to have all those light sources casting shadows on nearby geometry, but the immersion factor gained from implimenting this type of visual effect is significant and often jaw-dropping.  It's very rare to find this in games, and Doom should absolutely not be without it\n-2 or 3 poorly optimized areas, resulting in strange framerate drops.\n-Would have liked a 4th rune slot and the ability to further level up the power of my guns through more in-game challenges.  The guns are fantastic, but at some point the earlier weapons are mostly phased out unless you run out of ammo.\n-Certain weapons have their sensitivity changed either while firing or while zooming in/charging weapon mod fire.  This can be VERY hurtful during combat.  There need to be individual sensitivity options for these weapons/mods.\n-The game ends","May 14","true","25.0"," 66 of 85 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","66","85","3","0"

My very first PC game was the shareware version of Doom, so only played the first episode. Of course, it was so brutal for its time that I became quickly obsessed with it. As soon as I heard about Doom 2 coming out, I had to have it. Played hundreds of hours of that game in both SP and MP with friends. It was a visceral experience unlike anything else of its time.\n\nPlaying this latest game is absolutely nostalgic for me, but not in just wanting it to be a fantastic game, but rather how stellar it turned out to be. The music is incredibly bass-y, shakes my entire room, and pulls me right in. The combat is very arena style: you go into a new area, there's a handful of resident enemies in there that are typically fairly simple to clear out. Then you trigger the waves upon waves of enemies and this will make you go from weapon to weapon to weapon, picking what makes sense for that second before swapping again. This is not a game to creep about like Doom 3 was, you will be punished harshly for doing so as your HP and ammo comes primarily from "glory kills" which require you to quickly get in melee range and perform a killing blow. The bigger the enemy, the less time is given making it risky sometimes.\n\nAll the classic enemies and weapons are back (including at least one classic boss), and much of the old mechanics have been brought along too (looking at you keycards... my god you hide well sometimes) and they dropped all the things from Doom 3 that people despised: no flashlight, no oxygen meter, no jump scares, no more small scale fights. I personally enjoyed Doom 3 a great deal when it first released, but it was not what I could consider to be the Doom franchise should be.\n\nThe amazing thing is how well it runs. I am able to run 80FPS at 1440p on Ultra on a single (though highly OC'd and watercooled) GTX 980 and it just begs for more.\n\n9/10","May 14","true","30.5"," 50 of 64 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","50","64","2","0"

What it does take smartly from modern shooters is offering a variety of progression, with character abilities,  weapon attachments, and weapon upgrades drip fed to you at a continuous pace.  You end up with this varied set of weapons, each with various firing modes, always accessible at any given point to use against a metric ton of different demon beasties.\n\nHell, it even has good boss fights, which is an FPS rarity.  I haven't had this much fun with a single-player shooter in literal years.

Doom hits all the right chords when it comes to the campaign. The feel of the guns, movement, monsters, environment even the kick a$$ music (suck it steam censorship) was a perfect traslation to 2016. Snapmap is simple enough to use, but while it does make a gateway for boat loads of cross clatform content, I can't help but feel we missed out on mod support because of it. My feelings remain the same it is still great fun all around. Multiplayer, while some call it generic, is great fun in my opinion with plenty of content on release and much to come, I will admit at quite a hefty price. At the end of the day though DOOM is a game is see myself playing far into the future and am glad had the revival it did.","May 16","true","31.9"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","40","51","4","0"

It wasn’t all FPS games that I was over but drab brown gritty military FPS games that have lost my interest.  Give me a twitch arena shooter like DOOM, set in a world pulled directly from my 13 year old wet dreams, and I am a kid in a candy store once again. I can't stop grinning while playing and every other second I find myself fist pumping - seriously - and saying "Holy ♥♥♥♥ that was AWESOME" as I dismember another demon or pass through a portal to what can only be described as a pitch perfect recreation of my childhood fever dreams.\n\nThe graphics in this game are top notch. I'm running it on a the following:\ni5-3570K (not currently overclocked)\nGTX 970\n16 gigs DDR3 Ram\n\nI have all of the settings at ultra level - with the adaptive AA enabled - and it's running at 9000+ FPS. I haven't come across a single framerate drop or visual glitch/tear and I've only experienced 2 game crashes in my 16 hour playthrough of the single player campaign. I know that there are people with AMD cards, at the time of this review, that are having troubles and my heart goes out to them. I hope that those issues are fixed soon because this is a game that should not be missed.\n\nGraphics are beautiful and there is so much post processing going on that I've often found myself standing in awe at some of the vistas in hell wondering how there is so much smoke and particle effects going on without dropping a single frame. The lighting is perfect for setting the mood and the enemy designs and animation are top notch. Jumping up on a platform only to find an imp scramble up right behind you is a fantastic experience because you truly feel like you're being chased and running for your life.\nThe gameplay is a breath of fresh air which is ironic since it's due to the stripped down barebones nature of the gunplay. You fun, you jump, you shoot. YOU DO NOT RELOAD. Thank god for that. This game is about speed speed speed in a way that would satisfy Sanic’s need to go fast.  If you're on the PC, you NEED to be playing it on the hardest difficulty your first playthrough because this is one of those rare games – ala dark souls – that equal parts challenges you and rewards you for skill based play. You die quickly which means you need to constantly be on the move and if I find myself standing still for more than a second or two I start to wonder "how am I not dead yet?".  More often than not, it's because you are and you are staring at the reloading screen. Deaths never feel cheap and are almost always your fault. More than once I’ve kited a ton of enemies only to find myself doubled back directly into them. Those are learning experiences that make success feel even sweeter.\n\nThe versatility in the gun upgrade mechanic is a surprising plus that I did not see coming and the game is constantly dishing out upgrades and new guns to you to keep things fresh.\n\nThe sense of pace and urgency that DOOM creates sets a new gold standard for this type of twitch based arena shooter game. I hope we see a lot of copy cat games try to recreate the style of play you see in doom. I would love to have a resurgence of titles like Painkiller et al.\n\nThe level design is great in this game too. I was afraid that we'd be running down straight corridors like every other FPS on the market going from set piece to set piece when the levels in the original DOOM game were more like puzzles intricately laid out to always give the player a sense of forward momentum with plenty of progress markers and just enough backtracking to make you feel accomplished when you get that pesky yellow key and can open up a door that was previously inaccessible.\n\nIn a way, it reminds me a bit of the levels you'll find in a Metroidvania style game with lots of areas that are inaccessible without the right item or ability (yes, you get a double jump in the game that makes platforming easier).\n\nThe game is still broken up into levels so you can never backtrack from the end of the game to the beginning but each level is a multilayered labyrinth and they did a really good job of making it feel like a proper DOOM game in terms of level design.\n\nThe sound design in DOOM expertly sets the tone for the game and evokes the same fast past mayhem of the originals soundtrack while creating a fresh contrast to the frantic guitar with quieter serene moments in between fights. I really do enjoy the voices of all of the characters since they all have a decent amount of post processing to make them seem sufficiently robotic or demonoid. When it comes to SOME of the guns, the sound design is a bit of a mess. There is a missing low end that is really needed - for people like me who game with surround sound speakers with a sub-woofer - that really adds a satisfying punch when shooting. It's not terrible, but it's heavily biased to the mid and high range and lacks a lot of the impact I was hoping for. There is one cool sound effect that I love, though: The muffled sound of the bullets coming out of the machine gun when you aim down the sights (with one of the mods) sounds like someone shredding on a guitar. It's really quite cool.\n\nSpeaking of guitar, the soundtrack to this game is epic and they do a really good job with the modular industrial-electonic-metal-choir style that perfectly ramps up from serene moments when you're exploring to head banging metal when you're knee-deep in the dead. The soundtrack perfectly accompanies the violence and mayhem on screen while setting the mood, which is almost always one of the following: “Who did I kill next?!” or “my god…I can’t believe I survived that”. It's not often that I notice the soundtrack to a game and DOOM is a game where I'm constantly grinning because the music is perfectly setting the mood and I couldn't imagine playing my own music - which I what I often do - over this game because I LOVE the dynamic shifts between quiet serene choir chants to industrial metal when you round a corner into a horde of demons. They absolutely nailed it... and it didn't even require Nine Inch Nails this time....\n\nBad pun..........\n\n\nIf you miss the days of old school twitch based shooters and you lament the current trend of boring brown drab military shooters or cover based mechanics that force you to stand still and play what amounts to a carnival shooting gallery then DOOM is right up your alley.\n\n*Multiplayer component of the review coming soon*\n\nGraphics: 9.5\nSound: 9\nSingle Player: 8.7\nMultiplayer: 7.7\nValue: 9\nSJW (game supports toxic masculinity and lacks strong black trans female presence): 3\n\n\nFinal Score: 8.8\nSJW Score: 7.8","May 14","true","23.8"," 68 of 98 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","68","98","5","3"

A soundtrack that booms during the high moments of combat, and one that fills the atmosphere with tension during it's slower moments. The pacing of the game is exellent, you slowly earn new weapons and meet new enemies nearly the entire game, peaking around three-quarters of the way into the experience where the final chapter lets loose everything at once. The multiplayer component is fun and fresh while still familiar, although it is currently lacking a FFA mode. The creative aspects of snapmap seem plentiful, but the mapper has its own sets of limitations that prevent it from reaching the sky high hopes we had for it in order to compensate for lack of modding tools.\n\nOverall the game has such a well designed Campaign that it stands strong with that aspect alone.

I liked the monsters, but everything else looked slow and modern and basically nothing like DooM. And then the game got released and whole bunch of people (and their opinions) I care about actually said this was legit and worth trying out. Lo and behold: they were right!\n\nLets get one thing out of the way right away, this ain't DooM as you and I remember it. While in it's best and purest moments it evokes that circle-strafing, shotgun-blasting magic-feeling of the 1993 original - these are just a few moments every now and then. The majority of the time you are playing something that feels like an amalgamation of aforementioned original DooM, Quake (3) and all the run of the mill shooters of today. There is a bit in here for everyone - I love the basic ♥♥♥♥: super shotgun in hand and circle-strafing for days around beasties, but you got your powerups (quad damage!) and jumppads and teleporters and everything else that made the Quake Arenas fun, just to top it all off with double jumps, climbing and "Press RT to AWESEOME!"-glory kills that seem rather modern / new school to me. Also, uprgrades upon upgrades, modifications and ♥♥♥♥ - the bane of modern gaming.\n\nIt is kinda impressive how it all blends together quite seamlessly though, once I got a couple of upgrades I didn't really think about olden DooM too much anymore, and enjoyed DooM 2016 for what it is: fast(er than expected), ultra-violent, almost arcade-ish shooting action.\n\nA perfect "after work"-game too, had a couple of rough days and was always looking forward to playing one or two levels once I got home. New DooM is less about survival and more about kicking serious ♥♥♥. I haven't had such a good power trip in a while and it just arrived at the right time.\n\nIf you are a die-hard fan of the original, there is a lot to dislike about this new DooM, of that I am pretty sure. I am personally somewhat disappointed in the levels, while I wasn't expecting John Romero-mazes and all out Adrian Carmack graphic-goodness, the new DooM levels lack… personality? Sure, they remade a bunch of the old texture and turned them into cool 3D assets (like the gutted Barons of Hell hanging from the ceiling) - but with the insane technology of today you could have done a lot more ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥, right? Something memorable in it's own right and no rehashes of stuff done before. There are a few pretty sweet vistas every now and then - but the real hell of DooM 2016 is that the future looks like rooms are designed by Apple, with plastic everywhere and cheap-o LED ambient-lighting.\n\nI imagined DooM always in a much more retro-scifi look, quite like Alien: Isolation did it and always admired the way technology, gore and satanic imagery got twisted around in the original DooM in textures as well as actual level design. ID turned the original three episodes into a true descent to hell. New DooM  tackles all of this in a different way, and while I kinda enjoy them trying to bring in a new angle with the whole "energy crisis"-thing, it feels much more corny than the original game. The lore in this game makes the demons seem more like vermin, while the DooM-guy is doing clean up-work rather than the epic crusade that the original game was (until DooM II: Hell on Earth introduced all that pet-bunny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) and the whole DooM slayer stuff felt like they were trying too hard to build a world and bring reason and context to all of this. DooM doesn't need no explanations - the language of kicking ♥♥♥ is universal, no context needed.\n\nApart from that I felt like the sound design was kinda weak, I missed the distinct screams and howls from the original DooM (which was also integral in understanding what you are up against without necessarily seeing it), DooM 2016 drops the ball in this regard. Creature design is otherwise amazing, really like how they re-imagined all those funky original designs and even acknowledged some of the DooM³ stuff (Hellknights!).\n\nBut these are ramblings of an old man, DooM 2016 was great while it lasted - got 25 hours of good, demon-blasting fun out of it and spend some quality time curb stomping everything in my way (wouldn't recommend getting it for the full price though).\n\nAbout multiplayer: definitely not my cup of tea. Everything feels so… light? Like everyone is made out of cardboard. Fights feel like people are throwing colorful confetti around until somebody drops dead all the while moon-gravity is turned on. Imagine a really borked Unreal Tournament or something. Ranked to Level 5, grabbed the achievement and never looked back.","May 21","true","25.4"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","28","33","4","7"

You basically get locked inside of rooms filled with ammo, health, and usually a powerup or two. Demons spawn in order of ascending difficulty as grungy metal music kicks in, and you have to kill them to unlock the doors so you can walk down some corridors and head to the next arena. The game consists of doing this about 40 times. You very rarely get to navigate hostile terrain and pick off enemies from a distance like in retro Doom, and when you do, it's mostly just zombies.\n\nBut hell, this game is fun. It takes what worked from Doom 3, and replaces everything else with solid homages to the original Doom. The crazy colorful environments with cliffs and steep drops are back. The frantic fights with a dozen enemies at once are back.\n\nInterestingly, for the first time in Doom history, none of the enemies are given weapons with bullets (the chaingunners even fire energy spheres), meaning that you never have to hide behind cover and you can stay alive just by your dodging skills alone.\n\nAlso, there is no reload button. All your weapons automatically reload themselves and most don’t even have a cooldown, meaning you can just keep firing until you’re out of ammo. That’s about as awesome as it sounds.\n\nAmazingly, someone must have realized that Hell was the best part of Doom 3, and this game sends you there not once, but three times. I especially loved the ""Necropolis" level which was almost pure fanserivce to classic Doom in ways I don't dare spoil.\n\nBut probably best of all, this game has some serious attitude and a sense of humor. Doomguy is a destroyer of worlds, and you can feel his aggression in all of his actions even though you only see him through his own eyes, thanks in no small part to glory kills.\n\nI found that the notorious “glory kills” while odd at first, worked to the game’s advantage. For those who don’t know, when an enemy is almost dead, they can be finished off with a single flamboyant melee attack which will also spew a fountain of health pickups into the air.  Not only do they humorously show off Doomguy’s rage, but they aren’t really all that new since they were ripped straight from Brutal Doom. In retro Doom, you’d have to run over dead bodies to collect the ammo drops, and it wasn’t unusual to give the enemies a punch or a grind with the chainsaw to conserve a little ammo. Glory kills are basically that, but just happen to make it look a bit cooler. They become a bit less important in the second half of the game, as the game starts throwing you into some ridiculous situations and you’ll probably just want to blast enemies to smithereens without worrying about carefully whittling down their health.\n\nI give Doom 4 an 8 / 10. If you were hoping for the true return of classic Doom, I’ve got news for you: nothing is going to be like classic Doom. If you want classic Doom, go play that. ZDoom.org is on your right, Doomworld.com is on your left. Truth is that classic Doom never left; source ports exist which can add dynamic lighting and make the game look ridiculously modern, and the community is still alive and pumping out dozens of new maps and mods every week. But after the strange horror/corridor shooter that was Doom 3, Doom 4 returns the series to its roots in the best way possible: it will transport you to a colorful world of sprawling martian compounds and hellscapes, a place where you never need to stop running at full speed, a place where it just feels good to pull the trigger and watch hundreds of imps and mancubi crumble before you.","June 3","true","14.6"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","38","51","5","2"

It wasn't a very memorable experience for me.\n\nI think the biggest kicker for me, was how it lacked atmosphere compared to say Doom 3 (which I actually kinda liked despite its issues). Everything is so well lit and clean, Hell looks more like the Desert of Knareen from Rayman 3 than HELL, and that kinda did bother me a bit.\n\nBut I dunno yo, get the game and see for yourself.\nMaybe you'll like it, or maybe you'll feel kinda like some of us do, there is really only one way to find out.\n\nWhen you do get it also (or rather, if), you might be able to finish the game in one sitting or two.\nTook me about 10 hours to finish it on Normal start to finish, and I tried to explore every nook and cranny for about 2/3's of the game, so it could be 5-15 hours give or take depending on how much you care about collectibles and upgrades.\nEnding was a cliffhanger too, so probably expect a sequel within the next 3 years also.\n\nCheers\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nUnfortunately, because a lot of people seem to be illiterate or just overly aggressive in general I have to add a couple of points to this.\n\n1) I have in fact played the original Doom games, and I liked those too.\n\nI stated that I felt that Doom 3 had an overall better atmosphere compared to this new Doom game, because it did in my honest opinion.\nI never said "Doom 3 was better", "Get Doom 3 instead", "I've only played Doom 3" or whatever it is you are trying to imply.\n\nWhat I liked about Doom 3 was the design of the weapons, monsters and enviroments, and had a lot of interesting world building stuff to it, like putting you in the game before the hell invasion happened, gave a bit of insight on the UAC facility, the people who worked there, etc\nI always thought the game LOOKED pretty cool, even if the game had a bunch of flaws (like clunky combat, the annoying constant flinching when hit, basically total lack of a soundtrack, the annoying inconsistent shotgun performance, slower combat and fewer enemies, and so on).\n\nWHY is it being noted?\nBecause this game has ALSO tried to do that, with the collectibles, etc\nYou can argue that "Doom isnt about the story, lore or whatever", because it isn't, and never was, not even in Doom 3 (the objective there was also always just "you are faceless marine guy, go kill demons and stop hell").\nBut you can't argue that they didn't try to add it to this, or get upset because I brought a feature, that is in this game, up, as being sorta generic.\n\nIt was not cited as "not feeling like doom", but I also never said that it felt like it either.\nThat part is up to you to figure out, because obviously we all seem to have different views on what "doom" is judging by the many comments and reviews.\nIf you feel (after playing it of course) that it is a true successor to the original Doom, then good for you, I'm glad. And if you don't, that's too bad.\nBut it's still ultimately up to you to decide, not me.\n\nI should also note that I have also played a bunch of Quake (I also liked Quake 4, fight me irl fam), and the Unreal Tournament series aside from Doom, for what it's worth, in case you are seriously gonna sit and judge and throw ♥♥♥♥ about my taste in past and similar games.\n\n2) I never said "don't get the game".\n\nI said that I thought the game felt incredibly average and that nothing in particular stood out, and that you should get the game yourself to make your own opinion.\n\nIt is marked as a negative review because Steam doesn't offer an in between, and I cannot honestly with a clear conscience say that this is "the greatest game ever" or whatever it is people want.\n\nBut despite it being an absolutely neutral review, and you being suggested to try the game for yourself, you somehow still find the time to abuse and hassle me over it.\nLike I just can't understand what part of "it's not bad, but it's not good either, try for yourself though" is hard to understand here.\n\nI don't know whether to chalk this up to you not reading the review and instantly downvoting/call me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for it, or you being salty as hell that I'm not giving this a +1.\nBut at least consider that it IS a review, and that you clicked it knowing this, so you kinda oughta at least read it first before going absolutely rabid in the comments.\n\nThis is all I have to say now, I legitimately have better things to do than sit and reply to a bunch of angry teenagers telling me to kill myself for disagreeing.\n\nGood luck.","May 13","false","10.6"," 1,735 of 3,012 people (58%) found this review helpful 170 people found this review funny","58","735","3","170","243"

The campaign is an enjoyable trip down memory lane as it replicates the basic formula that was prevalent two decades ago. With good level design, potent weaponry and smoothly-animated demons, its individual action pieces are stellar. Unfortunately the arena encounter formula persists right until the end, becoming too repetitive. Multiplayer is a competent mix of old and new that brings the hell-themed action close to that of other modern shooters. Finally, SnapMap gives players a fairly powerful set of tools to make simple creations in minutes.

Doom 4 or Doom 2016; very much like the original Doom that gave birth to the firer-person shooter genre back in 1993 - once again taking old players back to face their nemesis, dragging them into the demonic abyss where not much is spoken as no words would suffice; rather, you're slipped into a whole body armor and grabbed yourself a shotgun. *Rack it* One in the chamber - or was it two? And off your way to prove actions are louder than words.\n\n\nFor relatively new players who're now used to softcore shooter games that allow harms to be avoid entirely courtesy of cover-based mechanic, easy target acquisition courtesy of aiming simulation and helath lost resulted from mistake can be forgiven with overtime health regeneration - DOOM may be the very title to grant you the long awaited refreshing experience by throwing you back to the purest, simplest root of FPS: Shooting & Moving - with some welcomed additions such as collectibles to find, secrets to discover, challenges to complete, progress bars to fill and a whole arsenal to upgrade to add extra layers of depths as well as replayability.\n\n\nFor veteran players out there... there really isn't much to say about this game. I mean, what could I say more? DOOM simply puts you back to the mix where you-know-for-god-damn-sure carnage, demon, gore, fast-paced combat, reloadless firing and powerful metal music are the least expected things to find. The normal difficulty level named 'HURT ME PLENTY' gives you a gentle yet fair taste of these elements whereas the higher difficulties 'ULTRA-VIOLENCE' and 'NIGHTMARE' will force you to flow through the oppressing offensives - or die trying to move your feet, take your aim and utilize up to 20 different means all seamlessly and constantly in order to beat the hostile confrontation.\n\n\nVerdict: I'd say not only does DOOM fulfils longtime fans' nostalgic desire to feel the classic formula in today's shooter game market that's been decorated miscellaneously with all sorts of gimmicks for the past several years, its latest iteration brought itself to the next level with two decades gap as the industry develops and the technology that powers it advances - to the point where we could never imagine or experience back in the 90s. Just like the first game back then, the gameplay of DOOM is smooth and fast, straightforward and intuitive, and above all an awful lot of fun and engaging as each arena gets increasingly more intense than the last -- yet it may has become even more enjoyable and polished with two decades of advancement in the videogame industry in general.\n\n\n\nFootnote: I believe you've watched the E3 reveal gameplay trailer before you're off your way to probing with a review like this. I'm telling you right now - the actual gameplay is faster and more intense by two folds to say the least, given you don't pick the difficutly level named 'I’M TOO YOUNG TO DIE'.","May 16","true","38.8"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","28","37","4","0"

Lately I've avoided FPS games because of what I've been calling 'lack of innovation in the genre'.  It took playing this game for me to realize what I've been missing from modern shooters.  Chaos.  It's been missing the chaos.   The single player is the best single player experience I've had in an FPS since probably the original Doom.  The story is not a super duper unique one but it is not a hindrance to the gameplay and it is pretty cool.\n\nMy biggest complaints are the fact that there is no out of the box: Free for all deathmatch mode in the multiplayer, this has been partially addressed with SnapMap as there are several enjoyable FFA maps people have already created, however SnapMap has it's own limitations.\n\nIn all honestly, my #1 complaint about this game is that it ended.  The campaign is by no means short, it's actually quite long for a modern FPS (probably around the same time to complete as the original half life), but I wasn't ready for it to be over. I just want more because of how fun it was. I hate the general concept of DLC but if id releases any SP content via expansions or DLC I will buy it immediately.\n\nDefinitely pick this game up, the SP is refreshing and the MP is also very enjoyable and is somewhere between Arena Shooter and Modern Shooter.","May 18","true","87.1"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","26","35","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/379720/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","Id Software have been in a slump, with every game taking years and years to come out, without the same spark they were known for in the 90s. But this Doom gives me hope. They’re on the right track, as this is different from any other action game out there. They’re finally back trying to carve their own path in the FPS space, borrowing elements from every id game that has come before it.\n\nThis Doom isn’t just looking back at what made the old Doom games good. It’s borrowing bits and pieces from all the Quake games, and adding the obligatory RPG mechanics present in all shooters today. At a glance the game doesn’t look very exciting, as it looks very similar to Doom 3 and Dead Space. It’s a brand of sci-fi aesthetic that’s way too familiar at this point. But when you get a couple levels into the campaign you start coming across vertical arenas, where combat takes place on multiple levels, with enemies following you everywhere. This is where Doom starts to make sense. And once you get to the good bits, it just keeps getting better. This isn't simply an “old school” game that does the same things as the classics of the genre. It's taking their elements and moving forwards. Calling it old school almost does a disservice for what they've managed to do here.\n\nThe level design of Doom displays good variety, with some levels having multi-level vertical arenas that feel like they belong in a multiplayer game, while other levels have simple tight corridors. Not all the levels are great, but they have a high average level of quality, and the truly great levels more than make up for the ones that are just okay. Most importantly, it didn't feel repetitive. Anything good can outstay its welcome, and this game mixes things up enough over the course of the campaign to justify its length.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the game is the audio. It’s primitive and simplistic in a way that isn’t worthy of the quality of game design and animation. In first person shooters, the audio is critical in communicating where enemies are, what weapons they’re using, and how they’re moving. In all games, audio expands your field of view beyond the borders of the screen. In Doom, enemies are too silent, and don’t have enough character. By listening, it’s hard to tell which enemies are in the arena with you, or where they are. This led to me being blindsided by enemies hitting me from behind. It added an unpleasant element of random chance. If you can’t use the sound as a weapon against the enemy, there’s a limit to how good you can get at the game. It creates a skill ceiling that you can never breach. It’s unfortunate, because in so many ways Doom is state of the art, or breaks new ground. It isn’t all bad, as the music is very fitting, with neat touches like guitar riffs that match the pace of your weapon as its firing. But I still found the audio to be a letdown.\n\nOverall, my impression of Doom is overwhelmingly positive. The first two levels were mediocre, and the audio disappointed me. But once the game got going, it won me over. It’s more than good enough to conquer its deficiencies and convince me that it’s a game I should be recommending to people. It proves that id Software know what they’re doing, and makes me excited to see what they do next. It’s easily my favorite FPS released in ages. It reminded me why I like the genre in the first place. It’s easy to forget when all you get every year is co-op RPG hybrids or military shooters. This is the kind of shooter very few people bother to make anymore, and I want to celebrate how well they managed to pull it off. The multiplayer is terrible though, so don’t get the game for that. The developer’s focus was clearly on the singleplayer, and it’s for that the game will be remembered.","May 22","true","15.2"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","22","28","2","0"

Reading reviews and comments of people that says this isn't like the original, that is repetitive, and not that good of a game. Because everything they say is total BS, this is as loyal to the original games as a 2016 title can get. And this is not that easy of task as you might think.\n\nThe pace, the atmosphere, the music, the weapons, the enemy variation, the big levels filled with secrets, almost every aspect of the game just screams Doom. Except maybe from the generous checkpoint system the game is old school in every other way, with no regenerating health, no cover system, no limit in the amount of weapons you can carry.\n\nEven in the lower difficulties (I recommend picking at least the highest available at the beginning) the game never lets you rest during battles, not only you can't take cover, Doom punishes you if you even think about it. Sniping enemies from afar is also a temporary solution since you run out of ammo really fast, especially in the early stages. The game almost forces you to get up and personal with you enemies since the only way to get health and ammo (besides the items scattered around each area) is to either kill them with your bare hands or with your trusty chainsaw. It's a clever mechanism that keeps the action furious and frantic even on the first couple of stages.\n\nThe guns in Doom are as fun to use as they were in the first two titles (no more crappy shotty or machine gun as in Doom 3). Most of them really pack a punch and are extremely fun to use (except maybe the pistol, but you only have to rely on it for a couple of minutes before picking a shotgun). Not only that but you can upgrade all of them giving them even more destructive power. But wait... there's more! Not only you can add great secondary attacks on your weapons, you can upgrade them even more, with skill points you gather during each stage either by completing challenges, finding secrets or simply by being awesome at disposing your enemies.\n\nI can keep writing positive things about the game for hours but it's time to talk about the negative stuff as well. Well, mediocre multiplayer aside, the visuals can be a little bland at times (the new engine seems capable of far more eye candy) and... well that's about it. People claiming the game get's repetitive towards the end, probably never played this type of a game before where the meat of the game is the combat and don't rely on cut scenes and set pieces to keep your attention. If you get tired from running and gunning everything in sight while searching for collectibles and secrets, then why on earth did you even bother buying Doom?\n\nI can't recommend the new Doom enough. It shows that an old school title not only can be made without any issues in 2016 but also there is a crowd that really craves for one. Maybe the new Rise of Triad was too old school  and Shadow Warrior not that known to jump start the old school shooter revival, but finally after countless gray, corridor, "hold you by your hand", generic military shooters, we have a game that not only gets what made the old titles great but also adds enough modern touches to make it appealing to people who only knew Doom from the crappy Dwayne Johnson movie.","May 16","true","22.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","1"

I haven't enjoyed a Singleplayer experience this much in a long time.\n\nThe multiplayer however, falls flat. And in many ways.\nLoadouts. Not a fan, especally for arena shooters. They said they'd add in classic gamemodes that remove loadouts. Time will tell.\nThe servers. You can tell they were designed with consoles in mind. You can't create one. You can't choose a map. You can't toggle any options. You can't even choose any SnapMaps. Apparently these were all things the Alpha had. Why remove them?\nThe fact that Snapmap and Multiplayer is split, and not just under "Multiplayer". All the split is going to do is kill Snapmap or Multiplayer. Maybe even both.\nThis is more of a personal opinion, but I'd prefer an option to disable teamcolor. The HUDs themself give enough information to tell who's friendly and who's not. FoC and WfC did it just fine.\nSnapMap needs more expansion. It's great, but it could be so much better. It's also very restrictive meaning you either get small levels that are jam packed, or huge ones with barely anything inbetween. There's also no way to bookmark/favorite a level to come back to it. There is "Download" but for beyond reason, it makes you the owner of the map. And, there's no way to even link levels for a custom campaign.\n\nThere are however a few things I like\nBig fan of the gamemode Freeze Tag. Ever since I played it in UT2k4 as a mod.\nGlad that levels are more or less cosmetic, and for unlocking mostly only cosmetics.\nSnapMap has huge unrealized potential.\n\nSingleplayer: 10/10 - Some of the best ♥♥♥♥ I ever played\nMultiplayer 5/10 - Tries to be everything and fails. Side effects of being for consoles glaringly obvious\nSnapMap 8/10 - Needs more TLC and it'd be perfect\n\nI'd go more indepth like with the lack of a weaponwheel for Snapmap, ect, but I'd just be repeating what everyone else says, so why bother.","May 17","true","32.2"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","27","38","2","0"

Unfortunately, this superb establishment has been overrun by an army of ferocious demons! You are the only marine left on the red planet and the UAC has no other option but to activate you with the sole mission to eradicate all demons from the site. Let’s face it, this mission is suicidal . . . it is DOOM!\n\nDoom is an action/first person shooter game where you take control of the last marine on the UAC research centre on Mars. You will wake up chained to what looks like an operating table, and within a few seconds you will realise that you are not the only one in the room. Menacing sounds are coming from your left, your right - actually from all around you! You free yourself, grab a gun on the floor and eliminate all enemies with sheer ferocity. Your next step is to find and equip yourself with a Preator suit - you will need it - it is going to be a brutal ride!\n\nIn the campaign mode, you will go through stunning and well-designed levels with plenty of demons to kill. I personally enjoy killing them when they are in the stunned state (glowing orange) with your bare hands - absolutely marvellous!  Each level has secret areas, items to find (check your map for hints) and challenges to meet. If you manage to locate a ruin, you will be able to activate a new challenge to succeed and keep a piece of the ruin.  Make sure to look everywhere, as there are a number of objects to collect:  Preator tokens (which can be found on fallen marines) so you can upgrade your suit, ammunition crates, shield plates (well, that’s what I call them), health icons and, of course, weapons. A little harder to find are the agent cells which can upgrade your character’s following skills – health, armour or ammunition.  The fun really starts when you find a “Gore Nest”- rip its heart out and a wave of demons will appear in the area. Sometimes you might notice an orb - pick it up and you will receive an extra boost in battle. I really like the Berserk Orb - just great to clear the area! If you succeed in eliminating all these nasty creatures you will receive an upgrade point; accumulate enough of these points and you can upgrade your weapons.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is also available in DOOM, but I find it really hard to get into a match, which is a bit disappointing. There is good character customization, however.\n\nGraphically the game is superb, with a great voice over as well as a great soundtrack and sound effects. In regards to the controls, I strongly recommend the mouse and keyboard - I find it easier, but it’s always a personal choice.\n\nThere are a couple of issues that you might encounter while playing DOOM. The first one is setting your video resolution (bear in mind, I have the latest Nvidia driver installed). The game keeps launching in a window mode for some reason, even after applying full screen on the setting. Then I have to lower the resolution to get back to my full screen and re-apply to a higher resolution. The second issue is the crashes to desktop. You might be able to play for 3 hours without an issue but then the game will crash for no apparent reason. It seems that people have been experiencing the same issue with a wide range of PC setups (crashes).\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Stunning graphics\n-	Gore violence (it is DOOM, after all)\n-	Well-designed levels with plenty of hidden objects and secret areas\n-	Great range of demons and arsenal\n-	Fun and fast gameplay\n-	Good soundtrack and voice over\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Hard to get into a multiplayer game\n-	Frequent crashes to desktop\n-	Resolution bug is a pain in the D…\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game and all fans of DOOM and FPS should have this game in their library.\n\n8/10\n\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE","May 17","true","9.1"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","32","47","6","4"

Many including myself had doubts they could capture or compare to the original or quake. The multiplayer beta even hurt everyones expectations further. But as it turns out multiplayer is quite fun actually and single player is absolutely one of the best Doom experiences since the original doom. I remember when Doom 1 and 2 came out. The feeling of amazement and thinking "This has never been done"... that feeling of awe. This Doom not only lives up to the expectation but it recaptured the essence of Doom and gave it new life. That feeling of awe is back. Doom (2016) is a great game and there isnt anything like it out there.

While it isn't 100% true to the originals it still manages to remain Doom-esque in level design and enemy/weapon interactions (Preferring to use some weapons against certain enemies but not others, etc). The melee kill animations can fairly safely be ignored (Enemies drop health, but on nightmare the guaranteed health from a melee kill is negligible at 5 points, and the large health drops from kills happen if you're low on health and still happen from ranged kills too) or even smoothed into the gameplay with the rune system, which lets you speed the animations up to practically the point of the Doom 1 and 2 punch animation.\n\nThe multiplayer isn't the worst thing ever made but it isn't particularly good or noteworthy. Since you pick which weapons you start with all the weapons have been equalized for balance, there's no frantically running around the map to grab the rocket launcher when everyone can spawn with one and it does piddly damage since it has to be equivalent to everything else.\n\nSnapmap has some cool potential, but since it's based around the MP rather than the SP there's a 2 weapon limit and the players can't pick a difficulty level, the map designer has to specifically set enemy HP, damage, etc. It also has a god-awful search system to try to find maps, so you'll have a hell of a time finding ones that look interesting. Not nearly as powerful as a full editor but some good may come of it at some point.\n\nOverall really damn good. I still enjoyed Doom 3, but this is far closer to Doom 1 and 2 than 3 was. Not really going to be a landmark shooter still regularly played and modded 20+ years later, but what is?","May 18","true","29.8"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","19","24","3","0"

It won many awards and critical acclaims from magazines such as "Computers And Stuff That Has Wires Attached to them Monthly." which described it as "amazing... I never imagined I would some day be able to mow my lawn in space, all from the convenience of my home computer machine!"  Copies were sold at Babbages for $1.99, and if you purchased two of them, you would receive a cloth map showing Richard Garriott's face.\n\nWhile this new "Doom" is quite different from its precessor, it does share many similiar features.  For example, your character can move (I believe they call it "running" or "walking").  There are guns in this game, but I don't know what you're supposed to do with them or why you need them because I was homeschooled and live in a series of closets connected by a central hallway.  I asked my friend Jeff K. what the plot of the game was, and although I coun't exactly understand him (I was blowdrying my hair), it sounded something like this:\n\n"You... guy.  Space guy. Make good (cramwitch) from a (fist slug forgery?). So NO NO NO don't do that, you need the Buttersworth! Yes. Parp. It's grunty (Fat Louie?)"\n\nSorry I couldn't be of more help, but it was late at night and I did not want to wake up mother because she might lock me in the training box if she heard me.  Overall, I would recommend this game 9/10, but please make sure you have a PC or something that can play it before you buy it (this has happened to me so many times I stopped counting).\n\nPeace out","May 14","true","14.0"," 34 of 52 people (65%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","65","34","52","38","2"

Been a DOOM fan since 1994, played the exhaustive releases and rereleases, and was very excited for this.  Wolfenstein: The New Order was my favorite game of 2014, and I hoped DOOM would get a similar treatment.\n\nI play this with an i5 3570k, 8GB of RAM, and a 970 G1.  With Ultra settings, I'm getting 80-100FPS, not a constant framerate, but no noticeable drops either.  The campaign feels like a DOOM game, don't even know how to say it better.  The movement is fast, enemies are plentiful, and the graphics and music are exactly what I feel should be in this game.  The glory kills were something I was afraid would kill the fast pace, but they don't.  If the flashing of an enemy takes you out of the game, remove the highlighting and just shoot them.\n\nNow, multiplayer.  I hated the beta.  Thought it looked and played poorly.  I'm not sure if things changed, but I'm loving it now.  Maybe it's because I'm good at it.  Has an Unreal/Quakeish feel, while not being as good as those.  The game modes for the most part are fun, and while most people tend to use the chaingun or super shotgun, I can still get plenty of kills and doesn't feel unbalanced.  All of the hate I see towards this game is based on multi, give it a shot.  It can really be fun.

They have managed to capture the essence of what made Doom great all those years ago, but now with incredible visuals, an amazing soundtrack that fits so well, gameplay upgrades that allow you to customise your character, suit and weapons, and new mechanics that force you to get in close to your enemies to give you back health or ammo.  On top of that there are plenty of heart-racing, frantic, gore-filled sections with tougher enemies progressively getting introduced, many of which are familiar from Doom 1 & 2.\n\nI took about 20 hours to complete the campaign, but that included spending a fair amount of time trying to find all the secrets and additional challenges.  I still have a couple of secrets to find, plus weapon challenges to complete and will definitely be going back in to complete those.\n\nI have only tried the multiplayer deathmatch experience in beta so far, I wasn't that impressed by it and isn't something that I will be spending much time in, as I prefer a more tactical team-based fps such as Counter-Strike or Battlefield.  I will give it another go and try out the new modes and maps however.\n\nI had a quick look at SnapMap which allows you to create your own content for the game, and will be interested to see what the community comes up with which may give extra replayability to come.\n\nTo summarise, if you are interested in a heart-pounding, fast-paced single player experience without too much in the way of a storyline, then I would definitely recommend getting this.","May 18","true","31.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","0"

The game that made me a PC Gamer for life. There is NOTHING i can say about this game that has not already been said. The single player campaign is for sure the best game that has come out this year, and to be honest its probably the best FPS in recent years hands down. The pace is breakneck, the graphics are astounding, the soundtrack is phenomonal. Nearly everything you remember about Doom is here.\n\nI want to say this now. This review does not reflect my feelings of the multiplayer portion of the game. It feels tacked on, it feels like its a seperate game and to me it doesnt feel like Doom. Two staples of Doom are completely missing from the multiplayer portion of Doom, and if it were a seperate game it is bad enough that i would not buy it. Co-op and free for all deathmatch are completely missing from this game. Doom multiplayer was built on these two modes and them both being missing is a travesty.\n\nThat being said, the SP mode is where this game shines, and oh boy does it shine! The story is a bit lacking for sure, but Doom never really had a whole lot of story anyways, so nothing really missing in this catagory. The gameplay is fast and frantic. On harder difficulties if you stop moving you are DEAD. There is a great variety of demons, both old and new, and the models for them all are spectacular. All your favorite Doom weapons have returned, and most of them are upgradeable. The weapon models themselves (like all other models in the game) are fantastic. Though i have not played through the entire game, what i have seen so far of the backgrounds are beautiful, and the textures have alot of variety.\n\nAll in all this game is a must purchase for any fan of Doom, any fan of arena shooters or honestly any fan of FPS games in general. There is nothing on the market that compares, and i feel it will be quite awhile before something does compare.\n","May 17","true","10.9"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","30","47","5","0"

Ifound single player repetitive and was never good enough to compete.\n\nSo I purchased this game after reading through various reviews. I have now finished the single player camapign on the easiest mode, attempted to make a snap map but failed, and also been pwned on multiplayer.\n\nI actually think this is the first DOOM game I can say I enjoyed for any length of time. The campaign is simplistic in style. You fight waves of enemies with the resources available and a few puzzles are thrown in along the way (only a few are irritating as I am not a fan of timed jumping). The story is as good as the source material allows and actually had me thinking back to Dead Space, which was a great game.\n\nIt looks great and the combat is fluid with finishing moves added for extra coolness. The weapons are what you would expect, but this time around you can upgrade your alternate fire and also pick up a few perks and armour upgrades. I think this sort of stuff is required to add re-playability, and also to allow some degree of customisation depending on your play style. This reminded me of Shadow Warrior, which was another re-boot that was also done very well.\n\nPeople have complained about the length of the campaign. It took me about 12 hours on the easiest mode and I have been back a bit to look for secrets and missed upgrades.\n\nHowever, this is only one part of the game. The snap maps have been criticised for being too simplistic. However, I think this is good as levels will be designed within a specific framework. They could maybe add more features if there is high demand though. I did attempt it but realised that I need to read up or watch some videos before doing this properly.\n\nThe multiplayer deathmatch seemed fun although I was clearly awful at it. You can choose weapons at the strat and customise your look. You unlock things as you play more. Again this is needed to bring players back for more, even though some purists like a good whinge.\n\nI think the game is another great example like Shadow Warrior before it of how to re-boot early FPS games for the current generation, and those of us from the previous generation who found them a bit dull after a while.","June 5","true","15.6"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

They did it. They actually pulled it off - the Doom is mostly black with even more gore and speed! Single player content is intense, and its really close to what you would expect from DooM title. Forget story, who needs a story - its about you killing tons of demons and shooting cool looking guns! The new doom guy even acts like he is angry that there is some story in his way!\nBut lets start from the beginning - game looks really great (no washed out, bright graphics that we gets these days with AAA games) - looks sharp, colourful and sometimes even dark with high contrast. And you can alter your FoV beyond 100 - big plus!\nFor me performance is fantastic, game runs smoother than anything that recently came out and I had zero bugs or glitches so far.\nGameplay - its fast, really fast. M+K controls are tight and responsive - aiming and shooting feels awesome. One thing that I dont like its the verticality - way way too many platforming/jumping parts - I died to those way more than from npc`s.\nGreat bosses, they will have some surprises for you once you think you figured them out - very good fights.\nYes the game can feel easy - mobs will drop health at your convince (glory kills) and if you short on ammo - just use chainsaw - ammo drop rain incoming. (did not tried highest difficulty yet).\nStill you can just ignore those mechanics and make game more challenging for yourself.\nDespite that it really feels different from today's shooters - in a good way. It has this old vibe that you get when playing original DooM.\nShame is - there is no coop for main campaign - I think it would work just fine and would be great fun.\nSnap map editor - yes it is there and you can create something cool form the blocks that ID gave us. Still its very limited and we have just few basic interiors and props to choose from - I hope it will improve because this is what will keep new DooM alive for many years - player created levels - and people are already showing great creativity with the maps.\nI wont comment on MP because I have zero interest in it.\nIts absolute worth getting even with the asking price.

Obviously it’s not going to be exactly the same, as the original game is far from perfect. With a lot of reboot franchises, the core of the game is usually lost, but this isn’t the case with DOOM.\n\nId Software have really poured their heart and soul into making this reboot as amazing as it could be, and then some. It reminds me of the original games, yet introduces new and interesting gameplay features that keep it up to date with modern games. It’s a perfect blend of old school meets new school. The new Id Tech 6 engine is one of the most impressive engines I’ve seen. Both in terms of graphics and performance. Granted my PC is above the recommended specs, but I’ve heard it performs well on a variety of systems. The performance was “unchained” essentially, and my computer could be fully utilized to give the best experience possible. Id clearly haven’t forgotten their roots.\n\nThe shooting is enjoyable and punchy. Each gun has 2 distinctly different weapon mods to unlock, which add a decent amount of variety to the combat. 2 weapon mods per gun doesn’t seem like much, but they change the way a weapon behaves in such drastic ways. Each stand out on their own, and by the end of the game I had unlocked all of them, and felt comfortable no matter which I was using.\n\nGlory kills are another new gameplay feature. Fast and fluid melee executions that add serious variety to traditional fps gameplay. Originally I thought these would slow down the pace of the combat, but I can safely say I was wrong. They add brutality and enjoyment to an already brutal and enjoyable game :P\n\nThe multiplayer is satisfying to an extent. At first glance people assume it was a tack on, but looking into it further you can tell Id have really put some effort into this area. The amount of customization is insane. From acquiring different armour types, to changing the material and colours of your weapons. The gameplay is pure old-school Quake III, slightly slowed down and missing a few features though. Definitely worth your time if you have any interest in faster paced multiplayer.\n\nThe integrated SnapMap tool (used for building your own levels and sharing with others), offers a lot more on top of the single player and multiplayer, but sadly the limitations are far too obvious. Clearly it was a tool built with consoles in mind, hence the limited objects, and options. You can only have 10 demons spawned at once, and the building space is far too small. I really wish they would have removed these limitations on the PC version, but sadly I don’t see it happening any time soon. Still, SnapMap is a fun extra, to an already great game.\n\nBuy DOOM, it’s worth every penny.\n","June 6","true","27.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abominationoverdrive/recommended/379720/","abominationoverdrive","Ξммı","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abominationoverdrive/","133 products in account","DOOM is a really legendary franchise, perfecting the First Person Shooter formula back in 1993 when it was released. Being a huge part of my childhood, when the new DOOM game was announced I was bouncing left and right, trying to contain my excitement. When I saw the first trailers and gameplay mechanics, I was kind of skeptical about how the new game will work off with health and ammo drops when you kill enemies, but to my surprise it works amazingly. Let me explain a little bit more.\n\nSo the new DOOM is what it tries to be, a new DOOM game for the new gaming generation. Based off the first two games of the franchise, DOOM and DOOM II: Hell on Earth it brings itself to the modern day really well. Gameplay is fast paced and full of action just like its predecessors. You can carry all the guns you pick up along the way and upgrade them through fighting hordes of demons or finding secrets to make your demon slaying even more gorey and effective.\n\nIntroduced new into the gameplay is the Glory Kill system, which will allow you to make a gorey kill move against any demon that you have done enough damage to and rip off their head, guts, heart or legs! There's multiple animations for these actions so you won't be seeing the same kill animation over and over again too often. Performing these kill moves on the demons makes them drop health and ammo for you to pick up making the killing smooth and fun with your guns or fists alike.\n\nNew enemies are introduced as well and I must say they fit to the DOOM franchise amazingly well and are a welcomed add to the bunch of the old foes that we meet along the way and God, don't get me started on the graphics. The environments in the game look really believable and beautiful to look at. I was in awe of the detail and beauty of the scenery wanting to explore everything you see along the way.\n\nWhich brings me to the secrets. They're scattered all over the game for you to find and they usually reward you really well from weapons to powerups, so exploration is always rewarded in multiple ways.\n\nThe game is challenging and fun to go through. Every difficulty from the old games are present and a new hardest difficulty Ultra-Nightmare is introduced as well. Never beat nightmare mode on the originals and I bet I won't beat them on this game either!\n\nEven if I give this game a lot of praise, couple of things did bother me.\n\nFirst off the Cyberdemon's design since the first trailer didn't leave a huge impact on me for being the most iconic DOOM monster in the series. The new redesign of the character makes him look cool, but not intimidating like he was in the originals. Even in DOOM 3 I felt intimidated by him. He was a rewarding boss in the old games, but for some reason I didn't get the same feeling when I beat him in the new DOOM. This is of course a personal opinion and I don't expect people to agree with me, but to me the big badass demon from the old games should have intimidated me and make me feel threatened at least once. This Cyberdemon didn't do it for me.\n\nI love most of the music in the game, but some of the industrial metal setting does get a bit repetetive. There's some nice easter eggs in the music having snips of old DOOM songs here and there, but the industrial sound doesn't bring them out too well. It feels too much like Quake and that is not what DOOM's about. Quake is a great game series, but industrial metal in my opinion doesn't belong in DOOM. Good old rock 'n' roll and old school metal does. Again, my opinion and no one needs to agree with me.\n\nOtherwise I'd say DOOM is a must pick for any DOOM fan out there and I personally would give the game about 8.5/10 rating myself. It's a great reboot of an old classic bringing the good old FPS action to the new gaming generation and who knows, get interested the old games as well.","May 16","true","49.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The gfx were wonderful, the gameplay happened at a rapid pace, and I was starting to get involved in the SP story line. Unfortunately, I happened to be a victim of the developer mode bug.  In a nutshell, out of blue I received a notification that I was put into developer mode, and as a result certain features of the game were disabled.  According to the dev message, the solution is to delete my SP Game save and start from scratch.  Unfortunately, this did not work. Even deleting the files and folders in C:\Users\me\Saved Games\id Software\ did not solve the problem (there are a few more steps that I followed to try and resolve this problem, but I digress).  When I first open the game after deleting the files I can play just fine. However, as soon as I quit Doom and then re-launch, I get the "you are in Dev mode" error.\nFortunately, I had played the game for less than 2 hours so I just ended up requesting and receiving a refund from Steam.\nIf it wasn't for this absolutely horrible bug, I would definitely recommend this game. In the end, I simply cannot recommend purchasing at this time until Bethesda releases a fix (as of 06-02 this bug has been met with silence).\nHonestly, I have no idea how many people its affecting; for all I know it could be less than 1%. That being said, there is currently a 500+ post thread on Steam regarding this issue.  Ironically, the thread was started by a Bethesda Developer.\nLong story short, if the Dev Mode bug gets resolved, I will definitely purchase the game again. Otherwise, I am happy with my refund!\nJust FYI, I strongly recommend any new purchasers test out their Doom install as soon as possible to determine whether or not you are affected by this bug (If you play the game for more than 2 hours, Steam will not give you a refund).  Based on my experience, the best way to determine if you are affected is to simply exit out of the game and then re-launch it. If you receive a message about network services being disabled and dev mode being enabled, you are most likely affected by this bug.  Honestly, you should perform the exit/relaunch process as many times as possible. Some people don't run into this issue until they are hours into the game. IMO there is simply nothing you can do to fix it at this time.\nHopefully Bethesda will at least post an update as to whether or not they are planning on fixing this.","June 2","false","1.7"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","33","55","0","0"

Wait for major patch.\n\nThe GoodThis game manages to faithfully bring back a number of Doom and Doom II features and tidbits, while also coming across as fresh and new.  It conveys the "run-and-gun" atmosphere of the original titles, but it doesn't feel like its in a recycled format.  It offers great combat, smooth movement, and decent graphics.  Overall, its a great deal of fun.\n\nHowever.\n\nAnd this is the important part.\n\nThe BadHowever, the developer support for the game is poor, at best.  There are a great number of users (including YouTube casters!) who are experiencing some very peculiar CTDs and system reboots.  These problems do not yield any in-game error messages, nor do they leave a single item in the Windows on-board Event Viewer.  The program quite literally kills itself instantly and with no prior notice or predictability, and nobody understands why.  The problem has nothing to do with DX, NVidia drivers, hardware, or user-end software, nothing to do with Steam settings, in-game preferences, etc.  This is a problem with the program itself, and there's nothing that any user can do about it just yet.  And furthermore, this issue hasn't been showing up for most users until they've lodged 10+ hours into the game.  At first, it'll seem fine.  But when you're in the middle of the solo campaign, ♥♥♥♥ will hit the fan.\n\nAs of yet, the only dev support that anybody has received has been the typical canned response that tells you, "Please download the latest drivers" etc. etc. etc.  It just isn't helping.  Additionally, some users are reporting that Bethesda and/or ID are trying to hush up this issue by deleting some online forum threads about it, as well as removing negative Steam reviews such as this one.\n\nThe OverallAdd this game to your Wishlist, and keep an eye on it.  Its a fantastic experience, whether or not you loved the original titles.  This game is exactly the Doom experience that the fans have been waiting for.\n\nJust don't buy it until there's a fix for this - rather large - issue of CTDs and reboots.   DO YOUR RESEARCH!  Look online and check forums and articles, check and see if there's a fix for this issue.  And if there's not, don't buy the game.  You'd only be wasting money.  And if there is a fix...\n\nBUY THIS GAME RTFN!\n\nThis game is excellent.  I really wish that I could play it for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time.","May 25","false","30.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

Not giving out review copies prior to a game's release is normally a sign of a publisher trying to cover up that their game maybe isn't all that great, and they would like to get as many people purchasing before reviews are out. Thankfully, DOOM is everything that I hoped it would be, even if I did doubt that it would be.\n\nDOOM is on a new engine, id Tech 6 and it runs very well. I managed to get a consistent frame rate, and the game looked amazing. id Tech 6 also doesn't have that texture pop-in annoyance that id Tech 5 had, which is always great.\n\nWithin seconds of starting the game up, you are straight into the action and shooting hell monsters right in their skulls. DOOM knows it is not a game that will have an award-winning story, and id Software play that to their strengths by making this 100% awesome gameplay. This shows heavily when there are scenes where characters are clearly trying to give the game a story with more in-depth character development, but the protagonist, Doomguy, just doesn't care.  Instead, Doomguy will just choose to ignore character/story progression and conversation by smashing computers giving messages, or by smashing communication units from people telling him what to do. You don't tell Doomguy what to do, his only job is destruction.\n\nAside from the starting pistol, all weapons feel like they pack a punch. You are given the pistol when you first start the game, and that may lead some people to think negatively of the game as the pistol doesn't feel good to use at all. However, before you can even begin to rage, you  will be given the shotgun. The shotgun feels and sounds wonderful. Weapon customising is big in DOOM, each weapon has two trees that you can unlock and it's not an 'either or choice', you can pick both and all of the upgrades, and even swap between the changes with ease. Want your machine gun to fire rockets? Sure thing. Want to turn your Chaingun into a mobile turret? Of course! As well as giving benefits that change what the gun can do, you also unlock benefits that can improve the stats, e.g. reload faster or decrease ammo cost. To unlock the last upgrade for each weapon, you will need to complete a challenge. The challenge will depend on the gun and the upgrade, but they are generally things such as 'Hit 4 enemies with Micro Missiles in 5 seconds'. This will then unlock the ability to be able to fire as many missiles as you have the ammo for.\n\nThe main problem with creating a game like this is that you want it to be modern and fresh, but you also don't want to ♥♥♥♥ off the core players that loved the original game. The enemy design in DOOM (2016) pays homage to the original in a lovely way, they have been heavily updated, changed and modernised, but you still look at them and know exactly what they looked like in the original game. The enemies still look like hell demons, and that is what you want in a DOOM game. They are also all squishy and full of blood, so when you shoot or rip them apart, lots of blood and gibs will splash out like a fountain.\n\nThat still doesn't change the fact that lots has been changed in this new version of the game when compared to the original. You can look up and down, you can jump and even double jump! The main issue I had before the game was released was that I was worried that the 'Glory Kills' feature would spoil the 'DOOM-esque' vibe and make it too much like every other FPS we currently have on the market. Luckily, that isn't the case. For all those not familiar with DOOM's 'Glory Kills', this is when an enemy is on low health, you can melee them brutal way with a quick animation. The enemy will then drop more ammo and health. When games generally add animations to things like this, once you have seen it a couple of times then you cannot be bothered to keep seeing them again. For me, I have not grown tired of them. They are extremely quick animations that does not slow down the gameplay or leave you vulnerable to an attack. Even though you will continue seeing the same animation again and again, they still always look great. For those that do not want to see these glory kill animations, you do have the option for turning them off.\n\nLevel design has always been a major part of the old school FPS games. Remember that joke picture that showed level design in old FPS games and it being an intricate maze, and then it showed modern FPS games and it was a single corridor filled with cut scenes? DOOM is most definitely the former. The levels have been wonderfully designed, full of secrets and easter eggs such as the ability to jump into and play the original doom but with the new weapons (Like in Wolfenstein The New Order). I hunted high and low for secrets as I was playing, but there were still plenty that I have missed and will need to go back and try to find them. There were also times that I found switches that I turned and I didn't have a clue where the door was that must have opened. Fans of exploration will love the little hidden things you can do and find, and people who do not like this can just choose to run right past it all and continue killing.\n\nCampaign length always comes into question. DOOM took me around 10 hours to complete on 'Hurt me plenty' difficulty, this was with many secrets and other items missed that I will go back and see if I can collect them all. Once the game has been completed once, this will unlock 'Nightmare' and 'Ultra-nightmare' difficulty. Nobody at id Software has completed the game at 'Ultra Nightmare', this is because the enemies pack a serious punch, and I mean that one enemy can easily kill you quicker than you can turn around to say hello. Is that all? No of course not. Once you die, sorry, game over. Yep, this is permadeath, once you die you have to start from the very beginning again. A marker will be placed in the area you died, so you can wave to where you previously died. I tried this difficulty mode. I failed this difficulty mode. I'm not generally one for re-playing games again, but with DOOM, I definitely will. I enjoyed all 10 hours that I put into the campaign that I will not be replaying it dreading a certain part of the game (except for maybe some of the boss fights when at a harder difficulty).\n\nMultiplayer was the part that seemed to have been focused on prior to the release of DOOM. The beta was a multiplayer only beta, that frankly I just didn't really enjoy that much. Now that the full game is out and I put more time into the multiplayer, it is starting to grow on me. I mainly play 'Freeze tag' as I loved that in Quake II, but there is a variety of game modes to suit everyone....\n\n##### Review is too long for Steam, to read the rest, please go to https://www.ordinarygamer.co.uk/2016/05/15/doom-review/ #####","May 16","true","11.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This led to a lot of experimentation, as every developer wanted their game to stand out from the pack. It is more true now than it was ever before as market is fierce. If you don’t stand out, you might as well simply be wasting your time making the game. This experimentation in the early years led to a lot of cool FPS games. However, after a certain point of experimentation, it began to lose its own identity as a genre. It was never more so prevalent since the last console generation. The genre was forced to do too many things at once, the weight upon which was felt by the pillars of the FPS foundation, which sometime after, ultimately collapsed. This is a big reason why I eventually grew fonder of RPG games, but again one can argue the genre is also suffering the same problems as of late. The FPS genre desperately needed some clear perspective of what it should try to accomplish and what it should leave behind. It needed a clean slate… a reboot…enter DOOM.\n\nDOOM of 2016 briskly severs all the ties it had with the previous game and drops every unnecessary alteration and went straight back to the basics. What makes a FPS enjoyable in the first place? -- The shooting mechanics of course, with little to no barrier between you and what you see on screen. For the DOOM reboot the id software guys-- just like another Bethesda studio behind the wonderful reboot of Wolfenstein-- nailed the feel of the first person shooting. It’s a pure delight just shooting whatever monstrosity moves. Here the level design gives players complete freedom to go crazy with their reclaimed ability to shoot, move and jump effortlessly. Movement and shooting were what made FPS a longstanding genre and it is great to see the id software acknowledging it. The shooting feels like smooth as silk. In fact, I’ll use a quote from id artist as it describes it perfectly, it “feel like Bruce Lee with a shotgun on a skateboard."\n\nDOOM doesn't mess around. It literally grabs the narrative and throws it against the corner of the wall. There is a very lose narrative on top of DOOM. Normally I would have used the word ‘tying’ with ‘narrative’, however for DOOM’s case the narrative actually unties the game which often restricts the flow in most modern first person shooters. The story is there only to serve as a compass to move things forward. In fact, the story is so light that I feel we are looking at the world through the eyes of our DOOM guy.\n\nThe player avatar – called the DOOM Slayer by those who condemn him, the DOOM guy those who revere him – does not utter a single word, not even when he gets hurt or about to die, yet he is one of the most expressive and well characterized avatar in any game – how’s it so? Where other first person shooters use voice acting to instill some soul to their avatars, DOOM speaks out player agency through the body gestures of the avatar. The gestures are clear and concise about the DOOM Guy’s motivations, which is to simply destroy every nightmarish creature from hell in the most morbid fashion, while looking all badass. While killing monsters, the DOOM guy never feels threatened, in fact he is having the time of his life. Little touches add up a lot, like fist bumping with his action figure persona, or giving a thumbs up as he gets swallowed by the molten lava.   Most of us players share the exact same sentiment when we sit down to play such a game, the DOOM Guy simply does what we are thinking. This allows players to instantly connect with the avatar. The only thing between us and those demons are our guns.\n\nIt is not that DOOM simply rips everything off the originals and idly sits by, it introduces a good number of modern FPS conventions which only enhance the foundations led by the original. One of the most controversial aspects of the combat when it was first unveil back in e3 2015 was the context sensitive melee kills, called ‘Glory Kills’. When the player damages the demons to the point they become vulnerable, flashes of yellow and blue circulates throughout the body, indicating they are up for a glory kill. The player than moves up close and press F (or console equivalent of it) to see the DOOM guy savagely dismember the demon, almost to the pint you start to feel sorry for it. Back at e3, without much context it felt like a cheap, attention grabbing mechanic which have been used a lot before. Once the players got to use it in action, it instantly made sense. The glory kills not just look incredibly violent – which feeds back to his character – but also heals the player when he/she had run out of health. Oh yea, I guess this is the right time to mention that the game does not have any regenerating health packs. Another neat thing is that these special kills do not take player’s control out of the game for more than a second tops, so the combat flow is not affected.\n\nSpeaking of flow, once the metal music kicks in and you are jumping, shot gunning, and tearing your way across the arena; you feel like you are a poetry in motion, a poetry of Death himself. The boom of your twin-barrel shotgun elevates the music by providing a coarse bass, the demon shouts providing organic vocals –rounding up one amazing metal album. When it starts, you just feel like shouting towards the screen as you continue to lay down carnage along your path. The music speaks volumes of what is on the screen, the composter as well as the sound engineers have done an outstanding job.\n\nThe game also enhances the player’s gameplay style with runes, items and power ups. Runes are special enhancements which passively enhances the core abilities like movement in the air, glory killing from distance. These passive upgrades open up to a lot of tactical opportunities in the right hands. For e.g. the Glory Killing from distance is not only useful for to get extra health during the time of desperation, but can also act as mode of quickly moving across the world. Then we have items which are stuff like grenades which do not have a big effect to gameplay like others, but when used under right circumstances can save your life. Finally, the power ups provide temporary super demon-killing abilities (as if you weren’t that already).\n\nAll this brutality is brought to life with the id tech 5 game engine. The lighting is topnotch, diffusing realistically on top of the crispy high resolution textures. Physically based rendering is in full force, allowing to differentiate a piece of metal to a piece of meat. The art takes full advantage of the tech and the environments ranging from the clean high-tech facilities of UAC to the dreadful underworld of Hell is meticulously crafted. Not only the game looks great, but runs really well too. With my GTX 970 overclocked, I can always reach 100fps on ultra with vsync off. The game scales nicely with lower and higher end machines as well. Clearly a lot of work gone into the latest engine from id software to not only look stunning, but also to run well as feasibly possible.\n\nThe game does ship with a multiplayer component.  It is by no means bad, but clearly it should be taken as a companion to the core experience as opposed to a featured package. While a user friendly mod/map making tool will allow a steady stream of content.\n\nSo there you have it. DOOM is all about undoing everything you learned in the COD school. It is unshamefully violent. Like its recent Wolfenstein brother, DOOM is the most fun FPS I've played. Funny how quickly things fall into place when you get the 'shooting' and movement mechanics right.","May 25","true","17.9"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","17","26","3","10"

Well, every aspect I've played of it thus far has been nearly flawless and truly is a real successor to Doom 1 and 2. I also don't recommend playing on any difficulty below "Hurt Me Plenty." If you do, you're a wimp and don't deserve to play this game.\n\nIt's fast, has a massive emphasis on being a good shot, good timing, and not being completely stupid. If you want to make it feel even faster, amp your field of view up to 120 or higher.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the way things go (which isn't difficult to do [unless you are dumb as a sack of potatoes]), you'll feel like the biggest, baddest bully this side of Hell's playground... until you get to the multiplayer aspect, anyway.\n\nOnce you get to that part, you'll find yourself constantly getting your poo pushed in all over again... but here's the thing... you'll like it. You'll find yourself constantly learning from your mistakes. You'll learn how to navigate the maps fluidly, where the pickups are, how to aim your rockets, etc. subconsciously as you play more and more... which you will. Trust me. This game is addiction incarnate. You'll find yourself saying "Okay, one more match" and next thing you know, it's 7am the next day.\n\nSo here's a pros vs. cons list.\n\nPros -\n\n1. Fast. You can make it feel faster by upping your FOV.\n2. Good controls. Responsive too.\n3. So many demons. All at once. All the demons.\n4. RIP\n5. AND\n6. TEAR\n6. YOUR\n6. GUTS.\n7. It's Doom in it's purest form. There is literally nothing to hate.\n\nCons -\n\n1. The chaingun and people who use it are truly the most annoying things ever. Seriously. Stop it. No. Put the chaingun down before I shove my super shotgun up your behind and fire both barrels again.\n2. Why are you still reading this? Go buy the game, dumb-dumb!\n\nMy personal rating -\n\n666/Pentagram.","May 13","true","40.0"," 59 of 105 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","59","105","14","10"

Bethesda's response to this is that we are using the console to cheat and the only fix is to delete your save and restart the entire game. In reality, it's happening to many people completely randomly. It seems that any time the game closes unexpectedly (crash, system hang, etc) it will then flag your save as being in developer mode.\n\nBethesda refuses to acknowledge there is a problem and if they are even working on a solution.

Then I got to play it and holy crap yes! Doom doesn't shove down some BS story down your throat, you wake up and imediately start shooting demons around you. Combat feels quick, you never stand in one place because that get's you killed pretty fast. From first level onwards I found myself running around the level, shooting anything that moves, jumping on higher ground while grabbing health/ammo/armor desperately trying to stay alive.\n\nWhat was probably the most positive surprise is the level design. You are not just thrown into a linear corridor after linear corridor like in Doom 3, instead you get open large levels quite similar to original games. Also yes, there are numerous secrets to be found, I think I missed 6 in second level alone.\n\nWhat I thought I would hate were the glory kills, however they are quite quick to pull off and keep the pace up by giving you some extra health (which you will need on higher difficulties). Perhaps the game relies too much on this system, them again whenever you take damage it is 100% your own fault, almost any source of damage can be avoided by a skillfull player. This doesn't make the game easy though, UV is definitely giving me a run for my money.","May 13","true","24.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

Existing saves need to be un-flagged.  Bethesda and id need to release a patch for this, rather than brazenly advising people to delete their saves and start all over again in the off chance that this will resolve the issue.  Most likely it won't, since the game is also crashing to desktop for a lot of players, leading to corrupted files which apparently are triggering this developer mode without the player doing anything (as if pressing ` should justifiably wreck people's save files, considering it's kind of an id game standby — let alone F12, which is the default screenshot key for players on Steam).  They need to understand that nobody wants to pay $60 for a video game only to waste their own time on this nonsense.  UNTIL THEN, well, I have to give this game a thumbs down — if only to contribute to gaining their attention and ensuring that THEY understand the onus is on them to fix their game.  It is not the responsibility of their customers.\n\nThat said, the single player campaign itself is AMAZING and far better than I had hoped it would be, so this whole fiasco renders it all bittersweet.  If/when these problems are patched up, I'll delete or edit this review and switch to very much recommending Doom 4.  If you're only concerned with playing through the fantastic single player campaign and don't care about the rest (and you shouldn't, really) I would recommend that you DO NOT PAY FOR IT until id and Bethesda show some sign that they're paying attention.

Easily the greatest FPS I've ever played. Fast and fluid combat mechanics, super tense encounters, and wildly satisfying gibs. Hopefully this game marks the end of the uninspired cover shooter, the forced-narrative driven games, and the 10 year long fetish for the Marine Corps.\n\nOnto the details, the difficulty curve is one of the absolutely most linear (that's good) I've ever seen in a game. It's a gradual increase and the game manages to foreshadow the next enemy to be introudced in a very natural way. And speaking of the enemies, they're as well designed as they ever have been. Each enemy has its own unique set of mechanics and weaknesses. They all have special ways of being disembowled as well, so that's a plus.\n\nEncounters usually come in three flavors: hallways, multiplayer-esque arenas, and boss fights, and they all manage to hold their own and be memorable. The boss fights are particularly fantastic though, sporting WoW-like boss mechanics that require you to really be paying attention to the environment as well as shooting the big bad guy in the head.\n\nAny negatives this game has are HEAVILY overcompensated by the positives. If I were to list a few though, it would be that it still indulges in the occassional slightly long cutscene or scripted sequence, the talent trees are neat but kinda boring (armor talents in particular), fairly lengthy load times, and lack of blast beats in the death metal/electronic score.\n\nNote that you do need a pretty good rig to run this properly (this game REALLY needs to be played at 60+ fps) and I had to turn everything to low to keep it around 60 when the ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan. I'm on a GTX760, i7-3400 and 8gigs of RAM for reference.\n\nSo if you can run it, you need this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hajimoto/recommended/379720/","hajimoto","Hajimoto [ECWC]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hajimoto/","714 products in account","I apologize to any of you that were exposed to the hack 1st year grad student review that was posted by me earlier.  I always write my reviews in Word and then cut and paste the finished piece into whatever medium I am working in, well this time I have no idea what happened but what was posted was missing paragraphs, punctuation, and all formatting.  I have corrected the review accordingly and hope it helps you during your deliberation if you should buy this game or not.\n\nI played so much of the original game Doom, that I could run levels entirely in reverse without touching any walls or hazards. I would deathmatch friends for hours at a time and got so good at the game that we used play where I would only use my fist but they could use any of the other weapons in the game.  So all of this being said, I am what you would consider a doom professional.\n\nSo my Doom professionalism was a bit skeptical with the newly released 2016 Doom. I got flash backs of Doom3 which was horrible and was not Doom at all but more of a Fear meets Quake. Well I can tell you that Bethesda (whom acquired id Software), did a spectacular job of capturing the essence of the original Doom and did the original coders some justice.\n\nThis endorsement is not made as a Doom/id fan boi but as someone who played the original so much that I could almost play by sound alone and remember the emotions and energy the game created in a player and this new Doom has that. I think we have all said this before "if the game developer would only upgrade the graphics and sound to todays standards but leave the game play the way it was in the past, they would have an amazing game".\n\nThese guys have done that exactly, they have not tried to make Doom something it wasn’t, they did not try and reinvent what works, they kept all of the elements that made the 1993 Doom a success. I have over 33 HRS in the game so far and have unlocked 24% of the achievements and can say with a fierce amount of confidence that this game has earned every minute of play time I give it.\n\nThe game comes with a Map editor/Game mode editor which means that anyone can produce game modes or levels that they feel are the ultimate field of play.  Anyone who has played the original Doom or Doom II, will agree with me when I say this games single player campaign get a 10 out of 10 rating/score.  I can not say enough how great of a job they have done.  The graphics, sound and overall immersion is second to none.  While the game feels familiar with all of the monsters that existed in the original, they all received a substantial graphic upgrade.  The levels feel large and size appropriate.\n\nCombat is what you would expect with all the awesome weapons but the developers have introduced a fatality like melee finish that produces health or ammo for a player. This addition allows a player to get close and personal in order to gain assets eliminating the need to search for health packs and ammunition around the level.\n\nNow on to the multiplayer portion of the game, my favorite game mode is Domination. Domination is what you would expect; there are points that you need to control to which earn your team score increases.  Killing other players, assisting team mates and capturing points of control all gain  you score increases just like typical domination/conquest modes in other games. The first team to 250 wins.  There are six different multiplayer modes to play, there is Soul Harvest, Freeze Tag, Warpath, Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Clan Arena.\n\nThe feel of the weapons and the weight of the character in game all feel correct there is no input lag, there is not any delayed reaction time caused by poorly optimized code.  If you get owned by your adversary and he didn’t use the BFG, you just outright got owned.  Currently it is said that the Chaingun is OP and there are a few ammunition limits they are trying to put in place to reduce one class from having a distinct and unfair advantage but overall, I have never been owned by one class specifically.\n\nIf you purchase this game for no other reason than the single player campaign, you will not be unhappy.  The one aspect of this game that I think is not getting enough applause, is the custom design and game mode multiplayer that allows a group of friends to play a their own game type in a private arena and just have fun.  That was something the original doom never had.\n\nMy overall score for Doom 2016 is 90 out of 100 - Definately worth the jing!","May 28","true","60.6"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","21","35","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/379720/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","It’s been 12 years since Doom 3’s release and now we have a new Doom title that drops the flashlight mechanic and follows its predecessors’ footsteps more closely. The end result is a beautiful fast-paced shooter with large maps, hidden items, and a robust upgrade system. The game is not without its flaws as it does falter a bit towards the end of the game, uses only a checkpoint system without manual saves, and sometimes the large maps can work against it by slowing the game’s pace down severely depending on a player’s obsession with collecting items and finding secrets.\n\nThe duration of the single player seems to be at a decent length as I did finish up by the 10.4 hour mark. That time includes around an hour of staring at the different upgrade screens, consulting the fantastic 3D map for collectible locations, and some unfortunate backtracking I did for some secrets. The latter later made me reconsider my desire to have everything and so I started to ignore collectibles that I could not attain easily. That said I did acquire most of the exploration items and unlocked 2 classic Doom maps which can be selected for play from the main menu after selecting campaign. The hidden levers to unlock them seem fairly obnoxious as they don’t show up on the map at all. I found that trying to search for everything bogs the pacing down and prevents you from doing what the game does best, throwing demons at you for slaying. The game has a level select available should you want to hunt any missing items down. You might wonder why I didn’t just skip more of the exploring from the beginning, but exploration equals power for Doom (2016).\n\nThe game heavily incentivizes going off the beaten path within its large levels because many of the exploration items grant upgrade points that can be used to acquire passive abilities, increase base stats like health, unlock weapon mods, or enhance unlocked weapon mods. You can also find plenty of Doom lore, a neat collectible that unlocks models for viewing, and an automap console for revealing the entire map. My personality made me take the map related Praetor armor passive skills first, but you could go for enhanced power-ups or faster weapon switching instead. Rune passives have effects such as enemies drop armor shards after a Glory Kill (melee finisher) or more plentiful ammo drops (I never went without these two). The weapon mods are critical to dealing enough damage to survive. They’re also fun and allow for different playstyles. I greatly enjoyed how the Siege Mode mod of the Gauss Cannon, a personal favorite, let me fire off a destructive piercing shot at the cost of staying still. Line ‘em up, put ‘em down.\n\nWhile I dearly love the Gauss Cannon and the devastation I can cause with it, most of the other weapons can also hold their own and work together with the various enemy types to create a mostly great combat experience. The combat’s fun owes plenty to its fast movement speed, no reloads, the weapon mods you choose after finding a field drone, and how you upgrade them. Weapon upgrade points are plentiful and you should have more than enough to develop the weapons to your specifications. I had a fully upgraded Super Shotgun for pure power, a Heavy Assault Rifle that could fire Micro Rockets until I ran out of ammo, a rocket launcher with remote detonation, and more. The weapons feel, look, and sound powerful; however, I did think the pistol and regular shotgun were weak contenders that didn’t see much use in my weapon rotation later in the game. That sense of power benefits from enemies losing limbs, turning into bloody chunks, and taking visible damage until the final blow is dealt. While weapon mods allow for diverse gunplay, unlocking the final upgrade for weapon mods can sometimes be a pain since some of them have very specific challenges which impacts pacing. I often had to press TAB, mid-combat, to remind myself of the unlock conditions for several different weapons.\n\nThe special weapons and melee finishers do their part too. The chainsaw in Doom functions like a panic button and instantly gives any demon a bad day before making them explode into dozens of little ammo pickups. It’s balanced by a limited supply of fuel. Doomguy also has several weapons available for tossing at the demon horde. The thrown items have a recharge rate, but can also be replenished with the appropriate ammo pickup. Despite my preference for shooting, I did engage heavily with the Glory Kill system in order to stay alive due to the health and armor shard (Rune skill) drops. If you’re on the brink of death, a Glory Kill will produce more health drops, making it vital to success if you’re bad at dodging. The finisher animations did make my eyes grow weary after a while due to the repetition despite how fast they are. I regret not finding the Rune Trial that grants faster Glory Kills.\n\nDoom’s combat pacing felt pretty good for most of the experience as it kept adding a new enemy type at appropriate intervals to keep things from becoming stale and has the occasional boss fight. For the most part, the game’s tempo followed a fight, explore, and fight again type of pattern. Most enemy encounters involved demons spawning into existence for you to battle instead of using monster closets. The spawning could cause some issues since the maps make great use of vertical space, making it more difficult to keep track of enemies. Late in the game, the spawns followed a similar pattern – small guys, medium guys, then large guys – which became monotonous. Far too often, fights would end by taking out the same large demon type. They could have done something with unleashing a horde of one or two enemy types, but I didn’t see that happen. Also, there didn’t seem to be a large number of enemies on screen at the same time. It always felt like 8-10 enemies at most. At least the game ended with a decent boss fight to help me forget.\n\nThe other two modes don’t seem to add much to the experience for me. SnapMap looks like it’ll need more time before the really good stuff becomes featured. I’m interested in what a co-op experience might look like with friends. The multiplayer has some fun modes, but Freeze Tag is ruined by Vortex Rifles which can one hit kill players with a full charge. It doesn’t help that the mode can end faster than the intermission time limit of 90 seconds between matches. Team Deathmatch made me wish I bought Overwatch because the gameplay just does not feel right with a loadout system. It’s not a good fit for this title. I would have greatly preferred weapon pickups, especially since the Rocket Launcher feels abnormally weak and doesn’t knock players around. War Path caught my attention and is my favorite mode because it’s a bit different, like Freeze Tag. I like the idea of a moving zone that needs to be captured and defended.\n\nOkay, here are some other things I want to touch on before giving a conclusion: the game’s performance is a rock solid 60fps on ultra with a GTX 970, i7 4790K, and 8GBs of RAM; textures will sometimes be slow to load, allowing for a retro feel; scroll bars can be buggy for descriptions/lore; Darin De Paul’s voice gives my ears pleasure; I like this Doom much more than Doom 3; Multiplayer, Campaign, and SnapMap all use different executables and selecting one requires a restart; finally, you can hold down Shift to walk, but I don’t know why anyone would use it.\n\nDoom can easily provide a mostly great experience so long as you don’t caught up with collecting everything in one go and really enjoy shooting demons. Otherwise, the copy/paste enemy spawning during the final areas of the game might annoy certain players. SnapMap has potential. The multiplayer portion doesn’t seem well-thought-out. The single player is the main draw for this game.","May 18","true","12.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But after getting my hands on it and playing through the campaign, I've never been happier to say I was wrong. This is Doom the way it should be: Light on story, very heavy on action, gore and challenging difficulty. Even if you only get it for the single player (like I did), you won't be dissapointed at all. Not only is it insanely fun, it's highly replayable with plenty of secrets to find, upgrades to unlock and loads of demons for you to kill. I especially love all the nods to the original games they've tossed in throughout the campaign.\n\nThis is also one of the most well optimized games I've ever played. I was somewhat worried my 970 wouldn't allow me to really push this game's graphics (especially after seeing the gameplay previews) but I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to turn all the settings up to ultra and still achieve a smooth, stable framerate even during seriously intense battles. It's good to see a developer who still cares about their PC players and isn't just giving us a shoddy console port.\n\nSo if you loved the original Doom games and wanna get back to killing hordes of demons, quit reading this and just buy the game already.","May 17","true","50.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AfroAmericanYoshi/recommended/379720/","AfroAmericanYoshi","Black Yoshi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AfroAmericanYoshi/","160 products in account","DOOM is one of the best FPS games I've played in recent years.  That sums it up, really.\n\nThe SingleplayerThere's not much of a story, but it's DOOM.  It doesn't need one.  All the story I need is "Here's a shotgun, here's a room full of demons; genocide the ♥♥♥♥ out of them."  There are some unwelcome modern elements such as the waypoints & compass in this game but luckily you can turn the lot of them off!\n\nAll the weapons feel powerful - in fact all of them are overpowered in their own ways - yet the game feels strangely balanced taking into account the amount of, and variety of, demons often shoved in one room with you.  You always feel powerful yet each battle you get into takes a decent amount of skill to get through.  The gunplay is excellent too.\n\nThe maps are open and there's plenty of room for exploration, and exploration in this game actually has a purpose other than for those 100% completion junkies; exploring can lead you to upgrades for your armour & weapons & weapon attachments that you find around the maps.  There's even cool little easter eggs featuring sections of classic DOOM maps from 1993.\n\nThe soundtrack's superb.  I don't really need to explain why, but here's a piece of the soundtrack which is basically a remaster of the iconic "E1M1 At Doom's Gate": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ4fJBFM4FY\nIf that didn't make you cream your pants, I don't know what will.\n\nThe game runs really well and I've experienced near to no bugs (except for a couple things on SnapMap).  A solid 60 FPS all the way through.\n\nThe MultiplayerThe multiplayer is a slightly different story.  Don't get me wrong: I love it as much as the singleplayer, however it is clearly the weakest part of the game.  Just for a bit of background, the DOOM Multiplayer Open Beta got 65% negative ratings.  It was developed by Certain Affinity, creators of the multiplayer modes of such classic examples of video gaming such as Call of Duty: Ghosts & Halo 4... yikes.\n\nWell I like the arena-style gameplay... I say arena "style" because it's not precisely an arena game, or "AFPS" as the hip kiddies these days are spouting these days.  I mean, there's the fast movement and the large emphasis on "move or you're ♥♥♥♥ed", some - SOME - weapon pickups around the place (though the weapon pickups that are there are the hilariously overpowered monsters that are the Gauss Cannon, Chainsaw and the BFG 9000), however there's ranking up, character and weapon customisation & loadouts.  People were rioting over this, but in all honesty I wasn't bothered.\n\nThe weapon pickups, powerups and Demon Runes are indeed overpowered... actually the weapons as a whole are strangely unbalanced too; I found the Combat Shotgun more efficient than the Super Shotgun for example.  Very strange indeed.  All the weapons are still fun to use though... except for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones.  Like I said, strange "balancing".\n\nOne thing I really like though is the weapon and armour customization.  It's pretty varied and there's plenty of options to keep you occupied.  Look at my bloke here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=684508290\nOh yeah, there's poses - or "taunts" - now.  Not really that essential, most of them are pretty obnoxious tbh.\n\nMy least favorite thing about the multiplayer is the concerning lack of gamemodes... where's Free-For-All?  Surely that'd be perfect for an arena-style game.  Come to think of it, apart from armour customization, there really isn't much of anything in the multiplayer; not much gamemodes, maps, weapons ect... and they play on making DLC for this game which I feel is a bit of a "♥♥♥♥ you" honestly but at the end of the day, what can we do?  We can't complain because the unholy amount of DLC in todays games are basically our fault because we all bought them when they came out...\n\nSnapMapSnapMap is great.  There's loads of player created maps to choose from and play through and learning to make your own SnapMaps are very easy and interesting.  What I don't understand is the armour customisation.  It's virtually the same as the multiplayer's with the same armour options, yet you have to purchase them using "SnapMap Tokens" which you earn by playing other people's SnapMaps and completing Snapmap challenges.  SnapMap.  Not got a problem with this, though I think it's weird how your armour set doesn't carry over from multiplayer.\n\nAlso, sometimes the logic chains when making SnapMaps break.  For instance, I tell a button to open a door and spawn two Imps when I press it.  It worked perfectly for a while, however after coming to completing the map, the imps wouldn't spawn.  No idea why this is the case, it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nOverviewOverall, DOOM is a great game.  Not flawless, clearly, but if you're looking for that classic DOOM singleplayer experience then you're sure as hell going to get it here.  You've even got your own singleplayer maps to create in SnapMap and the Multiplayer mode if you really want to...\n\n8/10\n\nP.S: Anyone who uses the Vortex Rifle in the Multiplayer needs to go drink bleach ASAP.","May 15","true","30.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buu342/recommended/379720/","buu342","Buu342","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buu342/","170 products in account","Before this review starts, something I'd like to point out:\nI'm a massive Doom fan. I've played Doom 1 and 2 at the age of 6. Doom was the game that got me into becomming a video game programmer and modder. Some of my fondest memories were playing these game and their multiplayer. DeHackEd and ACS were the first coding languages I learned, all thanks to Doom's extensive modding community\n\nWith this being said, let's see how my favorite childhood game has got itself rebooted.\n\nSingle-PlayerI'll just say it right out of the box that this is, by far, my favorite Single-Player experience by far. The explosions, gore and brutal-ness has activated a lot of adredaline in me. I felt my body all funny when I saw that they put my favorite video game villain (Spoiler) The Spider Mastermind in the game. The Glory Kill System stolen inspired by Brutal Doom was interesting, but it fell flat later on. Especially because some enemies seem to only have 2 different glory kill animations (Cacodemon and Mancubus I'm looking at you). The weapon arsenal and mods are great. There is too much emphasis on explosives though. The rocket launcher and plasma guns felt really flat and powerless. I never used any of the grenades the game gave us because I never found a reason to, and am still confused as to why they're in Doom. Also, one of the weapon mods is the ability to aim down sights. No comment there. The chainsaw... It felt like a cheap weapon and it was boring to use. Speaking of that, I found myself using the glory kill system to cheat out of death, because it gives me invincibility and free health. The music is Gorgeous, as well as the graphics. The story is here, for some reason, and it is forced on you. I hate it. I hate it. I HATE IT. I came to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up, not to sit locked in a room while some character talks. The ending left me there, wondering what the hell I had just spent a massive amount of time doing. It would have been so good if they let us blast our way out of those rooms so the doom guy would be like: "Pfft, I don't give a damn". The ending however... (Spoiler) I've been waiting the entire game to be able to punch Samuel in the face, but instead they just build a sequel? What the hell guys....\n\nMulti-PlayerJohn Carmack once said: "If I were to redo Rage, I would put less emphasis on consoles". Looks like ID didn't follow his advice. Multiplayer is where the notion that this game is a console port really starts to show. When I saw that this had taunts, I knew it was going to be EA Battlefront all over again. And funnily enough, I was right. There's no way to create servers, there's loadouts, and a massive emphasis on team based gamemodes. Where the hell is the Arena Shooter that Doom was famous for? The demon runes are broken and only the people who reach them in time will ever have fun in this gamemode. Why do we even have unlockables which give you an edge in combat? How could you ♥♥♥♥ up Multi-Player this bad??? Just no.\n\nMod SupportNon existant outside of the extremely limited and console friendly SnapMap. My Mod Folder for Doom 1 and 2 is about 30GB in size. I grew up modding Doom... This is by far the most disappointing thing from this game. Doom 3 had great mod support, allowing you to basically make an entire game based off ID's tech. This has a barebones level editor that doesn't allow you to place more than 4 players and hold 2 weapons because this was clearly just copy pasted from consoles. Computers have a lot more memory y'know? ID said they're planning on fixing this stuff, now the question is when...\n\nTech Issues:I have an Alienware M14X. Yep, I played this on a 5 year old laptop. Played it at lowest everything and a screen resolution of 640x480, and I've had a constant 60FPS almost everywhere except on the first hell level, which would slow to a crawl most of the time. Congratulations on ID for this achievement. Some LOD models would really benefit this game though... I was pretty worried at first though, the game was crashing upon booting when I first got it. I fixed it by updating all my GeForce drivers, so that wasn't a problem. Funnily enough, updating the drivers also made Dragon Ball Xenoverse run much better on my computer, so win win. I've exprienced 4 crashes so far, all were in the second hell level. Must be a bug there or something. Funnily enough the acid mancubus was always present when it happened. Also, the infamous developer bug. I had to redo my saves three times as a result. Luckily I wasn't very far in when I got them.\n\nPet Peeves- This game is called Doom. Why not Doom 4? I'm very certain they chose to call it Doom so that they get the top results in Google now.\n- Lack of Colors. This game is brown and blue. Where's all the color from Doom 1 and 2???\n- 40 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars worth of dlc. Are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me?????? The 60$ price tag was already a massive steep. Thank god I found keys worth for 30. I would pay 60 if the multiplayer wasn't absolute carbonated ♥♥♥♥♥. Which reminds me:\n- Everything about multiplayer\n- Crashes\n- 50GB in size. Maybe it's just me who needs to get used to this...\n- Glory Kill System is forced + Chainsaw is boring.\n- CONSOLE PORT\n- Health and ammo is given by the glory kill system and is rarely ever present in a map.\n- Plasma Gun Projectiles look like bubbles. Why couldn't you do something like in Doom 3? It looks so much better...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MKBY3bQJBM\n\nSummaryI know I've complained a lot, but believe me that it's been forever since I've had a singleplayer experience this fun. I'd reccomend the game just for the singleplayer. Everything else just falls flat and the game has bugs with no sign of patches underway. This game feels and is a console port outside of the singleplayer.\n\nFinal ScoresSingle-Player: 9/10\nMulti-Player: 5/10\nMod Support: 5/10\nTech Issues: 8/10\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10","June 6","true","20.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicD/recommended/379720/","CosmicD","CosmicD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicD/","274 products in account","The original doom was the second big fps, wolf3d started it all, and wolf3d was about "shooting your way through rooms with treasures, dogfood and nazi soldiers to reach that top of the building where you meet hitler" Doom was about "reaching the mouth of hell while you go through reasonably explorable level full of demon posessed zombie soldiers, imps, demons and cyberdemos while you explore one abandoned mars installation after the other". There was not really a story.\n\nSo it's not very hard to say why for me, this version of DOOM is the definite sequel, or remake, or re-imagining (whatever you want to call it) of the early 90's classic. You see doom 3 (2004) tried to suck you in too much with story and linear narrative, and conspiracy theories and story happening around you, and ironicly it tried to be too much "horror". It also suffered from trying to copy gimicks that worked in half life 2 but felt "copied" and bland in doom. It tried to go away from the classic by bringing in modern (at the time) gameplay that deviatd from run, strafe, crowd control and shoot. That's why in retrospect, I was never incredibly happy with it. The guns felt too clunky and plastic, and it was too impact less. Doom 3 was more quake 2 in a sense that quake 2 DID have more story to go for it and that's fine.\n\nThe new DOOM is more brutal, more clean and more fecious at the same time, the way the weapon pack punch to the enemies, the addictive glory kills that make you maticulously dismember enemies, make it a very classic experience with a special modern twist.\n\nThe leveldesign doesn't hold your hand for 100% (just like in the classic, there were small branches and spaces to roam and get lost in whithin the level), and the story is in the background. The pacing of gameplay varries from that typical calm haunting moment where you look for security cards while you hear critters in the background, only to suddenly ramp up and and barely make it alive by "glory killing" that last enemy that is about to punch or fireball your remaining health off. That makes me feel like I'm back in the 90s. The game lets you make your own story about what Doom is about; that it's the only thing you are worried about, you as a nameless marine with his praetor suit in an abandoned base on mars, no less, no more: that's that is what DOOM is all about, and successfully brings back and makes better!\n\nThere is progress in this game but it's simple and straight forward. The suit and weapon upgrades are granted to you when fighting hordes of enemies. You get suit empowerment globes and weapon upgrade points, you can spend them at your disgression on more armor, more health, specific weapon upgrades for your energy rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher etc...\n\nThe in world pickups like green armor replenishment and small armor nuggets, as well as the classic health packs and cupcakes, make a return. And just like in the old doom. Temporary enhancements also make a return such as berzeker mode where you fistbump the enemy to a squishy death, but also powerups that are adopted from quake make an entry, so you can find haste and quad damage powerups.\n\nDoom is simple and satisfying in it's modern execution, did I mention how satisfying it is to use the chainsaw ? Together with glory kills, it's one of these landmark doom essentials that made both the classic and the modern version so typically enjoyable. And as it adds allot to the overall gameplayto a point that it becomes a worthwhile satisfying mechanic on it's own, it becomes something you don't get tired of easily: DOOM certainly is a game you can replay, and it offers that extra value for that. Because you can findsecret "classic doom levels", and because you can stumble on runes that let you do challanges to receive extra passive perks for your characters. In level 3 there's a challange you can do by killing 15 imps with your shotgun in order to receive a perk that lets you suck in world items from further away as you pass them by. Thoe perks are purely optional but help a bit in roaming the levels.\n\nThe soundtrack is also a great throwback at 90's industrial/ambient type O negative / nine inch nails galore. And what makes it so amusing is that the music interacts, stutters and breaks while the pacing of the game changes and accentuates the arrangements as youperform glory kills. That really acknowledges your actions in a badass way.\n\nIt could be that when you are a modern player who is used to the sophisticaction of the division, call of duty, even dead space, and other modern first person shooters, that doom might be a bit too simple because there's no story. But for those nostalgic 40+ year olds like me, it becomes a throwback, and how more accuratly they can represent the original, the stronger the nostalgic feeling will get,  bringing the cycle of our youth anew... just like the marine's new cycle of violent creature tearing on the surface of mars!\n\nI don't review the multiplayer because I never play it.","May 16","true","10.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

There is a story here, but its mostly told through 'codex' entries that pop up as enemies are killed and objectives completed. 'Cutscenes' are very few and far between, minor ones being completely ignorable (just walk away) and major ones not lasting longer than a few minutes (a sparse handful throughout the game with the biggest and the start, middle and ending).\n\nThe combat? A glorious dance of death. Anyone who has been following id Software for some time knows they've put a lot of work into animating their enemies. Say what you will about RAGE, for instance, but the enemies 'danced' around the enviornment in wonderful ways, bouncing off walls, dodging, ducking and weaving about. That animation was built upon heavily in Doom 4. Imps leap up onto walls and hurl fireballs, Hell Knights leap through the air hulk smashing the ground and so on. When you have an arena filled with enemies dodging about as you frantically tear through the map dodging and weaving yourself to find better vantage points you'll realize what modern shooters have been missing for years.\n\nAbout the only negative I can give the single player is the glory kill system. While its not that bad and really doesn't hurt the flow of the game it is a very important component. When your health falls to critical levels in an arena and you have collected all the health pickups? You NEED a glory kill. Completely out of ammo in that arena? Time for a chainsaw kill.\n\nMultiplayer? I'm personally having a lot of fun with it. If you played the Beta and disliked it because of lack of content? You will probably like the full version as there are numerous demons, maps, weapons and customization options available that were not in the Beta. If on the other hand you simply did not like how it played... the full version will not change how you feel. Glad to say that while the game has 'prestiges' (echelons) you do NOT lose any items or customizations so you are looking at 500 levels of customization drops (you get all equipment and weapons by 17)!\n\nSnapMap is a bit disappointing as you can not actually build individual rooms and have to work with presets. There simply is not enough content available and there are questionable assets from single player not given to the player. Why no Cyberdemon or Summoner? Why no Pistol or Chainsaw? Why is only a single tileset available (No Hell tileset!?)? Hopefully as time goes on they add more functionality and content to SnapMap. I am having fun designing a remake of an old Doom campaign but I've had to dramatically lower my expectations for how accurate and true to the original it will be. Forget any sort of accurate remakes of Doom 1 or 2 maps.\n\nAll in all a ton of great content in this package. I really dove into the single player and have had an absolute blast with it and can see myself going back and trying on other difficulties (the collectibles took quite a while to find). The mp wont be for everyone but if you vary your loadouts it can offer a lot of fun. SnapMap has potential and already some imaginative and cool scenarios have been released. No regrets for a day one purchase and I hope you enjoy it too!","May 19","true","139.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","4"

While somewhat repetitive the run and gun gameplay is as satisfying and addictive as ever. Lots of collectibles and challenges will certaly make you replay some levels.\n\nThe Bad: Snapmap, in concept, is a great idea and in fact it does allow the creation of some interesting maps and mechanics. However, the more you mess with it the more you realize how restricted is the editor. It doesn't, in any way, make up for the lack of mod support.\n\nThe Ugly: The MP feel like a completely different game. The mix of a level progression system and loadouts with arena maps and pickups is , in my opinion, one of the worst possible things they could come up with. Demon runes are also terribly unbalanced, specially if you have unlocked the greater demons. It doesn't just feel like a Halo game - it feels like a BAD Halo game.\n\nBut, should you play Doom? Yes. Just don't pay full price for it.\nFor me, the campaign more than makes up for the MP. I can certainly see myself coming back to try the Ultra Nighmare difficulty.","May 24","true","41.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","0"

It took several attempts to open it without the company intros to stop chugging like an 1850's steam engine. I could barely navigate the menu at the 1-2 frames per second I was getting. I sat through the opening of the campaign in hopes that the red symbol was some sort of loading screen, but alas; the local, non-internet based, fully installed CAMPAIGN was chugging along at barely 3 frames per second.

Just after halfway through the campaign you can expect to be fighting many of the highly tough demons at once (though not as extreme as the Serious Sam games) that will require that you be very skillfull and effecient in the way you approach combat. The glory kill (melee) system, although lamented by many, isn't really a problem as it doesn't really break the flow of gameplay. Powerups make a great return to Doom by making certain battles easier, such as being able to decapitate demons with your fists\n\nThe redesign of the demons is just AMAZING. Many of them look and sound creepy as hell (especially the lost souls) and can definitely kill you very quickly if you are not paying attention, especially those pinky demons. The boss fights are not that easy but aren't extremely hard either, its just as simple as shooting at it until it dies and trying not to get killed, like the rest of the gameplay in DOOM 4.\n\nNobody should care about the story (*its a doom game for crying out loud) as it just disrupts the flow whenever there is a story segment with lots of talking.\n\nThe weapons look awesome and feel very satifying to use, except for the starting pistol. There is also a system where you can purchase and upgrade alt-fire modes on certain weapons, such as a triple shotgun burst, or a micro-missile launcher attached to a Machine Gun, which makes the weapons even more fun to use. The Chainsaw is of limited use at times but my god, it is so much fun to use as each evisceration spawns all this ammo and health everywhere. The BFG just destroys everything as it usually does, need I say more?\n\nThe level design returns to the exploration based maze like labryinth of sorts where you are constantly navigating a non-linear path. The game also places an emphasis on finding secrets so you can get the bigger weapons earlier, or getting such goodies like suit upgrades for doomguy or increases to health capacity.  The HUD also includes a compass so you can't really get lost.\n\nThe only qualms I really had with this game was a lack of quicksave function (annoying when finding dangerous secrets) and the music was a bit.. ehh... for my taste.\n\nDespite my rig just barely scraping past the minium requirements, performance was good enough for me to enjoy this beast of a game from start to finish.\n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game to pretty much any FPS nut as it is a wonderful return to form for the Doom franchise after what happened with Doom 3.","May 14","true","28.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

There is really no need to switch from the shotgun once you got the grenade mod for example, the only reason you'll be switching weapons is because a gun got boring or you ran out of ammo (which is like really no issue with the game having monsters spew ammo at you when youre low+ the chainsaw instantly filling you up)\n\nand the monsters, they look really cool and all. Very animated and have a lot of character, you kind of just fight them all the same way, they all act the same in regards to how you fight them. The only enemies I can think of that change the way you want to deal with a situation is the shield zombiemen and pinkies, the only enemies where it might be useful to switch to a gun like the rocketlauncher and detonate a rocket behind them or the plasma rifle and using the stun to disable the zombieman's shield or to allow you to more easily get behind that pinky. Every other critter is just basicly shoot at with the gun you think kills the coolest.\n\nand I dislike this new chainsaw, it's reward with no risk. It's just a way to circumvent an enemy you don't want to fight or instantly refill your prefered weapon.\n\nand the bfg is just a boring room clearer that has none of the interesting nuances that that classic had. Just another way to circumvent a fight that you just wanna blow through. (the thing is also hilarious with the fully mastered ammo rune, almost guarenteeing you'll get a free bfg cell if you blast the thing in a full room making near every arena fight trivial)\n\nThe multiplayer too is like easy trash that makes halo look like UT and snapmap is this really unituitive mess, for sure people have already started making interesting things but god it's unapproachable to me. lol\n\nI got a lot more to say about what i don't like with this game but I guess i'll stop here. lol\n\n\nMan like it's cool that id scrapped the call of doom build of the game and tried making what they thought was more faithful to the originals. I feel that they are all probably fans of the original but had misconceptions of what made those games good and made what is basicly a less creepy and terrible brutal doom.\n\n\nI'll go ahead and give this a recommendation I guess.

The gameplay is great but the game is literally unplayable (right now).\n\nI really like the game itself. It's fun and engaging. I was just recently talking to a friend about games nowadays not having real secret areas like games had 20 years ago. And now D°°M (re)introduced them eventually. Also the weapons upgrades, the whole leveling and powerup-mechanics are really nice. And there are no IAPs (yes, one really has to state that nowadays). There's no in-game currency you can buy outside of the game. Everything needs to be earned by yourself and is not taken from you again.\n\nBut: The game crashes. Not just for me but for a lot (!) of people (just search the web). And it crashes in the badest way possible: Without any error message. Just puts you right back to the desktop. The first three levels where fine but now I'm stuck in the fourth level, having to play from my last save game over and over because the game crashes out of nowhere.\n\nSo what finally has become the most scariest thing of the game are not the enemies but the constant fear of doing something that will make the game crash. This is the worst that could happen to a game and it fully ruined it for me. I've been playing so many games and none of them crashed. I honestly can't remeber the last game that crashed on my system. And this from the company that owned PC game programming.\n\nThat's why I tell my colleagues not to buy Doom and that's why I don't recommend this game. At least not yet.

The gameplay flows perfectly...even the glory kills are incredibly natural and satisfying (and i was very skeptical at first), the atmosphere is incredibile, the graphics and presentation is top notch...but most of all...this game is just fun! I'm really impressed that a game that carries such a big heritage on his shoulders came out this good. You can see clearly that the developers knew exactly what they were doing and knew what the fans wanted. There's a ton of content and replay value in this game (all the secrets, weapon/gear upgrades, snapmap mode ecc...)...not to mention the multiplayer, which i'm really enjoying so far with its modern but also old-school game feel (there's no regenerative health and you have to stay on the move constantly). I kinda wish there were more maps...and maybe if they had a more flashy design... but again, there's a lot of content to love and appreciate in this game and they really did a great job overall.

The graphics for the game are excellent even if you play on medium and low and whether you play on the highest or lowest, you are able to enjoy the game without having issues with low graphics like some games have. The enemies in the game are often tough and annoying at times but the game gives you tips on how to tackle each of the 36 enemies you will face throughout your time in the game.\n\nFrom a campaign point of view, story is a 7, graphics are an 8 and overall feel of the game is a 9.

This game feels amazingly smooth. What a breath of fresh air.\nI've played about 5 hours of the campaign with mouse and keyboard and about 2 hours with an xbox one controller and both ways of playing the game feel great. The single player is out of this world. Action packed with the old rat fighting it's way out of the maze feeling. The level design alone is killer. The levesl have the best of the multiplayer arena feel with the hugeness of the Doom universe. Lock downs are fun and feel satisfying to complete.\nMultiplayer is great as well IF you are in to arena shooters. This isn't CSGO or CoD. It's Doom and it's SO good. I like the little things too, like customization of the player and weapon skins. Maps are great and feel just right. Not to big or small and tend to focus fights through out the arena. Overall, an amazing release when other developers and publishers consistantly put out half completed and borken games. Doom feels like it's polished to a mirror finish.\nThe options are pelentyfull and greatly appreciated. FOV slider/console cmd's worth it's weight in digital gold.\nDang, guys, thanks.

Campaing is good, it's fast with non stop action. Gameplay feels good. Map desing is ok. It's a bit short, if you are quick you can beat it in around 2h. Optimalization is great, on my gtx970 with ultra settings I have 100+fps all the time. There are some things I didn't like; closed areas and enemies coming in waves, that is just bad or that there are only 3 boss fights in whole game.\n\nMultiplayer is garbage. Someone didn't know how to make arena shooter and consoles were main target for this game so we got this pos. Weapons are imbalanced, demons are imbalanced, map design is bad, there is no dm or ctf, everyting feels slow, there are loadouts, you can't pick up enemy weapon, it also have diffrent controls than campaing. The rounds are very short and you have to wait in lobby 90 seconds after every match(wtf?) + 25 seconds after the game loads and another 10 seconds after match ends, that is a huge waste of time for no reason at all. Overall DOOM multiplayer is very bad.\n\nSnapMap is a build in map editor, but due it's big limitations(thanks consoles) it's meh. You have limits for everything you place on the map. You can place around 50 demons in one map and that is just not enough. Same goes for other objects etc. You can make maps for singleplayer, multiplayer or coop. There is also limit of totall 4 players for coop and multi. I can understand that more that 4 ppl in coop mission would be too much, but only 4 ppl for multiplayer?!

What can I say? DOOM is BACK!!!\n\nFirst off... I'd like to start by saying my opinion of the MP in the game: IT IS GREAT!!!\nI seriously DO NOT understand all of the negative comments towards the MP. It is super competitive and feels like it was made for tournament style matches. Aka - serious gamers! It gets your blood pumping, and it satisfies so much more than the last several popular franchises' FPS games that have been released that are just garbage. The fact that your health doesn't regenerate and you can actually run out of ammo (picking up health, armour, and ammo packs from pickups on the map) gives it such a new and fresh edge while also feeling very classic like DOOM should feel. I don't know... I absolutely love it, and so does everyone that I have talked to, except for, apparently, people on Steam...\n\nSo enough about the divide of folks with the MP... Let's touch on the campaign a bit. Again I will say... DOOM IS BACK!!!\n\nI honeslty can't believe they did it... but DOOM has been rebooted, and it delivers something fierce. The graphics, mechanics, customization, and even the story are all spectacular. I don't want to spoil anything, but I can easily say that this is the best SP campaign of any FPS I have played in years, especially since the release of the "next-gen" of gaming. Another aspect of the game that just puts the icing on the cake is the music... METAL AF!!! There are fight scenes/levels that literally got me so pumped that I started screaming with happiness as I mowed down my foes and sent them back to Hell with my chainsaw and arsenal of weapons! You can't stop moving, or you are DEAD!\n\nI could keep going, but instead all I want to say is BUY THIS GAME! There is NO WAY you'll regret it. If you do, you should stop gaming and go read a book...... on how to be a better gamer. Lol. I'm joking. But seriously... Go buy the game.\n\nFIGHT LIKE HELL!","May 16","true","22.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If I had to describe game with only one sentence it would be "This is so oldschool and metal as f*ck".\n\nFirst thing that happens when you press "start new game" is you dropped right in the middle of the game and only thing you see is demons, pistol and space marine suit. So you get your ♥♥♥ (literally, since you wake up naked) in space marine suit and start slaying hell spawn.\n\nI had a a suspicion that sneaky f*cks from Bethesda just made such game intro to appease Doom fans and that it will go back to "modern" standards of gameplay and story. But no, they did it, they made oldschool hardcore shooter that is metal as f*ck, absolute MAD MEN.\n\nNo stupid hand holding, corny story, cutscenes, "modern" gameplay elements like ADS or QTE (press "F" to pay respect). The game is purely oldschool arena shooter. The only "modern" additions are gun mods, which actually completely transform your guns into something else. Like shotgun into grenade launcher, or assault rifle into rocket launcher. So I don't mind it. Adds lot of variety.\n\nLast things - secrets are back, rooms that lead to "Classic Doom" levels and other bonuses, like access to powerful weapons before normal progression, like getting Double Barrel shotgun way before you normally would stumble upon it.\n\nAnyway, from just play 6 hours, game is top notch. I would recommend it to both people who grew up in the 90s with shooters like Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein, as well as people who just got tired of "modern shooters" formula and want to try something different.","May 15","true","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

GET IT!\n\nOn top of graphics quality, it's easy to achieve + maintain. I use a single factory-clocked GTX 960, and manage practically Ultra on 1080p (Working on 4k). I had to turn 2 things down 1 notch to achieve my 60 fps, but other than that, Ultra on 1080p.\n\nGameplay is another aspect that is really well done. It may seem boring watching other people play and uneventful except for the occasional demon hoardes you run into, but trust me, it flows.\n\nStoryline is done pretty similarly to the Ultimate DOOM's, but slightly better explained and characters (besides yourself) have names.\n\nLast thing to brag about is how much tribute it pays to the older DOOM series. It follows the storyline,  has the throwback secret rooms , and uses almost the exact same guns.\n\nThe only thing there is to complain about here is multiplayer. Take COD and HALO, they make a baby, that kid becomes acquaintances with DOOM, and then is brothers with Quake. In a nutshell, not DOOM. I absolutely hate the multiplayer.

This will sound outlandish--far from conciliatory--but it is true for me (even as someone that grew up playing the original Doom as shareware):\n\nThis feels more like Doom than the original does.\n\nThis release incorporates the essence of what defined the original, and works out a personality so strong that makes it feel like this is what Doom was meant for all along.  The design is smart and masterful, and the movement and gunplay is so smooth and interesting--all without weighing down what made Doom so great in the first place.  It's just so naturally fun, there's no room to even think about it.  The campaign just gets better and better the further in... it's really impressive, and has no right to be this great, but here we are.

Seriously, I hope you are making a sequel, because only few FPS games in the past few years were as entertaining, gory and fun to play as your DooM.\nGameplay? Gunplay is fluid, smooth and precise. Health packs, armors, ammo, no regeneration, quad damage, challenges, secrets... it´s all there as you remember. The level design is what praised my gamer soul the most. No linear ♥♥♥♥, lot of vertical maps and dark corners. I love it. Yeah and chainsaw FTW!\nGraphics? Overall atmosphere is awesome. If you look on the textures from a small vicinity, it´s not as sharp as you would expect, but the overall impression is splendid.\nSound? If you would have your eyes blinded, you would still know exactly who is attacking and what gun you are using. Great work sound guys!\nMusic?	 Metal gory hell with infernal vocals. Master Eploder lvl 9000\nStory? It´s there.\n\nI can´t even express how glad I am that new Doom is so awesome, polished, well optimized and FUN to play. It´s nothing like Doom 3 (although I liked D3). This is really a throwback to the times when FPS was about speed, fast fingers and will to beat that last mofo boss. And then to start the game again on higher difficulty. I know I will.\nIf you are a long time FPS fan who like Quake, Shadow Warrior, Wolfenstein etc ... you will be everything but dissapointed.\n\n9/10 (I would love to have 2 or 3 levels more with more bosses)","May 17","true","21.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The glory kill is a very brutal execution that finishes off a staggared demon and drops extra health, I was skeptical about this first but after performing the first one I enjoyed them because the animation was one quick fluent movement that didnt take up too much time. This game is SUPER brutal if you have read other reviews, it is completely over the top which is why I like it alot with some of the simple touches of gore to outright ripping demons in half.\n\nThe campaign was brilliant, the story was easy to follow and understandable with most of it being told through holograms which if the player wanted could just run past and completely ignore. The game onnly forces you into cutscenes or dialogue during critical moments so that you actually understand the story. Doomguy once again was a complete badass as always, once again not caring about anything else except from shooting and killing every single thing related to hell he could find. He isnt invincible however and this adds to the brutality, you dont simply die in doom as most of the time the demon responsible will perform a proper and extremely brutal execution on you which adds a nice touch because you begin to feel what doomguy feels, and this once again captures one of the classic dooms effects. Another thing about the campaign I loved was what happened when you picked up a new gun, doomguy would examine the gun slowely like it was one of his old friends and another nice touch to this was depending on where the gun was found it could be immaculate or covered in blood.\n\nMultiplayer will be the next focus of this review, its not nearly as good as the campaign and more as an extra to the game. However I still had alot of fun with it and dont fully understand the hate towards it, its a very hard job to cater towards the old and the new simultaneously and get it perfect. I think ID did an alright job of it with loadouts being one of the only things that was close to the new, you had to find health via kills or drops on the map along with armor. The scrabbles to get to the powerups and superweapons made the game never feel "safe", I was in one game where the enemy team was thrashing us by 50 points, next thing you know my teams picked up Quad damage, the BFG and the demon rune and we pull it back and win. The demon rune is just way to much fun, upon collecting it you will transform into a demon you selected and run riot, the demons you could select are as follows: The revenant which is a skeletal demon with a jetpack armed with dual rocket launchers able to bring death from above, The mancubus which is the tank demon as he has a ton of hp and is armed with grenade launchers to shoot at any unfortunate soul, The prowler which is the stealthy demon of the lot as he has much less hp than the others but posseses the ability to pounce and hang from walls and if a marine gets caught during the pounce upon colliding with a wall will die, and my personal favourite The Baron of hell, this guy is a huge demon with above average HP who only exists to run around tearing every single marine limb from limb. In my opinion the multiplayer isnt that bad and will help to keep you occupied for a longer amount of time without too much boredom, although I have only one complaint. The chaingun, this weapon should be a super weapon as it shreds the demons hp and anyone else without a power up can die before they even register the chainguns shooting them. It revs to full speed almost immediatly making it extremely powerful and killing the wielder relies on him not having any armour which is rare.\n\nSnapmap is a very cool feature in DOOM, modding is a very complex and hard thing to do but Snapmap allows a player with no experience to create a map with relative ease, it is quite easy to grasp and its tools allow some really interesting ideas to flourish. There isn't much else to say about Snapmap although it will keep you occupied for a good amount of time wheather you are building a map or playing on those being recommended.\n\nTo conclude this review I would severely recommend DOOM to anyone wanting an FPS that doesnt focus on story but more on the aspect of making sure the player has fun and enjoys the game to its max. You start off at first against imps and the variety of demons increases at the same time as your aresenal, as the developer said "You take one step on the ladder and the demons take one step". The games difficulty and upgrades progresses at a nice rate and the areas are built for combat allowing for some creative strategies when engaging the hell spawn.","June 6","true","44.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I feared id would continue down the path they took in Doom 3 with dark rooms and corridors, jump scares and a game not in line with the previous installments regarding atmosphere. I didn't mind the darkness so much in Doom 3, I just didn't think it was the right way to go with a Doom game.\n\nIn this new Doom game, the levels a brightly lit, the action is fast paced and fluid and your adrenaline is flowing.\n\nThis is what Doom 3 should have been!\n\nThe level design is fairly non-linear (at least compared to other shooters out there), but with some of the same backtracking we used to do in the original Doom and Doom 2.\n\nThe enemies are fun, diverse and nicely modelled and animated.\n\nThe weapon and suit upgrading system is fun and encourages exploration and experimentation. The map challenges are some minor goals you can do to earn a few extra upgrading points, but your main source comes from clearing the maps for enemies. This means that casual players can just run through the campaign, yet still earn upgrades. The Rune trials you eventually encounter are yet another way of customizing playstyle and upgrading your character.\n\nThe soundtrack also helps to make combat fun and engaging.\n\nSo, there's a lot to explore and fun stuff to do! I like it!\n\nThere's even classic Doom maps to unlock and play with the new enemies and weapons, but with the classic graphics everywhere else.\n\nMy only minor complaint so far is regarding secrets. In early levels, the game lets you backtrack to all areas so you can explore and search for secrets in peace. However, soon enough you will encounter doors that lock the way behind you so you can't go back and look for missed secrets until you finish the level. I've never been a fan of this in any game. If a game have secrets and collectibles, please enable the player to go back and search for them if he/she missed some.\n\nI have not played multiplayer.

I've descended into hell in the game, and honestly its terribly gloomy and creepy, not that I imagined it would be pleasant. The campaign has little plot but thats probably already obvious and I dont know if anyone was even really expecting one, at least aside from fighting like hell.\n\nAfter playing through this for about 20 hours or so, Ive come to a point where I dont necessarily regret my purchase, but I am not thrilled with the game. With that said, Im an RPG fan and usually enjoy games with depth or a good story, I just bought this because of the legacy of Doom and that whole new appeal games have when they first release. The gameplay is shallow; at least if your expecting or looking for something meaningful or whatnot. This is a run and gun shooter at its core, and the game engine and gameplay succeed with that, not many games nowadays can successfully make a fun run and gunner.\n\nThe graphics and performance are good, Im on a gaming laptop I purchased a year ago (a bit aging hardware) and I can play on medium HD res. at around 30+ FPS. Looks great, runs great. Multiplayer I will not be commenting on as I do not play competetive online games, and have yet to even touch it. From what Ive heard many are dissapointed but to me I could care less if it was amazing or not, either way I wouldnt play it.\n\nSnapmap is... Dissapointing for me. I was expecting a Far Cry-like map editor which was unrealistic because this is a shooter that takes place in corridors hallways and cramped internal structures. Even in the more open area of Hell it still is compact and feels cramped. So sprawling maps arent exactly doable in a game like this. But for a dungeon crawler type shooter, the Snapmap is great, lots of corridors and rooms. Its basically just snapping rooms together then populating the maps with enemies and guns, and there are some unique gameplay modifiers that make powerful options at open ended gameplay, ive seen ridiculous stuff like raccoon simulator maps and farming/settlement type gameplay maps, where you feed your demons and upgrade your equipment.\n\nOverall if you arent expecting more than non stop hellish action, then great buy it. At $60 it can be hard for it to feel totally worth the cash when compared to other games released recently, at least if your not a huge FPS fan. If your an RPG fan like me who has played/enjoyed Fallout 4, Witcher 3 etc, then this will not feel complete. Its impossible to compare this to any of those I mentioned but obviously these type games arent my favorite, but even then its still fun and I decided to play past the original 2 hours and pass on a refund.","May 13","true","34.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

It feels right, it has the right atmosphere and gameplay, it's Doom, in the sense of Doom 1/2, with a touch of Doom 3.\n\nWeapons look and feel powerful, player movement suits the singleplayer experience fine, despite being mostly identical to the multiplayer movement. (More on movement later.)\nLike previous Doom games, you can carry and switch between your full arsenal of weapons in a moment, as suits the situation you find yourself in.\n\nMelee glorykills are a bit forced; you can't really practically avoid them as gameplay is balanced heavily around them(they cause ammo and health drops as well as offer momentary invulnerability that you often need. You also warp instantly from your lockon point to your glorykill point, making it the fastest means of moving between two nearby places in a map. The game could have done just fine without them. That said, they suit the Berserk powerup perfectly.\n\nThe monster designs are all well done, stylistically. Everything is either heavily inspired by Doom 1/2 in a good way, or redesigned well.\n\nThe game doesn't pull punches with difficulty; I'm a long time Doom player, and I've died several times going through on Ultra Violence difficulty.\n\nThere are a lot of upgrades, for weapons, armour, and abilities.  They work well for what the game is.\n\nMultiplayer\n=============\n\nNow, multiplayer is another story... Google how the Multiplayer Open Beta was received on Steam. ("One of the worst games ever made by Id/Bethesda" will probably come up.) The release version of multiplayer is functionally unchanged from the open beta. It's awful, and so painfully dumbed down.\n\nMovement, ignoring some of the singleplayer ability upgrades(a glaringly absent one being air control) is the same as in singleplayer. However, where it works fine in singleplayer, it's a bad fit for multiplayer, as human players do not move or aim like half a dozen AI monsters surrounding the player do, which makes things feel incredibly slow and inflexible. Anyone used to faster games like Doom 1/2, Quake, or Unreal Tournament, will hate how Doom 2016 moves in multiplayer.\n\nWeapons in multiplayer feel terrible. They've got the same visual and audio effects as in singleplayer... Except their damage has been reduced to pitiful levels. (A direct hit by a rocket, instead of blowing apart several nearby monsters in a single hit, instead does 50 damage. Splash damage from a rocket does even less.)\n\nMultiplayer also uses weapon loadouts; so there's no attempt to control a map based on where item pickups are, instead every player chooses 2 weapons of choice to spawn with. You can't carry more than 2, either, so switching weapons in a contextually-appropriate manner results in just switching back and forth between your two weapons. It's brain damaged, in comparison to how prior Id Software games have functioned, and how Doom 2016's singleplayer functions.\n\nMelee glorykills are present in multiplayer. And they feel very out of place, as execution animations inevitably do in multiplayer games. Yes, they're faster than most games implement them as, but they're very disruptive to gameplay, and result most often in someone being super-shotgunned for 80 damage, then their opponent instantly warping to them in a glorykill animation to instantly finish them. It's extremely repetitive.\n\nThe Demon Rune is an interesting mechanic, but it's not really balanced very well, with a competent Demon player frequently racking up dozens of kills, making it impossible for the other team to recover. (Also, there's no non-team-based multiplayer, no classic deathmatch. What's up with that?)\n\nThe superweapon available in multiplayer, the Gauss Cannon, is uninspired and boring. Doom without the BFG is a sad thing. (The BFG is present in singleplayer.) Though given how badly the weapons feel in multiplayer, I'd not be surprised if the BFG was limited to doing small amounts of damage to players, rather than being the room-cleaner it's known for being.\n\nMultiplayer, if anything, feels like a Halo game. Which makes sense, since Id outsourced the multiplayer development of Doom 2016 to a company called Creative Assembly, who happens to have a history of making Halo games. Clearly they're a one-trick-pony. It's unfortunate that multiplayer in Doom 2016 has been ruined by this decision.\n\nFinally, the announced DLC appears (So far!) to be multiplayer content only. Which is a waste of time/money. Especially since the announced DLC also includes paid maps, which means if you don't buy the DLC, you won't be able to play with players who have, so it will likely split the multiplayer playerbase, reducing the available players to play with.\nThere are also apparently some paid DLC weapons and Demons coming, so that's giving a further advantage of people who pay for it. I don't particularly expect the online scene for Doom 2016 to last more than 6 months. Given Doom 1/2 multiplayer is still played more than 20 years after their release, this is a crying shame. (Or rather, it would be, if Doom 2016 multiplayer wasn't an awful gameplay experience anyway. Which is an even bigger shame.)\n\n=============\n\nThere is no cooperative mode in the singleplayer campaign.\n\nSnapMap is a dumbed down editor included with Doom 2016. If you're used to making maps or mods with real tools, it's a frustrating, childishly bad experience with severe limitations. If you've never mapped or modded an FPS game, and you think you'd like to try, maybe SnapMap is for you, though be aware you're still going to be pretty limited in what you can create.\n(Don't get me wrong, making mapping and modding easier for people to get into is a Good Thing. It's just it shouldn't come at the expense of crippling the possibilities there.)\n\nAll in all, if you're considering Doom 2016, remember this:\n\nSingleplayer is good.\n\nMultiplayer is very bad.\n\nIf you want to play it, play it for the singleplayer. And I recommend it for the singleplayer exclusively.

Which is always nice to see unlike other games where you are sitting at a cinematic for half an hour.\n\nThe most prominent factor of this game is the gore, if you love heads exploding horns being torn off and just in general making demons punching bags then this is the game for you. Throughout the whole of the game you are thrown into thrilling battles with only one goal, to kill everything you see, also there's no denying that the music is freaking awesome, during every battle you will be bombarded with heavy metal music which adds to the adrenaline of the fights. There's nothing like using a chainsaw and ripping apart your enemies while there's some amazing soundtracks in the background.\n\nIn this title you can clearly see the effort the devs have put in to make all of the guns look like killing machines which adds to the excitement and thrill of the game, all of the models have a neat finish and have the feel of sheer awesomness.\n\nThe campaign in my opinion was very good and i enjoyed it alot, but the multiplayer i feel has alot more potential, at the minute there's not a big variety of weapons that players are able to pick from, the result of this you get people who run around with rocket launchers and shotguns, although that is a downfall of the game i can't deny that being the baron of hell and running around tearing people in half isn't fun.\n\nSo even though this game has some multiplayer flaws i would highly advise getting this title, when i first got this game i had really high expectations and DOOM most certainly smashed straight through those expectations and went over and beyond. Basically if you love killing demons listening to intense music and finding easter eggs this is the game for you.","May 15","true","16.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

I had trouble shooting at the varying demons on their first appearances because I was, more often than not, taken by how damn awesome their new designs were. Again, the developers stayed true to the original dooms.\n\nGame is bug free - I LITERALLY HAD ZERO BUGS! I beat the game in just over 12 hours and never, not once, did I experience anything close to a freaking GLITCH. No graphical errors, no clipping issues. NOTHING. Even when creatures die they stay plugged into the physics of the game until their corpses turn to ash and blow away. I just couldnt believe I didnt find anything and I explored EVERYTHING.\n\nGame is FUN! - I remember reading an article that Bethesda put out talking about how they want people to play agressively and that the game awards a gameplay style that is mobile and in the enemies face. If you sit behind a corner and camp, or try to play like its a Call of Duty fps, you will die. This game is all about moving, using the terrain, and all the tools the game gives you to bring the demons of hell to their KNEES.\n\nThe Game and gameplay make you feel like a BAMF - The game literally FEEDS your ego by talking you up and basically reinforcing the idea that YOU, THE DOOM MARINE, are the demon that the denizens of hell tell scary stories about around campfires. Unfortunately for them, you are very real! The glory killing system has you literally wade through your enemies pulling them apart and just leaving you looking for the next demon to tear apart with your bare hands! (sometimes your hands are all you need!)\n\nTHE GAME IS A REWARDING CHALLENGE! - The boss fights were AWESOME. The game constantly pits you against waves upon waves of demons as you get further into the game. It also seems like the game scaled my exposure to the waves quite well. It never felt like i was in an impossible situation. The entire combat arena could be swarming, and i mean like 20-25 guys staring at me trying to kill me and the only thing going through my mind was..."Im killing that one first" and then you charge!\n\nItem collection was a pleasure! - Alot of times you get games that basically give you the "option" of finding little treasure troves around the various levels with usually an achievement or a journal notation to reward you with. How does Doom award you for doing this? IT TRIES TO KILL YOU OF COURSE! You want to find every little secret on the map? Squeeze every upgrade you can? Get ready for puzzles, get ready for ambushes, get ready for challenges! How exactly are you rewarded? Well you become a far more capable killing machine of course! Going for all the unlocks in the game takes time but they are all interconnected with various "completion" based sub-objectives that further reward you for your diligence. Ultimately allowing you to stay ahead of the game with the best equipment and upgrades you could possibly have which you ARE GOING TO NEED!\n\nI havent touched the multiplayer or snapmap yet because im probably gonna amp the difficulty up to its max setting and give it a go.\n\nI highly recommend this game - the last time I felt this good about an fps game, I was on the Pillar of Autumn and my rank was Master chief.\n","May 14","true","17.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I have a powerful system, but I didn't expect a brand new game that looks so amazing to run so incredibly fast. And it's not just bells and whistles, the game is stupendously fun. Monsters are really challenging and it again feels like old Doom games. No more individual demons here and there like in Doom 3, they are still there, but most of the time it's crazy battle within a map segment filled with demons. You have to constantly move and kill. It's the only way not to die. Especially if you play on Nightmare like I am. Incredibly unforgiving but still fun. Combat is really engaging and amazing, especially thanks to tons of weapons and what's new and unexpected in a Doom game, Preator suit and weapons upgrades with rune powers. By playing, killing and finding secrets you upgrade yourself and weapons to be a better killing machine. And while most would think such thing just wouldn't work in a Doom game, it totally does. It's brilliant and most upgrades for weapons are designed to deliver more boom, only few are sort of tactical oriented like scoped railgun and scoped heavy machinegun (both optional, you can opt for more firepower mods). Suit upgrades are more for movement and world awareness. But it's all so well designed it's really awesome.\n\nAnyway, I could go on and on how awesome it is, but it's really one of the best games this year. It really is. It looks great, it's incredibly fun and captures that Doom feel from the 90's, but in new refreshing form. A proper franchise reboot, something we don't often see with floods of crappy reboots. This one is properly badass like Doom should be. I can only recommend it!","May 15","true","43.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I have watched a lot of gameplay of the OG Doom, though. I expected this game to be as gripping as the Bethesda walkthrough, and very hellish (of course.) I was  skeptical after seeing beta reactions, but I bit the bullet.\n\nInitial reaction -\n\nI was first blown away by the visuals. This is definitely a top-notch game for 2016. We know that it has Vulcun support coming, which will be amazing. I am running the game with a GTX Titan X on a 1440p, 144hz screen at max settings. I was only getting 60fps (could tell by the mouse) but I do believe it was from the graphics settings, as the game does have an unlocked frame rate. The game is much more stable than The Witcher 3, and even GeForce Experience (LOL.) There are basic menu options, so it's easy to use.\n\nMovement -\n\nThis game is fast. It's not as fast as Unreal Tournament 4, but it's fast. A long bunny-hop chain in CS:GO could describe this game's speed accurately. I tried bunny-hopping in this game but I can't tell if it was faster than running or not. Your character can vault up legdes really easily.\n\nLevel Design -\n\nThis is one of my complaints. They levels are very large in certain areas. There is a lot of verticallity to the game, which is interesting. There are "blue" and "yellow" keys that you need to obtain from dead characters to unlock doors. This is my issue. I spent a solid 15-20 minutes searching the entire level for one background-blending corpse. There was no marker on the map for it and it was just a waste of time. It's a good mechanic, but it can get annoying. Also, you need to open almost every door that you pass manually (at least to unlock it.) The terminals to do so look alot like the un-useable terminals so it can be confusing at times.\n\nGameplay -\n\nI played this game on the standard, medium difficulty. You gradually build up your arsenal of weapons as you progress. As you get more weapons and upgrades, (you can choose different alternate fire modes for each weapon i.e frag rounds or choked burst for a shotgun) there are more enemies that get more challenging. I sort of felt like I abused the "Glory Kill" mechanic. All you have to do is get any enemy down to low health and you will incapacitate them. You can just walk up to them and "Press F to pay respects" their asses and mutilate them. From doing that, you will get more drops vs a normal kill. I did this very often. With the chainsaw, you get a TON of ammo. You can insta-kill bosses with it if you have enough fuel. All of the enemies are really different - attacks, health, speed, etc. are all really well balanced.\n\nStory -\n\nFrom what I can tell so far, it's another reboot of the original Doom's plot. From what I've read about Doom 3 this game seems to have a very similary story so far. I have not finished the story yet so I will update when I finish it.\n\nSummary -\n\nI think this is a very solid Doom game, and my first. I love it and I always feel like a god. The art style is great and you are always moving. 9.4/10 - It's fun, gripping, and immersive.\n\nTL;DR -\n\nPros:\n+Graphics\n+Stability\n+Style\n+Level Design\n+Movement\n+Enemies\n\nCons:\n-Blue and yellow key-cards are not easy to find in some cases\n-Melee is overpowered, most of my kills are from melee because it is easy to spam and gives a ton of loot","May 12","true","132.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

I have played DOOM since 1993 and still play and make maps to this day for the originals. So my review is based on how it it as a reboot to the series, and how it pits itself against modern FPS games.\n10/10 for the Single Player.\n\nThe weapon system is awesome, choosing what upgrades to use, when you want to use them, switching between each weapon flawlessly and quick feels so fluid.\n\nThe monsters are designed beautifuly, including the bosses who are heaps better than what DOOM 3 had to offer, anytime I would see the "Arch Vile" (Summoner) I would actually go into panic mode as it was the only monster that I had issues with.\n\nThe enviroments are absolutely beautiful and detailed as hell.\n\nThe music is badass and fantastic, the OST needs to be released, I would happily pay money for it.\n\nThe action is actually extremely fast paced in SP and a blast. There wasn't a dull moment in DOOM that I could find.\n\nThe optimization for this game too is amazing, only running a 950m and i7-4720HQ and can play this game flawlessly. 30 ish FPS on medium, and 45ish FPS on low. (Yes I know time for an upgrade but building a PC when the 1080 comes out.)\n\nI loved this game so much I bought it twice, once for PC and once for PS4.\n\nMultiplayer 7/10\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the multiplayer, i've had a blast with it. But I personally didn't think it lets itself up to be what it could have been. Loadouts, and game speed are the killer for me. Other than that, the multiplayer is great, tons of stuff to unlock, badass armour to equip, and running a match where you absolutely dominate just feels so great. The demon runes too are a blast to play as, as well. But all in all, besides Demon Runes, the multiplayer doesn't offer too much new ideas. Still fun though. (Biasm due to obsession with DOOM as a whole may be included in this multiplayer review.)\n\nSnapMaps 5/10 hopefully 9/10 in the coming months, and 7/10 if you don't know how to or never will mod.\n\nAs of right now, Snapmaps is a boring, useless tool, and I don't see many great things come of it... yet...\n\n12 monster limit, bugs in the logic (weird bugs.), limited things about the way you can build maps, and the presets are boring as hell. Spent 2 full days making a map, and probably won't ever make a map again. If I only got the game on PS4, I probably would rate it higher as it is a wonderful map editor for console. But for PC, it is ♥♥♥♥. Doom needs true modding support, and there should be way less limitations on snapmap for PC. Plus no boss monsters on snapmap? Disappointing. Although ID/Bethesda plan to release a lot more content for snapmap, I don't see it ever becoming a replacement for modding support. However for people who can't or never will pick up modding it will be great for you. Also the menu's for navigating snapmap maps is a mess right now, with the same content appearing on the front page all the time.\n\nThere is work that needs to be done for snapmaps at the moment. A lot of work.\n\nMy 4th and final critisicm of the game is no modding support as said above. Hopefully someone can find a way to make modding possible, but as of right now I don't see that happening for a long time.\n\nAs for DLC, if all they plan to release is multiplayer related DLC and snapmap related DLC, I think they are going in the wrong direction. The fans (from what i've seen and including myself) want Singleplayer DLC.\n\nOther than that here's a recap.\n\nSingleplayer: 10/10\nMultiplayer: 7/10\nSnapmaps 5/10, 7/10, 9/10?\n\nThe Singleplayer experience alone trumps the MP and snapmaps enough that I highly, highly recommend it to anyone who likes FPS games/ DOOM games/ or action games.\n\nPS. If you love Devil May Cry, or DMC, you will find this game right at home for you.","May 24","true","19.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","8","12","4","1"

The graphics are a mix of mostly Doom 3's dark atmosphere and a few of the old Doom's colourful enemies. The only thing I didn't like as much as the rest was the design of a few of the enemies, like the cyberdemon which looks like it comes straight out of a Blizzard title, but that's just a very minor flaw.\n\nTechnically, the game is also very good. The environments look great, indoor as well as outdoor. The enemies are extremely detailed and wonderfully animated. The framerate is stable at 60 (GTX 970, 16GB RAM, i5-4690K) and the loading times are not even noticable on my SSD. The only flaw is that the game crashed 2 times so far.\n\nI can recommend this to old and new FPS fans alike, it's just great.","May 14","true","85.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The singleplayer is SUPER strong. Fun, fast, brutal, loads of guns and a decent story telling with big rewards if you explore. You're a badass, go kill some monsters. The storyline wont tell you everything, but you'll collect info while playing and decide for yourself if you want to read the story in detail. I like that, give the player a choice to read it all or leave it be. The game is also remarkable well optimized. I was amazed at how good the game looked with 8gb ram, a bad graphic card (GeForce GTX 560Ti) and no SSD hdd. It still runs smooth on 30-60fps after the loading, witch is nothing more than amazing.\n\nOver to multiplayer. It's not that great imo. It's fast, but messy and it just don't give me the same awesome feeling of being a badass. It looks a lot like a version of unreal tournament tbh, with the twist. And some of the modes was not that fun. The melee instant kill range also seems to be really long. It's possible to do a finish move from far away.\n\nAnyway, to sum it up. If you want a singleplayer shoot'em up game that's made of awesomeness, buy this. It will be worth it if you enjoy the old school doom style. If you want a multiplayer game, this will probably be a dissapointment.","May 25","true","17.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

Then you must be thinking why are there so many hates towards doom maybe because CoD infinite war is going to flop!? Who knows anyway from the campaign I really like the weapon upgrading stuff and the chainsaw and the glory kill animation. Itd not limited you can glory kill your enemies at any part (not that one 😎)\n\nAlso snapmap is very cool feature I've been doing training right now but I've found really amazing stuffs.\n\nSo far I didn't got time on mp I'll surely try it.\n\nSo collecting all points we have -\n\n1) Really good graphics\n2) Awesome weapons and their punchy sound\n3) Smooth like a butter\n4) Fast like a bike\n5) Doing glory kill are very impressive\n6)  Snapmap is great. It is also cross platform if you didn't knew that.\n\nSo far I can tell this game is really great I personally vote this game to be GOTY and my rating for this game will be 96/100. Now if you are wondering why 96 because ive suffered heavy experience issues at start and some graphical problem at 980ti. So meh this game is perfect.\n\nI've been playing doom since 2002 and I really like this DOOM (2016).\n\nAnd it really feels classic with key cards and bunch of other things too.\n\nDo this will be the end of my review hope you'll join me in Hell\nCheers have a good day.","May 12","true","110.9"," 65 of 123 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","65","123","3","0"

This is Doom.\n\nThe campaign does everything right that the multiplayer (and Doom 3) did wrong. This is the classic Doom experience dropped into the excellent id Tech 6 engine while still preserving the rules/gameplay that defined the original. Modern updates to the formula, such as weapon/suit upgrades, serve only to enhance the core experience rather than re-defining it. Anyone for whom Doom was a formulative gaming experience will quickly fall back into the rhythm here, while those who cut their teeth on Halo/COD might feel like fish out of water temporarily but will fall in quickly with a bit more investment.\n\nGameplay is fast and furious with the original Doom "glide" in full effect. No reloads, no cover shooting, this is a game that rewards aggression and constant forward momentum. That would be a problem if the engine/mechanics didn't support it, but the movement and shooting are as tight as any arena shooter in recent memory. The new execution mechanics fit perfectly into the aggressive/fast gameplay style, and along with the chainsaw (which generates ammo) incentivize a pace that comes as a breath of fresh air after a decade of duck-and-reload shooters.\n\nBottom line, if you have any fondness for the early PC FPS era or you want to try out a new experience that feels significantly different from other modern shooters, you can pick up Doom without concern that it throws the baby out with the bathwater. This is a labor of 90s-era FPS love, and you can feel it every time you shotgun an imp and then explode its head with your bare hands.","May 13","true","17.3"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","19","34","4","0"

The game knows it's an over-the-top action shooter about demons from hell, and it has FUN with it. You're constantly moving, as are the enemies, and it's the closest singleplayer FPS has ever come to reminding me of the old Quakeworld days of frantic movement, jumping around, shooting in mid-air, and so on.\n\nThe levels are full of hidden stuff, and generally there are very few points-of-no-return in each level (with the end-of-level being an obvious thing you have to explicitly trigger), meaning you can search for secrets through the level until you find them. The map and optional upgrades (in a light RPG system) can also help you locate secrets, or most of them at least.\n\nI was sceptical about adding things like execution moves, double-jump and ledge-grabbing to Doom but having now played it, it all works and fits into the mechanics surprisngly well. (Executions are useful as they give you a little bonus health and ammo, for the small risk of having to get close to the enemy in time, although you need not get _that_ close. They're over very quickly, and if you really don't like them then you simply never push the button that does them and you'll never do them.)\n\nSnapMap looks interesting, in terms of providing various types of extra maps and game modes you (and other players if you wish) can drop into, and make yourself. I haven't played with it much though, and it's early days in terms of seeing what other people can create.\n\nI have no idea what the multiplayer is like as I have not tried that yet. After years of playing nothing but Quakeworld and then Counter-Strike, and later CoD:MW2, I try to avoid multiplayer as it can end up eating up so much time, and never ends. This was all about single-player fo rme, and the game has delivered well beyond expectations.\n\nHighly recommended if you enjoy shooting demons in the face and searching multi-level, intricate levels for hidden stuff.\n\nRuns and looks great on Ultra/1080p on my lowly GTX 960 (4GB). While it cannot quite maintain 60fps all the time, it's pretty close to it, and the adaptive v-sync means I rarely even notice. (Maybe the really well done motion blur helps as well? I don't consciously notice it is there, but it's very visible in still screenshots.)","May 15","true","51.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am playing in max settings(ultra) in 1440p with a GTX980 4GB and an i7 4790k CPU and the optimisation is amazing throughout my 20+ hours of gameplay iv maintained 60+ FPS.\n\nSingle player campaign\nThe main story of the game takes roughly around 10-13 hours to complete depending on if your looking for collectibles/secrets. The story evolves around Mars and Mars installations and eventually takes you to hell where the entire game world such as textures, lighting etc look beautiful. Along with amazing heavy metal guitar music and hordes of demons to kill with plenty or weaponry and executions in the form of glory kill.\n\nMulitplayer\nThe multiplayer is fun and addicting with plenty of armor and weapons customisation to choose from. Their are multiple game modes to play and although fun for a short time on your own I can very easily play the PvP side of it all day long in a group of friends.  The multiplayer reminds me of Halo but on a smaller arena and old school based scale featuring health/ammo and armor pickups aswell as powerups and special weapons.\n\nButhowever Bethesda need to sort the servers out as I have noticed even though they are dedicated multiplayer servers a few players lagging or disconnecting due to poor connection. Hopefully they will let us select our region in a future update to ensure we aren't connecting with Americans when were in the EU and vice versa.\n\nSnapmap\nSnapmap from what I can tell is a custom editing mode for creating your own maps or game modes. I have no interest in playing this but if I do I will update my review on what I think of it.\n\nOverall Verdict\nDoom is a remarkable game full of carnage, blood and guts, amazing music and hordes of demons in a truly excellent single player and multiplayer experience.\n\nBUY DOOM NOW!!\n\n8/10 - Would be a 9 if they fix the connection issues in multiplayer.\n\nDoom gets a big fat thumbs up from.","May 18","true","34.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Devil of The Shooters. Id software have definitely taken it up a notch with this game being added to the category of First Person Shooters. Its fast, its bloody, its gory and most of all, its ♥♥♥♥ing fun.\n\nCampaign	The campaign starts off pretty exciting and definitely with a bang. Already from the first few seconds you start the campaign you are thrown into a massive battle, fighting off demons. You play as a lone DOOM Marine whos mission is to close the portal that connects the human world and the demon world. Your objective is simple, kill every demon that you put your eyes on. No more to it.\n\nThe campaign has lots of highlights and it will keep you playing for a long time. From the start you will be handed a few different difficulties that you can choose from, and they have definitely thought of every type of player here. Like to relax and chill while killing off demons easily? How about you try the "Im too young to die difficulty" (easy)?. Like to keep the game balanced, relax and play while at the same time staying alert? Give the "Hurt me plenty"(normal) difficulty a chance. Do you fancy yourself a challenge? Go for the "Nightmare"(hardcore) mode that will give you the chills and lots to be scared about. Got balls of steel? Go for the "Ultra-nightmare mode" (Extremely hardcore) that takes nightmare mode, and adds permadeath to it? What more could you want?\n\nFurthermore, the campaign features classic DOOM gameplay. Pick up weapons, go to the next room, slaughter everyone, and pick up more awesome weapons. The campaign will last you a minimum of 13 hours depending on which difficulty you play on, if you search for secrets, do challenges, do every rune trial etc. A really cool feature I find in the campaign are the mods that you can add to your weapons. When you explore around the world of DOOM you will find small robots holding a package. When you access this package you will get a menu of the weapons that you have, and available mods that you can add to them. For each weapon (except the pistol) have 2 mods that you can choose from. You can also upgrade your characters armor, health and amount off ammo that can be carried. In addition, you will get coins that you can use to upgrade the mods that you have added to your weapons. There is also these praetor tokens that you can pick up, that you can use to upgrade your praetor suit.\n\nThe campaign is lengthy and adds a whole bunch of craziness and fun to the game. There is nothing more satisfying than slaughtering dozens of demons while listening to good, metal music. The campaign easily gets a 10/10.\n\nMultiplayerThe multiplayer is a damned masterpiece. I have played the multiplayer so much that the campaign still stands unfinished. You start up the multiplayer as a level 1 newbie and from there you start by building yourself up. At first you start off with 3 premade loadouts, but as you progress and level up you will unlock more custom loadouts that will allow you to find your own, unique playstyle. You get to choose from 2 weapons + a gadget. The weapons range from the chaingun, to the super-shotgun, combat shotgun, vortex rifle and more! Every weapon has its own pros and cons and most of the weapons are great to use depending on how you like to play.\n\nIn the multiplayer you will be able to choose from 6 different gamemodes. From the classic team deathmatch all the way to "freeze tag". Some gamemodes are known to every one, others have a little twist to it that adds to the fun. Each gamemode is unique and requires a different approach, however the game rewards you for being quick, aggressive and of course playing the objective. The multiplayer feels well polished and a lot of time has been put into balancing it. It features hack modules that basically are small powerups at the start of each round that will give you some sort of bonus that you can use to your advantage when playing. These hack modules are very well made and bring a balance to the game like I have never seen before in an FPS. In addition to your loadouts, you will be able to get your hands on power weapons and power ups that are crazy fun to use. They add a funny and classic twist to the game and you will feel so powerful when you get your hands on them. Found myself having an evil laugh when shooting enemies in the back while being completely invincible.\n\nOf course, the multiplayer also has demon ruins that either spawn randomly in some gamemodes or are fixed in other gamemodes. Everytime you pick a new loadout, you will be able to choose between 4 different demons, each with their own, unique skills, weapons and abilities. There is lots of amusement to get from these demons once you get to try them out yourself and are also an important part of the gameplay. A good demon could be a game changer, while a bad demon could give the enemy an advantage. All in all the multiplayer is great fun, and hopefully the developers will implement some sort of ranked play or e-sports as it would make the game even more great. Imagine sitting on a cold, friday night watching a DOOM ranked tournament between two big teams fighting it out for a prize. Epic.\n\nSuggestionsDOOM is a great game,  possibly the best game of 2016 so far. However, there are some minor suggestions I would like to add that I think could make the game even better!\n\n1. Giving the player the possibility to choose between 1 of 2 mods for each weapon. Unlike the campaign, where you can choose between 2 mods, the multiplayer features prechosen mods for each weapon.\n2. Adding some sorts of ranked play or implementing e-sports. Im a very competitive player and I just love e-sports.

As soon as it was ready, I went for it.\n\nFirst playthrough on Ultra-Violence, no tutorials, no compass or objective markers, simple crosshair, minimal HUD (only health and ammo), no overlays, weapon changes only with keyboard shortcuts.\n\nLet's just say this: the transition from DOOM II couldn't have been smoother and more positively surprising.\n\nIn the first 5 minutes you'll be already knee deep in it, blasting away at demons like in the old ones.  Each demon has its own character and combat style: Imps are fiercer and faster than ever, and they come at you from all sides. Hell Knights are agile, fast and deliver some serious blows... and wait 'till you get to the Baron.\n\nLevel design is maze-like, combining linear corridors and sections with open ground arenas where most of the action will happen. Playing without markers and compass felt much more like an old school experience: exploring only by relying on visual clues is extremely satisfactory especially when searching for secrets, though the automap is still very useful.\n\nThe only complaints I have are related to relatively minor things: one is the presence of two or three story-related scenes that lock you in place for a brief amount of time and they cannot be skipped.\nThe second one that I noticed is that there are no running speed upgrades apart from the temporary Haste powerup, only combat speed upgrades (weapon and mod switching, faster glory kills, faster mantling) which do improve the pace somewhat, although I would still love to be able to speedup things a bit more, especially when comparing the pace to the old DOOMs.\n\nIt does feel like a DOOM with some Quake mechanics thrown in (platforming, air control), but I think those same mechanics have actually helped the game to step into more modern ground and at the same time feel like a unique, original game in its own right. In my opinion they did something that feels so good to play it's almost unbelievable. It's not about "franchise purity", it's about fun.\n\nAll in all I think the game feels just right: pace, power and enemy behaviour all combined to give an awesome "old-school meets new" feeling that hasn't been part of an FPS in a very long time.\n\nThanks id, you did it again.\n\n\n\nNote: The mouse input is the best I've ever experienced in an FPS, after disabling mouse smoothing. I definitely recommend doing that.","May 16","true","36.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's also the first I have ever played that actually emphasises replayability - miss some secrets the first time, go back and try to find them on the next playthrough. Tweak your weapons and armor differently to fit a different playstyle on the next playthrough.\n\nWas I blown away by the multiplayer during the beta? No, but I enjoyed it enough to even keep me from diving into the Overwatch beta running at the same time. Now that it has been fully realised, and I've experienced a number of different maps, game modes and demons, I can safely say that it's "pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good". I played a lot of multiplayer from Doom, Quake/Q3 and Marathon, back in the day, but since then I've also played a lot of the modern, military shooters, and of course, Halo.\n\nIt borrows elements from both ends of the shooter spectrum. I for one do NOT have a problem with that. I do not understand why people think challenges and unlocks are a deal breaker (since you are very quick to unlock new weapons, anyway).\n\nThe only things that bother me are the lack of weapon pickups (save for power weapons), which were even present in Halo, and how some of the weapons felt underpowered (the heavy assault rifle, rocket launcher).\n\nTL;DR\n\nBuy it, and stop acting like change is the be-all-and-end-all.","May 15","true","29.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Having spend a significant amount of time with the new DOOM, I can say that it is one of my favourite games of all time now.\n\nHere the cliffnotes:\n\nPros\nbeautiful audio-visual design. Looks and sounds as you would expect a modern DOOM to look and sound\nFantastic single player campaign. Very straight forward fun. Non-linear maps. Lots of secrets. Weapon upgrades etc.\nHigh-speed combat in kill rooms. The game will funnel you into these open areas with tons of enemies. If you want to survive you have to keep moving. Awesome fun.\nSNAPMAP - Ok, this is great. It will give the game infinite replayability. It is like Portal2's steam workshop support. Basically, like a Doom version of MarioMaker. Plus it is fun and easy to use and you can play with your friends in COOP. Brilliant.\nPerformance. The game runs like butter and you have a gazillion settings to manipulate. On a single 980ti the game runs in Ultra/Nightmare settings at 3440x1440 (21:9) almost always at a 100+ fps, with occasional dips into the high 70s. Good stuff, considering we are not even playing the Vulkan version yet.\n\nCons\n\nThe competitive multiplayer may be a con for you, if you expect a full Quake 3 Arena or Unreal Tournament type game. Personally, I love the multiplayer. It feels fresh for Doom. It is like a mix between Quake 3 and Halo multiplayer. For me it works, but if you are going to buy the game just for the multiplayer. Understand what you are getting.\n\n\nOverall, I am extremely happy about how the game turned out.

It does well to return to the roots of the Doom nightmare with a new polish and smooth gameplay. Play this game on the highest difficulty you can manage so you can get back into the old habits of strafe and destruction that you needed back in the glory days. Everything about this game wants you to move and never stop. No reloading, no regeneration of health. You want to live? Earn it. Be as brutal as possible to rip health out of your enemies.\n\nCampaign is fast paced, there are secrets, keycards, upgrades, weapons and collectibles galore. It does everything right to punish you when you mess up while making you feel like a beast when you deserve it. Don't stop moving and don't stop shooting. If you're concerned about secrets the game will slow down significatntly as you will backtrack like crazy because they really wanted to hide them from you. I would recommend looking up a guide to unlock the extra content and classic Doom throwback levels. The secrets are not false walls or secret doors, it's exploration of a 3d environment. All in all the experience is very rewarding when you really get your momentum rolling so either gather secrets in your second playthrough or grab a nice guide. That's my personal recommendation because I personally didn't want to totally kill the pacing. Something to consider.\n\nThe Multiplayer is even more fast paced as a player vs. player setting will always challenge you more. The game returns to the classic pick up standard. Given, you have loadouts for weapons so you don't need to gather weapons. You do, however, need to pick up health as there is no health regeneration. This incentivizes players to keep moving around the map to kill each other while keeping themselves alive while discouraging players from holing up in corners waiting for the red blood spatter border to fade. You will find 75 kill deathmatches to go very quickly with this classic doom philosophy. This game rewards boldness.\n\nIt's a great installment for an aged series and breathes new life into the look and feel of the game. If you played the Brutal Doom mod in the classic games then you will feel right at home.\n\nRip and tear!","May 14","true","42.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's fast paced, chaotic, bloody, and loud. Everything a DOOM game needs to be. The environments are stunning, colorful, and every bit as sinister. This is far from DOOM 3, it's better in every way and a great new beginning to the series. This time around a story is actually intact, and interesting.  Like DOOM original, this game is about staying on the move, exploring, and destroying stuff with epic weapons. And it delivers every bit of it without mercy.\n\nThis is not Halo, this is sure as hell not Call of Duty, you explore beautiful and grotesque environments in search of power-ups while surviving onslaughts of enemies and monster closets to make your inner psycho squee with joy at all the bloodshed. DOOM runs a very simple gaming formula, but does so with grace: Explore > Power up > Monster closet > Boss. It begins easy but later on, as the monsters evolve, so too does the challenge. Evolving from a simple shooter to a fight for survival at each encounter. Enclosed rooms become bloodbaths and open paths become drive-by arenas.\n\nThe graphics this time around put tears to the eyes. Guns are sleek and shiny, environments range from beautiful to hellish, and demons look better and more sinister than ever before. All of this complimented by the high levels of gore to make even the likes of George Romero squirm. Not to mention you got yourself a sick soundtrack to rip apart demons to.\n\nWeapon variety comes in the form of classics we know and love, with a little added something. Weapons can be buffed or upgraded, much like your armor, letting you play DOOM differently and to your unique style. Or you can forgo everything and just play this classic with no power-ups. Nothing is forced on the player, not even the routes you take. It's about freedom to express the insides of a demon on the wall any way you like. And it's damn fun to do it.\n\nMultiplayer is not your usual Halo or COD. This is a shooter with guts. It's fast, chaotic, and bloodboiling. Say goodbye to quick one-shot kills and hello to group cooperation and outmaneuvering. If you can't move, you die. Best start developing those hand-eye coordinations because you'll need it as you pump lead or plasma into the enemy combatant trying to make your head into a pinata. The added toughness of each player, along with armor and health boosts, just adds to the fun of dogfighting your way through each kill. It becomes a race to see who can kill who first before a partner or new enemy jumps over to provide the handicap. And it works. DOOM never stops. You can't camp, you can't cheese. All you got here is skill, forget the patience. You're a hungry monster out to feed. As you play you progress levels and unlock swag armor to stylize, colors, and new weapons/gear. Win or lose, you are always rewarded handsomely for something enjoying yourself. So forget the pressure of getting them kills, enjoy yourself.... and kill a whole lot of people.\n\nAll in all, DOOM is the remake Duke Nukem wanted to be. Hell, it's the remake any game wants to be. It's beautiful, fast, violent, engaging, challenging, and, above all else, fun. I have yet to run into lag, yet to see my frame rate drop, and I'm running this monster on all Ultra settings. The only stops here are when I rip the head out a demon to shove down his throat, or when a demon beats me to death with my own legs.\n\nDOOM fans NEED this game, shooter fans WANT this game, WHY HAVEN'T YOU ALREADY BOUGHT THIS GAME?!?!?!?","May 14","true","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is easily a very good successor to Doom 3 that we have been waiting for some years for. The core mechanics, graphics and gameplay is fluent and bloody brilliant. No doubt when you jump into the game after purchasing you won't be dissapointed. The multi-player is fun for what it is, and a good little side game to play with friends that acts like any other regular PvP shooter/arena style game. That be seeing said the real element to the game I honestly only play DOOM for is the main game, and it is really good. It has sort of a Halo meets Metroid Prime feel to the surroundings with secrets, passageways and areas of monsters to defeat, and nothing feels more satisfying than to break the neck or limbs off a monster while blowing everything away around it. That being said a well rounded game that definitely shows its trademark. That being said, I do have some problems with this game so far.\n\n1. The Campaign is not as long as you may think. The main game does have a decent long storyplot that goes through several areas of the UAC installation and inevitably Hell. But I found the world to be smaller, somewhat linear unlike the older game of Doom 3, which always had you going through endless passageways, installations and areas and constantly discovering something new. In this DOOM however it is all pretty easy to travel and discover everything that game has to offer.\n\n2. It is not Scary. Through my time playing it I have yet to be genuinely scared from the atmosphere, environmental elements or monsters themselves. Unlike the old Dooms and Doom3 where the game was abosultely scary, dark and grimy the new DOOM does not have this all that well. Most areas are bright, monster's are not scary and it is tough to be freightened when you are in big areas constantly blasting away at enemies left and right while ripping through them with a chainsaw. Which is not bad considering, but its tough to be scared when the action drowns it out.\n\n3. The Multiplayer although fun is very bare, it is nothing new but the usual kill or be killed team up match battles. The unlockables are not all that great, and it's just your usual Player vs Player arena style junk that we see in hundreds of games now. It is fun for a while but it will get boring with the same stuff everytime. If have friends to play it is can be very enjoyable and that is about it.\n\n4. No Main Game Co-Op or Co-Op Mods or Options at this point. This was somewhat a huge deal for me when waiting so many years for the next DOOM. I thought maybe finally developers of such great games would come to be aware how fun and successful main game co-op stuff could be. A big intricate main game with your friends is something many fans and my friends wanted to see. But instead there is no real co-op but little side mission/PVP Co-op junk that falls short of what we really wanted. When I first heard about this game and saw the Co-Op in its tags I was so hyped ans hoped for a real main game campaign of Doom filled with Co-op survival action, but it became a letdown and became just another Multiplayer action scroeboard game.\n\nAll in All the game is still worth its title and a great game overall that kept me entertained and still entertained with its time. So until than I am going to chainsaw some more monsters!","May 16","true","89.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You wana play a good game? You're in luck. When they said the levels were linear, they lied. I got lost for a bit on level two. If that level is representative of the whole product, the level design is on par with the original. When they said it was slow, they lied. DoomGuy isn't as fast as the original, but he's fast. The weapon switch wheel is optional console garbage, and the infamous glory kills are decent speed.\n\nDoom's all about the quick and dirty, so instead of writing a retrospective, I'll bombard you with bullet points, and I won't skimp on the negative aspects of the game.\n\nThe Good:\n* Modern FPS hand holding is 100% optional. Compass markers, tutorials, "press 'E' here" shimmer, HUD pop-ups. You can turn it all off in the option menu.\n* Level design is top notch. Don't be fooled by the tutorial level, it's not all halls and boxes. Looks like Metroid Prime.\n* Like wise, the devs seem to have taken "Show, don't tell" to heart when designing levels around game mechanics.\n* Almost no waist high barriers. It's all fast action strafing and pillars, just like the original. More verticality though.\n* Varied player death animations, gore effects, and Glory Kill animations.\n* Weapon upgrades are simple, yet useful and fun.\n* I heard the game had an auto-aim feature. If it does, I couldn't feel it.\n* The game is self aware. It knows what made the original good and seeks to emulate/expand it. It also knows it can never top the original, so it isn't afraid to get creative.\n* The choice in music is excelent. Industrial metal, I think it was called? Very nice.\n* Doom loves its secrets, and it isn't afraid to rub it in your face.\n* Also, a lot of levers and computers lie around that look interactable, but aren't. Very cheeky devs, very cheeky.\n* Half-Life-esque aproach to story. The only cutscene I saw was the 8 second intro. Backstory delegated to logs.\n* On that note, it's better than Half-Life. No bunny hopping around waiting for people to shut-up.\n* RIP AND TEAR\n\nThe Bad:\n* You need a good "gaming" computer to run it. I bought a GTX960 GPU just for the occasion. Now I find out my CPU is bottle-necking it anyways. Overall I spent 350$ just to play the game.\n* That awesome kickass music it has only comes in during combat. Why.\n* Also, I kind of miss the knock-off Metalica MIDI's, but this is purely objective.\n* Corpses fade. That's fine and all, but it could at least leave piles of gore or something. Backtracking feels empty because of the corpse fade.\n* The game has a small over-reliance on arenas. A few more demons bursting out of vents or doors would be nice.\n* Demon palettes are not as varied as they should. You have to look for the baddies movement, not their color.\n* Glory Kill pinatas are fine, but the Chainsaw pinatas are overkill. So much ammo, my FPS dropped a few frames.\n\nThe Ugly:\n* An environmental bug forced me to reload to a previous checkpoint. Not cool, Doom.\n* It may just be me, but there shouldn't be 90 second load times for respawning/reloading.\n* The "Glory Kill" mechanic necessitated the removal of the "fist" weapon. They replaced it with a hearty shove action. It may do good damage, but I can't tell. I almost never used it because it looked and felt so damn weak.\n* The biggest sin of all, the Chainsaw weapon sucks, hard. It guzzels fuel (its ammo) on each kill. It also drops so much ammo on kill, it just looks ugly how it all spills out. It kills the mood. Also, the ammo-on-kill reward seems stupid. The bloody mess of a dead demon should be its own reward. God knows I lost so much health in the original just to hear that chainsaw hit demon flesh again. Its animation takes way too long and locks you in place. It's like 4x longer than a Glory Kill. In fact, I would classify the Chainsaw as an over-glorified Glory Kill, and not an actual weapon. Gone are the days where you could mow down zombie hordes 12 strong in just 20 second. Thank the Lord that one ♥♥♥♥♥ melee weapon a bad game does not make.\n\nOver all, I would recommend this game to everyone who likes bloody fun, even the hardcore Doom fans. Doom 2016 is to Doom 2 as XCOM2 is to XCOM. An awesome sequal in the franchise that manages to be good, but not completely outshine the original, giving us TWO good games to love instead of one strict improvement.","May 21","true","35.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And Quake 4.\n\nQuake 4 did a silly thing in hamstringing the player down paths like other corridor shooters of the time while the multiplayer was Quake 3 arena at the core. This relaunch of Doom has done the polar opposite where the multiplayer of the beta was slow while the pace of the primary game is ferocious as they come and on the higher difficulties is up there with Doom's spiritual successors like Serious Sam.\n\nDoom does borrow from a lot of modern game mechanics like grenade cooldowns, weapon/armour upgrades and the like. However, it seems to blend in well and isn't a main distraction for the player. The execute-stunned-enemy-to-recover-health mechanic works well as the kills only take a second compared to the slow times of Space Marine and Hatred and help keep the player running on the fast dance of death.\n\nJust try to remember not to grenade yourself, DoomGuy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jokerscene/recommended/379720/","Jokerscene","Jokerscene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jokerscene/","48 products in account","DOOM feels like a game for fans, from fans. It's fast paced, chaotic, bloody, and loud. Everything a DOOM game needs to be. The environments are stunning, colorful, and every bit as sinister. This is far from DOOM 3, it's better in every way and a great new beginning to the series. This time around a story is actually intact, and interesting.  Like DOOM original, this game is about staying on the move, exploring, and destroying stuff with epic weapons. And it delivers every bit of it without mercy.\n\nThis is not Halo, this is sure as hell not Call of Duty, you explore beautiful and grotesque environments in search of power-ups while surviving onslaughts of enemies and monster closets to make your inner psycho squee with joy at all the bloodshed. DOOM runs a very simple gaming formula, but does so with grace: Explore > Power up > Monster closet > Boss. It begins easy but later on, as the monsters evolve, so too does the challenge. Evolving from a simple shooter to a fight for survival at each encounter. Enclosed rooms become bloodbaths and open paths become drive-by arenas.\n\nThe graphics this time around put tears to the eyes. Guns are sleek and shiny, environments range from beautiful to hellish, and demons look better and more sinister than ever before. All of this complimented by the high levels of gore to make even the likes of George Romero squirm. Not to mention you got yourself a sick soundtrack to rip apart demons to.\n\nWeapon variety comes in the form of classics we know and love, with a little added something. Weapons can be buffed or upgraded, much like your armor, letting you play DOOM differently and to your unique style. Or you can forgo everything and just play this classic with no power-ups. Nothing is forced on the player, not even the routes you take. It's about freedom to express the insides of a demon on the wall any way you like. And it's damn fun to do it.\n\nMultiplayer is not your usual Halo or COD. This is a shooter with guts. It's fast, chaotic, and bloodboiling. Say goodbye to quick one-shot kills and hello to group cooperation and outmaneuvering. If you can't move, you die. Best start developing those hand-eye coordinations because you'll need it as you pump lead or plasma into the enemy combatant trying to make your head into a pinata. The added toughness of each player, along with armor and health boosts, just adds to the fun of dogfighting your way through each kill. It becomes a race to see who can kill who first before a partner or new enemy jumps over to provide the handicap. And it works. DOOM never stops. You can't camp, you can't cheese. All you got here is skill, forget the patience. You're a hungry monster out to feed. As you play you progress levels and unlock swag armor to stylize, colors, and new weapons/gear. Win or lose, you are always rewarded handsomely for something enjoying yourself. So forget the pressure of getting them kills, enjoy yourself.... and kill a whole lot of people.\n\nAll in all, DOOM is the remake Duke Nukem wanted to be. Hell, it's the remake any game wants to be. It's beautiful, fast, violent, engaging, challenging, and, above all else, fun. I have yet to run into lag, yet to see my frame rate drop, and I'm running this monster on all Ultra settings. The only stops here are when I rip the head out a demon to shove down his throat, or when a demon beats me to death with my own legs.\n\nDOOM fans NEED this game, shooter fans WANT this game, WHY HAVEN'T YOU ALREADY BOUGHT THIS GAME?!?!?!?","May 14","true","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Doom has never been about Multiplayer. It has always been the single player experience that has driven the game to it's heights.\n\nWhile this is the fourth Iteration of Doom, it is not Doom 4. It is not a continuation of the jump scares that were used to great effect in Doom 3. Unfortunately the scene deformations are lacking this time around. So if you were hoping for a corridor shooter, You won't get that here.\n\nWhat you do get are waves of enemies à la the original Doom 1 and Doom 2. Hordes of them. It's fast. It's frantic. It's a bloody good gorefest. Some people might hate the new Glory Kills, but I find them to be gratifying. All the weapoons have impact. If there is anything to be said about a game with great gunplay this has got to be it.\n\nThis is a game that is meant to be enjoyed for the sake of enjoyment. It looks gorgeous on my system running at 2560x1440 all settings maxed out, Motion Blur is turned off, on my GTX 980Ti. At these settings, I get a solid 90fps. 4k is somewhat playable at around 47fps all settings maxed out, but I'd take the higher frame rate any day.\n\nI can appreciate that perhaps some people wouldn't like the metal soundtrack, but you know what. That's what DOOM is. It's Dungeons and Dragons, Heavy Metal, and Grit. It's tough as balls.\n\nAs far as the multiplayer...I'm not interested. It doesn't (yet) have Local LAN, so I couldn't care less about playing with Randos.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is extremely satisfying. Buy this game for a fantastic Single Player experience. Don't buy it just for the Multiplayer.","May 16","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaetter/recommended/379720/","kaetter","Heretic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaetter/","248 products in account","I was initially very sceptical about the game. A very long and troubled development cycle, no review copies sent out before release, a multiplayer that was poorly received and did not sound or look all that exciting.\n\nI did end up getting it anyway (a good deal on greenmangaming), I had to see what id had done to make a follow-up to what was perhaps my two most favorite games ever.\n\nAbout 5 seconds after the loadscreen is gone you have a gun in your hand and are shooting zombie guys. 30 seconds later you've violently destroyed a couple more in grotesquely violent melee animations and picked up a shotgun. Shortly you're off over the surface of Mars, through a bunch of sci-fi facilities in the sort of style that Doom 3 laid out, but far more open, expansive and brightly lit. The game looks great, even on medium settings (+85% res) that I was forced to run it at to get a performance that'd sit stable in the 45-60fps range. (2560x1440, 2gb 680gtx, i5 3570k, 16gb ram).\n\nMelee finishing animations were a hotly debated topic, but they are so short they don't interrupt the flow of combat. In later levels they become sort of your in-combat health-regen and later on you can equip a powerup to shorten their duration further.\n\nThe gunplay is extremely enjoyable, every single gun has a distinct feel, good sound effects, nice visuals and all are upgradable with interesting alternate firemods that can be upgraded further to improve on their effect, ending up in a Mastery Unlock that buffs the alternate mode fully.\n\nThe enemy gallery is almost entirely the classic Doom lineup buffed with a few extra new monsters and new takes on former humans.\n\nAbsent from the game are the Arachnotron and the Archvile, the latter replaced by the Summoner the Summoner, a sort of new version of the Archvile. It doesn't feel as threatening, but it shares the agility and speed of all the other monsters in this game.\n\nWhich is something quite new and fresh in the FPS genre. The monsters literally jump and climb all over the environment, dodging and weaving to avoid your shots or position themselves to rain lasers down on you. You'll be doing the same, moving with speed up and down ledges, no fall damage is present, so your freedom to move is great. Later in the game you'll get a double-jump and a powerup that lets you move faster after performing melee kills, a powerup that lets you control yourself while in the air much like in Quake 1 and powerups that let you engage melee kills from farther away.\nAll this combines to a combat system that feels smooth, precise, extremely fun and very rewarding.\n\nI find it to the game's credit that dying seems entirely my own fault for not taking good enough advantage of the options allowed me. And the options are many. You can carry all the game's weapons and you will be swapping between them often and you'll have many, many available approaches in every single fight.\n\nThe soundtrack is blazing modern industrial style metal in combat, out of combat there is a light ambient drone, all of it heavily inspired by the original Doom soundtrack. There are many, many eastereggs and little things paying homage to the original games in here and it's clear that it's been made by someone who obviously cared a lot.\n\nWith the snapmap editor allowing community creations and a robust replayability, I foresee Doom staying on my drive for quite a while. I hope to see more.\n\nI have not had any experience with the multiplayer, but I'll probably take a look at some point, but it's not why I bought the game and not why you should either, I'd reckon.\n\nHighly recommended.","May 15","true","25.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

But, hopefully Bethesda and id Software will bring us more great story mode content, and even fix up the multiplayer a bit, fingers crossed.

The story is minimal to non-existent, but that is a good thing, DOOM knows what it's doing, providing an avenue for players to experience the most adrenaline fueled gameplay of the past few years in gaming.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent level design\n-Return of "Secrets" across each level\n-"Always Run" is back\n-Old School mechanics (health packs, holding all 10 weapons)\n-Epic score of industrial/metal music\n-Excellent visuals\n-Well optimized for PC\n-Gameplay is stellar\n-Enemy design is grotesque and gory\n-Memorable boss fights\n-Snapmap is a great addition to the game\n-Good length campaign (~10 hours on ULTRA-VIOLENCE difficulty)\n\nMeh:\n-Multiplayer is just OK, some old school Doom fans will be disappointed\n\nCons:\n-Some campaign arenas can get repetitive (Gore Bags)\n\nPerformance:\n\nRig Used: EVGA GTX 980 4GB of VRAM, 16GB DDR3 RAM, i5 3570K.\n\nI was able to maintain a flawless locked 60fps at 1080p resolution on ultra settings.

Also, you no longer encounter any other survivors at the UAC facility, or get to wield the Crucible Artifact, making the whole experience feel a little hollow. None the less, hoards of Doom fans will still lap this up as it up's the brutal violence & Satanic sites, fusing it with thumping hardcore metal tunes.

The faster you kill, the more recklessly you play, the more your rewarded, not just with showers of health (and later armor), but also in spectacular death animations that just don't get old.\n\nAll this and it's FULL of well hidden and fun to find secerts, an intuitive yet interesting weapon/armor upgrade system, remade retro levels to find and murder your way through, and one of the most well optimized, bug free experiences I've had from an AAA title maybe ever.\n\nThis game is worth every penny for the campaign mode alone, and then there's the SnapMap feature which I hear is already turning out some quality content. And multiplayer, if that's your thing (it's not mine...but I don't mind at all cause the single player is so good).\n\nSo if your idea of a great time is crouching behind waist-high walls and waiting for health to regen while the enemy inefectually attempts to shoot you from long range, look elsewhere. But if your idea of a good time is wandering into the wrong part of Hell and tearing every single resident apart with your bare hands till you're wading in the gore, than yeah, buy this game now.","May 19","true","31.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This relaunch of Doom has done the polar opposite where the multiplayer of the beta was slow while the pace of the primary game is ferocious as they come and on the higher difficulties is up there with Doom's spiritual successors like Serious Sam.\n\nDoom does borrow from a lot of modern game mechanics like grenade cooldowns, weapon/armour upgrades and the like. However, it seems to blend in well and isn't a main distraction for the player.

This is no doubt one of the best games to come out in 2016 and a perfect reboot to a wonderful franchise. You can tell the developers and the writers of that game love Doom and love the fans, they didn't try to turn it into something that it's not, this game is packed with high speed action, hordes of enemies, amazing graphics and one of the best soundtracks ever. The plot itself is not bad either, I actually expected it to be rather dumb and shallow but the writers created interesting lore and a world of content that keeps you wanting for more.\n\nBottom line, DoomGuy (DoomSlayer?) is my spirit animal, if I could marry a game I would marry Doom, if you loved Wolfenstein: The New Order, you will love this one as well.

It does well to return to the roots of the Doom nightmare with a new polish and smooth gameplay. Play this game on the highest difficulty you can manage so you can get back into the old habits of strafe and destruction that you needed back in the glory days. Everything about this game wants you to move and never stop. No reloading, no regeneration of health. You want to live? Earn it. Be as brutal as possible to rip health out of your enemies.\n\nCampaign is fast paced, there are secrets, keycards, upgrades, weapons and collectibles galore. It does everything right to punish you when you mess up while making you feel like a beast when you deserve it. Don't stop moving and don't stop shooting. If you're concerned about secrets the game will slow down significatntly as you will backtrack like crazy because they really wanted to hide them from you. I would recommend looking up a guide to unlock the extra content and classic Doom throwback levels. The secrets are not false walls or secret doors, it's exploration of a 3d environment. All in all the experience is very rewarding when you really get your momentum rolling so either gather secrets in your second playthrough or grab a nice guide. That's my personal recommendation because I personally didn't want to totally kill the pacing. Something to consider.\n\nThe Multiplayer is even more fast paced as a player vs. player setting will always challenge you more. The game returns to the classic pick up standard. Given, you have loadouts for weapons so you don't need to gather weapons. You do, however, need to pick up health as there is no health regeneration. This incentivizes players to keep moving around the map to kill each other while keeping themselves alive while discouraging players from holing up in corners waiting for the red blood spatter border to fade. You will find 75 kill deathmatches to go very quickly with this classic doom philosophy. This game rewards boldness.\n\nIt's a great installment for an aged series and breathes new life into the look and feel of the game. If you played the Brutal Doom mod in the classic games then you will feel right at home.\n\nRip and tear!","May 14","true","42.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As soon as it was ready, I went for it.\n\nFirst playthrough on Ultra-Violence, no tutorials, no compass or objective markers, simple crosshair, minimal HUD (only health and ammo), no overlays, weapon changes only with keyboard shortcuts.\n\nLet's just say this: the transition from DOOM II couldn't have been smoother and more positively surprising.\n\nIn the first 5 minutes you'll be already knee deep in it, blasting away at demons like in the old ones.  Each demon has its own character and combat style: Imps are fiercer and faster than ever, and they come at you from all sides. Hell Knights are agile, fast and deliver some serious blows... and wait 'till you get to the Baron.\n\nLevel design is maze-like, combining linear corridors and sections with open ground arenas where most of the action will happen. Playing without markers and compass felt much more like an old school experience: exploring only by relying on visual clues is extremely satisfactory especially when searching for secrets, though the automap is still very useful.\n\nThe only complaints I have are related to relatively minor things: one is the presence of two or three story-related scenes that lock you in place for a brief amount of time and they cannot be skipped.\nThe second one that I noticed is that there are no running speed upgrades apart from the temporary Haste powerup, only combat speed upgrades (weapon and mod switching, faster glory kills, faster mantling) which do improve the pace somewhat, although I would still love to be able to speedup things a bit more, especially when comparing the pace to the old DOOMs.\n\nIt does feel like a DOOM with some Quake mechanics thrown in (platforming, air control), but I think those same mechanics have actually helped the game to step into more modern ground and at the same time feel like a unique, original game in its own right. In my opinion they did something that feels so good to play it's almost unbelievable. It's not about "franchise purity", it's about fun.\n\nAll in all I think the game feels just right: pace, power and enemy behaviour all combined to give an awesome "old-school meets new" feeling that hasn't been part of an FPS in a very long time.\n\nThanks id, you did it again.\n\n\n\nNote: The mouse input is the best I've ever experienced in an FPS, after disabling mouse smoothing. I definitely recommend doing that.","May 16","true","36.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

These are the good and the bad things imo:\n\nPros:\n\n- Great production, technically excellent with amazing sound and graphics.\n- Smooth, fast paced, bloody like hell.\n- Level maps and boss designs.\n- Metal music with some really good tunes, and a bit of electronic and classical music for each moment.\n- The game is so fun and addictive for itself but add a lot of things to do for a better replay value such as secret levels, different paths, upgrades, challenges etc. Nice Easter eggs.\n- Glory kills (Melee Fatalities) looks and feel really good and you can disable the visual effect that indicates when an enemy is staggered if you don't like it. With this, you can get bonus ammo and health.\n- You can turn off the crosshair, the compass, the objectives... for a more hardcore experience.\n- Definitely SnapMap (They key for the ones who are looking for a more competitive multiplayer experience)\n- Casual but really fun multiplayer with tons of creative modes and a well designed online world with skins, new weapons and other stuff to unlock while you play.\n- Perfect balanced difficulty (Nightmare, the harder one, is really hard) Also you have that same difficulty level but with Perma-death called ''Ultra-Nightmare'')\n- Weapons beautifully designed with collectible modifications you can get through the game.\n- Spoiler: Classic nostalgic levels hidden inside the campaign and you can play it later from the title menu.\n- First time since 90's we see a real good FPS (I mean with an AAA production in the back) with no health/shields regeneration, no reload, tons of beautiful weapons, good maps, and fast combat speed and exploration.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Disappointment achievements, all of them so easy to get.\n- The... Story? (I know, is DOOM)\n- No coop.\n- Expensive Multiplayer DLC.\n- Limited Strafe Jump as default (Don't know if you can change that with SnapMap)\n- No Rocket Jump and no Plasma Climbing. (SnapMap maybe?)\n- It seems this is another PCGame victim of the cross-platform because textures have been downgraded a bit. I can feeling it.\n\nOverall I'm happy with the new DOOM. Games evolve and change, 90's were great but we should accept and love the new era because it does good things too.

Doom has never been about Multiplayer. It has always been the single player experience that has driven the game to it's heights.\n\nWhile this is the fourth Iteration of Doom, it is not Doom 4. It is not a continuation of the jump scares that were used to great effect in Doom 3. Unfortunately the scene deformations are lacking this time around. So if you were hoping for a corridor shooter, You won't get that here.\n\nWhat you do get are waves of enemies à la the original Doom 1 and Doom 2. Hordes of them. It's fast. It's frantic. It's a bloody good gorefest. Some people might hate the new Glory Kills, but I find them to be gratifying. All the weapoons have impact. If there is anything to be said about a game with great gunplay this has got to be it.\n\nThis is a game that is meant to be enjoyed for the sake of enjoyment. It looks gorgeous on my system running at 2560x1440 all settings maxed out, Motion Blur is turned off, on my GTX 980Ti. At these settings, I get a solid 90fps. 4k is somewhat playable at around 47fps all settings maxed out, but I'd take the higher frame rate any day.\n\nI can appreciate that perhaps some people wouldn't like the metal soundtrack, but you know what. That's what DOOM is. It's Dungeons and Dragons, Heavy Metal, and Grit. It's tough as balls.\n\nAs far as the multiplayer...I'm not interested. It doesn't (yet) have Local LAN, so I couldn't care less about playing with Randos.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is extremely satisfying. Buy this game for a fantastic Single Player experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChancesRat/recommended/379720/","ChancesRat","Chances","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChancesRat/","198 products in account","Doom is back, this time back as close as it can to its roots, while putting on new polish and new features. However, does it have enough to be the Doom folks have been wanting since the 90s? The answer is a definite 'Yes!', with a caveat or two. Doom delivers a solid singleplayer experience with plenty of love and attention to gameplay, bits of story, and speed. The multiplayer aspect feels like an afterthought, or worse, shoehorned in to try to grasp the old days of Doom multiplayer, while trying to keep it modern, which fails as the system is drastically different than what’s seen in the Singleplayer.\n\nOverall, a must have to any FPS Enthusiast of the 90s, or those who definitely enjoy the frantic pace of the Doom series (not including Doom 3).\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nId Software went out of their way to make some solid effort to bring back the foreboding atmosphere to abandoned facilities all the way to Hell's jagged mountains and corridors. Every sight is as foreboding as it is impressive to the eye, not once leaving the proper atmosphere of the invasion of Mars. Enemies themselves are painstakingly put together in great detail from the Possessed all the way to the Cyberdemon (something you can inspect in great detail later in the game in the gallery). Special effects and particles all play out well, leaving the game a beautiful sight.\n\nAudio: 8/10\nMusic composed to this game is a nostalgic gamer's dream mixed into a new players love for intense song. Mixing in old classic tunes from the old games for remixes for a modern finish that will speak to old school gamers while still leaving the newcomers enjoying the throbbing tone of a fight in their ears. There are times when the music difference can in fact feel a little jarring, as the difference between fights and exploration ambiance music can be as different as night and day. This does happen a bit in Hell as music can come between hard techno, to suddenly the hellish chorus and orchestra echoing in your speakers. However, the real treat comes from the work put into the guns and the monsters. Almost every gun in the game has avoided the 'nerf gun' feel of firing, from the combat shotgun's ringing blast, all the way to the chaingun firing at full throttle. Only one gun in the collection feels a bit disappointing, the pistol, while only really necessary early game, it never feels like its got much impact in the sound of the shot, but this is minor.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nIt's fast, its chaos, and its gory. The Devs really did listen to their fans this time around, trading the creeping and paranoid inducing feeling of Doom 3, and replacing it with fast run n' gun action that leaves it dangerous to stop at any point in the fight. Of course, there are small respites you can find here and there between fights that allow you to take a breath, but at the same time, while the game is fast paced and chaotic, it doesn't discourage exploration either. With secrets and badly needed supplies everywhere, you can always back track, as most of the time, it'll be rare a portion of the map will be gated off after a certain amount of progress. There are a few negative points, such as the over reliance of the Glory Kill system, especially in later levels where its not an option, its almost mandatory. (Details discussed below) However, every punch, every shot, ever messy take down brings a satisfying sense of speed and thrill that few FPS grasp these days.\n\nLongevity / Replayability: 9/10\nContrary to rumors, DOOM is packed with content from start to finish, most of it all in the Singleplayer, which after my playthrough, lasted between 18-20 hours on the highest difficulty available right out of the box (Ultra-Violence). From secrets, challenges in every map, collectibles to obtain, weapon mods to add to your arsenal, its quite a bit to all get. Thankfully, all this is not locked away should you miss it on finishing a map. You can return to any map any time with all currently obtained equipment and upgrades, allowing you to use the advantage to take on a challenge, or get a leg up to finally reach that possible secret you were having trouble with. That said, all secrets and challenges can be done with the default gear you have during that part of the game. (Eg. No challenges / secrets that cannot be reached without double jump in maps prior to obtaining that skill). After completing the game, you still have time to challenge yourself with two new difficulty settings (Acting much like New Game+), Nightmare, and Ultra-Nightmare, where the latter throws the challenge of permadeath. SnapMap and Multiplayer also add to this, but we'll get into that next.\n\nMultiplayer: 6.5/10\nRegretfully, once you load the Multiplayer up, be it SnapMap or Standard Multiplayer, the game changes drastically from its fast paced Singeplayer counterpart. The multiplayer works on a loadout and leveling system, most of which rewards you with cosmetics. Gameplay-wise, the speed is taken down several notches, and the wild combat is somewhat muted, as the guns don't quite have the same impact, and since they are given in loadouts, guns like the Super Shotgun and Rocket Launcher don't quite have the impact folks would expect. There are options to run classical rules, but some of these matches seem devoid of players at this time. Sadly, this part of the game feels shoehorned, simply there to make multiplayer a 'thing' in Doom, which fails to quite grasp the feeling of urgency and intensity.\n\nSnapMap, however, does add some creative credence to the idea of custom work and mod work, adhering to the idea that Doom is a mod friendly game. However, in that same stroke, actual mods of the games players could make are no longer viable. SnapMap replaces this by giving folks tools to make their own maps from between staged Multiplayer, deadly onslaught mode coop, to even missions of their very own to test other players. Including trials to test your modding skill to improve / complete a map, to letting you publish and share your work. More and more features in regards to cosmetics, textures, and objects. The downside is that the setup is rather simplistic, and scripts are rather dumbed down, making it easy for newcomers, but more advance map makers are left wanting more. Possible upgrades later, but for now, it feels like it could do much much more for what its promising.\n\nOVERALL: 8.5/10\n\nDisclaimer: Review was based off a full campaign run on Ultra-Violence difficulty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/379720/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Doom 2016 is a reboot of the iconic Doom franchise that has us back to square one on Mars awaiting the start of the demon onslaught once again. Unlike the original game that has us be a normal space marine with nothing more than a pistol and the will to live we now start in a giant coffin as some kind of prophesied chosen one. We are then immediately given a robotic suit very similar to the Master Chief's armor from Halo. From waking up from cryogenic sleep to the enemy with the energy shield this whole game feels a lot to Halo with a dash of Painkiller more so than Doom. The levels are not intricate mazes with key card hunting, there is little real enemy placement as they just spawn out of thin air and the secrets are now for collectibles and upgrades instead of vital resources. It's not a critic but something I feel fans of the first two Dooms should be aware of since those games were not arena shooters such as this.\n\nYour first weapon will be the pistol which is as useless as ever though what rather surprised me is how fast you are thrown into the action. Within the first moments of being able to move you are already shooting down foes which is rather unheard of these days. Story is kept to a minimum thankfully and there are no cut scenes though the game will take away control of your character making you listen to characters blather on about uninteresting stuff on occasion. It is rare enough to be a non-issue but when it does happen it is annoying and stops the game dead in its tracks while General Grievous explains backstory to why they opened the portal in the first place and the need to keep it open. Characters are bland, the story is completely predictable and honestly the Codex pages you find scattered around the levels would have been more than enough context to the invasion without slightly damaging the quality of the campaign.\n\nLuckily it has a far heavier focus on pure gameplay where you are given little room to keep the adrenaline down as another wave of demons awaits your every step. It's the closest a Triple A game has been to the fast paced, balls to the walls action of yesteryear in a very long time. There is no hiding behind cover or hit-scan projectiles here instead you will always be on the move and surrounded on all sides while mowing down enemies with absurdly impractical yet glorious weaponry. Add to that the ability to double jump and very good AI and you have a recipe for a good time. All the Doom enemies minus the Elemental and the Arachnotron are back and ready to rip and tear you to pieces. Many of the monsters are pretty much unrecognizable from their previous appearances like the Summoner that represents the Arch-vile in this game and the Imp looking like a fleshy Halo Promethean. It's cool to see how they are  redesigned into the modern age and now appear far more threatening than their counterparts of the 90's.\n\nThey don't just appear more threatening but the enemies like the Imps and Pinkys are now far more capable of killing you than ever before. Imps are very agile and cling to walls while flinging projectiles while Pinkys are now the true tanks they were meant to be and an enemy you really don't want to face head on. The Barons of Hell are the stars of the show being giant charging beasts capable of sending you sailing across the sky by just punching the ground near you and throwing fast moving projectiles from a distance. There is just a ton of variety between the monsters and seeing how your childhood foes now fight with the power brought to you by over 20 years of technical progress is just amazing. One thing that bothered me was your movement speed being a bit too slow making it a bit harder to deal with shielded enemies among other things.\n\nIn single player you can carry all weapons at once meaning you always have the right tools for the job taking the luck out of carrying the right weapon at the right time very common in modern FPS games. There is no reloading either which really helps with the flow of combat since no one wants the needless realism of waiting for your gun to reload in game about killing demons with a chainsaw on Mars. All of your weapons have two alt fires you can switch between that really spice up the variety in your already vast arsenal of weapons. They are pretty wacky as well like an Assault Rifle firing mini rockets at your enemies and charging up your shotgun to fire three consecutive blasts to annihilate your foes. Causing your opponents to gib is a bloody satisfying feeling in this title.\n\nLevels themselves have a ton of secrets scattered around the place and are pretty well hidden. You can easily go from arena to arena in a linear fashion but branching off the beaten path gets you some pretty nice rewards such as an orb that increases your overall health, armor or ammo limit to entire retro levels of the original Doom in all its low res'd texture goodness. It's an interesting process to finding the retro levels, first you must pull a random lever hidden somewhere in the level which in turn opens up a wall somewhere else. You can play these levels from the campaign menu though they feature Doom 2016 enemies, weapons and gameplay so these are mostly one of nostalgia extras. There are also challenge stones hidden about that unlock single player perks such as more control while in air but to unlock them is a challenge as you are always given a very short time limit to do whatever they ask of you.\n\nGlory kills is in my opinion the greatest flaw in the combat. Killing wounded enemies in that matter makes them drop health for you which is weird but I can live with but the way it is implemented is terrible. When you shoot an enemy enough they have a very good chance of being stunned which in itself doesn't sound too bad but imagine being swarmed by enemies and shooting one point blank with a shotgun only for it to stagger a bit while you do the same to another enemy but that one explodes into bloody pieces. It feels very inconsistent and not killing them in time will have them recover to full health. So you either waste some more ammo to kill the stunned enemy or enter a cheesy animation that is far too zoomed in on the enemy making it very hard to see what's going on in the battlefield while manhandling that demon for a few seconds.\n\nSnapmap is ID's replacement for proper modding and allows you to make preset rooms and place enemies as well as edit gameplay options such as movement speed, damage and game mode rules. You'll see stuff like survival modes, playing as demons and a weird Harvest Moon clone to name a few of the creative things you can do. It's pretty easy to use and maps are all shared between PS4, Xbx1 and PC which is going to lead to a massive amount of options for the fanbase. It is a double edged sword though. Since maps have to be playable on the hardware of the consoles there is a pretty small limit to the amount you can add to the maps. You and up to three strangers can play on multiplayer supported Snap maps. Multiplayer is where Doom 2016 falls on it's face. Perks, small uninteresting maps and taunts like a dudebro teabagging option make this portion of the game feel run of the mill. Not to mention the two weapon limit, loadouts where you can start with any weapon you want and the season pass that focuses entirely on multiplayer and will most likely split up the playerbase. Team Deathmatch's only unique feature is the ability to play as a demon. It's a pretty annoying feature that has a rune randomly spawn on the map with a few seconds of warning. It would have been better to announce it far ahead of its spawn arrival to cause players to fight over that area instead of blind luck to have it. When all is said and done Doom 2016's is a flawed yet fun overall package but its campaign is one of the best the FPS genre has had to offer in a very long time and one I'm itching to replay time and time again.","May 16","true","12.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fisheth24/recommended/379720/","Fisheth24","Fisheth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fisheth24/","425 products in account","Going to preface this review with my PC specs: Intel 4790, 8GB Hyper X Beast DDR3 1866 ram, R9290\n\n\nYou know if anyone had told me Doom would be good after years of development hell, Carmack leaving ID and a critically mauled Multiplayer Beta, I would have laughed at the comment and bought you a treble Whiskey. Needless to say, I'm pretty suprised, but after how good Wolfenstein: The New Order was, I was cautiously optimistic for the rebirth of Doom and I'm glad I was.\n\nNow Doom needs no introduction for how influential the original was or how much it impacted game design, but for the newbies to the Franchise it's like this. Doom when it launched on the PC back in 1993 was critically acclaimed, was one of the first games to make use of Shareware to great success and one of the first video games I remember ever seeing when I was age five (I'm twenty two now) and it was the videogame that coined the phrase "Deathmatch"\n\nThe reboot is interesting, because if I remember rightly the only member of the original team that has worked on this is Tim Willits. No Romero, Bobby Prince, Carmack or Tom Hall.\n\nAs far back as Doom goes, there's always room for some new breed on the team, Mick Gordon returns after his industrail flavoured soundtrack for Wolf: New Order, he's back, with the Meshuggah inspired chugging and the weird electronica noises which fuse really well. even the rendition of At Doom's Gate is done with care and respect.\n\nLevel Design is decent, well paced and has a visceral quality to them that ID do when they're at their best. It's clear that they've been playing classic Doom and Doom 2 in the office. With expansive levels, with secrets and amusing little Easter Eggs. There's some inspiration from Doom 3 in it's corridor design, which in itself isn't a bad thing, despite Doom 3 not being the most well liked in the series among fans of Doom, however it has it's champions.\n\nIt's weird, on the visual design front I was never a fan of the demon designs when Doom was unvieled at E3, I always felt they were a bit cartoony. However I think they've done a really good job of modernizing the Demons (Revenant and Imp especially) whilst still making them recognizable.\n\n*Potential spoilers*\n\nThe story is well told, with Doomguy giving a "I don't give a ♥♥♥♥" attitude. He never speaks, but he's got more personality than another mute character like Gordon Freeman or Jack from Bioshock 1. His actions throughout the course of the story mode when getting exposition give enough character to make the muteness work. It's also nice that they've written some Lore for the universe this time, with it going into detail about the creatures, personell of the UAC and the enviroments.  As the original Doom's exposition and story was just a couple of paragraphs of text over a midi file, it makes a refreshing change.\n\nAside from twice, maybe three times the story isn't forced on the player and the player is free to avoid it.\n\nI know I'm gushing over  the single player, because it's good. Now for some of the things that aren't as good as they should have been. The multiplayer is tacked on and throw away and the two weapon limit in Multiplayer doesn't really make much sense and it feels like it lacks an identity compared to it's single player componant.  However I've also been playing it on the PS4 and based on responses over voice chat they've been loving it on that side.\n\n\nThis one is a bit subjective, but the Demon Gorenests, some people won't like these, I'm not bothered either way, but it's focused on lock downs and wave based combat. It feels a lot like Painkiller rather than Doom and that's not a bad thing as there's enough Doom DNA in it to still be called Doom and not Painkiller MK2.\n\nThe texture load in bug is still there from ID Tech 5, but nowhere near as bad.\n\nUsers are reporting issues with chrashes and poor performance, I've not experienced either of these issues however.\n\nSnapmap I can't really comment on because I've not dwelved enough into it.\n\nSlight Mouse Acceleration until you disable it via Config files or Launch commands.\n\nBut all I can say about DooM is I'm suprised that ID is back with a good title, I was never a massive fan of Doom 3 or it's expansion (Though I can appriciate it more now) or Rage, despite there being some interesting idea's in it. It never grabbed me.\n\nSo I'm glad to say that Doom is back and  it's good. With decent performance on both the PC and the PS4.","May 14","true","103.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As soon as it was ready, I went for it.\n\nFirst playthrough on Ultra-Violence, no tutorials, no compass or objective markers, simple crosshair, minimal HUD (only health and ammo), no overlays, weapon changes only with keyboard shortcuts.\n\nLet's just say this: the transition from DOOM II couldn't have been smoother and more positively surprising.\n\nIn the first 5 minutes you'll be already knee deep in it, blasting away at demons like in the old ones.  Each demon has its own character and combat style: Imps are fiercer and faster than ever, and they come at you from all sides. Hell Knights are agile, fast and deliver some serious blows... and wait 'till you get to the Baron.\n\nLevel design is maze-like, combining linear corridors and sections with open ground arenas where most of the action will happen. Playing without markers and compass felt much more like an old school experience: exploring only by relying on visual clues is extremely satisfactory especially when searching for secrets, though the automap is still very useful.\n\nThe only complaints I have are related to relatively minor things: one is the presence of two or three story-related scenes that lock you in place for a brief amount of time and they cannot be skipped.\nThe second one that I noticed is that there are no running speed upgrades apart from the temporary Haste powerup, only combat speed upgrades (weapon and mod switching, faster glory kills, faster mantling) which do improve the pace somewhat, although I would still love to be able to speedup things a bit more, especially when comparing the pace to the old DOOMs.\n\nIt does feel like a DOOM with some Quake mechanics thrown in (platforming, air control), but I think those same mechanics have actually helped the game to step into more modern ground and at the same time feel like a unique, original game in its own right. In my opinion they did something that feels so good to play it's almost unbelievable. It's not about "franchise purity", it's about fun.\n\nAll in all I think the game feels just right: pace, power and enemy behaviour all combined to give an awesome "old-school meets new" feeling that hasn't been part of an FPS in a very long time.\n\nThanks id, you did it again.\n\n\n\nNote: The mouse input is the best I've ever experienced in an FPS, after disabling mouse smoothing. I definitely recommend doing that.","May 16","true","36.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's also the first I have ever played that actually emphasises replayability - miss some secrets the first time, go back and try to find them on the next playthrough. Tweak your weapons and armor differently to fit a different playstyle on the next playthrough.\n\nWas I blown away by the multiplayer during the beta? No, but I enjoyed it enough to even keep me from diving into the Overwatch beta running at the same time. Now that it has been fully realised, and I've experienced a number of different maps, game modes and demons, I can safely say that it's "pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good". I played a lot of multiplayer from Doom, Quake/Q3 and Marathon, back in the day, but since then I've also played a lot of the modern, military shooters, and of course, Halo.\n\nIt borrows elements from both ends of the shooter spectrum. I for one do NOT have a problem with that. I do not understand why people think challenges and unlocks are a deal breaker (since you are very quick to unlock new weapons, anyway).\n\nThe only things that bother me are the lack of weapon pickups (save for power weapons), which were even present in Halo, and how some of the weapons felt underpowered (the heavy assault rifle, rocket launcher).\n\nTL;DR\n\nBuy it, and stop acting like change is the be-all-and-end-all.","May 15","true","29.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Having spend a significant amount of time with the new DOOM, I can say that it is one of my favourite games of all time now.\n\nHere the cliffnotes:\n\nPros\nbeautiful audio-visual design. Looks and sounds as you would expect a modern DOOM to look and sound\nFantastic single player campaign. Very straight forward fun. Non-linear maps. Lots of secrets. Weapon upgrades etc.\nHigh-speed combat in kill rooms. The game will funnel you into these open areas with tons of enemies. If you want to survive you have to keep moving. Awesome fun.\nSNAPMAP - Ok, this is great. It will give the game infinite replayability. It is like Portal2's steam workshop support. Basically, like a Doom version of MarioMaker. Plus it is fun and easy to use and you can play with your friends in COOP. Brilliant.\nPerformance. The game runs like butter and you have a gazillion settings to manipulate. On a single 980ti the game runs in Ultra/Nightmare settings at 3440x1440 (21:9) almost always at a 100+ fps, with occasional dips into the high 70s. Good stuff, considering we are not even playing the Vulkan version yet.\n\nCons\n\nThe competitive multiplayer may be a con for you, if you expect a full Quake 3 Arena or Unreal Tournament type game. Personally, I love the multiplayer. It feels fresh for Doom. It is like a mix between Quake 3 and Halo multiplayer. For me it works, but if you are going to buy the game just for the multiplayer. Understand what you are getting.\n\n\nOverall, I am extremely happy about how the game turned out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ergonometry/recommended/379720/","Ergonometry","Rhubarb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ergonometry/","276 products in account","This game is a fantastic homage to the old Doom while being a beast in its own right. It does well to return to the roots of the Doom nightmare with a new polish and smooth gameplay. Play this game on the highest difficulty you can manage so you can get back into the old habits of strafe and destruction that you needed back in the glory days. Everything about this game wants you to move and never stop. No reloading, no regeneration of health. You want to live? Earn it. Be as brutal as possible to rip health out of your enemies.\n\nCampaign is fast paced, there are secrets, keycards, upgrades, weapons and collectibles galore. It does everything right to punish you when you mess up while making you feel like a beast when you deserve it. Don't stop moving and don't stop shooting. If you're concerned about secrets the game will slow down significatntly as you will backtrack like crazy because they really wanted to hide them from you. I would recommend looking up a guide to unlock the extra content and classic Doom throwback levels. The secrets are not false walls or secret doors, it's exploration of a 3d environment. All in all the experience is very rewarding when you really get your momentum rolling so either gather secrets in your second playthrough or grab a nice guide. That's my personal recommendation because I personally didn't want to totally kill the pacing. Something to consider.\n\nThe Multiplayer is even more fast paced as a player vs. player setting will always challenge you more. The game returns to the classic pick up standard. Given, you have loadouts for weapons so you don't need to gather weapons. You do, however, need to pick up health as there is no health regeneration. This incentivizes players to keep moving around the map to kill each other while keeping themselves alive while discouraging players from holing up in corners waiting for the red blood spatter border to fade. You will find 75 kill deathmatches to go very quickly with this classic doom philosophy. This game rewards boldness.\n\nIt's a great installment for an aged series and breathes new life into the look and feel of the game. If you played the Brutal Doom mod in the classic games then you will feel right at home.\n\nRip and tear!","May 14","true","42.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I haven't liked multiplayer too much but I will try it more. About campaign;\nStory; well it has a story but it ain't important too much, even game offers you some extra story such as readible entries. If you want a game with a solid story then this game is not for you. However story never was what this game has offered. So you probably know this.\n\nEnemies are like they actually have brains or something, you don't know what they're gonna do. They can climb up ledges, turn away and attack you anytime, or suddenly escape from you and start attacking from range (unless they are Pinkies). All of the enemies feel annoying more than they were in Doom I & II thus making combat really insane.\n\nCombat is really challenging yet fun and somehow encourages to try again if you fail somehow. Game is really fast, you run really really fast and you may think that you've missed something before such as secrets. Its really awesome but my only problem was motion blur. It made me dizzy few times so I had to give a rest, you may want to close it.\n\nThey are secrets, they are not big nor hard to find. You can come across few secrets in a level even if you are playing linearly. I suppose its fine.\n\nMusic is awesome, electronic elements mixed with heavy ♥♥♥ distorted 9-stringed guitars, pumps you more to kill some more. However I haven't liked weapon sounds too much especially normal Shotgun.\n\nShotgun and Pistol sucks in this game. They do. Only they do.\nYeah this is about campaign. As I've said before I really haven't played too much of multiplayer (only played in beta) so I don't have a review for it yet. I will update if I find it necessary.\n\nAbout SnapMap; it is a easy to use modding tool. While it doesn't have unlimited range between what you can do with what you cannot do, I think that it is a really flexible tool. I would recommend you to give it a try. Learning it can take a few hours so be patient, it is REALLY easy compared to other official and non-official modding tools for other games.\nCurrently I've been trying to make a RPG mod but I don't know, it may turn out to be a Crack-Life.\n\nAnyway, campaign is fun, SnapMap is fun. Game really feels like it is Doom. It has an appeal for both hardcore Doom fans or casual players out there. So if you want fun, not-focused-on-story-too-much game then it is for you.","May 15","true","40.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LandyRS/recommended/379720/","LandyRS","Landy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LandyRS/","265 products in account","For new players, Doom offers an interesting break from the usual first-person shooter style you might be familiar with (Call of Duty, Halo 5, etc.) and instead puts a focus on in-your-face, bloody combat. You'll be close with your enemies in this game, rather than picking them off from a longer distance. And it's this close-quarters focus that really brings out the game's intensity. It's constant, fast-paced action all the way through, with only occasional breaks from the carnage.\n\nFor classic Doom veterans, this game is not too far from the norm of a Doom game. It's fast-paced, visceral and brutal. You can feel like a true badass again, destroying anything in your path, but you're never shy of a challenge. The demons will mess you up if you don't keep yourself killing. And of course, just like any true Doom game, you should always be on the move.\n\nThe campaign has a nice story to it, but it rarely forces you to pay attention to it. You spend more time killing demons, which is a great thing. Most story segments you can actually just walk away from and continue killing.\n\nDoom also introduces some new mechanics, such as glory kills - fully animated executions performed against your enemies, each one gory and...well, glorious. You have a variety of unique guns to choose from, just like any good first-person shooter, but in singleplayer, you get to modify your weapons with upgrades, new firemodes, and the like. You can also upgrade your suit abilities in singleplayer - anything from blast resistance, to a more intricate map. Further suit upgrades can be achieved through obtaining runes - gained by completing quick challenges. These runes let you get new benefits, such as armor-for-kills or increased mobility.\n\nThe multiplayer modes are, surprisingly, a really strong point of the game. Deathmatch game modes can get hectic and crazy, especially if you bring friends along. The "demon rune" - a powerup that lets you turn into a demon for a short amount of time - can be a real game changer, and ends up directing a lot of focus on the big guy.\n\nThere's also a level editor (SnapMap), which has it's design limits, but is still really fun and can be used very creatively. This level editor can make solo/co-op missions, wave-based survival games, bloodbath arenas...I even saw someone make a Harvest Moon-type game.\n\nIn both multiplayer and SnapMap, you're allowed to customize your weapons and armor to your liking. In multiplayer modes, things like colors, armor pieces, and extra loadout items are obtainable through an XP system. In SnapMap, though, you earn these by buying them with SnapPoints - an entirely in-game currency gained by playing and creating SnapMap levels. This system keeps you playing and creating for a good while.\n\nOverall, Doom is an amazing game for both veterans and newcomers to the series, and has an outstanding amount of content to keep you going. I would say that id Software definitely delivered us the true return to the series everyone has been waiting for - because believe me, Doom 3 sure wasn't that.","May 16","true","38.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The momentum and the pacing of this game are freakishly good. The level design and added depth is just fantastic. Each level is a sprawling open map that all last more than an hour.  Theres half a dozen secrets per level as well, I only ever managed to find 1/4 of them. You can also find parts of classic DOOM levels and play the full levels outside of the main campaign.\n\nI could only describe DOOM 4's singleplayer as near perfect.\n\nIf theres on very small issue I had with its the fact that some of the jumping puzzles in the early and mid game drag on for abit too long and are just kinda annoying.\n\nOverall multiplayer is not worth bothering with, it hasnt really improved from the BETA and its not even by Id anyway. It was outsourced to a studio that does Halo and CoD stuff. Snap map on the other hand has some potential to be a really great tool for DOOM modders and level designers to make some really great stuff. I cant wait to play some of the levels by the community soon.\n\nFinally If you dont have a 900+ plus card you can expect some preformance issues. For the most part with my 770 the game ran fine on high settings at 60 fps but I would experiance the rare frame rate drop which brought it down to 15fps for some bizarre reason. Across all cards and systems there have been some random and really annoying crashes.\n\nAll in all its a great game, RIP AND TEAR\n\n666/Cyberdemon","May 15","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Otherwise it may not properly authenticate your edition. Whether this is true or not becareful and if Doom does not work for you please post on the forums so that the developers can help us.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futarama/recommended/379720/","futarama","ƒumarata","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futarama/","151 products in account","Where to start?\n\nThe Campaign\n\nSpent 12-15 hours on my first playthrough just exploring and admiring the fully fleshed out gameplay, enviornments, and not to mention the brutally amazing soundtrack. I did a second playthrough spending twice as much time just unlocking stuff and hunting for secrets and easter eggs. I guess I was a little obsessed, but damn. If the campaign doesn't pull you in to it then you must be playing the wrong game. For this alone I felt the game was well worth the purchase. The replay factor with Nightmare and Ultra-Nightmare is just icing on the cake.\n\nSnap Map\n\nI started Snap Map tutorials a while back and finished a day or two after. It's got me hooked. Sure, there are some limitations (IMO due to cross-platform modding being enabled), but it's pretty fun just messing around with its capabilites. Even in it's current state it potentially allows for longevity of the multiplayer community. The dozen or so featured maps should give you a good idea of it's potential.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nChecked out the Multiplayer. Feels incomplete and pretty sloppy by online FPS standards. Classic games such as FFA and CTF are missing. The TDM and Warpath modes seem to not cater to teamplay.  Hitboxes and network issues make it a pretty whacky experience. Leading shots with a hitscan sniper rifle (Vortex Rifle) and still hitting targets is a pretty bad sign. Demon runes being in almost every game mode may get annoying after a while (I'm already there).\n\nMy biggest gripe with the multiplayer is the mobility hamper. The jumping is floaty, but there is no air control like the campaign had. The gunplay rewards twitch shooting and good reactions, but the mobility factors don't allow any kind of evasive maneuvers. The double jump only lets you grab higher ledges, but in reality it just makes you a floating target for a longer period of time. I question why there are so many maps with high grabbable ledges and platforms when it feels like such a risk to jump in the first place.\n\nYeah I know. It was outsourced to different devs, but in it's current state I feel it needs major improvements to stand on its own.\n\n\n\n","May 18","true","122.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Devil of The Shooters. Id software have definitely taken it up a notch with this game being added to the category of First Person Shooters. Its fast, its bloody, its gory and most of all, its ♥♥♥♥ing fun.\n\nCampaign	The campaign starts off pretty exciting and definitely with a bang. Already from the first few seconds you start the campaign you are thrown into a massive battle, fighting off demons. You play as a lone DOOM Marine whos mission is to close the portal that connects the human world and the demon world. Your objective is simple, kill every demon that you put your eyes on. No more to it.\n\nThe campaign has lots of highlights and it will keep you playing for a long time. From the start you will be handed a few different difficulties that you can choose from, and they have definitely thought of every type of player here. Like to relax and chill while killing off demons easily? How about you try the "Im too young to die difficulty" (easy)?. Like to keep the game balanced, relax and play while at the same time staying alert? Give the "Hurt me plenty"(normal) difficulty a chance. Do you fancy yourself a challenge? Go for the "Nightmare"(hardcore) mode that will give you the chills and lots to be scared about. Got balls of steel? Go for the "Ultra-nightmare mode" (Extremely hardcore) that takes nightmare mode, and adds permadeath to it? What more could you want?\n\nFurthermore, the campaign features classic DOOM gameplay. Pick up weapons, go to the next room, slaughter everyone, and pick up more awesome weapons. The campaign will last you a minimum of 13 hours depending on which difficulty you play on, if you search for secrets, do challenges, do every rune trial etc. A really cool feature I find in the campaign are the mods that you can add to your weapons. When you explore around the world of DOOM you will find small robots holding a package. When you access this package you will get a menu of the weapons that you have, and available mods that you can add to them. For each weapon (except the pistol) have 2 mods that you can choose from. You can also upgrade your characters armor, health and amount off ammo that can be carried. In addition, you will get coins that you can use to upgrade the mods that you have added to your weapons. There is also these praetor tokens that you can pick up, that you can use to upgrade your praetor suit.\n\nThe campaign is lengthy and adds a whole bunch of craziness and fun to the game. There is nothing more satisfying than slaughtering dozens of demons while listening to good, metal music. The campaign easily gets a 10/10.\n\nMultiplayerThe multiplayer is a damned masterpiece. I have played the multiplayer so much that the campaign still stands unfinished. You start up the multiplayer as a level 1 newbie and from there you start by building yourself up. At first you start off with 3 premade loadouts, but as you progress and level up you will unlock more custom loadouts that will allow you to find your own, unique playstyle. You get to choose from 2 weapons + a gadget. The weapons range from the chaingun, to the super-shotgun, combat shotgun, vortex rifle and more! Every weapon has its own pros and cons and most of the weapons are great to use depending on how you like to play.\n\nIn the multiplayer you will be able to choose from 6 different gamemodes. From the classic team deathmatch all the way to "freeze tag". Some gamemodes are known to every one, others have a little twist to it that adds to the fun. Each gamemode is unique and requires a different approach, however the game rewards you for being quick, aggressive and of course playing the objective. The multiplayer feels well polished and a lot of time has been put into balancing it. It features hack modules that basically are small powerups at the start of each round that will give you some sort of bonus that you can use to your advantage when playing. These hack modules are very well made and bring a balance to the game like I have never seen before in an FPS. In addition to your loadouts, you will be able to get your hands on power weapons and power ups that are crazy fun to use. They add a funny and classic twist to the game and you will feel so powerful when you get your hands on them. Found myself having an evil laugh when shooting enemies in the back while being completely invincible.\n\nOf course, the multiplayer also has demon ruins that either spawn randomly in some gamemodes or are fixed in other gamemodes. Everytime you pick a new loadout, you will be able to choose between 4 different demons, each with their own, unique skills, weapons and abilities. There is lots of amusement to get from these demons once you get to try them out yourself and are also an important part of the gameplay. A good demon could be a game changer, while a bad demon could give the enemy an advantage. All in all the multiplayer is great fun, and hopefully the developers will implement some sort of ranked play or e-sports as it would make the game even more great. Imagine sitting on a cold, friday night watching a DOOM ranked tournament between two big teams fighting it out for a prize. Epic.\n\nSuggestionsDOOM is a great game,  possibly the best game of 2016 so far. However, there are some minor suggestions I would like to add that I think could make the game even better!\n\n1. Giving the player the possibility to choose between 1 of 2 mods for each weapon. Unlike the campaign, where you can choose between 2 mods, the multiplayer features prechosen mods for each weapon.\n2. Adding some sorts of ranked play or implementing e-sports. Im a very competitive player and I just love e-sports. It would be awesome to see some sort of ranked matchmaking where players can get a rank based on their performance and eventually start building themselves up from there. It would be awesome to participate in DOOM tournaments or other events.\n\nSnapmapDOOM lets you build maps, gamemodes and stuff like that. Nothing more needs to be said.\n\nTL;DRJust ♥♥♥♥ing buy it already.","May 18","true","37.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I am playing in max settings(ultra) in 1440p with a GTX980 4GB and an i7 4790k CPU and the optimisation is amazing throughout my 20+ hours of gameplay iv maintained 60+ FPS.\n\nSingle player campaign\nThe main story of the game takes roughly around 10-13 hours to complete depending on if your looking for collectibles/secrets. The story evolves around Mars and Mars installations and eventually takes you to hell where the entire game world such as textures, lighting etc look beautiful. Along with amazing heavy metal guitar music and hordes of demons to kill with plenty or weaponry and executions in the form of glory kill.\n\nMulitplayer\nThe multiplayer is fun and addicting with plenty of armor and weapons customisation to choose from. Their are multiple game modes to play and although fun for a short time on your own I can very easily play the PvP side of it all day long in a group of friends.  The multiplayer reminds me of Halo but on a smaller arena and old school based scale featuring health/ammo and armor pickups aswell as powerups and special weapons.\n\nButhowever Bethesda need to sort the servers out as I have noticed even though they are dedicated multiplayer servers a few players lagging or disconnecting due to poor connection. Hopefully they will let us select our region in a future update to ensure we aren't connecting with Americans when were in the EU and vice versa.\n\nSnapmap\nSnapmap from what I can tell is a custom editing mode for creating your own maps or game modes. I have no interest in playing this but if I do I will update my review on what I think of it.\n\nOverall Verdict\nDoom is a remarkable game full of carnage, blood and guts, amazing music and hordes of demons in a truly excellent single player and multiplayer experience.\n\nBUY DOOM NOW!!\n\n8/10 - Would be a 9 if they fix the connection issues in multiplayer.\n\nDoom gets a big fat thumbs up from.","May 18","true","34.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlike Doom 3 which tried to focus more on narrative and horror aspects, DOOM brings what fans always enjoyed about the series.  Fast paced action, gory kills, sprawling level design, epic music, and wonderful boss fights.  The story is minimal to non-existent, but that is a good thing, DOOM knows what it's doing, providing an avenue for players to experience the most adrenaline fueled gameplay of the past few years in gaming.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent level design\n-Return of "Secrets" across each level\n-"Always Run" is back\n-Old School mechanics (health packs, holding all 10 weapons)\n-Epic score of industrial/metal music\n-Excellent visuals\n-Well optimized for PC\n-Gameplay is stellar\n-Enemy design is grotesque and gory\n-Memorable boss fights\n-Snapmap is a great addition to the game\n-Good length campaign (~10 hours on ULTRA-VIOLENCE difficulty)\n\nMeh:\n-Multiplayer is just OK, some old school Doom fans will be disappointed\n\nCons:\n-Some campaign arenas can get repetitive (Gore Bags)\n\nPerformance:\n\nRig Used: EVGA GTX 980 4GB of VRAM, 16GB DDR3 RAM, i5 3570K.\n\nI was able to maintain a flawless locked 60fps at 1080p resolution on ultra settings.  When unlocked, fps stays around the 90-100 mark on Ultra graphics settings.  I tested at 2560x1440, and was able to maintain 60fps, but with a few frame drops during intense sequences.\n\n","May 16","true","25.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game has so much content in single player that it didn't disappoint. The boss battles were amazing. The Cyber Demon (Not a spoiler! Doom without Cyber Demon isn't Doom) fight dwarfs the one from Doom 3.\n\nI enjoyed doing rune, weapon and level challenges while playing. They really made me vary my playstyle as I progressed. I almost never played the same way each level. I made good use of the weapon alternate firing styles. The models, weapons look amazing and the levels look great but I still believe Alien Isolation had the best space corridor levels ever, this can come second.\n\nThe story is actually really well done! It just fits. Don't expect amazing story but a story that works with this kind of game and setting; Not complex but flows well. The codex were fun to read. The BFG and Chainsaw implementation is the best so far!\n\nThe amount of enemies chasing you in tight places is amazing and the fact that they can jump ledges and chase you to almost anywhere is really scary. You need to keep on your toes to stay alive. I played on UV btw (I didn't notice that Nightmare was actually unlocked from the beginning ><).\n\nI like that glory-kills can have so many different purposes and not just a gimmick. It just works.\n\nForget the MP and Snapmap is a possible oppertunity.\n\nIt is all in the SP and there is almost little to no downtime related to Story. You can just zoom in through the entire game, bar one instance, fighting. I was hoping for a NG+ with no focus on collecting or secrets, just action. But alas that isn't implemented.\n\nOh and for those who were dissappointed in Doom 3 (and RoE) because of a missing foe, be prepared to glee in glorious joy when you reach the end of this game","May 16","true","31.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This time, the emphasis is more on pace & strafing than Doom 3, but in doing so sacrifices any proper narrative and removes the fear-factor it's predecessor had. Also, you no longer encounter any other survivors at the UAC facility, or get to wield the Crucible Artifact, making the whole experience feel a little hollow. None the less, hoards of Doom fans will still lap this up as it up's the brutal violence & Satanic sites, fusing it with thumping hardcore metal tunes.

The game has so much content in single player that it didn't disappoint. The boss battles were amazing. The Cyber Demon (Not a spoiler! Doom without Cyber Demon isn't Doom) fight dwarfs the one from Doom 3.\n\nI enjoyed doing rune, weapon and level challenges while playing. They really made me vary my playstyle as I progressed. I almost never played the same way each level. I made good use of the weapon alternate firing styles. The models, weapons look amazing and the levels look great but I still believe Alien Isolation had the best space corridor levels ever, this can come second.\n\nThe story is actually really well done! It just fits. Don't expect amazing story but a story that works with this kind of game and setting; Not complex but flows well. The codex were fun to read. The BFG and Chainsaw implementation is the best so far!\n\nThe amount of enemies chasing you in tight places is amazing and the fact that they can jump ledges and chase you to almost anywhere is really scary. You need to keep on your toes to stay alive. I played on UV btw (I didn't notice that Nightmare was actually unlocked from the beginning ><).\n\nI like that glory-kills can have so many different purposes and not just a gimmick. It just works.\n\nForget the MP and Snapmap is a possible oppertunity.\n\nIt is all in the SP and there is almost little to no downtime related to Story. You can just zoom in through the entire game, bar one instance, fighting. I was hoping for a NG+ with no focus on collecting or secrets, just action. But alas that isn't implemented.\n\nOh and for those who were dissappointed in Doom 3 (and RoE) because of a missing foe, be prepared to glee in glorious joy when you reach the end of this game","May 16","true","31.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's tight, modern, dynamic and brutal. It's not as rememberable als Doom 1 or 2, but it gets me in the mood all the time.\n+ You know what I despise about modern shooters? The fact that you can't backtrack from start to end of a level. None of this in Doom 4. You can fully explore back and forwards at your own damn leisure just like old times.\n- [edit:]...at least, that's what I thought. Unfortunately there are some too many points where the level designers thought it *would* be a good idea not to let the player backtrack all the way to the start. A weak, infuriating and ununderstandable design choice. [/edit]\n+ And there's a lot to find and explore on the levels. I would recommend disabling the compass and using the map to a bare minimum because that makes it a bit too easy to discover everything, but on the other hand.. well, suit yourself.\n-+ There are some very hard to find secrets, if you're set on discovering all of the classic maps. It's fun to actually discover one yourself without looking it up on the internet, but it's not likely to happen with every one of them.\n+ I actually like the weapon and armor upgrade system. It's redundant, but at the same time fun enough to keep yourself occupied with so why not. Same goes for the challenge levels.\n+- Enemies come in waves instead of placed thoughtfully throughout the levels. However these waves themselves have been orchestrated pretty well and are fun to beat, it's not too bad at all (one has got to love Painkiller after all).\n+- There's still something left of the chunky, too shiny too clean too round environments that made me insta-dislike Doom 3 so much back then. But many improvements have been made over it, it does look and feels good this time around.\n+- Also I'm not the biggest fan of the lighting used in this game. Sometimes it's perfectly fine, sometimes it gets very oversaturated and foggy. It's very nice and thoughtful that you can actually change the rendering to gritty or cinematic, although I find myself switching between the modes depending on where I am instead of just using one setting the whole time. It's a bit of a mixed bag to my taste.\n- Still too much exposition. Why the hell do we need a boring generic seen-it-before-too-many-times storyline? This is not Doom 3 (thank god)\n- This is Doom 4. Not Doom, not Doom 2016, Doom 4. Seriously, name your game properly guys.\n- Just ignore the multiplayer. It's not Doom, it will never be Doom. Snap Map seems interesting though, but I yet have to dive into that at this point.\n\nAll in all this game actually turned out to be great. It was really hard to believe anything good would come out of this game after that very mediocre multiplayer open beta, but you better believe it: Doom 4 is awesome. Highly recommended.","May 17","true","41.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is everything I wanted in a doom game and more! I really liked the emphasis on upgrading weapons and runes, the challenges and secrets to find in the levels. The nods to the old 90's doom games was great as well! So glad they decided to drop the old COD-like build of doom they presented a few years back, and develop this instead!\n\nThe only thing that I can think of that detracts from it, is that it's a little bit buggy, at least for me. It has hard crashed my pc two times, to the point where my pc was non-responsive and I had to do a hard reset. And one time where it just crashed to desktop. I didn't loose that much gameplay time since the checkpoints are rarely far between, but it's an annoyance none the less. There were a few bugs in-game as well, such as falling through the level, getting stuck in geometry and so on, but overall I'd say the game is pretty well polished!\n\nI used 23.5 hours to get through the singel player on hurt me plenty difficulty, and I took my time to explore the levels, search for secrets, upgrade stuff, read the lore and so on. I think most people will use about 14 hours or so to just get through the game.\n\nPros:\nFantastic graphics\nReally good level design\nTop notch character and monster design\nTop of it's class shooter\nRune and weapon upgrade system\nLots of secrets\nCons:\nA bit buggy\nMy Grade: 9/10","June 4","true","28.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Its fast and frenetic. Bethseda also brought back the Cacodemons missing in Doom3 so I'm happy. I havn't tried the multiplayer yet which was disappointing in the beta release. The graphics on my MSI GTX 780 have been solid. If you access the Doom console you can check the FPS using com_showfps 1 and switch it off with com_showfps 0. I'm getting a steady 60fps with occasional dips but I've switched it off. There are also many other console commands with cheats like unlimited ammo, god mode etc but I'm not interested in those. There are secret areas which can be revealed. I'll probably try to find those on a separate play through. The melee works well and is important to use to preserve ammo in the harder settings.

I went with "Yes" because I at least liked the game enough to finish it and Steam doesn't have a "Maybe" option. I beat the campaign on ultra violence in 9 hours.\n\nPros\n------------------------------\n-It's Doom/Hell themed. We don't get too many gorgeous video games centered around Hell.\n-It's well optimized. I was able to run the game on ultra settings at 2560x1440 while sticking mostly in the 50-60fps range off of a GTX 980.\n-The sound design is great.\n-They give you tons of options for customizing your HUD.\n-Shooting demons in the face is fun.\n\nCons\n------------------------------\n-People seem to think this is just like good ol' Doom 1 & 2 but I really don't think they remember how those played. The levels in this are set up that you'll shoot a few weak enemies on your way to a main objective marker before getting trapped in an area that you can only get out of if you kill every last enemy in the room. This formula repeats throughout the entire game. There isn't a single room that I can recall like this in my beloved Doom 2. This in no way, shape, or form is set up so you can just find the necessary keys and switches to complete a level while shooting anything that gets in your way. Shooting literally everyone in the face is the only way to progress the game. If you have never played Doom 1 or 2, the formula may still bother you but it's not as much of a letdown.\n-The story is forgettable at best. Even Doom 3 had a better reason for bringing Hell to Mars.\n-The game has pacing issues. The game has 3 speeds: stuck in a room listening to an awful story, shooting an imp or two while navigating through the map, and drinking from a firehose from hell once you're inevitably trapped in an area and forced to kill several waves of enemies.\n-Glory Kills are cool at first but once you realize that's the only way to guarantee a kill will yield health, they get annoying. It would be really cool if it was just an optional way to take a demon down but it's mandatory if you value your life.\n-Some of the weapons feel under powered. It seems like a strange system to let you upgrade the hell out of your earlier weapons only to have them be complete garbage compared to the next gun that uses the same ammo type at stock.\n-The multiplayer is infamously average and they're selling a $40 season pass for it. Strange call.","May 15","true","10.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Shortly after that, yo're tearing demons up with a shotgun. From there, it just get's more brutal.\n\nTHIS is the Doom that long time FPS fans have been waiting for. With all the same crap flooding the genre, Doom is a welcome return to what made FPS games great.\n\n- Fast paced combat with tight controls.\n- Fight and move in every angle. Demonds don't just come at you from the front.\n- Primary/secondary weapons? Nope! An arsenal on your back ensures you have multiple ways to fight at any time.\n- Great graphics yet keeps minimum specs low.\n- Lots of gore accompanied by heavy metal.\n- Actually earn the right to feel like a badass, and not just an artifical winner (*cough* COD *cough*)\n- Explore each map to find secrets, collectibles, weapons and ammo.\n- Locked door? Dead end? Tough ♥♥♥♥. Find a key or another way. Prepare to explore each map.\n- This is no corridor shooter. There is no one way only.\n- There's a story... I guess. But that's not what you're here for.\n\nThe FPS genre is sorely missing this kind of fun gameplay. Future shooters can learn A LOT from Doom. Hell, they could learn a lot from any of the Doom games.\n\nOverall, an excellent game and looking to be the shooter of the year. Maybe even the decade. Hell, since the last Doom.\n\nWelcome home Doomguy. We missed you.","May 18","true","13.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Shortly after that, yo're tearing demons up with a shotgun. From there, it just get's more brutal.\n\nTHIS is the Doom that long time FPS fans have been waiting for. With all the same crap flooding the genre, Doom is a welcome return to what made FPS games great.\n\n- Fast paced combat with tight controls.\n- Fight and move in every angle. Demonds don't just come at you from the front.\n- Primary/secondary weapons? Nope! An arsenal on your back ensures you have multiple ways to fight at any time.\n- Great graphics yet keeps minimum specs low.\n- Lots of gore accompanied by heavy metal.\n- Actually earn the right to feel like a badass, and not just an artifical winner (*cough* COD *cough*)\n- Explore each map to find secrets, collectibles, weapons and ammo.\n- Locked door? Dead end? Tough ♥♥♥♥. Find a key or another way. Prepare to explore each map.\n- This is no corridor shooter. There is no one way only.\n- There's a story... I guess. But that's not what you're here for.\n\nThe FPS genre is sorely missing this kind of fun gameplay. Future shooters can learn A LOT from Doom. Hell, they could learn a lot from any of the Doom games.\n\nOverall, an excellent game and looking to be the shooter of the year. Maybe even the decade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KETNAR/recommended/379720/","KETNAR","KETNAR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KETNAR/","140 products in account","Note: I'm only marking this game as recommended pertaining to the single player, NOT THE MULTIPLAYER, WHICH IS TERRIBAD.\nAs of this writing I have completed the single player route on ultra violence and played enough multiplayer to reach level 20-something (after putting 8+ hours into the open beta, and being very little different from that, I didn't feel like playing multiplayer anymore.)\n\nThe good (SP):\nThe music KICKS MAJOR DEMON BACKSIDE. (even the menu music is amazing.)\nThe guns are nice and varied, but each one has its strong and weak situations.\nThe game isn't EZ-mode walkabout like some big-name FPS games, and it doesn't hold your hand TOO much.\nThe audio (aside from the music) is VERY good, very punchy and visceral, it makes the game sound alive and ..well, DOOM-y.\nThe enemy AI isn't scripted. It's also not stupid. They can do just about any move you can, and then some. Some are combat closers, some rush, some hang back and shoot from range, but they also change their roles depending on what you are doing to their fellow bad guys. In short, VERY well done.\nThe glory-kill system is fun, and varied enough that you don't get sick of using it.\nThe maps, look, amazing. The DEMONIC maps even more so, there are varied details everywhere, the overall feel of the maps change as you get further toward key places, giving a solid feel of progression through the world and into the pits of hell, and then back again.\nThe animations all across the board are some of the best I have ever seen in an action title.\nThe character design going WITH those animations is also top notch.\nThe writing and world building entries are thick and plenty, clearly showing that Bethesda does in fact care about game lore and whatnot even if its DOOM. I enjoyed reading every thing I unlocked/encountered.\nThe bad (SP):\nThere is a little too much micromanagement, upgrades to your suit and weapons and whatnot. It's not really what a DOOM game needs, but its not done poorly either.\nPeriodically the glory-kill system will put your camera thru a wall or map object for a few moments (however, never getting stuck when this happens is nice),but its also very rare.\nStrange bug when loading a map/restarting a map. Might be driver related.. game will choke down to exceedingly low FPS and stay there until you alt-enter the game to a window and then alt-enter it full screen again. (this also happened in RAGE as well, and was later fixed.), but again, this happens rarely, and only at the very start of a area, so its fairly minor.\nA few CTD's here and there. (Crash to desktop) Only had about 4 the entire play through, showing this is very much a Bethesda game... :) This will likely be fixed.\nOVERALL:\nI highly recommend the crap out of this game for the single player, its as good if not WAY better than Bethesda's work on Wolfenstien, and I'm looking forward to more playthroughs and secret finding and unlocking of all the goodies. I might even make some stuff in snap-map.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf your interest in this game is single player, stop reading, from here on in things get nasty, mean, and ugly REAL fast.\n\nI had a scathing review of all the problems in the multiplayer beta, it sat on the front page of the beta review for four days and had a %87+ ratio at the time the beta was taken down. I pointed out the blatent halo-ism of the multiplayer, the problems with the audio, netcode, the weapons balance and the, frankly, lack of effort put into making the multipayer. Now that the game is released, I have gone back and re-evaluated all my previous points of concern and..well, here you have it.\n\nThe good? (MP):\nIt looks nice, being as all the game assets are from the single player, that is to be expected.\nYou can unlock stuff that looks neat. (It even looks like they yanked some of the halo-lookalikes and replaced them with variants that fit the new-doom-lore better.)\nIt has guns..?\nThe pings seem to be better, but that doesn't mean a whole lot since the servers are all entirtely hosted by Bethesda and ID, they just added more capacity on their end.\nThe bad..(MP):\nNO CO-OP? WHAT THE EVER LOVING HELL BETHESDA? No, really. Which one of you guys-in-ties thought that was a good design choice? Because you need to be slapped upside the head with the north end of a southbound pinkie demon.\nEvery game mode is basically team deathmatch. No, really. In this game mode you chase and guard a circle! In this game mode there are more than one circle and they sit still! In THIS one you are playing team deathmatch and you just have to pick up an extra thing people drop when they die! And in THIS one.. Well, you get the idea. Do you LOVE team deathmatch? Because Certain Affinity sure as ♥♥♥♥ does, and NOTHING ELSE. This is DOOM.. and there is no straight up ♥♥♥♥ing deathmatch anywhere. And I couldn't even test Clan arena because *no players were found*.. just a few days after launch.\nThe Audio is even *more ♥♥♥♥ed than the beta*.. Before, you could hear firefights clear across the map.. but not rockets exploding on your back or in your face. Now you can't hear really anything. No, really, you can't hear a rocket explode 2 inches on the ground behind you. But you can hear this... really strange.. pitter patter sound that I think is supposed to be.. bullets hitting things? In the far far distance like somebody was tapping away at the nearest wall with a BB-gun. It literally makes no sense.\nWeapon balance is still completely hosed. They basically didn't change anything from the beta they just unlocked the rest of the weapons you can use. Combined with the fact you can't /hear weapon fire around you/ for beans, the super shotgun is pretty much an instant kill gun. Supershotgun+glorykill-button-spam=win. That's how to multiplayer.\nExplosions still basically do nothing, nothing has knock back in this game.\nThe little numbers that pop off players when you shoot them.. seem to be calculated client side, and therefor sometimes highly inaccurate. (When I hit a guy for 25-25-25-25-25-25-25-15.. and he kills me, and the post-kill screen shows him as having 85 health left at the time he killed me, I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on your game code skillz, K?)\n\nI could go on, but frankly.. I don't care anymore.\n\n\nMultiplayer Roundup:\nThis is not the next 'doom multiplayer' or even the next 'Action FPS multiplayer' experience, its just 'generic multiplayer FPS with a doom skin and a demon spawn', its not even a contender for competitive FPS play, its strictly casual nonsense and frankly its not even really that fun after the first hour or two.\n\n\nRemember all that 'feedback' they were gathering from the multiplayer beta for 'development reasons'? Remember how I warned you it was all a big fat marketing lie? Yeah, it was. They changed one thing, the stupid audio bias, and they didn't even fix it, they fudged it even more. That is it. The weapons are still jacked, the game modes people all asked for are not there, nobody can host a dedicated server. Yep, that's the list. So the console kids who think this is as good as FPS multiplayer can get are gobbling it up, and will abandon the game as soon as the next shiny thing rolls past. The multiplayer is more or less as forgettable as I feared after the beta.\n\nI give it 6 months and it'll be a ghost town unless there is some severe intervention by the developers. (which IS possible, and if that happens, I'll update this review!)","May 16","true","67.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The campaign is very fun and doesn't waste your time with too much exposition, it thrusts you into the action right away. However, if you're looking for a multiplayer game, look elsewhere. While it isn't bad per se, it feels a bit generic, especially compared to the campaign.\n\nPros:\n-Fast paced, challenging gameplay\n-Feels like a modernized version of the classic (in a good way)\n-Looks amazing, even on the lowest settings\n-Tons of secrets\n-Minimal cutscenes/story\n-Good variety of weapons, both classic and new\n-Great mix of exploration and combat\n-Pacing feels almost perfect\n-SnapMap works great, and there's already some pretty awesome fan-created levels\n\nCons:\n-Multiplayer is mediocre and feels a bit generic\n-SnapMap has some unnecessary limitations (such as only being able to carry 2 weapons)\n-Regular deathmatch can only be done through SnapMap (which is limited to 4 players)\n-The ending is kinda lame (not that it really matters)","May 15","true","37.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The map design, the effort put in to make each map vast and exciting, Hell, I spent a good hour trying to find secrets on E1M2. The story (so far) seems to be well enough put together, and I like that it isn't (really) the focus of the Campaign. Overall, the Singleplayer is what I mainly came for.\n\nNow for the Multiplayer,\n\nSuprisingly, the beta recieved many Negative reviews, but once DOOM was released today, It seems they made some improvements. A beta is a beta, its may or may not be the final product. I love the customization of weapons and armor. The demon powerup still seems overpowered to me, but its extremely fun to player as the Baron of Hell or the Mancubus, etc. I'm not really into the Hack modules, I don't use them. The six modes are very diverse, and are each fun in their own ways. If you were one who was disappointed by the beta, you should check out the multiplayer again. Overall, better multiplayer than expected.\n\nFinally, DOOM SnapMap.\n\nI haven't explored DOOM SnapMap much yet, but from I've experienced, and seen elsewhere, its very impressive. There are almost endless possibilities to make things, ranging from story maps to a functioning keyboard. I plan on making a map, just for the fun of it.\n\nTo sum it up,\n\nSingleplayer - 9.5/10 Overall Amazing, but maybe a little short.\nMultiplayer - 9/10 Much better than expected, but still lacking in balancing, etc.\nSnapMap - 10/10 Fanominal maker with so many possibilities and a lot of customization\nGraphics - 10/10 They really outdid themselves, most likely one of the prettiest games I've seen.\nBalancing - 9/10 Great for the most part, Multiplayer needs work.\nTruely DOOM - 9/10 closer to the original dooms than doom 3, but the multiplayer is more like halo than doom.\n\nThis is worthy of being a DOOM game, and I recommend you buy it (off cdkeys for 38 dollars).","May 13","true","25.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Really fast paced action that requires you to always be on the move.\n\nThe graphics.\nThe game looks and performs great, but, i did notice that this iD Tech 6 engine shares some of the downsides of iD's previous engine (iD Tech 5), enviroment textures sometimes look really bland and in my opinion not on par with the rest of the game's graphical qualities, also, texture streaming issues while far less noticeable when compared to iD Tech 5 games, it still exists here. Those aside, the lighting and shadows are fantastic, gun and demon models are very detailed, decals and effects look great, but most importantly it performs really well, smooth at all times, probably the most optimized game to come out on PC this year, no bugs, no crashes, excellent performance even with all graphic options set to maximum. Great job iD Software.\n(At the time of this review there was still no proper SLI support, iD has promised to fix this in the coming days)\n\nThe sound is great as well, just listen to those heavy metal riffs while you cut an Imp in half with your chainsaw!\n\nThat's it, now i have to go back to kill more demons and finish the campaign.\n\nBuy this game and have fun!","May 13","true","53.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

I played a couple of hours with it and The Verdict for me with about 2 hours of gameplay. Solid, amazing, Feeling Classic and new. It is Amazing and Great and not something to shrug at because its Bethesda or being Triple A. Granted the Multiplayer is a disappointed in many ways in terms of the "Default" settings, there is some Classic stuff in Snapmap options but thats it.\n\nOn to the real game, If you have the money and you were skeptical. I would say that there is nothing That Wrong with the game. It starts strong, Gets stronger. and its hella fun. the gunplay is exactly what you would want in a classic style like game of the old doom, ROTT and Quake. the Weapon Mod system is not bad addition an feels fluent with how they work. the monsters all have very specific game styles and how to avoid them, Movement is fast and hectic and only stops once rooms are cleared just like how the old days where. there is never a instant respawn of unlimited enemies. Look Fantastic and would say everything there is a good Solid Doom game. Though for me Personally There are some features I dont like but its not a insult or a ruiner of the game but stings me in a small way in terms of the mechanic choose they imposed.\n\nThe First one is that the Glory Execution Kills, While Graphical its damn impressive in the mechanics and how much scripting they used, Different animations based on where your Doom Marine position is and where you are looking gives you different types. However, what im not impressed by is you are almost Reliant of them which I was hoping was not the case. When you use any weapon, it takes a couple of shots to cause them to be in a "stunned" state. then you can just walk up and Press Melee. the problem I see is that if you want Extra Ammo and Health drops from them, This is your only way besides the Chainsaw, To get such items. If you picked up all the health and ammo picks up on the map normally. you have to resort to Animation Kills over and over just to get it back. and the Chainsaw if you want a Plethora of ammo back using its ammo charge in a instant animation kill. I will understand the animations are very quick of about .8 to 1.3 seconds depending on the enemy. But the fact you are Reliant of such mechanic to stay alive bugs me on a personal level.\n\n2nd, Im Perfectly fine with a upgrade system in a game, as long as it doesnt feel forceful or doesnt seem stupid to add upgrades for upgrades sake. and For new Doom, Im hesitant. There are on average 3 to 5 upgrades per Module Per weapon, and there are about 10 weapons in the game I believe. You earn the weapon upgrades through "challenges" (one example was to do 5 Glory Kills on the possessed) to get Weapon Upgrade points, and are different challenges Per level. Then there is your Praetor suit, which you earn those upgrades through dead elite guards in hidden areas to collect there chips. Then the Argent Cells to permanent upgrade your health. armor and ammo Capacity. THEN there is the Rune system that gives different characteristics that can be changed on the fly. To me personally I feel that was a bit to much upgrading ideas for the Sake of Upgrading. the only argue rebuttal Ive heard was "it has a New Game Plus, for Nightmare or Perma Death mode". But for me, If Bethseda didnt claim "this is Doom back to its roots" or "no cutscenes fast pace action demon killing" then I would let all of the upgrading slide. but they did and it feels unnecessary to me in Some Departments, not all Mind you.\n\nThose are Personal complaints that no way derail the game or makes me feel its bad, because its not in any way. The overabundance of Secrets to be found. a Map that can be access to figure out locations and areas of those secrets is so much fun again in the years I havent seen such a thing because some indie like titles (like ROTT 2013 Reboot). Im a little sad the map does show you exactly what items to be found, like Elite Guards, Bots to get Mod purchases etc. But it doesnt change how much you can move in this game. It never seems that you are locked out from a passed location During a level. Once you finish what is considered the Level, then you can no longer return to that location and move forward. The Jumping is amazing to feel and climbing everything makes you look carefully for any location that can be used for such puzzles in a sense.\n\nGraphical amazing, Runs super smooth. can turn off Motion Blur, DoF, and have a FOV of 130 for PC (and I believe Consoles now have such a option). Feels fresh then most games and in a lot of ways not something to shine away from. The singleplayer is a lot of fun so far. There are a lot of dialogue that seems to happen but its usually breif with one paragraph of words that you can just Walk away from hearing, to most of it being a Codex system in your menus detailing all environments, datalogs, demon creatures, and the weapons. Happy to be there if you like to read, or ignore for just more killing demons. Its bloody its gorey and it works for a Triple A for once.\n\nBuy it if you have the money, Its not a waste of time. It is not a Disappointed, its not a failed hype train. It is a new Doom that besides some minor complaints I Personally have. Im Happy, Excited and loving to play it more.","May 13","true","22.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But the strange thing is i get the same feeling i got when playing as a child ( - the cheats ofc, and - the scared meheh) so for all you oldschool DOOM fans thinking this might be some kind of COD clone or somthing like that, fear not.

Not only has this release featured throwback gameplay combat elements, it has completely out shown the recent trend of monotonous red screen duck and wait shooters that have become a fps genre norm.\n\nBringing back the classic health and armor pickups was genius, but I was not looking forward the the issues this classic system brought with limited item availability per level, the search this involved, and limitations it made. With this release ID has completely revamped the mechanic and has incorporated them into a driving force to live and push the player to take increasingly higher risks to succeed and excel in combat.\n\nA problem with many classic run and gun shooters was in many ways the monotonous non stop action. There were rarely moments for the player to stop and be immersed in the story or environment. The constant push to continue moving the entire game caused in a large part a haze over the experience. Going through a level would often simply involve mashing keys and constantly clicking the mouse until the next loading screen. It even popularized buying a mouse with auto-fire button so you would not tire your finger and hardware.\n\nWith this release of doom it has not only brought back the positives of that classic gameplay but has remastered it in a way that brought a balance to combat, plot, unlockables, secrets, and character progression that is a evolution in a lot of ways doom 3 was with it's unique 2 way lighting engine that inspired a more reserved horror survival style incorporating the ability to choose between seeing the horror that befell UAC Mars and actually being able to combat it to survive.\n\nI am 12 hours into DOOM and constantly remarking how impressed I have been so far and continue to be.\n\nTHIS IS THE DOOM WE HAVE ALL WAITED FOR.\n\nUnfortunately, the season pass is not. At this point it is shown as only featuring content for online combative multiplayer and snap map features.\n\nAs a classic DOOM fan, I am not interested a COD online rehash or Halo reach style unlockable armor skin dress up features.\n\nI am here for the campaign. The continuation of a world I have grown up with and continue to want to learn more about. The one that I am consistently learning more about every time I replay Doom 3 and re-live emails, audio logs, video training sessions, and immersive plot elements.\n\nThis recent release of DOOM brought back the classic gameplay I loved with the originals and paid respect to Doom 3 and continuation of the revolution in immersive content and gameplay.\n\nThe Season pass does not, but there is hope.\n\nAs doom 3 had a full game expansion, and wolfenstein the new order also has a full game expansion "bad blood" I am hoping that if there is not going to be included either several small dlc levels, expanded single player content included campain levels or secrets, weapons, mods, or the ability to co-op the existing single player campaign with increased difficulty included in this upcoming season pass then hopefully an additional full game expansion will be released in the near future.\n\nAs a long standing doom fan I have waited years for a new release.  So often with new pc releases in the past couple years we have not only had sub par performance with console ports, bad hardware support, horrible optimization issues, locked or not available settings,but the fact that most games for pc upon release will crash and not even run until patched months later by the video card manufacturer as developer support after the base release is continually dropped soon after collection of pre-order funds.\n\nID delivered on it's promise to the doom community and brought a sequel we can stand by and continue to play for many years to come. They brought the PC gaming community a stable release including everything we need and continue to lack from most recent releases.\n\nAll I am asking for is the same I have been asking for many years now.

No, it's ♥♥♥♥ing PERFECT.  You'll be tearing the map inside out looking for those last damned secrets, the fights just get better and better the more enemy types they throw at you (and the more firepower you throw back) and the Nightmare difficulty is actually a challenge.  I'm frankly amazed that they translated the gameplay so well to a modern game, from essentially a 2D topology (and gameplay) to 3D as well.\n\nMultiplayer? Meh.  Needs some more work.  The weapons are inherently unbalanced and the guns are not satisfying.  The speed is okay but feels slower than it actually is because too many of the wrong weapons are weak e.g. rocket launcher, and the game is very unhappily married with this horrendous two-weapon loadout system.  Why did they have to introduce THAT element, especially when the single player game does not, thank God?  Also the announcer sounds like he's a centuries-old wizard with just as much understanding of the game.  Bad, bad.  Tragic thing is the finishing-touch work to make multiplayer as evil and nosebleed-inducing as it ought to be is a couple of hours work, if that.  Except for new VA work, obviously.\n\nOverall get it today for the satisfying single player, if you're a Doom fan.  Don't bother with multiplayer until it's actually worked on a bit more.  The multiplayer would probably be a bit more okay if the single player wasn't such a glorious masterpiece right alongside it, making the multiplayer look even more of an afterthought.\n\nSnapmap is more of the same as multiplayer sadly, the tool itself is pretty darned cool but for all of its options it is limited by the imposed limits set to keep the framerate up on consoles and minimum spec PCs.

It took me approximately 18 hours to complete on Hurt Me Plenty difficulty--I have explored a lot and tried to get as much secrets and upgrades as possible but I did not replayed any missions.\n\nI enjoyed the campaign tramendously. This is certainly different experience as moder story-driven shooters I was playing lately. Gameplay was fast and action packed. Gory kills proven to be integral part of the gameplay as they allow you good sustainability. Chainsaw is another great element that allows you play strategicaly. The game also offers a lot of exploration and properly rewards you for it.\n\nVisuals and audio are great. The game looks stunning and plays butter smooth without single hicup on my GTX970 at medium to high details. Audio was powerful, both weapons and music, and perfectly matched franctic action this game offers.\n\nI have not tried Snap-map or Multiplayer so far. Singleplayer campaign was great and refreshing experience. I'm looking forward to compare this to Homefront: The Revolution -- undoubtly both games are very different but it will be interesting to see how these games compare and where is their main strength.\n\nMy rating for Doom is 9/10 (single-player campaign only, no MP rating).","May 14","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I still got the original xbox version here next to me and this game doesn't disappoint. It is so fast paced, in all honesty, you can call this Doom 4 without ruining the franchise.\n\nThe game gives you acces to 3 game modes; campaign, multiplayer and snapmap.\n\n\nCampaign:\nThis is actually a fun story! I've laughed several times to the bad puns and also to some glorious kill moments (yes I might be a bit sadistic...). Demons have invaded and it is your job to shoot every single one of them down.. or ya know, snap their necks and bash their heads in. The campaign consist out of several chapters, each covering their own unique levels with collectibles, free upgrades, enemies, goals and ofcourse some story progress. Compared to the Doom I had on the xbox the scary part got kinda removed (but hey I was a small kid back then so it might've been scary due the creatures), but it is so lovely to just massacre everything. You're an overpowered agile entity that gives no ♥♥♥♥s, last time I've played with such a character was with prototype (played it later than crysis).\n\nBut once again, god ♥♥♥♥ing damnit, I never expected campaign to be this amazing!!!! I mean it has been several years, how the hell can they pick up the doom feeling? Well they actually did and they improved it where it was needed and they squeezed out an amazing nuclear demonic baby with 2 other game modes. This stuff reader, if you purchase this make sure to have a holiday or so and no exams ahead or you'll be doomed.\n\n\nMultiplayer:\nClosed alpha; many flaws, much balancing to do; simple environment.\nClosed beta; less flaws, 2 game modes, decently balanced, but bazooka fest, demons!\nOpen beta; minor bugs, 2 game modes, balanced; massacre.\nFinal product; no bugs, 6 game modes, more balanced than a 2 coloured pudding, fast paced killing spree.\n\nAfter each session they took our feedback to the heart and implemented it. I've written long essays on their site for testers and I feel like it was read and used for a more balanced game. This leaves a customer like me with a good feeling. The improvements were noticeable and I absolutely can say that if things have to be improved, they will definitely do it with the given feedback!\n\nMultiplayer now has 6 game modes. TDM, warpath, soul harvest, domination, freeze tag, clan arena.\nTDM: basic team deathmatch with a goal of total kills to achieve.\nWarpath: conquer the moving zone and keep defend it from enemies, or capture the one from the enemies. The zone gives points and you need an x amount of points to win/lose.\nSoul Harvest: There is ALWAYS a demon, so no spawning rune, the first killer gets the demon rune as drop. Every kill drops 1 soul and you need to collect an x amount of enemy souls to win.\nDomination: There are several non moving zones to capture now, each gives points over time and you need the most points to win.\nFreeze tag: probably the funniest one, killing an enemy freezes the enemy. Freezing all enemy players results in victory. Standing next to a frozen ally will melt them. 3 ouf of 5 matches wins.\nClan arena: There is no such thing as clans in here, it is basically team deathmatch with only 1 life. 3 out of 5 matches wins.\n\n\nSnapmap (level builder):\nThis tool will get me hooked for several days. I will start building maps after my final exam, or else I will be in trouble.... But! This tool is really nice, it kinda reminds me of trackmania canyon where you could build tracks. Here you allign several segments and you place some objects in them. Trust me the map builder is pretty advanced. From big ♥♥♥ mazes to tiny detailed spaces!\n\n\nOptimizations:\nA stable average of 125fps 1080p at the highest possible settings. My setup it a i7 4790k @ 4.8ghz, 32gb ddr3 ram @ 1866mhz, nvidia 980ti. Now not everyone can afford a high-end/enthousiast setup, but With this rig I've had several other AAA games running at the same preset achieving fps of less than 80. So lowering down the settings would allow you to play on a potato. The graphics are absolutely amazing though, even at low quality. Push your system if you can, it is worth it. But yeah this game is optimized and I can say for sure it runs great on any system. However make sure to have your drivers up to date, that goes for both amd and nvidia, otherwise you might experience some lag and stutter in during the cutscenes..","May 13","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Optimized for speed, an expression of love for the pc gamer with keyboard in one hand and mouse in the other.  With much attention to detail on how the world looks when you move your mouse, or strafe, or pull that trigger.  I hadn't experienced such a glass smooth response engine since the days of quake.  We've become accustomed to inferior games with their instant hit mechanics, de-emphasized movement of projectiles in space, dumbed down 'trust me you hit something' hit markers.  Doom brings back something we've been missing and raises a bloody middle finger to all recent first person shooters that came before it.   Aim matters, weapon switching matters, distance matters, and you the player have become an artist.  At your disposal is an arsenal of destructive weapons.  It's up to you to paint that canvas with blood.  Doom is a jolting realization of what we've been missing out on.  Other games have taken shortcuts and denied us a pure visceral experience that our computers,  our internet connections, and our skills were capable of all along.

I had very high hopes for this game because DOOM and DOOM II were my very first FPS experiences on the PC when I was growing up. I've only played 2 levels so far and this game has already proven to be everything I could hope for X5. The nostalgia is unreal,  this game is literally the original DOOM on horse steroids.  It brings back all the original aspects of doom, keycards, weapons, health pack, armor, even the map system has a likeness of the old one but upgraded with a 3-D view of the area you discover, but of course the most important part is the demon slaughter fest and secret areas, the absolute best part of playing DOOM. I dont think there is a game out that has made me happier than seeing this brought to life.  Proud owner of the collectors edition, Worth every penny.

The story was action packed, kept you moving, and would make a great movie (like doom 3). The monsters were very well done to this art style, the cyber demon I wasn’t a fan off but you can’t fix perfect (doom 1). The rest is just great, fast paced alot to do, level are for the most part really well done, then ontop of the campaign being worth the money you get a puzzle game/map design, which can be coop. Multiplayer is there, haven’t really messed with it other than beta, but really you’re getting 3 games in one. Potentially with all the maps being made you could have endless fun, since in snap map you earn points so it’s something to "shoot" for, even though it’s all just customizing your doom marine look. It’s worth it and stays true to the doom name. It just shocked me that it turned out this good.\n\nAlso play snap maps over the classic unlocks you get oin campaign they are not as cool as they sound, they are set in lower difficulty and rather just play the old levels the way they were, since playing one you get all amped up for the next level and it just ends no stat page, if they made them exact with a twist maybe but they didn’t, all in all game is worth the money and story worth your time.\n","May 17","true","61.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderlol/recommended/379720/","murderlol","Murderlol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderlol/","1449 products in account","DOOM is a surprise hit for a lot of people and one that I've been following and anticipating for a while. The singleplayer campaign is one of the best I've played in many years. It's a strong throwback to the old doom games, from the keycards to the fast paced action, to the secrets, this game deserves the name DOOM. The weapons feel beefy and powerful, the enemies explode into fountains of blood and gore, and the sound design to go with it is top notch. The level design is what really shines, always giving you plenty of chance to explore and find secrets and always leading you along without playing the game for you and telling you exactly what to do (ala CoD). The singleplayer for DOOM is a breath of fresh air in today's gaming climate.\n\nThe multiplayer isn't quite as strong. It's still good and has plenty of game modes, customization and progression to keep people busy. It isn't for everyone but it's still quite a bit of fun if you like arena shooters. I should mention that the game uses a loadout system instead of weapon pickups (power weapons are still pickups).\n\nSnapmap is a useful tool that people can use to make custom singleplayer and multiplayer levels. It's easy to use and powerful enough to make some fun, decently complex levels but not the same as having actual mod tools.\n\nMy only major gripe with DOOM is the lack of actual mod support and mod tools. It seems they made snapmap to fill that void but it's really not the same thing and especially with it being a DOOM game, that just doesn't feel right. Overall though DOOM is a fantastic entry into the series that surprised a lot of people by being unarguably one of the best games of the year.","May 17","true","22.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have always found fast paced fps multiplayer games, ever since Quake world to a bit of a minefield for knowing if a game is good or not. You can never trully say a game is good or bad just by playing multiplayer.\n\nI urge for anyone thinking of getting this game to ask yourself, are you a single player or multiplayer person? SP is defintiely me and because of that, this is why I believe this game has done an awesome job.\n\nWith all my settings set to Ultra (There is one more step known as Nightmare but you need a 5GB GFX card to support it) it runs butter smooth at constant 60fps. I see no screen tearing, no lag, no nothing. The AI of hellspawn and depending on which difficulty you choose is on par, they all have their own way of coming for you.\n\nAs you play through the game there is so much to do for a SP FPS, but it does not hinder the game as most FPS's that try to add side projects to it. The upgrades for weapons, armour, runes etc are very well done and the mini games mixed in to get the runes just add to the flavour.\n\nThere is a very well put together overview of the environments, artifacts, weapons, monsters etc. that really give you the feel that you are part of something in that world and you are learning of why, what, where, who, when and how.\n\nI am yet to play with Snapmap, but from what I've seen in terms of how it works, people out there who are not the best at creating extra content for a game can find it very easy and there is so much that can add in via the community. Definitely giving it a lot more playability rather than just straight up SP or Multi.\n\nOverally if I was to rate this out of 10, it would definitely be a 9. The only reason it wouldn't be 10 is because it is missing the most memorable part of any old school game that is current, CO OP.","May 23","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It is Doom, there is lots of demon slaying and plenty of guns to slay said demons with. But after finishing the game in 13 hours, and because of how it ended, I am beginning to wonder if the game manufacturers aren't attempting a bit of a cash grab.\n\nThe game is pretty linear. Get from A to B while killing everything inbetween that is not you. There is a villian whom you're trying to catch and you also get to uncover pieces of the story as you go along. The story is pretty much a side to the main dish: shooting stuff. And here it is fun. If you stand still, you're going to have a bad time. There are some areas where it is difficult to move around and it can be frustrating trying to do the thing they want you to do but in little space to do it in. However, on the whole, strafing, jumping and shooting your way through an area is lots of fun.\n\nThe bad parts though? The game is repetitive to the point that is predictable. You walk into a round/oval shaped room with lots of ammo, armour and health which means a fight is about to go down. It is not scary at all - Doom 3 was a lot scarier - and you'll find yourself wandering from area to area barely taking anything in. Every now and then you'll come across a log or hologram explaining some of the demented stuff they did to summon demons, but again it's thrown in more as justification for doing what you do. They could have expanded on the story a whole lot more because it's easy to feel like you're just running around and shooting stuff for the sake of running around and shooting stuff.\n\nMany of the reviews I've read praise it for getting back to its roots or being the real Doom, but they could have done more than just sprinkle a story inbetween shooting stuff, climbing on stuff and melee attacking stuff. The Glory Kills (melee finishers) are not a bad idea, but they are really just soft quick time events. Shoot the demon until it flashes then hit the melee button to finish it off. You're then rewarded with health, ammo and armour, which sprinkles about like a pinyata has blown it's load.\n\nThe developers have a good game on their hands, but it seems like it's missing some stuff. For example, there are like only 2 NPCs you interact with throughout the game. It's pretty much demon shooting all the way. The game looks nice but the levels are pretty much the same: walk down a corridor towards a room or area where you're going to shoot stuff then proceed to the next level.\n\nHere are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Shooting hordes of demons and fighting demon bosses is fun\n- Power-ups help you lay the smack down that much harder on demons\n- You can upgrade your weapons, armour and equipment. You can increase your maximum health, armour and ammo capacities, which is a nice touch.\n- You're constantly moving when fighting, so it forces you to think about what the best weapons are for the environment, as well as for the specific demons you're facing.\n- Melee finishers come in handy, especially when ammo and health start running low.\n- The game is rather forgiving when you do, allowing you to just reload from the last checkpoint, which is usually not far from when you entered an area.\n\nCons:\n- Combat is repetitive, especially during boss fights. I remember finding myself just circle strafing and shooting many times because it worked rather well.\n- Not much of a story, which is a shame because Doom 3's PDA system made the game more immersive.\n- Level design tends to be similar when entering areas where you're going to fight some demons.\n- The ending is a bit of a let down. They're probably looking to profit from DLC later.\n- The game "feels" fast-paced only because demons are quick and you're constantly trying to avoid projectiles. Your character, though, can feel slow because he is set to one speed.\n\nI'd give the game a 7/10 because it is fun, but it hasn't got much in the way of substance.","May 23","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mje/recommended/379720/","mje","MOGUL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mje/","206 products in account","I'll update this as I continue through the game, but here are my initial thoughts:\n\nThis game instantly feels more like DOOM than any game since 1996. Combat is extremely fast-paced, and by the second mission, even on the normal difficulty, you're circle-strafing around the room just trying to stay alive while you pick off anything you can. It feels like the most intense Ultra-Violent maps from the original games, with movement speed turned up beyond Nightmare! levels.\n\nOne of the major strengths of the originals' design was the weapon balance, in that every weapon was a tool for a specific job. That has returned in an even more pronounced way with the new DOOM. It's clear the developers understand, gameplay-wise, what made the originals so good. From what I can tell, they've captured and refined those qualities here.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nMy initial review was written while I had something like ~7 hours in the game. At the time of this update, I've played about 40 hours, the vast majority of tha being the singleplayer campaign and maybe ~10% of it in team deathmatch.\n\nI've completed the singleplayer campaign from scratch twice now, once on Ultra-Violence and once on Nightmare.\n\nI'll elaborate on what I've already written. DOOM (2016) gets everything right that the first game did, and in fact, does it better. Aesthetics aside, what made the first game so cool was its gameplay elements consisting of harmonization between the weapon balance, player movement, and enemy types and what they brought to the table for you to work with.\n\nThe first game had enemies that caused you to use certain weapons depending on your position in relation to theirs, as well as affecting your movement. Dodge projectiles by strafing, evade the demon by backpeddling, keep enemy positions in check by charging forward. Take cover against hitscan weapon enemies. This game features all of this and more. Well, actually I guess not hitscan enemies, but I digress.\n\nPlayer movement is extremely fast, lack of bunnyhopping notwithstanding, and movement is absolutely essential to success. This is the only game I've ever played that kind of felt like the original DOOM's movement. The inertia isn't quite there, nor is wallrunning, but it feels right, and it feels good.\n\nCombat is very hard until you have enough experience to understand what to upgrade and how to leverage your strengths. I recommend starting on Ultra-Violence and moving up. It will challenge you hard, and it's fun every second of the way.\n\nThe soundtrack is brutal and intense. The compression on the drums, especially, makes for some psychotic slams and it fits the combat very well. There are hints of old DOOM songs in there, too, so veterans that listen closely might be able to pick them out. Off the top of my head, I can think of four references that are present in varying degrees of completeness.\n\nCommentary on game systems and multiplayer might be coming in the future with another update.\n\nBottom line is this: I've only fallen harder for this game after spending ~30 more hours playing since the initial write-up. I still highly recommend this. I believe this is probably the best singleplayer shooter ever created.\n\nUPDATE 2: Multiplayer\n\nI've spent the last three days or so playing a lot of team deathmatch. I've managed to level up to Echelon 3 rank 20-something (that means level to 50, then level to 50 again, and again, and then 20-something more levels) (updated: I've since leveled to echelon 6 and I might get to 8 before I sleep tonight). Somewhere between 15-20 hours of play I think (now over 30).\n\nDOOM TDM is the best Halo game ever for PC. Why do I (and others) compare the game to Halo? There is an unmistakable influence found in everything from the announcer's tone, to the game design, down to the player models and maps. Everything in the MP game's design has been touched by the influence of Halo. Let me elaborate before rambling on random multiplayer thoughts.\n\nLet's start by pointing out that it just doesn't feel like id deathmatch. Two-weapon loadouts. Power weapons. There are only team modes. No duel modes. Only huge, extremely complex maps. The weapon set has been expanded with several new items that specifically feel very Halo. There's not only one sniper weapon (the vortex rifle). There are like three. That's very Halo. There's even one called the BR that shoots in bursts of three, which ought to remind any Halo veteran of a certain infamous weapon from the past. While there are (thankfully) no vehicles, there are demon powerups, which are a kind of analog to Halo's vehicles. The person controlling the demon can absolutely dominate unless the opposing team coordinates a focused attack. Nevertheless, the inclusion of explicit demons from the campaign (baron, revenant, mancubus) is one of the only distinctly DOOM things in the multiplayer. Hell, they can't even bring themselves to use the word "frags," something found in every id Software deathmatch game since the original DOOM. Until now. Now, they're just "kills," just like Halo.\n\nIs this a bad thing? It's not bad, per se. It's very fun. But I have to warn you, if you're looking for the next installment of classic id Software multiplayer, this is not it. But again, it's very fun and addictive. So whatever issues I raise from here on out, keep that in mind. And keep in mind that I'm nowhere near done playing it; I plan to level to Echelon 10 level 50 (the current cap). It should probably take 1.5-2 weeks if I play every day. So look, it's cool. Now onto some commentary about mechanics.\n\nThis is where my thoughts get weird. This is a video game, so does anything matter other than the fun factor? The game's MP is fun. But I have to say, it's like the junk food of game design. What I mean is, it's a team-based shooter (no duel mode in sight), just like Halo. But the rewards systems are all about your individual performance. It hardly matters if your team wins. Hell, it doesn't really matter that much if you die a lot, provided you get roughly as many kills as deaths. You get bonuses on top of bonuses when you kill with the absurdly overpowered "power weapons," a borrowed maxim of Halo. The team as a whole doesn't really benefit from controlling the map, other than "winning" but who cares about that? It's all about you and your points and progression. Hell, there's a large health pickup literally around every corner, so you don't really even have to know the item layout to survive. You just sort of jump in and play.\n\nAnd that's really ♥♥♥♥ing weird.\n\nAfter spending several hours in a few Overwatch beta weekends, I've come to appreciate the required teamplay aspect that game brings to the table. This game is almost exactly the opposite. What can I say, it's the ultimate selfish team shooter. But it's fun.\n\nThere's nothing like knowing the power weapon spawn points and trying to capitalize on them and just destroying other players with the chainsaw. It's so fun and visceral. Actually, the MP chainsaw is my favorite powerup in any game, ever, no question.\n\nBut did we want this? I didn't. I've played a fair amount of Halo Reach multiplayer (50 hours? I can't remember) and I like it. But this isn't what core id fans want, for sure. On the other hand yet again, an entire generation of shooter players are probably jumping into this thinking it's totally normal and par for the course. Things change. I kind of doubt that if they did a Quake style deathmatch game, it would be as popular, and it would certainly not be as accessible. Nevertheless, I feel like they left behind the hardcore competitive scene to deliberately cater to a different style of player to a degree that this game will never be an esport, and I think that's sad. So, mixed feelings.\n\nThis isn't the MP I wanted and dreamed of all of these years since DOOM 3. It's still very fun. Just don't expect the successor to Quake Live.\n\nMore updates later? I don't know.","May 13","true","122.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/recommended/379720/","electrichellknight","ElectricHellKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/","95 products in account","Welcome to DOOM, a lightning-fast virtual reality adventure where you are the toughest space trooper ever to suck vacuum.\n\nWhen I first read those words many years ago, I knew this game was going to be something different. That's the intro to the original Doom manual circa 1993. And over two decades since those words were first printed, the legacy is still going strong.\n\nDOOM (2016) is everything that I expect from a Doom game. Big guns, much bigger demons, and one lone tough-as-nails Marine using the first to obliterate the second. Rest assured that this is an epic and action-packed assault through Mars, and hell, and back to Mars, and back to hell. (Repeated many times over a 15 hour campaign, twice as long as most FPS these days.) DOOM is a fantastic return to a time when games were about fun gameplay, story was something you had to dig for (instead of being spoon fed to you), bosses were challenging, and protagonists knew when to shut the hell up instead of yapping through the whole campaign.\n\nWhile most shooters today encourage you to move cautiously, keep a finger on the reload key, and kill maybe a dozen or so enemies in a mission, DOOM takes things a different route. In DOOM, speed and aggression is the only way to get things done. If you back down from a fight, if you try to camp your enemies, if you try to hide in cover, you will lose. Over and over again. Play offensively, and always be on the move. This applies equally to campaign and multiplayer.\n\nIn DOOM, you will be moving 99% of the time. To help keep you from having to stop, DOOM does away with sprint-keys and weapon reloading. Instead, your weapons never need to be reloaded. So long as you have ammo in your inventory, you can fire your weapons. Rather than a sprint-key, your default speed is running and you can hit a key if you (for some reason) wish to walk. Movement overall is much less restrictive than in most shooters. By jumping towards any ledge, you can grapple on and quickly pull yourself up. You can also rapidly climb railings and vault over low obstacles. These mechanics are very fluent and far more versatile than they seem on the surface. While some games have mechanics like this that feel gimmicky, in DOOM they feel natural and work exceptionally well. In addition to this, fairly early in the campaign you will acquire a set of boots that let you double-jump (double-jumping is standard in the multiplayer). This combined with the ledge-climbing enables you to reach new heights.\n\nBut you aren't the only creature that can traverse the world with ease, nearly all of the thousands (literally thousands) of demons you will fight are just as agile as you. They can, and will, chase you all throughout the combat zone with surprising intelligence. Killing these demons is frantic, hellish, and very satisfying. The ability to melee weakened enemies for a quick finishing move (called "glory kill") is a welcome feature in DOOM. These glory kills might sound clunky and repetitive, but they are neither. Glory kills happen very quickly (so as not to slow down the action), and they have many variations. They are even contextual, so that what part of the enemy you are looking at when you hit the melee key will determine which glory kill you preform. These are not quicktime events and do not detract from the speed of the game. To aid in your assault, you will find numerous powerups that give you temporary abilities such as haste (makes you even faster), invulnerability, and berserk (allows you to glory kill demons instantly).\n\nCompleting various optional challenges during the game will allow you to unlock upgrades. Some of these upgrades take the form of runes which require you to beat a brief combat arena under specific instructions. (Example: Kill every enemy with only the super shotgun in 12 seconds.) You can equip up to three runes at a time and swap them out as you wish. Finding "field drones" throughout the game will unlock weapon mods which can be individually upgraded at your discretion. Once unlocked, weapon mods can be hot-swapped without pausing the game. Some of these are basic (burst fire mode for the shotgun), others are a bit more complex (chargeable 360 degree heatwave blast for the plasma rifle). As you play you will also find the corpses of fallen UAC guards, whose suits contain a power chip that can be used to improve your own suit's abilities. Also scattered around the environment are caches of "Argent energy", which allow you to choose one of three specific things to upgrade (armor, health, or ammo capacity). These upgrade systems allow you to tailor the game to your play style, and offers some replay value beyond the obvious fun factor.\n\nid Software knows that all work and no play makes DOOM Marine a dull boy, so your experience isn't strictly limited to killing demons (unless you want it to be, then you can just do that). There are dozens of secrets to be found, all of which unlock something interesting. These are not easy secrets, either; they will require you to search and think. The most notable of these are the secrets which open up a hidden door to a small chunk of a level from the original 1993 Doom. These levels are classically textured and feature items and demons exactly where they should be. These are much cooler and more dynamic than the boring and static E1M1 in Rage. But that's not all, finding a small section of a 1993 Doom level also unlocks the full level which you can play from the menu. And in addition to the true secrets in the game, there are countless Easter eggs, some obvious and some not, that call back to earlier Doom games.\n\nOn top of this lengthy and challenging singleplayer action, you will find a verity of unique and adrenaline-pumping multiplayer modes and an impressive amount of character and weapon customization. playing the multiplayer rewards you with various hack modules which can be equipped and swapped out during the next match. As you level up, you will earn new weapons and equipment as well as available demons. Pick up the "demon rune" to transform yourself into one of several demons, each with their own special abilities, and decimate your enemies. If you find yourself on the wrong side of the demon, you'd better search for a power weapon to assist in tackling him. You will also be rewarded with different armor pieces, colors, patterns, and taunts, which you can use to customize your character. Oh and don't worry, you can glory kill both humans and demons in the multiplayer when they are low on health.\n\nI could go on for much longer (there is ten times as much content in DOOM as there is in most FPS games), but this review is more than long enough already. DOOM is exactly what a Doom game should be: fast, hellish, violent, and very fun. id Software (as far as I know, Bethesda did not make this game, they only published it) has done an outstanding job of bringing back a legendary classic. This game absolutely looks like, plays like, and evokes feelings of, the original Doom. If you have even a remote interest in FPS games, DOOM is an absolute must-buy.","May 17","true","126.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is absoutely worth it.\n\nAs a side note, Mick Gordon (who also did Wolfenstein) adds a refreshing and inspired metal soundtrack with electronic/glitch aesthetics and it works seemlessly.","May 20","true","58.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

However, after seeing the positive comments and good reviews, i thought i would cave in and get it at full price.  And i have to say I dont regret it in the slightest.  If you are a true doom fan, you should love this.  Its probably the fastest shooter i have ever played, certainly in the modern era.  The guns are punchy, the combat excellent, and the graphics are superb.  On top of all that the game is very well designed.  It was a smart person who said "level design is everything".  And doom is basically a tribute to its ancestors heritage.   Not quite as groundbreaking as its predecessor, but damn is it a fine shooter.","May 22","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheehanje/recommended/379720/","sheehanje","sheehanje","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheehanje/","193 products in account","I remember I ran a BBS back in the late 80's, early 90's.  I was a PC enthusiast and always was jealous that consoles had such really cool games -while the PC had some good ones, most were adventure style games like King's Quest or Ultima - great games of the day, but the PC was lacking high end action ga,es.   My BBS was the only local Apogee distribution site, and I remember when my modem spent hours downloading a game called Commander Keen at 2am from the distribution hub.   I woke up as the modem initiated its handshaking sequence.  And thought, what a stupid name for a game.\n\nThen I played it.   Things changed on the PC from that day forward.   Thanks to the developers at id Software, the PC was no longer relegated to backwater gaming.  The consoles had direct competition - and the PC could be on the same footing.   Then Wolfenstein 3D came.  While not the first FPS game - it certainly took PC gaming to new heights.  Then came Doom - a game that forced many to upgrade from 286 or 386 to 486 machines - and that started the trend of PC Gaming driving new computer sales.   It was that important of  a game.  Many forayed into Networking, or Modding - a game that drove people to the IT industry.   Myself included.\n\nOk, sorry for the mind numbing nostalgia - but I'm sure a lot of people who grew up in that golden age of PC gaming get the same feeling playing the latest Carmack and company installment.  A feeling most didn't get with Doom 3.   But here is a game with an engine a cut above what's out there (as we should expect from id), and displaying what made early FPS so popular in the first place --- fast pace action, twitch reflexes, not a lot of thought above "wow, I'm really enjoying this."\n\nDoom is an absolute great game for me.  Look, I'm middle aged, I have more than a full time job (in the IT industry), kids, and other RL commitments.  I've tried to like games like Destiny (which btw, has some great shooter mechanics itself) - but the campaigns were needlessly drawn out in that game.   I'm not so interested in multiplayer anymore, mainly because there is no pause button.   Doom scales so well to gamers like myself.   I can go in for 30 minutes and have glorious gluttony of frenzied hell spawn killing action, and then get back to my frenzied kids trying to kill each other over a minecraft sword real life.   But like  I said it scales - so when I do have more time, I have the option of exploring a little more of the nooks and crannies of some superb level design.  And I'm not even that far into the game - but I knew right away that I'm playing Doom and not something that just bears its name.  It has the feel, the atmosphere, the design, and  the modern technology the original had in 1993.  Luckily I didn't have to upgrade my hardware for this one, because it plays absolutely stunning on my GTX780 with high details.  Not a single dip below 60FPS with averages in the mid 80's.\n\nAs a bonus, this game scared the hell out of my kids.   They walked in on one of my gaming sessions - and promptly ran the hell out of the room.  That means I may get a few extra minutes while playing it, cause they will probably think twice before coming in and asking me if they can have ice cream for dinner while I'm playing Doom.\n\nI haven't even tried multiplayer yet, and even if it does disappoint, it won't change my overall thoughts of this game because the solo aspect of it is just what I've been itching for.   My only wish is they port it to SteamOS/Linux so I can play it on my steam machine in the living room.","May 18","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJoker116/recommended/379720/","TheJoker116","TheJoker116","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJoker116/","349 products in account","Finally a Doom game capable of being both modern and true to form. This game brought back what was sorely lacking in Doom 3: Exploration, fast pace and butchering demons by the dozen. Gone are the cheap jumpscares that Doom 3 brought us at every corner, you're not some ♥♥♥♥♥ marine shooting at spiders or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ his pants in front of a Cyberdemon, you're the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Doom Marine and you kick major ♥♥♥ all the way.\n\nRemember when someone at ID said the point was to feel like Bruce Lee roaming around on a skateboard with a shotgun? The pacing reflects exactly that, there's a sort of rythm to the game: Shoot, run in, Glory Kill their asses then do the same with the other fools snarling and throwing fireballs at you. This new Doom is all about movement, to stay still is to get killed. The Marine can easily climb ledges and jump around, especially once you get the Thrust Boots and the well-designed levels let you moce easily during arena combat. All in all, combat in this game is Brutal Doom in the ID Tech engine, very satisfying. The Glory Kills are quick enough to not break the pace and they are indeed very brutal and gory. So satisfying.\n\nOne of my biggest disappointment with the closed alpha was the impossibility of carrying all the weapons, the loadout system felt unnecessary since just about everybody spammed rockets during the game and it just feels like it was implemented to be "more modern" ... but in the single-player campaing? You can carry all you find and there's a great slection including classic weapons from the earlier Doom games as well as some newcomers, like the Gauss Rifle. Each weapon has it's pros and cons, such as power, reload time and firing rate and almost all of them can be modded by finding drones, adding explosive shells to the shotgun or micro-missiles to the Heavy Assault Rifle. You can also upgrade those mods and once you've upgraded a weapon all the way, you're given a challenge to unlock the weapon's full potentiel, for example, killing two enemies at the same time with the Super Shotgun eventually allows you to fire two shots before reloading and direct hits on imps with the Shotgun's explosive shells makes them Cluster Shells for even more carnage. Aside from guns, you get the Chainsaw, which works in a rather new way: Instead of being a simply damaging melee weapon, it's instead a limited but very powerful one-shot killer that makes enemies drop ammunition. By using amounts of fuel, you can kill nearly everything, the more powerful the enemy, the more fuel used and they automatically drop ammo after each chainsaw kill. Very gruesome indeed and quite useful, despite ammo being quite plentiful unless you manage them very poorly.\n\nAnd the monsters ... all the classics are here: Imps, Hell Knights, Barons of Hell, Cacodemons, etc ... all of them have new twists, such as imps clinging to walls while lobbing fireballs at you and Pinkies charging at you for a damaging ram attack that forces you to stay on the move. Hell Knights don't just walk towards you and fire projectiles anymore, they run around, can leap towards you in an eyeblink and can pound the ground to damage you, making them fearsome and dangerous. You also get new variants for some enemies, such as the Posessed Soldiers, who now fight alongside security personnel equipped with shield, making them harder to kill and there are tough demons that can fire continous beams of damaging Hell energy. With great weapons come great monsters to kill with them and every creature can be challenging in their own ways.\n\nOf course, the levels come with their share of secrets and crannies to find. Each level has a number of secret areas to find, with collectibles and hidden powerups and, of course, classic map unlocks. By finding a hidden lever on a level, you an open a secret door leading to part of a classic Doom map, letting you unlock the full map for the game, allowing you to replay some fan-favorites like the Hangar or the Entryway with modernized enemies and controls. You'll have to look around and search thoroughly to find all those secrets, they are well-hidden and the area scanning upgrade isn't always helpful. You will be coming back to this game often, just to clean the entire levels.\n\nAll in all, this is a much better offering than Doom 3 and while classic Doom still is its own thing, this one borrows enough from the past while keeping a modern presentation to satisfy any classic Doom player's bloodlust, while the pace and the old-school formula might deter the casual Call of Duty/Battlefield players ... but this game didn't have these players and mind and frankly, who cares? Doom is a solid title that I recommend to anyone who's getting tired of the slower-paced, regenerating health, survive-an-entire-clip-emptied-in-the-stomach-but-can't-take-a-knife-slash-to-the-leg crap that we've been fed since Call of Duty came to be.\n\n9/10, would chainsaw a demon in two for ammo again","May 18","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had a doom shareware cd, I bought doom2 and quake new. So I'm old.\n\nI've very very much enjoyed (new) Doom so far. It reminds me of the best parts of doom, but unrestrained by technology with a sprinkling of q3arena. Getting suddenly mobbed and blasting until it stops hurting is what doom 1&2 were about, and this offers that, the rate then seemed really fast (remember, doom gave birth to the FOS genre), now? It IS fast.\n\nIt also includes loot/leveling aspects that compliment rather than complicate the game. Do I need to shotgun blast 30 imps in the face? No, but I'll do it for the fun, and to get the weapon enhancement.\n\nWhich brings me to another interesting point. Many(but not all) characters are readily recognizable from doom I/II, but.. better. Which I really enjoyed.\n\nThe bad:\nIt ate my HD6870. The framerate hovered around 24 with passable, but not good graphics, the rendering engine really isn't meant to cater to older hardware. The game's combat engine copes well with lowered framerate, combat slows universally so you don't just get gibbed, but as you'd expect, it damages the pace. Some views were untenable, dropping to 10 or less FPS.\n\nHad to overnight a new card from Amazon, which is pretty typical when a new id game comes out(The purchase, not the overnighting. id has driven much of my PC upgrade process).\nWith the new card I'm getting 100fps consistently and the old school doom 'feel' is0 100%.\n\nEdit: It does not appear to require much CPU power, even with the 6870 it was only using around 20% cpu in a second gen i7.","May 16","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After 12 years, this game was worth the wait.  Gone are the slow-moving, dark shadows of Doom 3: Where that game was a horror game with action elements, this is the complete opposite - This take on Doom is brutal, bloody, brightly-colored, and otherwise a chaotic gore-fest deluxe.\n\nThe Good:\n1.  Awesome graphics - blood runs out of the walls, clouds of smoke rise from destructed building on the horizon, great glass and DOF effects, etc.\n2.  Action, action, action, and more action - the game never stops moving.\n3.  Glory Kills to finish off opponents in completely blood-drenched fashion\n4.  All the classic Doom weapns make an appearance, are fully upgradable, and there are even a couple new ones\n5.  The Demons have all been revamped, and are more aggressive and deadly.   Imps now climb walls and hurl fireballs at you from all sort of angles.  Hell Knights will jump up to ledges to pursue you, etc.  And there is no shortage of any of them.\n6.  Secrets galore and areas to explore\n7.  Minor RPG upgrading elements on gameplay and the marine's suit\n8.  Double jumps and climbing allows for more expanded environments and movement\n9.  Demons react when being damaged - they will stumble or step backward from machine gun fire, etc instead of just charging forward like a robot\n10.  Smooth as silk on Ultra settings (GTX 980, i5 OC to 4.3 GHZ).\n\nThe Bad:\n1.  Checkpoints....need I say more?\n2.  The maps are somtimes confusing and it's difficult to figure out where you are at a lot of the time\n3.  The music, while fitting to the game, is sometimes a little repetitive\n4.  One type of Demon is missing from the game, but was replaced with another similar one - diehards might not like this.\n\nThe Ugly:\n1.  For those who suffer from motion sickness, repeated Glory Kills will catch up to you.\n\nIn the same ways that the original Doom had minor aspects of Wolfentstein in it, this version reminds me of the more recent Wolfenstein games and has minor similarities to those also.\n\nI couldn't put it down, I never lost interest, and it never got boring.\n\nAll in all, it's a killer game.\n666/10\nA+","May 16","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The singleplayer campaign is one of the best I've played in many years. It's a strong throwback to the old doom games, from the keycards to the fast paced action, to the secrets, this game deserves the name DOOM. The weapons feel beefy and powerful, the enemies explode into fountains of blood and gore, and the sound design to go with it is top notch. The level design is what really shines, always giving you plenty of chance to explore and find secrets and always leading you along without playing the game for you and telling you exactly what to do (ala CoD). The singleplayer for DOOM is a breath of fresh air in today's gaming climate.\n\nThe multiplayer isn't quite as strong. It's still good and has plenty of game modes, customization and progression to keep people busy. It isn't for everyone but it's still quite a bit of fun if you like arena shooters. I should mention that the game uses a loadout system instead of weapon pickups (power weapons are still pickups).\n\nSnapmap is a useful tool that people can use to make custom singleplayer and multiplayer levels. It's easy to use and powerful enough to make some fun, decently complex levels but not the same as having actual mod tools.\n\nMy only major gripe with DOOM is the lack of actual mod support and mod tools. It seems they made snapmap to fill that void but it's really not the same thing and especially with it being a DOOM game, that just doesn't feel right. Overall though DOOM is a fantastic entry into the series that surprised a lot of people by being unarguably one of the best games of the year.","May 17","true","22.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story was action packed, kept you moving, and would make a great movie (like doom 3). The monsters were very well done to this art style, the cyber demon I wasn’t a fan off but you can’t fix perfect (doom 1). The rest is just great, fast paced alot to do, level are for the most part really well done, then ontop of the campaign being worth the money you get a puzzle game/map design, which can be coop. Multiplayer is there, haven’t really messed with it other than beta, but really you’re getting 3 games in one. Potentially with all the maps being made you could have endless fun, since in snap map you earn points so it’s something to "shoot" for, even though it’s all just customizing your doom marine look. It’s worth it and stays true to the doom name. It just shocked me that it turned out this good.\n\nAlso play snap maps over the classic unlocks you get oin campaign they are not as cool as they sound, they are set in lower difficulty and rather just play the old levels the way they were, since playing one you get all amped up for the next level and it just ends no stat page, if they made them exact with a twist maybe but they didn’t, all in all game is worth the money and story worth your time.\n","May 17","true","61.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Pro tip for playing this game: Play it on Nightmare otherwise it does not feel like DOOM.  Even with just 10 hours in I am enjoying this game greatly on the higher diffculty because it is absolutely the return of the classic DOOM, but this time you're able to move your head in all directions and your enemies like to jump on your head... to smash it.\n\nIf you're looking for a compelling story with compelling characters then keep looking because that is not DOOM.  There is some story but the main emphasis is on guts, gore, and fighting like hell.  Additionally do not pick this game up for Multiplayer, just don't.  DOOM has always been first and foremost a singleplayer game and it exceeds in that area significantly.  Finally the SnapMap is definitely worth checking out and will certainly add replayability to this game.  SnapMap missions even offer coop style gameplay so you rain body parts down with your friends!  Hooray!\n\nOverall DOOM successfully fills the shoes of its classic predecessor's when it comes to singleplayer.  Multiplayer is weak, but you're not playing DOOM for Multiplayer.  The SnapMap will provides hours of entertainment for those who enjoy building content and those who enjoy playing user created content.","May 17","true","23.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So when this game was announced I was hyped as ♥♥♥♥ but after some trailers and marketing, I really begun to doubt it, the MP alpha + beta did not help either.\n\nBoy was I glad that I got this and was wrong. The campaign is gloriously brutal and fun, with actually well written story and good map designs, the weapons are fun to use and the flowing action works well. There's a lot of challenges and secrets to do and find so it's got a lot of replayability.\n\nThe MP is definitely not worth noting as it's pretty average in a lot of ways, there's stuff to unlock but it's nothing new and already there's hackers. So don't expect to have much fun with it.\n\nSnap Map is a decent idea because there's some already unique maps out there and some co-operative maps or competitive but it does feel like a bad substitute for modding.\n\nThe soundtrack is wonderful, I'm glad Mick gordon worked on this game because he also worked on Wolfenstein the New Order and that soundtrack was also great.\n\nGraphics are good looking but it's a mess in a way, data isn't compressed because Denuvo doesn't make it easy and so it's 55gbs to download which is absurd and because of Denuvo, the game runs poorly on some PCs, I had to drop my settings a lot to accompany this and luckily it hasn't dropped below 60 but it's a very demanding game.\n\nPros\n- A campaign that ticks off all you would want from it.\n- weapons are satisfying.\n- Lots of replayability.\n- Soundtrack is fitting and great.\n- The Demons are pretty good looking.\n- Story is surprinsingly good.\n- Gameplay is satisfying and flowing\n- Brutal\n- "weaponizing demons for a brighter tomorrow" got a laugh out of me\n- FOV Slider\n- Nice graphics\n\nCons\n- Denuvo\n- MP\n- Lack of modding\n- No Co-Op for Campaign\n- Cliff-Hanger ending\n- $110 on steam in Australia\n- Not compressed\n- Worst marketing, you'd be better off just releasing the 3 main trailers and leaving it at that.\n\n7.8/10, I dropped it by a lot because while Campaign is 10/10 for me, MP is bland and lack of modding just hurts it more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HawksAU/recommended/379720/","HawksAU","Hawks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HawksAU/","327 products in account","tl;dr Review: Great game for the singleplayer with a few problems but nothing huge enough to make it bad as a classic shooter, I'd recommend this game based on it's singleplayer alone. Snap Map and Multiplayer however are terrible and should be avoided at all costs. ID give us proper mod tools on PC and we'll love you forever.\n\n-----\n\nI'd like to preface this by saying that I have played Doom and other classic shooters for thousands of hours and for so many years I don't care to think about it, I've wasted more of my life on classic shooters than anything else. This game was bought for me by a friend and I played it on their insistence as I was skeptical ID without any of the original team would pull this off especially while under the wing of Bethesda who loves to dumb down their games. I had no intention of ever buying this but I've ended up glad that I was pushed into playing it as I have genuinely been surprised and I do recommend purchasing this.\n\nUnlike most positive reviews I've seen on Steam I'm not going to say it's perfect or the best shooter I've ever played but it does hold up well and is just a lot of stupid fun and I do recommend this game to any fan of the oldschool shooters. It is fast, it is fun and it is violent with the late game especially feeling like I'm playing with that same great map design that the 90s and early 2000s was all about. The weapons feel punchy and have a role that they excel at and weaknesses that will require you swapping weapons quickly and thinking about your choices. The AI Actively hunts you down and comes from all sides, you can't just hug cover you have to move around both to stay alive and to keep grabbing pickups in the arenas they set up for the fights. The movement speed is fast, maybe not as fast as the old Doom games or Quake but it is a good pace and jumping and grabbing onto ledges doesn't slow you down, the glory kills don't slow down the pace of the game too much either I never felt like I was going slow while playing which is a good thing. The weapon unlocks are varied and I like the system of being able to change them around to suit both your playstyle or the situation at hand,l the armour unlock system could use a bit of work though because the majority of the unlocks border on useless. Exploration is encouraged although the majority of the secrets are a bit of a joke once you realize they show up on the automap, there are however some very cleverly hid secrets that only the most thorough players will find, or you're using a guide.\n\nOne of the biggest critiques I have for this game is that it can be a bit predictable, especially the early game and even the late game just throwing you into wide open arenas kind of like small multiplayer maps where it just sends wave after wave of enemy at you until you kill them all. You then move on through a series corridors into the next big arena that they have set up for you. It would have been nice for this to have been mixed up a bit with some more traditional exploration styled areas to go through between these arenas, there are a few cases of this but not nearly enough in my opinion. The monster count also seems very on the low side a lot of the time, even in the endgame you rarely see more than ten or so enemies to face off with at any one time with more enemies being spawned in as you've killed a few off, I imagine this is due to the limitations on console hardware but I would really love to see the monster count kicked up a notch. The boss fights are a complete and utter joke to beat on the Ultra Violence difficulty the cyberdemon especially was a huge let down even though there was a huge build up leading up to the fight.\n\nSnap Map is just horrible, extremely limited and has a huge case of 'made for consoles' that makes the UI insufferably confusing to use on a PC. Give us a map editor or at the very least increase the spawn limits.\n\nThe Multiplayer is completely terrible and should be avoided, it doesn't even have anti-cheat which is a huge joke. I'm not surprised it was made by ex-Bungie developers because it just feels like fast Halo with worse weapon balance.\n\nThe lack of proper mapping and mod tools is a serious mark against this game too, while ID Tech 6 might be hugely complicated even just a proper map editor and not this joke of a substitute Snap Map will make this game go a lot further.\n\nIn conclusion it's pretty gr8 m8 I'd r8 it 8.8/8 no","May 15","true","35.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

After 12 years, this game was worth the wait.  Gone are the slow-moving, dark shadows of Doom 3: Where that game was a horror game with action elements, this is the complete opposite - This take on Doom is brutal, bloody, brightly-colored, and otherwise a chaotic gore-fest deluxe.\n\nThe Good:\n1.  Awesome graphics - blood runs out of the walls, clouds of smoke rise from destructed building on the horizon, great glass and DOF effects, etc.\n2.  Action, action, action, and more action - the game never stops moving.\n3.  Glory Kills to finish off opponents in completely blood-drenched fashion\n4.  All the classic Doom weapns make an appearance, are fully upgradable, and there are even a couple new ones\n5.  The Demons have all been revamped, and are more aggressive and deadly.   Imps now climb walls and hurl fireballs at you from all sort of angles.  Hell Knights will jump up to ledges to pursue you, etc.  And there is no shortage of any of them.\n6.  Secrets galore and areas to explore\n7.  Minor RPG upgrading elements on gameplay and the marine's suit\n8.  Double jumps and climbing allows for more expanded environments and movement\n9.  Demons react when being damaged - they will stumble or step backward from machine gun fire, etc instead of just charging forward like a robot\n10.  Smooth as silk on Ultra settings (GTX 980, i5 OC to 4.3 GHZ).\n\nThe Bad:\n1.  Checkpoints....need I say more?\n2.  The maps are somtimes confusing and it's difficult to figure out where you are at a lot of the time\n3.  The music, while fitting to the game, is sometimes a little repetitive\n4.  One type of Demon is missing from the game, but was replaced with another similar one - diehards might not like this.\n\nThe Ugly:\n1.  For those who suffer from motion sickness, repeated Glory Kills will catch up to you.\n\nIn the same ways that the original Doom had minor aspects of Wolfentstein in it, this version reminds me of the more recent Wolfenstein games and has minor similarities to those also.\n\nI couldn't put it down, I never lost interest, and it never got boring.\n\nAll in all, it's a killer game.\n666/10\nA+","May 16","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Doom.This is a spoiler-free, rather detailed DOOM review that should give you a basic idea of what this game offers.\n\nLet's start right at the beginning.\nMy beginning is the DOOM Beta. We've all seen it.\nNot being developed by id Software themselves, it was bound to be different than what we expected.\nA popularized Doom-Quake. A modern day shooter, if you will.\nSkins. Taunts. A pre-order-only multiplayer equipment pack.\nA lot of people got worried: Was DOOM going to be modernized to please the average crowd instead of the old fans?\nWas it going to lose everything that makes DOOM, well, DOOM?\nNo. No, it didn't. Not in the slightest.\n\nIn DOOM you control a very p!ssed-off guy who doesn't give two sh!ts about anything.\nAs him, you slaughter thousands of demons in the most satisfying ways possible, faster and with more flow than ever before.\nYour arsenal consists of upgradeable, moddable badass weaponry, all useful in their own ways. A new system of "Glory Kills" was introduced - gore-filled finishing moves that let you preserve ammunition, get rewards depending on your enabled in-game perks and get some sweet fist-to-face combat going (You can also turn them off if you find to dislike them; Perks are received by completing side-challenges, you don't have to use them).\nThe level design is a very well executed mix of arena-like battling grounds and every level has a great vertical aspect. In the heat of the battle you'll be on the move constantly - especially on higher difficulties where a single hit means death. That's where DOOM delivers adrenaline in a way no other current game can. Once everything has settled down a bit, you can head out and explore the secrets each level hides from you. Whether you do it for the extra upgrade points for your weapon- or suit-improvements, to stock up on armor and health or because you like tons of retro-content - exploring is fun and very rewarding.\n\nWith that neat package of extremely blood-thirsty gameplay come astonishing graphics and a surprisingly stable framerate on the suggested hardware.\n\nSadly, no game is without any flaws, and DOOM is definitely not an exception in that regard.\nA very common and very annoying issue are the crashes.\nDOOM crashes an awful lot on my (quite powerful) system, seemingly increasing amounts over time.\nCrashes happen when:\nI start or finish a side-challenge\nI load into new level parts\nI load into the campaign levelsAnother thing are VERY laggy intros. The initial DOOM Nvidia driver fixed those for me, however I still disabled them by writing "+com_skipIntroVideo 1" into the DOOM launch options on Steam.\n\nThat's all, folks!DOOM is what we wanted, DOOM is what we got.\nThis game plays great and has a fun factor way above the dose your doctor prescribed you.\nOld DOOM fans will find a brutal, beautiful run-and-gun-shooty-shoot-game in this one, and if you want that good old hard experience - DOOM on Nightmare difficulty and above is definitely for you. You can unlock Nightmare difficulty without having finished the game by typing "+menu_advanced_AllowAllSettings 1" in the launch options.\n(Don't get mad if it doesn't work - they might have patched it out by now.)\n\nIf this review gave you a peek into what DOOM is, give it a like!\nIf you think it sucked, give it a dislike.\nIf you're going to play DOOM, I wish you lots of fun!","May 18","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story was action packed, kept you moving, and would make a great movie (like doom 3). The monsters were very well done to this art style, the cyber demon I wasn’t a fan off but you can’t fix perfect (doom 1). The rest is just great, fast paced alot to do, level are for the most part really well done, then ontop of the campaign being worth the money you get a puzzle game/map design, which can be coop. Multiplayer is there, haven’t really messed with it other than beta, but really you’re getting 3 games in one. Potentially with all the maps being made you could have endless fun, since in snap map you earn points so it’s something to "shoot" for, even though it’s all just customizing your doom marine look. It’s worth it and stays true to the doom name. It just shocked me that it turned out this good.\n\nAlso play snap maps over the classic unlocks you get oin campaign they are not as cool as they sound, they are set in lower difficulty and rather just play the old levels the way they were, since playing one you get all amped up for the next level and it just ends no stat page, if they made them exact with a twist maybe but they didn’t, all in all game is worth the money and story worth your time.\n","May 17","true","61.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was just really friggin' dark and a crappy Doom game. What I mean by that is the original Doom is very rarely about not being able to see, and jump scares. Rather, it's about intense action, strafing wildly, wielding heaps of cool weapons, and not taking it too seriously while having fun. Doom 3 has some of these elements, but tries much too hard to be mature and gritty in the wrong ways.\n\nThis 2016 version of Doom is Doom done right. It's a reboot that I expected to be garbage, but ended up having a lot of fun with. Each weapon has a job, each enemy is dealt with a different way, fast melee finishers which I didn't think I'd like surprised me and added a fun new element to the game, and although it feels weird at first, the further I got into the game, the more this felt like the original Doom games. It's a fun reimagining of the original with a story that you can pay as much or as little attention to as you like, with delays for exposition being very rare. The enemies are very detailed and redesigned, but some of them, such as the cacodemon, revenant, pinky, etc., while looking so new, also have that nostalgic look to them as well when you take in their overall shape, purpose, and aesthetic.\n\nHowever, it's not just Doom with a shiny new coat of paint and melee finishers. Almost every weapon has upgrades, as does your Doom Marine suit. You are awarded upgrade points for finding various collectibles, killing large numbers of enemies, and completing challenges (such as kill X number of imps from behind in melee, etc.) on each level. Completing these challenges, finding the secrets, and upgrading your guns and suit are practically a mini-game in and of themselves, because I spent a rather large number of hours combing through levels looking for goodies. It's definitely worth it, though, because having better guns and such make clearing later areas much easier and give you more options.\n\nThat said, if you aren't the kind of gamer who has a lot of spare time, you may not want to spend a terribly large amount of time looking for the secrets. Although there's a really rewarding feeling about finding some of the tougher secrets on your own, Youtubing to find secrets you're missing isn't a bad idea if you really do need to cut back on how much time you're spending playing, and videos of that are already available from several users on the aforementioned site.\n\nIf you like games you can get all the achievements in, this one's doable but not super easy. I have 100% achievements now, and most of them are for finding all the secrets and upgrading everything. I got the competitive multiplayer achievements in under an hour easily, despite me being terrible at it, and the Snap Map achievements can be obtained within an hour or two depending on how much attention you pay to Snap Map's tutorials and playing legitimate maps to entertain or simply trying to finish maps fast to get achievements.\n\nThe competitive multiplayer seemed alright, but I'm hardly the person to ask. It's just not really my jam. The mode I played was a lot like Transformers War for Cybertron's mode where you try to hold command points,except I could turn into a jet on a whim whenever I felt like it in Transformers, so for me, Transformers all the way. ;)\n\nSnap Map is surprisingly robust. Basically, you have an overhead view of an "x-ray" of a room, and can place different types of rooms, key cards, locked doors, secrets, etc. If you follow the tutorials and mess around with the features, I think a person could turn out some impressive maps. I played a few that people published, and as short an amount of time as it's been since launch, someone had already posted a "tower defense" sort of map. No towers, but the enemies run in lines to an end point you're trying to stop them from reaching, killing them quickly yourself and spending money in a "store" between waves for new guns, permanent damage bonuses, score multipliers, etc. I didn't play these maps too long, but I could see some amazing things getting made eventually.\n\nAll in all, Doom is quite a good game, and if they make a sequel, I'm definitely down for it.","May 21","true","67.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you remember fighting endless hoards of teleporting demons in "colosseum style" battles? Well I first played Doom when I was 6 years old in 1994 and have since replayed it again and again, as well as Doom 3...\n\nWell this version of Doom had me on the edge of my seat. I loaded it up and finished the game on ultra violence and lets just say that the action and nostalgia worked great together. There were many aspects of the game that remained "classic", such as certain weapons, tunes and monsters (all modified to a degree).\n\nThe music really had me captivated. Each level had its own ambient sound as well as combat music, each one progressing the previous, based on the overall theme of the zone - Hell had some choirs, for example. The composer, Mick Gordon, did a great job in combining what sounded like, Nine Inch Nails, Slipknot, Disturbed, (old) Korn and many other 90's and early 2000's metal/industrial bands' sound.\n\nOpposite of Doom 3, this was no survival horror with a hint of action. This version of Doom replicates the feeling of the original two; a run and gun shooter with immense gore and over the top action. In every level there are stages in this game where there are tons of powerups and ammunition strategically placed all around an enclosed area, sometimes with objectives to complete. The music "drops" and "kicks in" and you're literally swamped by stages of progressively more difficult monsters and you're constantly on the move, jumping from pillar to ledge and underpass, always looking left, right, backwards and forwards.\n\nI highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a modern version of the past. It has a story similar to all the rest, hell on Mars, but this story in particular is very easy to follow and the mission objectives are not intrusive; the story will tell itself, and the cutscenes, premonitions and little bits of story are brief and did not bother me at all. Overall, in my opinion, this game was very fast paced, well-thought-out, full of action  and the story was simple, cut and dry.\n\n9/10 - -  My only con is that the replayability may not be high unless you haven't beat it on a more difficult setting. I don't  play these kinds of games on Multiplayer but the experience of the Single Player is well worth it.\n\n","May 21","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A game where you move fast, mow down demons, and don't look back. Something which at the time was brand new and nowadays is a breath of fresh air from the sea of generic military and slow paced shooters that have overtaken the genre. In addition the performance of the game is equally as impressive as it was back then, achieving incredible fidelity and smootheness on low powered hardware. This game is the perfect reboot, capturing the soul of the original games while improving on it for a modern audience.\n\nI really have to rant about the performance here, it's so good it doesn't fully make sense to me. I'm running the game on a 980ti at 2560x1440 resolution, everything cranked up as high as it can go. My average framerate is in the 80-90 range, regularly jumping up into the 110-120 range during less intensive areas. The absolute lowest framerate I ever got was 58, and only in 2 isolated areas throughout the entire game. Id clearly knows something that other developers don't, considering that most other games would struggle to reach 60 with similar settings, let alone 90 or 120.\n\n"But you have a high-end rig!" I hear you say. Consider this: The game runs at full 1080p and 60fps ON BOTH CONSOLES. If an Xbox One can run a game that looks this good at 1080p/60, it's damn well optimized.\n\nThe game is paced such that every combat section is followed by an exploration section, which is then followed by another combat section, and so on. You run around, murder some demons, then go on your way to look for secrets and to accomplish objectives.\n\nHonestly I don't have too much to say about the game other than it's really really good. Everything they attempted was well executed and the game keeps your blood pumping the whole way through. I was playing with a friend and sometimes after an intense combat section he would just turn around and laugh, a laugh of relief but also a laugh of pure enjoyment and adrenaline. This game makes you feel like an invincible badass, but without being a cakewalk. You have to earn your victories with skill and planning. Admittedly, the normal difficulty mode is pretty easy, but more on that later.\n\nInstead of just gushing about the game, I'm going to talk about stuff that I didn't like. That way I think it's easir to make a decision. If you don't think you can deal with the stuff I mention, maybe skip this one. If you think it's not a big deal, go for it.\n\nFirst of all I think the upgrade system could have used a slight tweak that would have made the game less of a headache overall. In the game each weapon has 2 mods that are unlockable through finding upgrades, and you can further upgrade each mod with weapon mod upgrade points that are earned for progressing through each level. Unlike the other upgrades in the game, when you find a new weapon mod upgrade you have to either spend it on the spot or leave it for later. You don't get to keep the upgrade point to use whenever you want, and you don't get to try before you buy. You basically have to hope that the desccription of the mod matches your interpretation of it, and that it complements your play style. The consequence of not being able to use the mod upgrade whenever you want is that in the early game before you find all the guns, you might find an upgrade before you find the new gun in the level. Obviously you don't know yet that there is a new gun in the level so you can end up spending your upgrade on an old gun instead of getting to try out a mod on your new gun. Even worse, you can end up spending it on a mod that you are totally disinterested in just for the sake of completion. This is frustrating, and after I realized this was happening I found myself leaving the upgrade points for when I had a gun I knew I wanted to use it on. This involved having to backtrack to a previous level and navigate through it just to use a weapon upgrade that I already found. All of this trouble would have been saved if the game just let you store your weapon mod upgrades to use them whenever you want. This would also let you try them out because you could just reload your save if you don't like the one you picked.\n\nThe second thing that started to annoy me a bit was the repetition, but every pure shooting game suffers from this to some extent so it's not a big deal. There are ways to remedy this as well by using different weapon mods and different rune loadouts to try new playstyles.\n\nLastly I kind of have a problem with how the game really doesn't want you to die. I get that you're supposed to be a nigh-invincible one man army, but the game makes it pretty obvious that it's doing it's best to stack the odds in your favor, at leat on normal mode. In the game you can glory kill enemies, which is done by using a melee attack on them when there are critically low on health. This kills the enemy and causes them to drop pickups, usually health but they can also drop ammo and armor. The thing about this is that I quickly noticed that the game will give you substantially more health from glory kills if you are low on HP. Generally a glory kill will net you a modest 10 health. But if you are about to die all the enemies become health pinatas, dropping many times that. I think the most that I got from a non-boss enemy was 65 health from one glory kill. The same principal applies to ammo drops, but less so. In this way it almost feels like the game is disrespecting you by giving you a get out of jail free card. Aagin, this is only in normal mode. Those wanting a bigger challenge have 3 higher difficulty options to explore.\n\nThat's pretty much it, everything else is good enough to not warrant any complaints. The game really feels like you are descending to the bottom of hell. Bigger hoards of more powerful enemies are thrown at you towards the end, as the levels get shorter and the time in between combat sections wanes. For me the game took roughly 25 hours to complete on normal mode, 100% (including alt-tabs and fooling around). If you don't care about completing everything, expect to spend about half that time playing the game.","May 14","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They are nitpicks of a colossal, fast, brutal game that I can easily see myself sinking in ungodly amounts of time.

I played doom as a very young kid, then I played Doom 2 and I also loved playing the custom maps! Unlike most people I really enjoyed Doom 3 as well. Although it wasn't like Doom 1 or 2, it experimented with so much and geniunely frightened me with it's well designed monsters and frightening atmosphere! It also had DoomEd\nand I spent countless hours making maps of my own. Now, on to Doom 4.\n\nHoly mother of barons, what a game! The format is very simple, get into a simple area, and move! Run, use pickups, get health, destroy those demons, tear them apart, run, get powerups, eviscerate more demons, repeat! It seems like a repetitive formula but that is what Doom has always been! Running and gunning! And it was so much fun! Finally, finally,\nthey even brought back the Baron of Hell, my favorite demon from Doom! Man guys, the demons aren't lumping, drooling muscleheads like in Doom 3 either! They run, dodge climb up everything and come after you to rip you to shreds! Such an improvement over Doom 3! There was this one stage where I had little health left and I frantically tried to get away from a hellknight and jumped down a path and as I looked back in fear I saw him jump after me in all his glory,\ntrapping me. That's when I knew, well done Doom AI team, bravo.\n\nThe only disappointment perhaps was it's  lack of plot atmoshphere. Don't get me wrong, with Doom I'm not expecting much but I do feel that the voice recordings and videos of the PDA system in Doom 3 created a brilliant atmosphere. I feel they could have introduced all the cool sciency parts of the first UAC complex in a different way. The walls and walls of text the pda's provide you do feel kind of empty. I also feel the characters are extremely forgettable. Dr Betruger from Doom 3 genuinely frightened me in a 'This guy is satanic as hell'-way.\n\nIf the long single player campaign with secrets and battles abound isn't enough to satisfy you there's still the multiplayer and snapmaps! Especially the snapmaps, with it you can create your own multiplayer or single player missions, I can't wait!\n\n9/10\n\nTLDR version\n\nAn awesome old school shooter in 2016. That's NOT an easy task to pull off, well done DOOM team!","May 16","true","59.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966718937/recommended/379720/","76561197966718937","Love2Hate","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966718937/","33 products in account","Right off bat, if there were 1 word for me to describe this game it would be: EPIC!\n\nPeople may have been skeptical about rehashing old games just to jump the hype train but Bethesda Software does nothing short of delivering a software masterpiece that captures all the glory of the old games and invent new innovative ways to approach FPS.  To my knowledge they really set a new bar for FPS game standards.\n\nSTORY/SETTING:\n\nYou didn't buy Doom for a story as deep as Bioshock Infinite or Uncharted.  No excessive characters, no complicated story plot, very simple and to the point.  The environment and setting is vastly unknown to you and part of the enjoyment is to see what happens next after series of completing events.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nEvery encounter involves RUNNING and SHOOTING.  You won't be taking cover, you won't be sniping, there is no subtlety here as those will almost immediately get you killed.  Every fight is an unrelenting battle against insurmountable odds ranging from waves of small imps to multiple towering hell knights.  There are a great variety of monsters ranging from numerous but weak to few but nearly immortal, slow precise ranged to insanely fast melee, all of which requiring unique strategies with the weapons available.  This makes all of the weapons useful to the very end of the game as well.  Plasma rifles can be modified to stun monsters (great for stopping rushing melee enemies in their tracks), Rocket launchers with homing capabilities for tough medium ranged monsters, and rail guns for tough but slow long ranged monsters.\n\nThere is a "spec" system for upgrading weapons, health, ammo capacity, perks, etc.  I didn't calculate it precisely but I am pretty sure it is possible to max out all attributes by the last level of the game if you find all secrets in every level.  Missions can be replayed to recollect any missed secrets and gain additional upgrade points.  The upgrade system does seem a bit complicated though.\n\nI was also impressed with the double jump and climbing up cliffs function in the game.  Platforming has always been somewhat cumbersome in FPS games but with this new system, it definitely allows significantly more control and agility of the character when running from enemies.  This greater control makes FPS games not feel so handicapped when moving and jumping around allowing for new enjoyable challenges that require running around.\n\nSOUND:\n\nThe Music is quite fitting with the overall mood of the game.  In the base areas, there is always some upbeat techno music and most of the encounters have some heavy metal type music.  It definitely adds mood and character to the game itself.  Each weapon has awesome sounds and it really feels like they hold a tremendous amount of power behind them.  Explosions, bullets whizzing, laser blasts are all satisfying to constantly hear without feeling annoyed or repetitive.  The whizzing noise of rockets shooting out of the assault rifle and sticking to the enemies before exploding was one really memorable sound effect that stuck to me.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nThe graphics are decent and on par with the most advanced games out there now.  I always felt DOOM was a game where you would fight off a tremendous amount of monsters at the same time, so I was concerned that some graphics would have to be sacrificed in order to accomodate large amounts of enemies on screen at the same time (I felt this was a problem for doom 3).  Turns out my worries were unfounded.  I played this with dual 980ti in SLI and could consistently get 120 to 150 fps with maxed out settings on a 1080P monitor.  Even on the forums, people reported that they could achieve decent performance with single 970s.  The animations are all smooth, each classic doom monster was reworked and given a new look while preserving what made them what they were in the 80s.  They really seemed to hit a good balance in providing great animations, looks without excessive stress on decent video cards.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nDOOM 2016 is an awesome game!  It is very challenging, it stays true to its origins and brings a lot of new innovation to the table as well.  It is also decently long!  Ultra Violence difficulty, which is what I am playing at, will probably take 18 hours so.  I think I will hit the higher difficulty next.  I haven't explored the map editor or multiplayer at all yet.  I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an adrenaline rushed action FPS game.  Starting with Wolfenstein the new order, I really think Bethesda has found their place and niche in the gaming world.  If you see their games, rest assured it will be action packed and it won't disappoint.","May 25","true","31.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay feels like doom 1 and 2, the exploration is back, the powerups, the teleporters, the arenas and weapons, no reloading, hell yes, this is doom. I never once felt anything but challenged, a huge grin on my face as the next hell knight fell to my super shotgun. strafing and double jumping my way out of the energy balls flung from cacodemons. This is where the game pays homage best. And when you arent filling mars and hell with pools of gore, you are exploring to find upgrades that actually make you FEEL more deadly rather than being "+4% speed, you move barely noticeably faster" The gameplay is solid and wonderful on almost all accounts, however since i need to not be biased in review there are things i will point out specifically, good bad and neither, in the order that they come to me because im lazy and dont care to categorize with my currently shaking hands\n\n-The early weapons (Assault rifle, shotgun, and plasma rifle) are basically utterly useless once you have their upgraded versions (At least on my difficulty level, which was one under the hardest, ultra violence?) I would occasionally pull out the assault rifle to humor myself in the later half of the game (Where all the former bosses now make up 90% of the enemies) but there was no doubt they were clearly INFERIOR to the better versions (Chaingun, for instance) theres no "They have their purpose" argument to be made here, the grenade upgrade to your shotgun doesnt even match the damage of the unupgraded super shotgun, the missile upgrade to the assault rifle doesnt match the DPS of the normal chaingun and wastes more ammo.\n\n-The game has no "Pity" system, many games give you a "hey, idiot, you are about to die" grace period to go and hide or whatever, this game does not, i love it. You can feel like the biggest badass on mars and turn to run into a cacodemon shot at high health and instantly die, no pity, no sorry, no mercy, this is how doom should be.\n\n-Onto the "Story" yes, i know, doom+story=? but they got this one right, you can play through the whole game with no exploration and get a pretty darn good idea what is going on and why you are killing things, but explore some and you will find a rich and cultivated universe that takes place hundreds of years after the original doom (Not doom 3, i mean DOOM) Somehow they tied a pixel game with weird mixes of guns and no story up well with this game that has a well defined universe and a great-but-easy-for-doomguy-to-keep-up-with story. (Im talking a full multiple pages for each monster beastiary, a gun database, tons of content for weridos like me who take breaks from killing demons by reading about the guns im using to do so)\n\n-This game doesnt just pay homage to doom, mind you, the super popular and free "Brutal doom" mod has equal parts in this games pedigree, from ripping monsters apart for health to a powerup that lets you decapitate a hell knight with your bare hands, brutal doom was not only acknowledged, but totally included.\n\n-Doomguy is epic, just epic, no other man could carry more reverence than B.J blaskovich himself while not ever saying a word.\n\n-The game pays homage to alot of amazing boss battles in the DOOM canon, except for my and many others favorite... Ill bet that DLC comes to give us that back (However I must note the "Season pass" ONLY mentions multiplayer, there may be no hope for me after all unless theres a sequel) SPOILER  The icon of sin was only mentioned and his skull is part of a level. you cant battle the behemoth in this game, can battle spider mastermind and cyberdemon though!\n\n-The games ending and alot of the content that feels vaugely not-all-there probably suggests the games story will continue in a sequel. Remember how the "Sherlock holmes" movies opened up with a badass first film, that oddly was designed to set up the next one to be even better? thats kinda how this feels. The game was great and complete but felt like "Just the beginning" My bet is that a "Wolfenstien, the old blood" type standalone game comes out (That way since its standalone they dont have to include it in the season pass, see) That gives a little more substance and background to this game before they begin working on a sequel.\n\nall in all, This is a great game whether you are a hardcore doom fan who sleeps with a cacodemon plushie or a gamer who missed out on that generation but wanna feel the nostalgia with modern graphics. this is the doom you have been waiting for.\n\nYea, it was a ranty, awful review, my hands ache and shake from all the strafing and jumping in the constant never ending combat this game offered me. When a game leaves you grinning and thirsty for more, its good, simple as that.\n\nEDIT: MULTIPLAYER\n\nThe multiplayer is fun, but not nearly as well made as the singleplayer, the matchmaking system is atrocious about matching top level players with level 1-3 players, and most modes heavily rely on "Demon runes" that let one player become a monster that racks in points, and often these are the sole decider of each victory. While the runes are fun and playing as a demon is badass, the fact they impact gameplay so much and depend so heavily on one players ability to use them (Cuz dying with one drops it for the other team to steal) makes them a bigger nuisance than feature. All in all however, the multiplayer is entertaining and mostly twitch based, which is how doom should be.","May 19","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It is Doom, there is lots of demon slaying and plenty of guns to slay said demons with. But after finishing the game in 13 hours, and because of how it ended, I am beginning to wonder if the game manufacturers aren't attempting a bit of a cash grab.\n\nThe game is pretty linear. Get from A to B while killing everything inbetween that is not you. There is a villian whom you're trying to catch and you also get to uncover pieces of the story as you go along. The story is pretty much a side to the main dish: shooting stuff. And here it is fun. If you stand still, you're going to have a bad time. There are some areas where it is difficult to move around and it can be frustrating trying to do the thing they want you to do but in little space to do it in. However, on the whole, strafing, jumping and shooting your way through an area is lots of fun.\n\nThe bad parts though? The game is repetitive to the point that is predictable. You walk into a round/oval shaped room with lots of ammo, armour and health which means a fight is about to go down. It is not scary at all - Doom 3 was a lot scarier - and you'll find yourself wandering from area to area barely taking anything in. Every now and then you'll come across a log or hologram explaining some of the demented stuff they did to summon demons, but again it's thrown in more as justification for doing what you do. They could have expanded on the story a whole lot more because it's easy to feel like you're just running around and shooting stuff for the sake of running around and shooting stuff.\n\nMany of the reviews I've read praise it for getting back to its roots or being the real Doom, but they could have done more than just sprinkle a story inbetween shooting stuff, climbing on stuff and melee attacking stuff. The Glory Kills (melee finishers) are not a bad idea, but they are really just soft quick time events. Shoot the demon until it flashes then hit the melee button to finish it off. You're then rewarded with health, ammo and armour, which sprinkles about like a pinyata has blown it's load.\n\nThe developers have a good game on their hands, but it seems like it's missing some stuff. For example, there are like only 2 NPCs you interact with throughout the game. It's pretty much demon shooting all the way. The game looks nice but the levels are pretty much the same: walk down a corridor towards a room or area where you're going to shoot stuff then proceed to the next level.\n\nHere are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Shooting hordes of demons and fighting demon bosses is fun\n- Power-ups help you lay the smack down that much harder on demons\n- You can upgrade your weapons, armour and equipment. You can increase your maximum health, armour and ammo capacities, which is a nice touch.\n- You're constantly moving when fighting, so it forces you to think about what the best weapons are for the environment, as well as for the specific demons you're facing.\n- Melee finishers come in handy, especially when ammo and health start running low.\n- The game is rather forgiving when you do, allowing you to just reload from the last checkpoint, which is usually not far from when you entered an area.\n\nCons:\n- Combat is repetitive, especially during boss fights. I remember finding myself just circle strafing and shooting many times because it worked rather well.\n- Not much of a story, which is a shame because Doom 3's PDA system made the game more immersive.\n- Level design tends to be similar when entering areas where you're going to fight some demons.\n- The ending is a bit of a let down. They're probably looking to profit from DLC later.\n- The game "feels" fast-paced only because demons are quick and you're constantly trying to avoid projectiles. Your character, though, can feel slow because he is set to one speed.\n\nI'd give the game a 7/10 because it is fun, but it hasn't got much in the way of substance.","May 23","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If you were a fan of Doom 1 and 2, you'll enjoy this thoroughly.\n\nThere's a wealth of options to turn off any of the new additions you don't fancy; I myself toggled off the melee finisher flash, any waypoint icons, the "radar", HUD notifications for objectives and lore pickups, and finally I also toggled off cross hairs. Mission stages are expansive, have plenty of hidden secrets, and tons of enemies to kill. Weapon, armor, and rune upgrades are fun to use and if you really don't want anything to do with them you can just ignore them entirely aside from one mandatory armor upgrade pickup early in the game. I highly recommend using at least weapon modifications so you gain full use of each weapon's capabilities though, it's just more damn fun with each weapon's alternate fire available.\n\nThere honestly isn't much I could ask to be added or fixed. I've been playing Doom since Knee Deep's shareware and I happily can say the current team at iD knocked it out of the park.

Optimized for speed, an expression of love for the pc gamer with keyboard in one hand and mouse in the other.  With much attention to detail on how the world looks when you move your mouse, or strafe, or pull that trigger.  I hadn't experienced such a glass smooth response engine since the days of quake.  We've become accustomed to inferior games with their instant hit mechanics, de-emphasized movement of projectiles in space, dumbed down 'trust me you hit something' hit markers.  Doom brings back something we've been missing and raises a bloody middle finger to all recent first person shooters that came before it.   Aim matters, weapon switching matters, distance matters, and you the player have become an artist.  At your disposal is an arsenal of destructive weapons.  It's up to you to paint that canvas with blood.  Doom is a jolting realization of what we've been missing out on.  Other games have taken shortcuts and denied us a pure visceral experience that our computers,  our internet connections, and our skills were capable of all along.

No, it's ♥♥♥♥ing PERFECT.  You'll be tearing the map inside out looking for those last damned secrets, the fights just get better and better the more enemy types they throw at you (and the more firepower you throw back) and the Nightmare difficulty is actually a challenge.  I'm frankly amazed that they translated the gameplay so well to a modern game, from essentially a 2D topology (and gameplay) to 3D as well.\n\nMultiplayer? Meh.  Needs some more work.  The weapons are inherently unbalanced and the guns are not satisfying.  The speed is okay but feels slower than it actually is because too many of the wrong weapons are weak e.g. rocket launcher, and the game is very unhappily married with this horrendous two-weapon loadout system.  Why did they have to introduce THAT element, especially when the single player game does not, thank God?  Also the announcer sounds like he's a centuries-old wizard with just as much understanding of the game.  Bad, bad.  Tragic thing is the finishing-touch work to make multiplayer as evil and nosebleed-inducing as it ought to be is a couple of hours work, if that.  Except for new VA work, obviously.\n\nOverall get it today for the satisfying single player, if you're a Doom fan.  Don't bother with multiplayer until it's actually worked on a bit more.  The multiplayer would probably be a bit more okay if the single player wasn't such a glorious masterpiece right alongside it, making the multiplayer look even more of an afterthought.\n\nSnapmap is more of the same as multiplayer sadly, the tool itself is pretty darned cool but for all of its options it is limited by the imposed limits set to keep the framerate up on consoles and minimum spec PCs.

I have always found fast paced fps multiplayer games, ever since Quake world to a bit of a minefield for knowing if a game is good or not. You can never trully say a game is good or bad just by playing multiplayer.\n\nI urge for anyone thinking of getting this game to ask yourself, are you a single player or multiplayer person? SP is defintiely me and because of that, this is why I believe this game has done an awesome job.\n\nWith all my settings set to Ultra (There is one more step known as Nightmare but you need a 5GB GFX card to support it) it runs butter smooth at constant 60fps. I see no screen tearing, no lag, no nothing. The AI of hellspawn and depending on which difficulty you choose is on par, they all have their own way of coming for you.\n\nAs you play through the game there is so much to do for a SP FPS, but it does not hinder the game as most FPS's that try to add side projects to it. The upgrades for weapons, armour, runes etc are very well done and the mini games mixed in to get the runes just add to the flavour.\n\nThere is a very well put together overview of the environments, artifacts, weapons, monsters etc. that really give you the feel that you are part of something in that world and you are learning of why, what, where, who, when and how.\n\nI am yet to play with Snapmap, but from what I've seen in terms of how it works, people out there who are not the best at creating extra content for a game can find it very easy and there is so much that can add in via the community. Definitely giving it a lot more playability rather than just straight up SP or Multi.\n\nOverally if I was to rate this out of 10, it would definitely be a 9. The only reason it wouldn't be 10 is because it is missing the most memorable part of any old school game that is current, CO OP.","May 23","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bubbles95/recommended/379720/","Bubbles95","Bubbles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bubbles95/","211 products in account","I don't know where to start besides saying that I just love it. Calling it perfect would be absurd, but it's damn near close. The critiques I have are mostly too minor for me to really care about. Four things that stood out to me the most about the game are:\n\nThe Level Design\n\nThe levels are huge and full of secrets. They remind me very much of the original Doom levels in the sense that they can be full of twists and turns with little alcoves and corners hiding items that you need to sniff out. The verticality makes for a lot of interesting routes you can take. I love the fact that they included an automap and managed to make it completely readable and easy to use. I'm always tabbing in and out of it to look for secreat areas or places I might have overlooked, just like in the original games.\n\nThe maps are also very pretty. The Martian surface with the vast landscapes that you can look out over, seeing different parts of the UAC base that you eventually travel to almost strikes me as a callback to the intermission screen of Knee Deep in the Dead. My two favorite levels so far are probably Foundry and the Lazarus labs. Running around the gritty industrial facility with molten slag pouring out of the walls making everything glow bright orange. And later on, deep inside the Lazarus labs, you can see the extent of what the UAC have been up to with their experimenting and cult worship of Hell, which leads me to my next favorite bit.\n\nThe Story\n\nYeah Doom seems to actually have a halfway decent story so far. Well, I haven't finished the game yet so I still have to see what happens, but I love reading all of the tidbits you pick up along the way about the environments and the monsters. Each codex entry you find gives you some insight into the research and development behind the projects that UAC have been up to, as well as the indoctrination of their workers. Slowly brainwashing them from their low level positions until they eventually convince them that it's perfectly okay to kneel over and be ripped apart by a demon.\n\nAnother thing I like is that half the time the game simply lets you ignore things if you don't want to bother listening to what's going on. There are some forced cutscenes where you have to stop and look at a thing that's happening, but most of the time these only last about 5 seconds, with the exception of a few that may last quite a bit longer.\n\nI want to keep this review mostly spoiler free, but the way they handled Doomguy is great. Reading about his backstory and seeing how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ he is with what the UAC is doing is a great way for them to let Doomguy speak without actually using his voice.\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nThe combat is just fun. You move very quickly, you jump around up onto ledges and over demons heads, smacking down on their chests and pulling their heads apart, blasting them with rocket launchers and slicing them in half with chainsaws. It's so fast, fluid, bloody and fun. Everytime I reach a room that I can tell is going to be a fight I get excited, I think to myself " hell yeah, let's do it " and then the monsters pour in and the music kicks in and you just start dancing around the room fragging one demon after another.\n\nWhen it's over with you get a breather to look around the level and stock up on health and ammo, wandering the corridors again for the next room that needs to be cleaned out, or trying to find a secret. The levels are very nonlinear at times and your path is your choice. Some people may not like the fact that rooms go into lockdown and you're forced to fight and kill everyone before you can leave, but for me there's never been a time where this has been disappointing or frustrating. You have plenty of weapons and can always fight your way out if you're resourceful enough.\n\nAnother aspect I like is the inclusion of upgrades for weapons and your character. As far as I can tell, these are completely optional except for the first time you come across a suit upgrade. I like these light customization elements, they essentially bring new weapons into the game by letting you add on two mods to your guns that offer an alternative fire mode. In addition to this, you can upgrade your suit by allowing for more health, armor, and ammo capacity.\n\nSnapmap\n\nFor me, Snapmap is a love-hate relationship. I love love LOVE the fact that id designed this and included it with their game. I've been making maps for as long as I can remember, anything from a simple WYSIWYG editor to things like Hammer. I love being able to create a level and control the gameplay behind it. Nowadays, most editors are quite complicated with a steep learning curve, and even after you've bothered to learn them it still takes a LOT of time and effort to produce anything that looks and feels halfway decent. Snapmap basically takes care of this for you, and lets you connect levels together with premade assets. Rooms are already made, and you place props, lights, effects, ambience, monsters and pickups within them. You can manipulate logic to create events and other actions within the level. From what I've seen, this can go fairly deep.\n\nThe flip side of this editor is that most of it is already done for you. You cannot build architecture unless you get creative with some of the props. You can't alter the lighting too much besides a couple of entities they give you as well as changing the atmosphere of the room, but this is mostly just a visual manipulation of the player's screen with color correction and brightness. There's also a " budget " meaning that you're only allowed to place so many monsters, objects, and logic. This is a shame but somewhat understandable. If someone tries to create a level that's way too detailed with too many monsters, they will probably tank their framrate. But at the same time, you should just let them. I'm not going to pretend I know everything about what went into the development of this and what it's limitations are, but it does feel a bit unnecessary to impose these limits.\n\nAnother thing that's a huge bummer is there are no Hell and Martian surface themes. Hopefully they will include these in the future, because despite the more organic nature of the two themes, I still think they're completely doable.\n\nBesides these shortcomings, Snapmap is a wonderful addition to the game. It will hopefully keep the community alive for a while longer.  Maybe we'll also get some true modding tools in the future so that the more talented people out there can put together some campaigns and other cool stuff. But in the meantime, I'm really glad they created this.\n\nIn summary\n\nI feel like Doom really hit it's mark. It's a great blend of the classic run and gun, visceral gameplay of the original games with some modernization from features such as the upgrade system. There's lots of fun storytelling to find within the game if you're looking for it. The highly explorable maps are always such a pleasure to run through, appreciating the aesthetics of the sleak UAC base and the twisted depths of Hell.\n\nI absolutely recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Doom or just likes a good old fashioned shooter game.","May 15","true","144.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
