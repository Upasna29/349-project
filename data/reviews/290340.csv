It looks fantastic, it's a beautifully-crafted world, it's got a great deal of variety both in aesthetic in characters. The world and its characters are fascinating; even with little character development, the animations alone are enough to convey each character's personality, and aspects like the Rot are mysterious enough to be captivating. I'd absolutely love to see this world explored further in other games or media - it's a world I want to spend more time in. However, I've put a good deal of time into the game, and while for the most part I've enjoyed myself, the game has two critical flaws that make me uncomfortable recommending it. So while this review is negative, please understand that in the context of "it's great until you start taking it seriously."\n\nThe two major issues the game has are as follows: first, attacks are easier than defenses. When you are in battle, barring any of the rare modifiers, three sides of the six-sided dice result in an attack, one of which rolls an extra die (which can chain infinitely), while only one side will give you a defense. A defense will block one attack and no more. The issue this presents is that combat has extremely high variance; you could roll 12 dice against 6, and there's still a large chance that you will die in the process. Your opponent is far more likely to roll enough attacks to kill you, than you are to roll enough shields to ensure your life. Even when you roll 20 dice against 4, you could very easily watch a long chain of rerolls build on your opponent's board that quickly eclipses your shields and remaining health. Rather than feeling like an exciting and rare moment, it feels like the norm.\n\nThe conclusion may be, therefore, to avoid combat entirely; but there are also an abundance of ranged cards that let you do large amounts of damage, and rarely requiring you even be close to the target. There is no way to "safely" play a game of Armello. When paired with the variety modifiers for the dice rolls, the simple fact is that surviving is far more difficult than killing...\n\n...which leads into the second issue: there is basically no comeback mechanic. It is ridiculously easy to fall into a situaton where you can't progress further towards any victories or character progression because you keep dying, and you keep dying because you can't become any more powerful. This is not just a common occurence, it's basically standard: in every game aside from AI matches, one person will always end up in a situation where they literally cannot compete because they have to go for their quests, but they can't get to those quests because it becomes too easy for them to die along the way and start way back at the beginning. And even if they get to stack the odds in their favor - they get a few lucky spells that buff their attack and die and weaken their opponent - once again, the game is so high-variance that they are still very likely to get set back to square one.\n\nThe problem here is not that you can be screwed over at anytime; it's that you are less likely to be screwed over when you're already in the lead. Not just on the basic premise that players who can stay on the board get more powerful and have more opportunities (rich get richer), but there are other game mechanics to support this: The Prestige Leader gets to pick one of two laws to be enacted every dawn, meaning they can always choose the card that benefits themself or threatens other players; and also, once you die, you can't play any cards to the board until you leave your spawn on your next turn. You can also only move after you've drawn cards, meaning you may will be unable to toss the cards you don't want in order to draw better ones that might actually help you win.\n\nAnd once a player realizes they are in that pit they cannot climb out of, there's hardly any reason to complete the game - I've never played an online game where a player hadn't tapped out by the halfway point. I wouldn't even call it a ragequit; after all, acceptance of defeat does not have to involve anger any more often than disappointment. And once one person has left, the remaining players generally follow shortly after.\n\nSo, I also play a lot of Blood Bowl. I've stared the worst that RNG can offer straight in the face, and occasionally managed not to cry. But Armello is rigged in such a way that makes Blood Bowl seem almost forgiving. If Wyld rolls (the ones that reroll) were shields instead of attacks, the game would likely be significantly more fun to play, as it would encourage trying to stack the RNG in your favor; rather than always needing the best luck possible to get anything done, no matter what you do. Blood Bowl is a game of calculating risks and managing your actions to maximize your chances of success. Armello is a game of swearing because the game will leave you in positions where your only hope for victory is that everyone else starts aimlessly wandering into swamps and suiciding constantly for the remainder of the game.\n\nI still recommend the game for a few hours' worth, if you've got friends to play with. Don't play online, because you'll never finish a game with as many people as you started with. And don't stress over trying to get better at the game, because you'll eventually realize that the skill ceiling was underneath the building's foundation all along. But yeah, it's a pretty fun experience for a period of time.","November 15, 2015","false","37.1"," 1,469 of 1,726 people (85%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","85","469","1","59","98"

It is very well produced blend of strategy, role playing, and board gaming. The producers have comitted great attention to detail. Every element of the game; characters, story line, events, spells, equipment, flavor text, and even poetry, create a true sense that this is a fully imagined world that you have entered.\n\nBefore I go into the gameplay, a little bit on the game lore would be helpful: Armello is a kingdom of animal clans ruled by a lion (king). Unfortunately, the king has been infected by a creeping, evil disease called the "Rot". It has driven him mad and slowly ebbes his health. Each night the Rot grows in him, and each morning he loses health. His madness is evident in his daily decrees, that create chaos around the realm, affecting the heroes and inhabitants of the kingdom. The time then has come to depose the king and for a new hero to take the throne.\n\nArmello is a turn based 4 player board game (you can also play against AI). At the beginning of a game players choose a hero, a female or male character, that is either a bear, wolf, rabbit, or rat. Each character has unique stats (Fight/Body/Wit/Spirit), and also a unique ability. The hero's creature clan type provides a trait that provides a boon for that character as well. From there players select a ring and amulet that provide additional abilities or benefits to their hero.\n\nPlayers take turns drawing cards, moving their heroes about the game board, casting spells, and completing quests. Completing a quest improves hero stats, and rewards them with equipment, followers, or treasures. As heroes adventure they will encounter perils, both randomly placed, and ones placed by other players and the king. They may also attack other players and cast spells on opponents to hinder their progress or even kill them. There are King's guards and evil creatures called banes that wander about the board that will attack players and generally get in the way.\n\nThe object for each player is to aquire the means to dethrone the king and become the new monarch/matriarch themself. There are 3 ways to win the game; by defeating the king in straight one on one combat, by gathering 4 spirit stones to destroy the "Rotting" king, or by having the most prestige points when the king finally succumbs to the Rot after 10 turns.\n\nSo here's the take away for Armello:\nPros:\nBeautifully imagined and rendered world. From the artwork to the storyline to the general atmosphere, you know that this game was a labor of love for the very competent makers.\n\nUnique. Armello borrows from several genres and merges them into new gaming experience that is a welcome break from the copy/paste fodder that has cluttered the online gaming selection.\n\nFun and addictive. Even if you don't win you'll have tons of fun tripping up your opponents and discovering new ways to use heroes, board tactics, and spells.\n\nReplayability. The variety in characters, abilities, and win conditions make each match unique and provides tons of replayability. Achievements will unlock new rings and amulets that give players even more opportunities to expirement with heroes and win conditions.\n\n\nCons:\nWaiting. Armellos is a turn based game so this may turn some people off. In addition each night and morning there are non-player creatures that must move and decrees to resolve. One consolation is that you can still play spells, perils, and equip items during another players turn.\n\nMore waiting. The player base is still small and you may have to wait a while, sometimes longer than a while, to get a full group of opponents. (best bet is to invite your friends to a game)\n\nRandom. "The best laid plans of mice and men....". The randomness of card drawing, dice rolls in battle, decrees, and questing, can sometimes wreck your strategy. It can be frustrating since you have little control over this element of the game. But the more you play, the more you learn how to mitigate this factor and/or adust your strategy in midstride.\n\nYou can't win. Ocassionaly, at some point in an Armello match you'll realize that you can't win. Kinda like in Monopoly when you own Mediterranian and Baltic Avenues and your opponent owns everything else. It just ain't gonna happen. Sometimes as early as midgame you come to this realization. Many online players drop out at this point (the game inserts an AI player to take over when this happens). And you'll feel like your just going through the motions, hopelessly. But, you can still get some enjoyment out of messing with the leading player or even by helping another player steal the win!\n\nIn closing this is a great game that's different and enjoyable. It deserves to succeed. So get it, play it, and definately tell your family, friends, neighbors, and enemies to give it a try.","April 25","true","226.9"," 150 of 169 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","150","169","7","5"

Love the audio!  Love love love the concept behind the whole premise of the game!  It's genius!  Almost everything about it is just fun.  The different characters being animals and their traits. etc.   This has so much potential for expansion it isn't funny.  The whole game as it is now could be one small room in a whole castle or kingdom. and jsut a small part of the story.  (sorry in game development so get too excited about the potentials.. feature creep)  Anyway, the like part of this is so broad that it's hard to put it in a few words and I don't have time or the finger durability to write it all down.  I love the fact that it's difficult to master. ... but the game is too random card wise to get really good at it or turning situations.  I love that you can win in different ways.  like I said .. this game has so much genius in it.\n\n\nHowever, in the hopes that the dev team sees some of this I will detail a little more in the "don't like" side of things.  Because I want to keep playing!\n\nFirst of all, the games are not short most of the time, and that is good, but there is no way to save a game and come back to it later.  If you have to stop and quit due to life, you loose all progress.   I don't need a bunch of saves to cheat with. I just want to save to come back to later.  It took me almost 3 hours to play one game.  Sometimes I don't have that long to play but don't want to screw myself out of playing because I don't have 3 hours.  Online play, well doh, no need for it there but locally, that is a feature I'm frankly appauled isn't in there yet.  That is an industry standard for any tabletop or turn based game. ... in fact most all games.\n\nA couple of times I played a card, for example, one that takes one prestige from each player.  palyed the card no problem, and everyone still had all their prestige and I got 0.  There are a few cards in there that are similar that seem to be buggy in general or buggy to one character.. but it isn't consistant enough to give you a bug report with any helpful info in it to track it down.\n\nThe randomness of the dice and cards are a bit too random. characters really don't get to build and use their strengths and weaknesses.. wait... Thane has no weaknesses (for example)... and always has money and prestige even if you take it all away.  Even if he has an item of some sort.  doesn't matter the game, whether he has city income or not or hasn't even gone treasure hunting, etc.  Even if he gets killed 4 times in a row with no source of income , he's always got plenty of gold and presitge. LOL!!  That kind of needs to be looked at.  Makes for a great challenge if you got the right attitude, but even if you do, after a while it gets old.\n\nI know unlocking jewelry and stuff helps you customize it a little bit but honestly, it's in areas that don't help that much in most characters... not all.. but most. What good is stealth in the city at one part of the day when it's likely they saw you go in there.. >,<  It's just an example of the many things.  Sure it might come in handy a sliver of the time but it really doesn't make you feel compelled to unlock much of anything... and there is no progression at all in any way to make you feel like you are playing more than a same scenario board game.\n\nIn the game you have to stay almost completely rot free to survive or go full rot.. you can't really play the middle of the road and have much of a chance of winning anything other than prestige or by stones.\n\nI will have to say though, even with all the "dark side" comments, it's worth 15 dollars... but if improvements aren't made soon, honestly I wouldn't pay 10 for it even as beautiful and artful as it is.  The flaws are big gotcha's .. something as simple as a "sorry you can't save your game and come back to it" is HUGE!!\n\nI really hope this keeps progressing I love it and do recommend it.\n\nEdit:  It will save your progress in single player, but be aware there is no message that it will do so.","September 2, 2015","true","35.1"," 127 of 152 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","127","152","5","4"

Twice I was thwarted, twice I lost precious time as the King fell deeper into his sickness, but on my third attempt to slip past the sinister curses, I made it beyond the palace walls. Soon we would be free!\n\nBut it was not to be. The other powers of the realm, drunk with lust for the throne, would force me out, limping, bloodied, back to my home. It became clear that I would never be able to save the King before the Rot claimed his life.\n\nAnd so I began a swift campaign of political treachery. I schemed, I connived. I did things that whittled away at my soul. To my dismay, it was not long before a rival house entered the keep and slew our once great King. But they sacrificed their own life in the process. In the turmoil that followed, I slipped through the web of liars and conspirators to occupy the vaccuum of power left in the rivers of blood that now freckled our land.\n\nI could not save the King, nor could I save my spirit.

This is due to a unadvertised kickstarter which was participated in by about 3,000 people. Being part of said kickstarter got you access to the "Bandit" clan permenantly and exclusively. So let's just get that un-advertised thorn of dissapointment right out in the open.\n\nThe Pros:\n-The game is fun, the gameplay is solid, and it feels like exactly what it was meant to be- that beer and chips roleplaying, dice throwing, card slinging board game you've likely played with your friends before.\n-The graphics are smooth and there is plenty of depth to keep gameplay engaging.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the single player AI doesn't feel lacking like some games of these genres do, and have an amusingly nasty habit of punishing the player and other AI's mercilessly. It feels nearly complete if not acceptably so as a base boardgame in it's current state to be frank; though not all cards are incorperated in the game yet, nor are the characters.\n-The full game will double the (dirty steam players) roster from 4 to 8. So there are more characters to come. and assuming the community doesn't take the secret kickstarter issue too personally, likely more to come in future expansions, assuming there will be expansions.\n\nThe Bad:\n-As a pre-release it does have its share of  bugs. Occasionally, but not often, the game will hang on an AI's turn and require you to restart the game. This can be bothersome, but it has only happened to me 3  times out of about 14 matches so...it's par for a pre-release in terms of technical difficulty.\n-The game does not explain in any way it seems, the ability mechanics obtained through spells and equipment yet.\nExample, the abilities "Scout" as provided by "Mariners Lantern" and "Evasion" as provided by a spell who's name I can't remember, are discussed nowhere. You can refer to a wiki...but I feel there shouldn't have to be any sort of question on this. Especially with a large tutorial-esque digital pamphlet to read to get the rules down, there should be an effects tab there to clear up any confusion at the least.\n- People can and do ragequit if they are losing mid game. These games mind you can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. This being said, a poor sport could waste a good chunk of your day with no sense of satisfaction to be had. It is also worth noting that there is no system in place to punish this type of poor sportsmanship, and thusly, you can keep your win/loss ratio as high as you want it to be as long as you never let yourself lose...by ragequitting.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Overall; I love this game and hope to see it succeed... but I will tell you this as well. Anyone who gets into this game will eventually feel a creeping frustration regarding the 1/3 of the character cast they will never have access. Especially given that they are easily the best designed and most interesting characters so far as to be seen of the lot. This is a real shame in my eyes.\nBeing meant to be played online, the average player will likely get fed up or agitated seeing these sacred cows they will always want to play with, but ya know... NONE FOR YOU!\nAlso, it is worth mentioning this will likely cause tension regarding the competitive gaming community as well regarding the legality of these characters in any sort of tournaments, which will likely insight endless bickering and hostilities between the filthy steam players and the obscure kickstarter community.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n+The Grade I want to give: 9/10 - As a pre-release game it shows a great deal of polish, care, and attention to detail. The gameplay is balanced and there is enough to be done to remain engaging; including trash talking in chat mid game. I love the way it looks and feels very much and could spend many countless hours tooling around a game like this casually, however...\n\n+The Grade I have to give it: 6.5/10 - As stated above, this is a fun game that is hard to find fault with, even in its early stages, but with the ability for poor sportmanship to ruin any chance of an accurate leaderboard, and the high probability a "Good" player may actually just be a man child hellbent on wasting your time and robbing you of that satisfying victory you started the game seeking, I can't fully endorse the multiplayer just yet in a competitive sense.\nFurthermore, I personally found out about the game only after it was released in its early release phase, but by the time the steam community was made aware of it's existance, they were already damned to forever-never play 1/3 of the games cast; more regretably so, the most appealing 1/3 of the games cast.\nMaybe seems like a small detail to some out there, but I personally won't ever be able to fully dismiss this as a "Tough luck" kinda thing. Because nothing spoils a good meal like eating by a great meal, especially when you never knew it was going down accross the table from you.","January 27, 2015","true","20.6"," 116 of 146 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","116","146","8","17"

Strategy here is a key element, though luck factor is also important, as fights are being resolved with dice rolls, but a good player may ensure that odds will be on his or her side. Lets see this title in detail.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Variety of heroes with unique abilities\n+ Hex tile design\n+ Day/Night cycle\n+ Huge replayability\n+ Four victory options\n+ Interactive turn-based system\n+ Cards\n+ Story-driven prologue\no Fair multiplayer (host leave may crash the game)\no Luck and random number generator\n- May be frustrating sometimes\n\nGameplay is cute and lovely. Heroes are moving on hex based tile, and trying to get prestige, magic, coins or even rot sometimes. With four modificable stats via quests - Fight, Body, Wits and Spirit - the amount of strategies is huge and also it adds more replayability to Armello.\n\nThere are basically four victory options. Firstly we have a Prestige victory - gaining prestige for quests, killing heroes and banes. Second one is a Spirit Stone victory, after gaining four stones through quests and stone circles, the king is banished after engaging him. Kingslayer and Rot victory are very simillar, you have to kill the king, survive, when trying for Rot, your Rot has to be higher than king's.\n\nDay and night cycle also brings important aspect, as heroes have affinity to day parts and also other creatures too. During the day Guards move, during the night Banes are spawning and moving. It may be an advantage or disadvantage, heroes may also become corrupted, which changes their strategy.\n\nGood strategy may bring the odds to player side, yet still luck plays an important factor here and after several unhappy rolls players may get frustrated. It is a risk, that needs to be taken. There are six kinds of cards - Items, Spells, Trickery, that may be drawn, Treasures, Followers, acquirable from dugneons or quests, and Palace cards, which player simply has to encounter. Questing is important, as it may deny the palace perils, which are really difficult and nasty.\n\nMultiplayer is fair and it is up to the player, if they decide to team up or not, victory may belong to the best one. Also mechanics are good againts leavers or delaying players, though, when the host drops it might result to game crash.\n\nLast addition to good points is a story-driven prologue, that is not just a simple tutorial, but the beginning of story in Armello. Also easy to understand and explain game mechanics.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Traits and affinities, variety of them\n\nPlayer may choose so far from eight heroes and adjust the strategy accordingly.\n\nRabbit clan is represented by Amber, the Far Seeker, who is excellent in dungeons seeking, thus has a higher chance of get a reward. Another member is Barnaby, the Screwloose, who collects equipment and when changing equipped items, cards are not burned.\n\nBear Clan offers Sana, the Forest Sister, who uses Spirit instead of Fight, when dealing with corrupted creatures, and Bran, the Oakbreaker, who gains temporarily Fight after each successfully casted spell.\n\nRat Clan has Mercurio, the Grinning Blade, who steals gold from previous settlement owners and Zosha, the Whirlwind, who is alwasy stealthed at night and may ambush other creatures.\n\nFinally, we have here the Wolf Clan. Thane, the Winter Wolf pierces burned cards with swords through enemy's defense, River, the Howling Arrow, shoots before fight, inflicting one hp injury to target.\n\nKing is always corrupted, whose healthe decrease and rot increase through the game. Banes get additional rot each night, guards are dealing with them, or with heroes, who have bounty on themselves.\n\nNew heroes are announced, review will be updated after release.\n\nVISUAL\n\n+ Nice art style\n+ Animations\n+ Dices\n- Few graphic glitches\n\nArt style is lovely and suits the nature of the game. Also combat animations with dice rolls are amazing (there are four different dice styles so far with animations), differing whether the dice explodes or not, also hit to the hero differs from a blocked attack. There were some graphic glitches, but very rare and not affecting gameplay.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Stylised\n+ Lisa Gerrard performance\n+ Changing accordingly to the atmosphere\n\nSoundtrack is very well created and composed. Songs are underlining the dark-fantasy atmosphere and course of the game. Also Lisa Gerrard participated and her voice well known from Dead Can Dance or Gladiator suits melodies and game very well. I am glad that developers released soundtrack, that may be also purchased even by non-early-access players.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTo sum it up, Armello is well driven adventure-strategy game with dice rolls and a bit of luck, that resembles the style of board games. With a plenty of cards player may react to changing course of the game and adjust the strategy perfectly.

With Animals!-----\nVersion 1.0 Update is finally here and this game has become everything it set out to be. My review still holds, please read below. As for those complaining about RNG, yes there is a lot of randomness to aspects of this game, but as the store page says "Difficult to Master". Learn how to utilize what is dealt to you. Once you learn the ins and outs of this game you can see the light in what you may consider bad luck of the draw or dice roll. Cards have more functions than to just be played. You may go into a game with one strategy in mind, but be prepared to change things up. I've had plenty of games where I was seemingly at the bottom but would rise to the top to finish strong and win the throne. Don't give up like some of these negative reviews that only have 0.2 to 2 hours played. They barely scratched the surface and do not see the potential.\n-----\nAs a kickstarter backer, an alpha and beta tester, I can say without a doubt that this game is truly a gem. Even in its alpha form it was very well built and fun to play. You can see how much love LoG puts into their game in every single detail of this magnificent world. The story is deep, and engaging. The basic idea is that a Mad King is cursed and slowly dying. The goal is to over throw him and become the new King/Leader of the land.\n\nEach character has their own backstory, bonuses, and generally a typical way they should be played, with room to wiggle: After selecting a character you get to choose from Rings and Amulets, both of them giving you more bonuses and traits that will allow you to help shape your strategy for winning.\n\nThe game plays like a board game, with many mechanics and elements added with the cards, but simple enough to play casually if you'd like. However, in my opinion, the fun really begins when you really try to strategize to win. There are several methods of winning, Prestige (having the most prestige at the end of the game), and over throwing the Mad King in several different ways starting with overcoming the trials placed around his castle. If you pass those trials you can then enter into combat with him and over throw him, or you can present 4 Spirit Stones (Aquired by exploring dungeons, encountering druids, or taking them from the other players) and banish him from the realm with their magic. You can even win by becomming more rotten/cursed than the king and being able to over-power him.\n\nThe cards in the game are wonderfully crafted peices of artwork. They move, and flow, showing off the talent this team has even further. Each card's picture faithfully represents what the card's gameplay function is. There are spells to cast, traps to set, tricks to play, equipment to wear, and followers to join you. You can play cards with either your Magic, or Gold. Some cards even make you more Rotten when you play them or take your Prestige, so be sure to read the card carefully if you are going for a certain strategy to winning (Sometimes you want the Rot, and sometimes you just don't care about Prestige!).\n\nI haven't covered many mechanics this game has to offer, but to quickly throw out a few there are Perils, Quests, Dungeon exploring, Settlments, Terrain effects/bonuses... not to mention the incredibly engaging Dice rolling and Card burning system during Combat and Perils!\n\nWell, to sum it up, I think this game is amazing, and I highly recommend it to absolutely everyone. Especially those who enjoy a strategic board game, a love for animals, a beautiful world, and most of all when actual HEART is put into a game!\n\nThank you!\n\nPS) Be sure to read the Quick Start Guide (along with the many others) in the Community Hub by Alvorn and 8BitProxy\n\nI play in 4k with two 980ti STRIX in SLI. Overkill. Runs nice and smooth. My iMac late 2015 model also runs this at max settings, although not in full 5k resolution like the screen is. Still runs really well.","January 22, 2015","true","120.6"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","54","63","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/290340/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\n“Imagine Magic The Gathering meets Final Fantasy Tactics, and Game of Thrones meets Kung Fu Panda,"\nArmello is a turn based strategy game that was released in September 2015 on PC – being developed and published by League of Geeks.  The game was originally an iPad title that was released in mid-2012 before going through a successful Kickstarter project to get the game onto Steam.\n\nThe game play in Armello feels is almost like an actual board game. There are lots of different dice involved, and hex squares in which you can move your character. You take control of one of eight anthropomorphic animals and plot to oust the corrupt king from power. You can do this in many ways, either by becoming even more corrupt than the king, winning by coming the most prestigious character in the game by completing certain tasks, or killing the king yourself in battle. The game has a day/night cycle, you get two turns per day to carry out your actions. The game lasts for 10 nights usually. Each turn the king will lose one health but becomes more corrupt.   Your character has about 3 action points, moving, attacking and casting spells all cost one point, meaning you can only do so much in one turn – planning your turn is key to this game.\n\nThe game has a card game element to it all be it a very small one. You have an unlimited deck of cards; the cards consist of equipment, spells and traps. Each turn you draw the amount of cards you used in the previous turn.\n\nOne way in which you will be able to win a game of Armello is to become the most prestigious character on the board. You earn prestige by killing other characters in combat, killing corrupt “Banes” which the King summons, or by completing various quests. Each character will have one active quest at any time; this will involve traveling across the map to a specific hex square. The quest will always be completed, but you can take an extra risk by taking your chances on a dice role in order to get extra equipment or stats; failing this will mean you lose stats. I personally found the questing system in this game really fun – the flavour texts of each quest is a nice addition and the simple resolutions keep the game flowing.\n\nGraphically Armello is a really pretty looking game. All of the characters look like they have been drawn in a children’s story book, and they just look gorgeous. My personal favourites are the rat characters; they get the animation nailed down on their run. Even though there is only one map in Armello, it has various different weather effects to keep it looking fresh. The game’s UI is OK. I would have liked to have seen a few extra information boxes on screen to see the rest of the characters stats/points, but this can be accessible in a few button clicks if you want it anyway.\n\nAlthough the game does have a fairly lengthy tutorial that does actually do a good job of explaining the rules of the game; it still took me probably two full games worth for me to just get the basics of the game down. Even now there are parts of the game that I don’t understand; it would be been nice to have a little bit of maybe a tooltip with a lot of the buttons and card effects for you to easily understand what is happening without throwing you in at the deep end and letting you click random stuff to see what happens.  The game can vary in difficulty; sometimes you can be completely screwed over by pure randomness of the cards you are dealt or the dice roles – such is life when you play board games. I think I have got about a 60% win rate at the moment which is fairly good I would imagine.\n\nLike I said before, there is only one map to play on, but the game does a good job of creating a different landscape for you to fight on every game, the randomness of what each hex square can have on it differs from game to game, such as dungeons and settlements all being scattered across the map to keep things fresh.\n\nThere is plenty of replay ability in Armello, I have been playing for almost six hours now and I still have a strong desire to keep playing. There is no “story” mode to be exact; it is just a case of skirmish battles. The game has its own unlock system where you can unlock special equipment for your characters by completing specified tasks in game, meaning it gives you a reason to keep playing to unlock things. The game has eight characters for you to play, each come with their own set of tasks and unlockables. Not to mention the games online mode – whilst there isn’t many people playing it online, hook up a few friends on the game to play in the four player mode for some real competitive action.\nThe game runs perfectly fine with no technical hitches at all; being able to play at 4k resolutions on ultra-high settings makes this a really well optimized PC port. I did try to play with the Steam controller, but it just felt better with the mouse, as you would expect from a strategy type game like this.\n\nI personally think this is quickly turning into one of my favourite turn based strategy games; it is highly addictive, and the learning curve keeps you on the edge at all times. Matches can be completed in twenty minutes or so meaning you can get a couple in when you only have an hour to spare. If you are looking at getting into a strategy based game, I can wholeheartedly recommend Armello to you. I do think it is maybe slightly overpriced at £14, 99 – but still it is a quality game with endless amounts of replay ability.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT60IiKPk-0\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Armello takes place in a beautiful fantasy setting with wonderful weather and lighting effects.  It truly is a wonder to behold.  I won’t mention so much about the graphics in this game as it is plain to see from videos and screenshots that only a fool would dispute how especially nice this game looks!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Pz5asaCPhY8\n\nArmello is far from style over substance.  The games mechanics, whilst they may take some time to digest fully, are as beautiful as the game looks.  Don’t be fooled by the fairy-tale appearance, its gameplay is far more sinister!  Players will be poisoning, stabbing, stealing from, reaping revenge and a whole list of other mischievous acts upon their opponents.\n\nThe acts are carried out by the cards in a player’s hand, or they can be played to hexes on the board or you can just outright attack another player.  The Kings guard can also attack players if they upset the King and monsters (Banes) roam the land attacking nearby players.\n\nAs I mentioned before the objective is to kill the King and the first person to do this wins, if no one manages it before the King dies (I forgot to mention that he isn’t very well!) then the “prestige” leader wins.  Prestige is accumulated in a variety of ways including killing other players, the Banes, etc.\n\nI’m not going to go in depth into the rules here.  The game offers a tutorial, which I found helped a little but going in blind I was quite confused by the end.  On the main menu there is also a “Game Guide” that is worth reading as well.  Hopefully after that things should be a bit clearer.  I gave up twice trying to learn the game due to not understanding the tutorial, then a friend played a game with me using VOIP and it all became clear!\n\nI am so glad I persevered.  I must say that I haven’t met any example of a board game, either physical or digital that encapsulates so much.  If you have any interest at all in turn-based games or even better board games specifically, Armello could become your new obsession!  Heed that as a warning if anything!\n\nPlayer numbers are pretty good, you can usually find an online four player game within a couple of minutes.  Sometimes it may take a little longer, which isn’t bad considering each match will take around 60-90 minutes.\n\nThe developers decided to not include in-game chat which I think is a bad decision.  Their reasoning behind this is because a few people will troll and insult others.  Yes, this is a sad fact of the world and especially the internet but that’s what mute buttons were invented for (well maybe not originally!).  The lack of chat means learning the intricacies of the game will take a bit longer and developing friendships with other Armello players may never happen from within the game.  Which I think is a shame.\n\nAnyhow, that’s enough time away from Armello typing this review up!  I’m gonna go find myself another match and hope I can be the one to topple the king this time!!","March 1","true","159.3"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","42","48","4","0"

With redwall-esque anthropomorphic animals, deadly rot vultures called Banes, and a solid board game behind it to boot; this game was a no brainer for me. But is it for you?\n\nWell, I've logged about 40+ hours in the first week of owning it and here is what to expect if you add it to your steam collection.\n\nIt's a bit much to dive into if you have no previous experience with board games, but if Puerto Rico, Settlers of Catan, Power Grid, and Lords of Waterdeep are names that are familiar to you, then you shouldn't have any problem. There are currently 4 characters (with extras for the folks who kickstarted it) each with unique starting stats. Players will balance things like fighting skill to be able to beat other players/banes, wits to increase hand size and solve challenges, health to survive longer on the game board between turns, and spirit which dictates how many spells you can cast.\n\nYou'll also be collecting gold, influence, and magic while also trying to limit the amount of rot or corruption you garner. Or will you...That's the best thing about Armello. The way to win in any given game isn't immediately obvious. In fact, there are 4 win conditions. There are turn cycles, day and night, and with each passing day the corrupted King at the center of the board grows weaker. So your options are 1: collect the most prestige points and hope he dies. 2: Collect 4 spirit stones and bring them to him to cure/exorcize the king 3: Fight him in battle and survive to claim the throne. 4: Purposely allow yourself to be corrupted by the Rot and obtain a Rot Victory. The last seems the hardest, but it gives each of the characters an interesting advantage over one another. Mercurio is great at scheming in the background stealing gold and settlements, but you can build him almost as bruisery as Thane, the wolf who is the pen ultimate of fighting.\n\nEach game can have random stuff set you back or catapult you forwards into the lead. And sometimes that can be frustrating because it's not necessarily through any great strategy of your own, or even an opponent doing something annoying. Then again sometimes it is. So I feel like any board game it tries to balance luck and randomness with solid player strategies and tactics. The communication at present is done through emotes alone and it's hard to really convey much to the other players. It certainly isn't the same as chatting with your friends around the game table, but it's still so damn fun without the option to chat. And the art/videos/concept is simply amazing.\n\nThere is no single player campaign, so don't fool yourself into thinking this is anything but a board game. Now, it's still in early access and with the success of it who knows what they do next, but my assumption would be, more characters, new items, plot cards, perhaps new perils or monsters, eventually even new game boards or modes. But it's a board game in virtual form. Nothing more, nothing less. If that's your thing, then I hope to see you in a game soon. :)","June 9, 2015","true","69.8"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","37","40","0","1"

Armello features a different board each playthrough and randomly spawning evil and good mobs to help terrorize your opponents; these things make every run a unique experience.\n\nDue to the random nature of the game, I don't feel discouraged if I'm losing halfway through.  There are enough weapons, armor and followers to ensure my character at least has access to tools that'll turn a losing game into a winning one.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Talisman and Elder Sign: Omens.  A game of Armello can be played in under an hour, and there aren't any characters that can just roll over other characters by default (such as the Assassin in Talisman).  Although dice rolling can be brutal, there are plenty of ways in Armello to "fix" your dice results and improve your chances; the game rarely feels unfair (unlike Elder Sign, heh).\n\nBefore purchasing this game, I did feel the price was a bit steep.  I'm glad to announce that I have no buyer's remorse; Armello is worth every penny.","June 22, 2015","true","13.3"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","0"

Connections between people in multiplayer are more resilient while pirates seem to have been booted from Steam's network.  More item cards were added, font size is bigger for better readability.\n\nSingle player mode is now lightning fast with fast-forward mode on: you can finish a game in 15-20 mins instead of 40.  The new house rules also let you tweak aspects like turn times, character max HP, or King's starting life.\n\nSharing of the Bandit characters is functioning, with their full release still planned for Early 2016.\n\nThings the community is hoping to see in the near future:\nFull reconnection to games when a player drops accidentally.\nCross Multiplayer between Steam, PS4, IOS, and DRM free.\nMore Houserules.\nRanked Mode.\nEven More characters post Bandits.\n\n\nUpdate added 8/2/2015\n\nAddressing concerns found in negative reviews that are no longer accurate:\n\nWhen this game first annouced early access, there was a controversy about a set of 4 characters being limited to only people who backed the Kickstarter.  This "Bandit clan" has since been declared open for purchase as a paid DLC to be released a few months after the official release.  Those that were backers will get to play their "Beta" a bit before release, but only in single player and friends match games.\n\nPrestige being the only victory: Early on, there was no way to raise stats and thus beating the Palace gates required luck of dice or card draws.  Now you can weaken the Perils with trickery cards, raise your Peril beating stats by 2 points each (4 total points to spend, no more than 2 per stat), and the act of finishing your 5 quests gives you the ability to automatically pass the Palace Peril closest to your home.  Without other players acting to stop you, Facing the King happens quite often.  Spirit stones are much less luck driven in acquisition and there's no way to lose them like there used to be.  Acquiring Rot is more sensible too, it's easier to gain rot after corruption when before it used to be very difficult to find Rot past 5 points.\n\nA few corrections in my review below: Winning by spirit stones changed.  Now instead of heroes starting with stones, and stealing from each other, stones will appear on the map to be picked up as an alternative to pursuing your quests; once you have them you can never lose them.  You can also chose to quest with sprit stones as the reward.\n\nQuesting also helps you get Rare Treasure quality gear or followers.\n\nThe new builds are on break until release, but they've already annouced 1.1 for a month after release to implement Ranked Public multiplayer games.\n\nCard library is complete for trickery, missing just 1 spell, and then a handful of items/treasures/followers.  Around 100 distinct cards with a Rarity system so some cards appear many times a game and others just once.\n\nOriginal January Review below this point.\n\nShort version: The Art is beautiful, the mechanics are solid and unique, the Dev team actively engages the forum and spits out new builds at least every 3 weeks.  If you like complex boardgames that handle all the rules themselves very efficiently, you are going to like this game.  If boardgames, fantasy kingdoms, or walking talking animals are not your thing, you wont like this game.\n\nLong Version:\nDo you like fantasy boardgames?  Armello gives you a cast of Anthromophic heroes on a quest to succeed the throne of Armello as its Dying King goes mad from the Corrupting disease "Rot".\n\nYou can perform quests, slay monsters, and even dispatch your Rivals to earn prestige and become the people's hero for when the King dies of supernatural causes, the King will even ask you for advice in his new laws.\n\nOr perhaps, you can just kill the king yourself and take the throne before his increasing insane laws harm the populace, but the King is powerful and well guarded, you'll need to explore deep dungeons or collect tribute from towns to gear up and wield wyld magic spells to make yourself stronger.\n\nPerhaps you'll find more of the sacred spirit stones that have been told might Save the King from the horrible disease; the heros of the other clans each have 1 (See update correction).\n\nOr perhaps you'll fight darkness with darkness.  Sink deep into depravity and the darkness will grant you all the power you desire to take the throne.\n\nEach Hero has variations of 4 stats: Fight (how many dice you roll in battle), Body (your max HP), Wits (your ability to draw cards each turn, sneak into the palace walls, solve many of the quest's dilemmas and avoid Trickery's set by other players, and Spirit (amount of MP you reset to each night and ability to dodge harmful spells.)  In combat you roll sword, day or night (matching whether the game round is night or day) or the Wyld symbol to hit (Wyld symbols even reward you with extra dice for critical hit like effects); shields to defend, and the Rot symbol just revels in your failure.  The 3 to 1 offense defense ratio makes combat vicious.  You can use unwanted cards in your hand to force Dice to be the symbols you want.\n\nThe map is randomley generated from hexagons.  Forests let you hide at night, towns pay you if you own them at dawn, swamps injure those who ford them, mountains take extra time to cross but give you the high ground in battle (extra defense), and stone circles let you heal your wounds.\n\nEach round you draw until you have your Wit stat in Hand size.  You can pick item cards that cost gold to play and can equip 3 non consumable items.  You can pick spell cards to cast from your nightly regenerating mana to buff yourself, teleport, or harm your rivals.  You can also spend your gold and reputation on Trickery cards to raise your public standing or harm your rivals.  Usually, you have 8 days and 8 nights to make your claim, but animal sacrafice to the King's evil can prolong his dark reign.\n\nThe game is still in early access, so the card deck is only about 70 of the planned 130, some odds and ends of mechanics is open to feedback like the effects of some spells and the slight customizations each character has (would you like bonus magic from waking up in forests, or become invisible when you enter towns?).  Each game takes about 30 minutes versus the AI (Turns over in 15 second) or 90 minutes versus 3 other humans (turns given a max of 2 minutes).  You communicate to other players via a hardcoded list of chat phrases.  Or you can use Steam's friends/chat room functionality.","January 28, 2015","true","595.0"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","40","48","0","11"

My friends and I have been playing it since it came out, pretty much non-stop.  And while we may scream in anguish after a particularly unlucky die roll, we always end up coming back for more.  An extremely tight and polished game.\n\nPros:\n-Authentic Board Game Experience\n-Incredibly addictive\n-Beautiful Artistic Style\n-Four paths to victory, giving options for each player to always have *some* chance of pulling out a win, even if it's from someone else failing at the last moment\n-Multiple character types with unique traits and starting stats\n-Three card types (Items, spells, tricks) that work very differently to achieve the same goals, allowing for more diverse strategies\n-Dozens of unlockables with additional unique traits\n-Easy-to-set-up multiplayer, especially with friends\n-Relatively short but satisfying games (30-45 mins single player, 60-90 multiplayer)\n-Excellent tutorial\n\nCons:\n-A fair amount of luck involved, some of which can be significant enough to foil the most well-thought-out strategies\n-Can get heated in multiplayer, when someone chooses to attack/interfere with another player unprovoked\n-The random terrain might slant the game for/against certain people from the start\n-A lot of (often random) events can provoke excess frustration, such as getting a teleport/bane from a ruin, having wandering guards/banes move into your path, being hurt by the daily declaration, etc.\n-Getting across the map (usually to reach your quests) can feel painfully slow\n-One victory path (Rot) significantly more difficult and luck-based than the others\n-All followers and treasures (ie, the best gear) can only be attained through ruins and quest bonuses, and both of these are entirely luck based.  This can lead to gear disparity between players based on what are essentially coin flips.\n-No way to get back in after a multiplayer disconnect (though an AI will take over for you)\n-Some finicky, non-obvious rules are not covered by the tutorial, especially when it comes to gaining/losing influence and rot\n-Like most board games, will eventually get repetitive","September 5, 2015","true","93.5"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","5"

Lot's of little improvements to the UI have been made to make keeping tabs on what goes on in-game much easier. Cards have been added and balanced as needed with the current total so far being 60 out of a planned number of over 100 cards. The game mechanics have been all put in their place to produce a decievingly deep strategy board game that can have you at certain victory only for someone or something to quickly dash your hopes and make you lose everything.\n\nArmello overall is a game that involves a good mix of luck and skill to win. The luck aspect comes from what cards you draw, dice rolls, and dungeon exploration among other variables.  Skill on the other hand comes from knowing where to move, using the terrain to your advantage, and how to use those cards to give yourself an edge. Gameplay itself may last anywhere from about 40 minutes to an hour for multiplayer matches, depending on how long players take on their turns, and at about 30 minutes for matches against the AI. Currently there are a series of tutorial pop-ups present when you play your first game to help guide you through everything Armello has to offer since it can be a little daunting to first time players. Plenty of this game itself is seemingly done, but there's still plenty of polish to be added and feedback to be given. This in turn is where any prospective Early Access player will be able to help make this game even better by providing a fresh perspective on everything already in game plus new ideas for the future.\n\nLeague of Geeks still has lots of work ahead of them, but I already know from what I've personally seen that they will get it done and do a damn fine job of it at that.","January 22, 2015","true","175.2"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

From personal experience I can say each new match is unique - the map has procedural generation (which plays for the reach of resources such as settlements to conquer and dungeons to loot), the player starts each new match with random cards in hand, and this adds to the opponents being placed in different base camp locations (for example, if opponent A was placed on northern base camp in a match, there is a chance you can find it placed on the eastern or western base camp on a next match) plus the strategy you're thinking about running.\n\nAs the game truly is a legitimate digital board game, there is the possibility a player's strategy may be entirely destroyed in only a single turn, or it can turn on this player's favor as well - and this is the true beauty of Armello. The playing of cards - at any time - adds an interesting dynamic to the experience, not to mention the rot, the quests mechanic, the rings and amulets chosen before the match that help the player on his/her strategy and more elements to list.\n\nAdditionally, the environment, the lore, the graphic design (character's and even the cards' illustrations), the sound effects of this game, they're all great.\n\nAs a more personal note, I'm reading the Redwall series and, as in my opinion making a proper Redwall game wouldn't have a good result, I must say that when I want to effectively "play" Redwall, I go play Armello. This is really an amazing experience.","March 7, 2015","true","92.2"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

It is fun, but feel somewhat poorly tuned. Lets start with the bad:\n\n- There are four victory methods, but one seems entirely based on luck (Spirit Stones) and the other feels as if you are attempting to push a boulder up a mountain with a toothpick (Rot).\n- The stats of the characters seem as if they were intended to be "balanced" but fall short of the mark. Some characters have inordinately amounts of advantage compared to others. If you intend on attempting a Rot or King kill victory with a character like Sana, you are in for a bad time. Whereas characters like Thane seem excellently tuned, and capable of Prestige, Fight, Rot, and Spirit Stone victories due to their natural ability to fight other characters.\n- Most of the game feels random. Cards you draw and dice rolls create a frustrating sense of the need for luck, despite your best laid plans and strategies. Cards seem to appear in poor ratios, with common useless cards getting stuck in your hand because you cannot burn them off on perils or battles.\n\nNow the good, and honestly, this does make up for the bad on most days:\n\n- It is EXCEEDINGLY beautiful. The characters all are colorful and interesting, the map gorgeous, and the card art is superb.\n- The music is relaxing and engaging, which is helpful while waiting for your turn. It was a pleasure to hear that early access players would receive the soundtrack for free, and I find myself listening to it frequently.\n- The varied methods of victory make an interesting game. Not everyone is always going for the same goal, and there are different reasons that a character may fight another. Maybe they need to get to a quest, or can see your quest and want to prevent you from getting to it.\n\nAll in all, it is a joy to play, but it does not feel entirely complete. I hope to see more from the development team, and I would be more than happy to see DLC for this game. 7/10","September 6, 2015","true","28.6"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","36","49","0","0"

Out of all of the games i own, Armello is the only other game besides the Fallout series to get me to go in depth into it. The concept is very great, simple to grasp gameplay (learn how to play in roughly 5-20 mins) is awesome, every game you play is totally different than the one your friend will play. The list goes on for this game, but just like a lot of games they do have some drawbacks. For example there is no custom characters for yourself, though it be great to see it in the future to have a custom character that you can make (only one) and see him/her progress in the game.\n\nThough the only other thing that i see as another downside is the map size. The map size never changes, it is great that it is like smallworld where the tiles changes every game, but there should be at least one or two different map sizes other than one. Because game map size is somewhat small for me, and at least they should offer a bigger mapsize too for people, like me, who like extra long games.\n\nThanks for reading my review, though all my reviews are not as detailed and pretty as some, i do try to give you all my own thoughts of the game to help your decision to buy a game or not. This game gets a 9/10 in my book, and i do highly recommend this game to anyone who like GOT (game of thrones), Table Top Games like Small world, or anything that is RPG related. To devlopers of this game, you guys did a very good job with this game and for that i am glad to play Armello.","September 4, 2015","true","9.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

Though some cards may appear more frequently, I've really had to adapt a different strategy every game I've played.\n\nThis is also because of one of the best parts of Armello: the victory conditions. There are 4 different ways to beat the game, and the four conditions are able to be reached by anyone in the game, provided they plan for them. This helps keep the game interesting for everyone: it's hard to have a completely hopeless game, you can always try to fulfill one of the different conditions, regardless of the other player's status.\n\nThe game takes a little to learn and understand, and (at the moment) some tooltips aren't always easily readable, but it isn't a particularly hard game to learn.\n\nThere is ONE big problem with the game at the moment: lack of local multiplayer. This is a boardgame kind of game and the lack of local multiplayer is a big oversight. The developers have said they may add it in the future, but at the current moment it is sorely lacking it. Keep this in mind, because this lacking feature and the somewhat high price tag compared to other board-games, makes it hard to fully recommend.\n\nIf you consider buying it, watch some gameplay videos first. Then, think about how you would want to play the game more: Do I like playing these games online with strangers? Can I wait for a local co-op that may not come? Do I have friends that play online and are willing to buy their own copy for $25?\n\nArmello is an amazing game and should be given a try, but at the moment the multiplayer options have a few bothersome conditions.","April 8, 2015","true","80.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","3"

Attack/defense balance is cranked all the way towards the former, which means that even if you can kill your opponent thrice over, they are likely to kill you too, throwing you back to square one.\n* Way too much is left to chance. If RNG hates you, you can't do anything about it.\n* Matches are too short - 20 turns, 24 at custom rules, and any attack that wounds the King cuts that further down.\n* Next to no settings, specifically graphics, language (it always takes the setting from steam), ans such.\n\nOverall, the game has great potential but it needs fixing.

Well explore a dungeon! From the icon wheel that spins up when you do, it appears more likely that you'll get a coin result, but no. Four dungeons in a row you'll spawn a bane.

Armello is a turn-based RPG/Strategy Card game which is honestly more of a Virtual Board game than anything else. You pick a Hero, each possessing their own strengths/stats/abilities and proceed to compete against 3 other players while trying to win the game through 4 different methods (kill the king, gather 4 stones and confront the king etc etc). All the while, you have random events, dictations from the King (player-chosen events), and even an evil race of monsters (called Banes) that are trying to kill everything and everyone. Sometimes you will work together with other players but it's important to remember there can only be one winner, so backstabbing is friendship killing levels in this game. Final opinion?

What separates Armello from other board games is that the rules of the game are incredibly simple to learn, yet there is so much you can do with the huge variety of cards and equipment you can obtain throughout the game. As someone who is not into the competitive multiplayer genre, games such as Dota or LoL, Armello has plenty of room for players to develop in all levels of skill. As of this moment, the only real High level grounds for players to lurk around on are the "Devs Vs Community" streams where the LeagueofGeeks challenge members of all skill levels in the community to battle against them. Should Armello be taken to a full competitive level, I would certainly delve further into the amazing world of Armello. Despite that this is a Multiplayer focused game, I appreciate that Singleplayer does a fantastic job preparing you for online play and is still enjoyable to look into even if you might not have any friends to play with/against. Be prepared though if you do get your friends into Armello. This game can and WILL test your friendships, but you will also forge new ones from meeting other members of the Armello community. The Music and Artwork for the game are also incredible. The music completely sets the tone for the heroic battle (Between the Heroes and admitably the Players) for the throne. To be honest, I often head into the Card Gallery just to look at the animated artwork for each card as each one adds its own background to the world of Armello. Regardless of how angry I might get at not getting a quest done in time or having bad combat streaks, I still enjoy playing game after game (Even if something like the following story happens)\n\n>Friends think 2v2 is a good idea\n>We try it out\n>Get absolutely massacred in game (MMM WHATCHA SAY, THAT YOU ONLY MEANT WELL)\n>Proceed to get Ice Cream\n>Sit in Corner for 10 minutes, crying while stuffing face in Ice Cream\n>Swears to never touch Armello again\n>Goes back 20 minutes later for another round\n>10/10 Game Design, would salt again\n\nGive this game a shot, get some friends along, I promise you that you will have a wonderful time.\n\n<Edit 1> So I have still been playing this game ever since the review, which I wrote at around 110 hours of total time. Now I have a total of 320 hours and I have shown no signs of slowing down.

I got it in early access, and awaited eagerly as more elements were added. It has many elements that appeal to me. A tabletop feel, fantasy world, anthropomorphic characters. Throw in gorgeous graphics, especially on the animated cards, and a great soundtrack, and surely we're onto a winner.\n\nSadly, I have to say the full release has disappointed me. The game just feels empty. But unlike many early access games, which end up as buggy unfinished excuses to take your money off you, Armello feels like it had a lot of love and effort put into it, which makes what we are left with a let down indeed.\n\nThere are four ways to win in Armello, and only two of them seem worth pursuing unless you like a self imposed challenge. The 'prestige' and 'spirit stone' victories are fairly straightforward, but the 'kill the king' victory is an exercise in masochism, fail at it (which you will most likely, as the king is an absolute beast of a fighter) and you'll be too far behind to try for the other methods. The 'rot' victory is identical to the 'kill the king' victory, except you have to punish yourself even more to get it.\n\nYou can play many cards during an opponent's turn, but good luck finding them: the mouse scrolling gets stuck very easily, and if you zoom out to see the whole map, an inexplicable layer of cloud obscures the whole map! Compare this to a true tabletop card game, where you can play cards against your opponent sitting round a table. Imagine if you had to get out of your chair, chase them around and physically hit them with it before they played their hand. In Armello Seeing as you don't know a card has been played until it's effect kicks in, there is very little one can do to protect against it. Most of the time, you will never have enough resources to ever use that card that's been in your hand for the past 2 turns.\n\nOnce you've won a few games, repeat plays become a chore as you watch your 3 opponents slowly take their turns, then watch the king's guard take their turns, THEN watch the banes take theirs. Games become incredibly drawn out for all the wrong reasons. I think the developers could have added more settings to change gameplay rules, define what type of victory conditions are active and so on, give the player some customisation options to add longevity. Currently the only reason to replay is to unlock the many beautiful cards.\n\nThe game is beautiful, and fun for a little while. It's just a shame it leaves you wanting more so badly.","September 3, 2015","false","19.4"," 45 of 67 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","45","67","0","1"

I don't think so.\n\nAlso, unlike other Board games you actually CAN DO stuff while the other's are at turn. You can manipulate the enemy with your cards, you can set traps to avoid enemys approaching you or their goals. You can study their inventory and their goals.\nRethink your strategy if someone is much further ahead of you with the same strategy.\nAll these things you can do while the other's are at turn.

The art, animation, presentation, music, all of it, awesome.\n\nThe game is super easy to pick up and play, and it isn't all too deep. Matches last for 45 mins, maybe an hour, and each one can play out differently, with different win conditions that are better suited for different characters. A few account-level unlocks, but nothing too skewed toward power. So there's a fair bit of replay, but it's not infinite.\n\nNo local multiplayer, currently, but there is online. Single player probably won't keep you occupied for too long, and it is rather easy (difficulty levels would be much welcome) but multiplayer has some potential, especially when ranked play comes with a later patch.

It feels as though every strategy is trumped by die rolls, random map resource spawn, and card draw.    Yes, you can try to sway the values in your favor, but these seem to be gentle nudges to the odds, with significant resources often spent for no actual gain.

Armello mish-mashes several things I enjoy playing: card-based games, strategy, and tactics. This isn't just a "beat your opponent to the King and layeth down the smack", it's got far more depth than that. The methods of winning the game are part of the draw here: individual play styles can shine and are rewarded for the effort. Pacing your gameplay will depend on your play style.\n\nArtistically, the game draws me back to the worlds created by Richard Adams in Watership Down and The Plague Dogs, and the Redwall stories of Brian Jacques, all of which I enjoyed in my youth and still enjoy now. I actually like the disconnect from human-rendered characters as animals can offer similar, but much more mystical histories. As far as the story goes, there's not much more than a few simple bases: you're part of one of the four animal clans, you're attempting to dethrone the King, and each character has a special skill that can be used to essentially envision them within your own imagination. I like games that allow me to sort of "flesh out" a character for myself rather than having some contrived backstory forced on me, it makes each game more interesting and kind of intense as you're able to invent something for your character to be working toward upon taking the throne.\n\nCons, I suppose, would be some of the things that I consider pros. Not everyone enjoys turn-based games, and waiting for the King's guard and the Bane to take their turns can become tedious (especially if there are a large number of them on the map), and not everyone enjoys card-based gameplay. However, if you don't like turn-based and card-based games, this one shouldn't even be on your radar. Luck is also part and parcel to this game, as it is with any dice-roll game, and if you don't like raw deals from Lady RNG, stay away; stay far, far away.\n\nOne of the pros that I particularly enjoy is that each game can't just "drag out"; the King has diminishing health and will eventually just keel over, ending the game whether anyone's breached the palace or not (no, you cannot heal the King other than one specific means). This keeps it from becoming stale, and since there's that added sort of time limit, it encourages progressive gameplay techniques that are learned from playing the game and understanding its tactics more.\n\nAnother pro is the "chat" system in multiplayer games. There is no "press-enter-to-type" chat function, rather a series of basic dialogues available through the chat tab (like Hearthstone). I've long disliked chat systems in most competitive multiplayer because it seems like some people spend more time "chatting" (rather, trolling or raging) than they do actually playing the game. In the future, I hope that this minimalistic "chat" function is not replaced by a press-enter-to-type system; personally, I feel that it would hinder more than accentuate multiplayer. So far, the only basic way for someone to rage out and quit a match is to simply leave the game. I like this, I don't need someone's vitriol about being behind or ganged upon clogging up my screen. So, if a dev ever happens upon this review, please know that at least one fan of the game likes the "chat" system as it is; it keeps things far more civil in game.\n\nIn all, Armello has an aesthetic that will either appeal or dissuade players in its art style, mechanics, and gameplay. It's easy to sink several hours into this game without noticing (or sometimes caring) that time has passed.","October 7, 2015","true","52.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

This game is a strong statement of shrewd, devoted developers and a sincere passion for their work. This, however, comes at the expense of being a game with limited audience, especially since animal characters tend to give the impression of a game aimed at children, plus a lot of people keep saying they'd prefer this to be a "real" board game, ignoring the fact it is simply amazing to be able to play a well developed, solid board game experience over the internet with people all over the world.\n\nIs it fun? Is it frustrating?This game ranges more towards the frustrating side of the specturm. It is quite fun if you take it as a casual experience. Invite a couple of friends, have some snacks, drinks, and play the game over stories and pleasant conversations. This game is perfect for this kind of approach.\n\nNow, if you're playing a multiplayer game by yourself... It takes a long time for turns to get resolved. The heavily RNG influenced mechanics prevent you from coming with long term strategies, and that can ruin a perfect game in a moment's notice. This is explained in greater detail in this excellent review by Kitsona.\n\nClosing wordsSomething to bear in mind, though: THIS IS NOT A STRATEGY GAME. People who do not recommend this game keep telling others to buy a "better strategy game," though they completely miss the point that this is not supposed to be a strategy game. It is a board game mixed in with card game in its conception. It is unique in that way, as it fills a niche that is unexplored and often ignored. The care to detail is great, and the visual presentation is astounding, considering this is an indie title. Visually, it is something to behold.\n\nI'd say to support this game just so we can see what the developers can come up with next. They are on the ball. I believe they have a great contribution to give to the gaming community, and I hope they have the chance to prove it.\n\nAs always, the final choice is up to you.\nGo there, save the day!","January 22, 2015","true","430.0"," 47 of 74 people (64%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","64","47","74","28","0"

It brings to the table a sense of RPG, TCG and PVP like no other "board game" videogame I have ever played.\n\nThe Multiplayer is pretty cool.  I can see why the developers wouldnt want a chat in the active multiplayer game, because it would lead to all sorts of things that derail you from enjoying the game, BUT I would add a chat in the Lobby, because waiting for players to appear, well its tedious.\n\nAs far as the characters you can play go, I have been playing with Zosha, which is a complete steal and I think it's the most OP character in the game due to it's night time advantages.\n\nStill no character is better or worst than any other, so they are pretty balanced.  You just need to be good at strategizing your moves, and have a little bit of luck :) But it is doable to win out of an irrecoverable position in the game.\n\nFor example, during my last multiplayer game for example, I wasted too much time reading the amulets and I didnt get to pick one, which is a bit of a disadvantage.  Then I got hit by Rot, which kills your health on a turn by turn basis, I spent most of the game without any prestige... I honestly thought I was going to lose.  But as luck turns out by following the quest line, I was able to get rid of the pesky Rot, gain enough fight to have 10 dices of it, and eventually made my way to the castle where I brought the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ king well deserved tears.\n\nI really have to tell the devs that this game has truly gone beyond my expectations.  Boardgames brought to video games usually turn one dimensional (take for example Smallworld2, which had an excellent opportunity to be a great game and it ended up sucking...) but in Armello, the board is simply gorgeous, I love the minituarized effect when you get really close with your mouse wheel, the animations are pretty solid, the gameplay is fluid and never boring.  The game has an excellent balance of cards, which bring to play fight, defense, items, magic, etc.  The AI is fairly competent.\n\nWhat I can expect from this game in the future, perhaps is different settings for the boards, and more characters, although the current 8 that come with the game are pretty cool so far.\n\nBravo for the devs.  This is the type of game I wish I had been able to kickstart because you guys did an amazing job.\n\nSo if you havent bought it yet, then you should go right now and buy this game.  $20 is cheaper than hookers and blow or a date... which are overrated anyways.  What are you waiting for... go buy it... now dammit.","September 2, 2015","true","22.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Really, it seems that YOU are the one who determines the alignment of four characters, a Thane (wolf), Sana (bear), Amber (rabbit), and Mercurio (rat). Each character is trying to become the next lord of Armello, and it can be done with intrigue, murder, or muscle.\n\nThe game is a card/board/dice game so each play is different. Cards can be used to make your ascension easier, or more difficult on your rivals. And all the while Banes, something like a corruption elemental, are spawning and wreaking havoc on the land while dungeons are ripe for exploration. Declarations can be used to make thing easier on you, harder on others, or just a touch of randomness when nothing else is beneficial.\n\nThis is one of the most unique games I have played and I enjoyed it, it's easy ot learn and isn't a game that is all to lengthy in play.

It's a true marvel among games of it's type. Not only is it fun, but it's challenging too. Plus it takes a bit to master, but I assure you all of that goes out the window once you gather three of your friends to play the game. The art is rich with detail and warmth. So much charcter place in the little sprits. The abilities and cards are well thought out and give the game new dimensions. My only Con and it's such a small one is that they should add a chat box players can type what they want to the other players, even add a whisper function to allow strategic attack and defense. In the mean time, just load up Skype and talk to your friends through that while enjoying the game.

As a huge fan of real-life boardgames, there is often a bit lost in transition between the tabletop and the digital realm. Rarely has a game of Settlers of Catan or Magic the Gathering felt nearly as compelling online as it has in person.\n\nHowever, Armello seems to meld just perfectly the best aspects of both real-world boardgaming and videogaming. The card art is gorgeous (and wonderfully animated), as is the world and the lore that is set up. Each character is unique, while still remaining viable and seemingly balanced. With four different possible paths to victory, players must adapt quickly and cobble together a winning strategy from whatever comes their way.\n\nIt must be said that no game has ever had the level of collaboration between developer and player that Armello has. As a successful Kickstarter, the game has grown past anyone's expectations thanks to the free exchange of ideas from the community. I can only hope that Armello, and the League of Geeks team, serve as models for what future videogames can accomplish!","May 13, 2015","true","163.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Buy it!\n\n\nThe Proper version:\n\nArmello is a strategy game that blends both strategic, tactical and luck based mechanics into a very well-polished package. Your typical game lasts about an hour (Longer for Multiplayer) and has you in a race for the crown. During each game you compete with both your opponents and AI controlled entites like Banes and Castle Guards to progress to one of four victory types.\n\nThe variety of characters (8 in total as of launch) ...each with their own unique starting stats and special abilities and the variety of victory types (4 in total) means that every game plays out differently, especially since the map is randomly generated every game. Even when playing the same character, you might find that the terrain and early game events might make one type of victory better than another.\n\nThe main victory in the game is a Prestige victory. This follows your standard victory point progression like other board games. The other three victory types are ways for players who are behind to "Steal" the win from the prestige leader. This is good as even if you fall WAY behind, you are still able to claim victory, yet it isn't unfair to the prestige leader as the prestige victory is the lowest-risk victory, and players trying to 'steal' it from you must take a riskier and more difficult path. It also means that a game isn't won or lost until the final turn, so every player is still engaged even if someone takes a very early prestige lead.\n\nThe Single Player AI is competent, most of the time. However, the true challenge and fun comes from multiplayer games. With ranked multiplayer coming in 1.1, this could absolutely be a good game to play against other people. And while there is still luck involved, more skilled players can pull off wins much more readily than novice players... thus demonstrating that skill and strategy play a signifigant portion in how well you do and that luck is merely *a* factor, not *the* factor in determining how well you do.\n\nThe price point is spot on and worth every dollar. If you compare it to a physical board game of the same scope, complexity and nature, this is about 1/3 the price that a physical board game would run you, and is a lot easier to setup and play than one. Even if you aren't a big computer game fan, if you love board games like Agricola, Carcaconne, Settler's of Cattan and the like, you'll love this game.\n\nIn all, highly reccomended!","September 2, 2015","true","136.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mishan/recommended/290340/","Mishan","Misha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mishan/","895 products in account","Armello is a board game... of sorts.\nYou play as heroes of 4 animal clans who fight to save their kingdom, or to destroy it. That is entirely up to you, the player. You have a choice of 8 characters (currectly, more are being added!). Each clan is represented by 2 heroes. They have a variety or special abilities which make them unique, and you need to adapt to their playstyle to win. Some character might be too weak but strong in battle, yet other might lack in battle but win with magic and amounts of health.\nBut as I said, Armello is a board game! It is not the best, but not the worst either. It has its flaws. For example the game relies too much on RNG. Which means you might get really good drop and on the other hand you will do so miserably and ask yourself: why? The gaming board represents the kingdom or Armello, its procedurally generated, so the game will always be different, although the shape of the board stays the same. The board is filled with villages, dungeons, enemy mobs, forests and mountains, and also with traps.\nThe goal of the game is to defeat the king, who has been taken by a Rot. (Rot is a special condition in a game that drains 1 health every 2 turns) The king is slowly loosing his health. You have many options how to win. Be a fighter, a diplomat, the one who purges the darkness away from the king or a corrupted hero who decides to rule with even darker hand than the king himself.\nYou can play alone with AI controlled players, join up online with friends or online against random players to have a chance to drop some sweet loot that can be sold on Steam market (really, free, no microtransactions!), or be kept for you to admire. (Seriously, a dice that sparkles... count me in!)\n\nAlthough the game is really clinging on randomness and it sometimes feels like its more based on luck than actual skill (which might and might not be true. If you are really lucky you can win, but if you think about your moves, you can win just as much) its very fun, matches might take over 60 minutes sometimes, but with its randomly generated maps the games are never the same.","May 18","true","83.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wharlgarbl/recommended/290340/","wharlgarbl","The Great Dingus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wharlgarbl/","288 products in account","Armello is a computer boardgame set in a fantasy kingdom of Armello, a world filled with antropomorphic animals of various kinds. Rot has corrupted the good king of the land, making him erratic and mad. This of course will not do and the clans of the kingdom set out to solve the problem, some of them harboring a solution more sinister than the other. It falls to the player's clan to either cure, kill or replace the king by being the hero of the people.\n\nThe game starts by the players picking their characters from a bunch of eight different heroes belonging into four different clans as well as the starting trinkets which the player can use to get and advantage in a specific situation on board and a statboost of their favourite stat. The board is then randomly generated with the King's palace in the middle. The map is made of a bunch of different tiles such as high mountains, dangerous swamps, periless dungeons, busy villages, lush forests etc. etc. Almost every tile has a special purpose, giving the player either a defence boost, health refill, invisibility, wound or something else. For example Dungeons give various rewards from money to magical items and Villages pile the heroe's purse with shiny, clinky, coin at dawn. The tiles can be further changed by various cards and events.\n\nThe goal of the game is to either kill the mad king and take his place. Cure the king with four magical stones or wait till the king dies by succumbing to the rot (or being slain by another hero with both the king and the hero dying) and claiming the throne as a prestigeful hero of the good people of Armello. By completing quests each hero increases their attributes and prestige.\n\nThe player heroes all have a handful of cards they can play any time they want. Even when it's not the player's turn to act provided the player hero has the money or magic and the proper conditions to use the card. These item cards range from beneficial items to magic to shady deals to spring traps and other evil things upon the unlucky contestants.\n\nAttributes include Fight which determines how good your hero is in combat, Body that servers as your hero's hitpoints and health, Wits which lets you draw more cards to play later and Spirit which measures your magical prowess. Each of these stats are used in either combat, questing or when facing a peril. Naturally the higher the attribute the more chances your hero has winning the encounter.\n\nSecondary attributes are Gold which is used to play various types of cards to enhance your own hero or make the life of other heroes more difficult. Magic which is the fuel for using magic cards for the same purposes as above. Prestige which helps you winning the game and Rot which... measures how much you rely on the dark evil. Prestige and Rot both require some attention here.\n\nPrestige measures how famous your hero is. Having the highest prestige at dawn has the benefit of letting your hero give the mad lion king advice on which of the two new rules he's going to enforce for the coming day. This can be used to make the life more difficult for the other heroes but the choises aren't always beneficial for the prestige leader. When the king dies, either by succumbing to the rot or when killed by another hero unsuccesfully, the player whose hero has the highest prestige wins the game. Players can also lose prestige by killing the royal guard or by dying. Some events, such as certain quests when failed, also drain prestige. Player can increase their hero's prestige by killing opposing heroes the evil banes and by completing quests.\n\nRot is the dark influence heroes gain by dabbling into evil magic or being corrupted by rotten creatures. Having rot can make your hero stronger, but it comes at a cost. Each dawn a corrupted hero takes damage and if your hero is very badly corrupted, the normally beneficial healing shrines will kill the hero instantly. Having rot makes your hero more potent in combat, but only if you fight against other corrupted creatures. If the hero's rot value is bigger than the opponents, the player may add the opponents rot in dice to their dice pool during combat. Also each time a rot corrupted character slays somebody they refil their health by one point and is not hunted by banes. Having rot is a very aggressive strategy towards winning the game.\n\nWhen a fight breaks out the player gets to roll their Fight dice. There are several items and abilities such as shields, armor, weapons and magic which add or reduces from your or your opponents dice pool. Players try to roll as many hits as they can as well as blocks to negate enemy hits. Fights can end in a several ways but dying doesn't punish the player too much. The defeated hero will respawn in their clan's starting ground and is back in the game as soon as the player's turn is up. The player can also burn the cards in their hand to get a guaranteed result on a single die.\n\nThe game has one nasty flaw though, if you can even count it as a flaw. The game is very random. By having a poor luck with the tiles near your starting zone or a bad starting hand of cards you may find your hero's chances of winning being very low from the get go. Bad card draws and unforgiving dice can also completely ruin your game, but that's given, considering the game is closer to a board game than a what you normally have on a computer. But besides that I find the game very enjoyable. The presentation is great. The game has some really fine artistic style, fitting music and it's just a joy to play. It's a bit boring alone, but with friends the game really shines. Armello is not for everyone but I believe anybody who's into board games will probably enjoy this one immensively.","September 20, 2015","true","25.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The first aspect that I loved about this game is that is not a simple board game but it has a solid and interesting story that makes the game experience even better! Moreover, the game features beautiful graphics and a really captivating soundtrack and in game music as well. The game is also fast with a high replay value. The day and night cycle is a great addition to the game with both of these cycles affecting the game play. Everything is also so beautiful in this game from the animated cards that will be more than 100 in the game to the captivating board of the title. Furthermore, the game has a lot of heroes to choose from that each one represent a different clan. Each clan representative has different set of skills, advantages and weaknesses with more to come when the final version of the game will be out. The heroes are also highly customizable with rings and amulets with impressive attribute. The title also features a dynamic sandbox. This means that every game you play will not be the game as the previous one because the maps and the quests are randomly generated. However, there are some negative aspects that I should mention. The biggest one for me is it lacks a good tutorial; I found it hard to get used to the title but after two or three games you will be able to learn it easily.  To sum up, if you love gorgeous games and tabletop title this is the game you must pick up without second thought. Totally recommend it despite the negative aspect. It has a great feature and more content will be implemented in the near feature.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10\n\n+graphics\n+customization\n+sandbox aspect\n+day and night cycle\n+100+ animated cards\n\n-desperately needs a better tutorial\n\n","May 21, 2015","true","12.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The artists worked even more magic and completely overhauled everything to make Armello one of the most beautiful games out there from the UIm the character models to every card in the game. The programmers and other teams members have also been working hard working with the community and their suggestions to make Armello play incredibly well. If you ever need an example on how to do a good Kickstarter and a good Early Access game, Armello is it.\n\nI could not reccomend this game enough if you are a fan of the genre and if you aren't there is still lots of fun to be had with this game.

As a Kickstarter backer, my opinion is somewhat beholden to the money I've given to the project. That being said, Armello had one of the fastest Kickstarter turnaround times I've ever seen. The proof is in the pudding: Armello is one of the most beautiful games available on Steam, with a strong sense of artistic self. Its parts create an ideal whole.\n\nWith over 100 cards and a total of 12 playable heroes (4 during the Beta, at least 4 more at launch Sept. 1st 2015, plus 4 additional ones for backers and eventually, late adopters) there is enough variety to keep you coming back for more, to see how each game plays out. Randomized gameboards and multiplayer support only further this. The additions of quests and storyline are icing on the cake, and I expect the full release to be even richer in terms of how the story is told. I've taken to playing the game just to unwind; the mix of beautiful art and serene, appropriate music is enough to please the senses for every moment you play.\n\nIn short, you owe it to yourself to experience the world of Armello, which in itself is so compelling that even without the exemplary game system it would serve as the basis for a series of best-selling fiction.","August 27, 2015","true","39.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

An RPG with board game and strategy game influence, a very unique combo! Great purchase." - Original Traders Group.\n\n"Because it was made in Australia" - Australian Made games.\n\nNow for my review bare in mind i haven't play thing game much. *don't know why really*\n\nArmello is hard to put in a group. It's a turn based RPG with boardgame elements while having a dash of card games in it's DNA. Some including myself have labled this game as Redwall (a fantasy novel series with animals as the characters) crossed with Game of Throne. Now this may not be fully accurate but that's the vide we get.\n\nGameplay is simple. You have Action Points (AP) which is used as you move on a hex tile base. Combat is Diffrent, you can "burn" cards in your hand to get extra icons that either help or hinder you in the fight. Now for the cards. How many cards you get in a hand is based on your will. Cards are split in three groups. Items magic and a thrid one that's more will based. They either help you or hinder the enemy.\n\nThe objective of a match is to usurp the throne. The king has taken ill and his illness is effecting his mind making bad descions. the Clans, Rabbit, Wolf, Bear and Rat(?)  belive that now is the time to take the throne. The king himself is had to beat early on but as his sickness goes on it weakens his health. His castel also has several trap/challanges you'll have to overcome in order to face him.\n\nOverall i'd give this game a 8/10 with my recommendation.","August 11, 2015","true","7.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

On several occasions, I played game nearly to their completion, only to have a player, whether intentional or not, disconnect, completely ruining the match and wasting whatever time you devoted.  Something as simple as a screen for the remaining players to decide whether to wait or continue with an AI would have sufficed, but as it is, there's nothing more furstrating than to figuratively have a player throw the game and table.\n\nSecond, between their Kickstarter page and their Wiki, there are currently 4 playable characters with 8 additional characters being released as DLC--four of which are slated to be paid DLC, and other four only available if you donated at least $45/$55 to their Kickstarter.  While I can appreciate something being special or exclusive, for what is supposed to be a casual stategy game, I can't help but feel a bit sleighted of being denied content simply because I happen to be late to the party or don't have a fat wallet.  Maybe if it was one or two characters, or even vanity items, but to devote a whole faction--literally a third of the currently planned playable characters, with a time and money requirement, I can't help but feel this game is pay-to-win even before leaving the gates.","January 27, 2015","true","113.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

This was not a board game adapted into a video game or vice versa, this game truly is a standalone experience on the computer. You could not have the high quality cards, dice rolling, or opening cutscene in a cardboard version of this game (though honestly, I wouldn't mind owning one).\n\nI'll be honest, I saw the gameplay and I was like, "I guess it looks like a game I would try out" but then I saw the two videos produced for Armello and my mind was blown. I appreciate the deep lore and story that they put into a turn based board game. I am in love, please produce a movie!\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I find it to be a very well balanced board game that is very down to the wire! I appreciate when a game gives you interesting decisions and Armello does just that. There are 4 different victory types but only 1 winner, breaking the possibility for a runnaway leader. One improvement which many board games have incorporated is alternate turn order to prevent unbalance based on when you go in a given round.\n\nThe game looks good, plays good, and has my heart.

There's a nice element of randomness that keeps it fair for people of all skill levels and makes it fun to come back and hope to see new things.\n\nSo yes, I'd recommend it. That said, I have to complain about the fact that this is a "board game" where people can't have local co-op or hot-seat multiplayer; everyone has to have a separate computer and copy of the game to play, which is tough to organize and pay for. I would, for instance, really like to play this with my brother's family (my nephew would love Barnaby), but sixty more dollars for three more copies is prohibitive. I was also looking forward to playing this with college friends and their children, and can't, which saddens me. For a "board game" this makes very little sense to me.\n\nOn a related note, please note that chat in multiplayer in this game is limited to a set of canned responses. I understand why this would be done (moderating chat is tricky) but it makes it near impossible to discuss strategy with other players, which can be unsatisfying when another player takes your "Greetings" as a threat rather than the intended friendly gesture and decides to hit you with an Immolation.\n\nDespite these absent features, it's still worth checking out, and I don't regret buying it, but those features would make it absolutely perfect.","September 24, 2015","true","15.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Shall I compare thee to a summer's night of Munchkin?  No?  Risk, maybe?  Dungeons and Dragons?  Alright, perhaps that's pushing it too far.  It is an excellent party game for up to four friends online and with a somber atmosphere and interesting level of lore and immersion.  Even if you're on the losing side, every game feels fun and compelling--the tables are always ready to turn and even in the face of utter hopelessness, you can always take on the role of a vicious saboteur.  Some will say it is too dependent on chance, but I would argue otherwise.  It is a game about choosing a path and then leveraging your odds.  Every move matters and it's possible to turn even a game fraught with terrible luck into a last-minute victory.  Game length varies a bit; single player games last me around an hour, but it's about twice that with friends.\n\nThe King is corrupt and marching toward his death.  Take on the role of one of several heroes representing the clans of the kingdom, each with their own unique traits, tricks, and motivations for claiming his throne.  Will you play the pacifist and build rapport within the kingdom, elected to power when he inevitably succumbs to his sickness?  You could fight your way through the competition with guile and brawn to slay the monarch yourself, taking the castle by force, or perhaps the Rot has found a more powerful host in you and he is but your final meal before your dark ascension.  With so many paths to victory and the freedom to devise your own strategy, you're guaranteed to find plenty to explore within the world of Armello--especially when you adventure with friends.","April 16","true","59.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Do I think its mechanics work well?\nYes.\nI've played all 4 of the prologue (tutorial) chapters, and also played 4 regular games. I enjoyed playing, and each game was a bit different since the map is semi randomized, each character has different strengths, there's various quests to choose from when you start or complete a quest, and there's several different win conditions.\n\nThe art in the game for the cards is very cool. Each of the cards has some little bit of animation like blinking/shifting eyes, or a forest whooshing by as a person runs through it, or a bit smoke moving. The art style of this game is wonderfull, but you can see that in the screenshots.\n\nThe rules/mechanics:\nIt has its own 6 sided die with symbols instead of numbers.\nIt has 8 different characters, each with a unique special passive ability and slightly different stats. This means each character will play a bit different as one might be better at battle, but another might be able to cast more spellcards or more expensive spells.\n\nEach character has 4 main stats:\nFight- Determines # of die you roll during battle.\nBody- Essentially is your max HP\nWits- Determines # of die you roll during Perils, a negative event card played on a space you entered. It also determines your maximum card hand size. You draw to this amount each turn.\nSpirit- Essentially your max MP, you restore to this number each night\nAll 4 of these are also used in quest challenges where 1 stat point x10 = % chance to succeed.\n\nYou also gain/lose Gold used in equipping Item cards / hiring (equipping) follower cards or playing Trickery cards\nThere's Prestige that you gain/lose through certain actions like completing a quest, and some few Trickery cards will cost Prestige instead of Gold. There's a thing that is basically your current MP for the day. Finally there's Rot. If you are infected by this, you lose 1 HP per day and there's other mechanics surrounding this. The king is infected by this setting the turn limit for the game.\n\nThere's a card system as mentioned as well. There's Items (including equip-ables, one use, and followers), Spells which can be buffs / debuffs/ or even direct damage to other characters, and Trickery (You triggered my trap card, Yugi! Sorry I'm unoriginal). Trickery cards most of the time are played as traps that can be set on certain tiles and when anyone enters that marked space they must pass a challenge by rolling the # of die equal to their Wits.\n\nThere's a bit more to the game but that's basically it.\nThe king is dying and mad (crazy/evil) due to Rot infection.

It made tabletop strategy seem accessible and fun for me.\n\nThe tutorial does its job well. The way it presents the various gameplay concepts, staggered through different characters to show different approaches to the game, really helped make the ideas stick. While Armello has some fairly complex aspects to it, I was never left feeling intimidated as I often am by other games in this genre.\n\nThe art style is gorgeous and I feel this is one of the most beautiful games I've played in a long time. Despite basically being pawns on a board, each hero has its own distinct personality, which I personally find necessary for a game to be engaging and to have any longevity.\n\nThough I'm only a few games in and can't comment on it at length, I do like the inclusion of a progression system. Being able to unlock items for my characters that allow me to alter their play style gives me more incentive to keep coming back.\n\nThe pace of the game can be a bit slow at times, since you not only have to wait for other players' turns but also the king's guards as well as any banes that have emerged on the map, but I feel that's really a minor issue.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with Armello so far and look forward to trying out the upcoming multiplayer ladder.","September 3, 2015","true","9.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

From the character traits to the perils you locate as you wander the 'board' you can feel the designers admiration and devotion to the tabletop genre.\n\nThe art is beautiful. The trees manage to bring forth the feeling of dark and deep adventure, the dungeons do the same. Honestly the amount of atmosphere created from such little space is truly extravagant.  The attention to the detail is something you'll be noticing with each game you play.\n\nThe only major drawback is that is falls short of enjoyment when wanting to play with strangers via the public games. There are very few people queued up to play and when you do play there is no way to communicate to each other. This means that the hilarity and competitive fun that you get when playing with friends is lost.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that blends the polish of many modern day games and the mechanics of old style tabletop boardgames where the dice play a huge part but your strategy and wits is what truly separates you from your competitors then I'd recommend Armello 9 times out of 10.\n\nI would suggest inviting a few friends along for the fun though!","August 3, 2015","true","8.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slamel/recommended/290340/","Slamel","Slamel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slamel/","379 products in account","I first noticed this game when it was up for a possible free PS+ game a number of months ago.  I voted for it without hesitation and have been telling myself to buck up and buy it ever since it didn't get the votes needed.    After purchasing the game and spending a few hours in it, I realized that I probably didn't know what everyone else knew when they didn't vote for it.\n\nI want to talk about the positives first.\n\nPROS:\n-Great graphical style.  This game really is beautiful in an indie game sort of way.\n-Brilliant setting.  I was immediately immersed in the setting and the world.  A pretty substantial feat for such a small game, with such little information.  I found myself wanting more and more setting and story information.\n-A unique take on the classic "Talisman" boardgame.\n-Variety of intriguing characters to play.\n-Variety of unlocks and gear to modify your characters\n\nYou'll notice that nowhere in the "PROS" section was there anything to do with actual gameplay.  Gameplay is atrocious.  The sheer amount of lack of control you have is absurd.  You will spend the majority of the game just watching random terrible things happen to your character, that you have no control over, which can very easily chain react and spiral out of control.  The game also punishes you at every opportunity.  You get to draw cards at the beginning of your turns, up to a hand limit, but most of the time those cards are useless for both their icons and abilities.  You are also not able to simply discard cards.  You have to either use them or burn them (trading a die roll for a guaranteed result depicted on the card).  Which means that you will end up losing multiple "Perils" or events just to get rid of cards that you don't want, hoping to draw new good cards, and then invariably drawing more bad cards.  That is just one aspect of the game.  Let's look a possible sequence of events.  And when I say "possible" I mean common.\n\n-King presents two laws for the current leader to choose from (random)\n-Draw cards at the beginning of your turn from three different piles, of which none are useful to equip or burn (random)\n-Encounter a Peril in which you roll dice to succeed at (random)\n-Fail the Peril because it is a Wits challenge and you are a Fight character and don't roll well enough (random)\n-Get warped to the farthest Dungeon away from that Peril\n-Encounter the Peril on the Dungeon, in which you roll dice again (random)\n-Fail the peril and suffer the consequences\n-Encounter the Dungeon (which is essentially a die roll where you can get gold, treasure, a spirit stone, magic points, a parasite (that takes control of your character and moves it), or a "Bane" which is a Rot-stricken enemy.  End up with a Bane, from the die roll (random)\n-Get moved off the dungeon (possibly even further from where you were trying to go), because you encountered a Bane.\n-Bane attacks you and initiates Combat which is a bunch of dice rolls (random)\n-Lose the combat to be killed and warped back to your starting location.\n\nSeven of those steps heavily involve random draws or dice rolls, and that doesn't even include the random Quest attempts, and those steps that did not involve a random element were simply suffering the consequences of the previous random step.\n\nThere are those who will defend this game saying that it is a board game and you can't do a board game without excessive random elements.  That's wholly and completely incorrect.  I am a boardgamer more than a videogamer with an absurd collection.  There are plenty of boardgames that reduce the amount of luck you have to endure in order to increase the amount of strategy you can use.\n\nInstead of dropping money on Armello, go take a handful of dice and throw them around your kitchen table for a while.  You will likely have more fun, have less wasted time and money, and can move onto something better.","May 13","false","3.3"," 56 of 100 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","56","100","8","22"

I have, on record, 200+ hours meaning I am experienced in Armello (and I have won a fair amount of games.)  I have seen the changes made to Armello as it progressed from beta to early access to full release and now patches.  I had high hopes for Armello in the kickstarter, and I really wanted to enjoy it; but I feel Armello suffers from having too much RNG.   RNG is fine in video games, infact it's what makes a game.  The complaint is the AMOUNT of RNG this game has:  dice, cards, coin flips, percent chances.  It takes out the skill of anything that could be done.  There are some other key elements that also make it an even more unpleasurable experience:\n\n•RNG\n-Dice Rolls:  The dice roll chances come out to | 3/6 attack | 1/6 shield | 2/6 miss |  not exactly balanced\n-Card Draws:  Adds to the RNG aspect with obtaining random spells/equipment\n-Movement:  Dungeons can spawn banes (obstructing your path) or teleport (sets you back further but can help in very few situations)\n-Quest Rewards:  Three sets of quest with rewards (spirit stone, random follower, or random treasure,) even a chance to fail the quest depending on your stats\n•Community\n-Griefing:  Partied up players like to gang up and bully the fourth player (LoG has took initiative to ban these players from what I've heard)\n-Quiters:  Some players quit games due to their favorite characters being picked or leave because of unfortunate events in the game\n-Aggression:  Uncalled-for aggression from other players, even unprovoked (On other negative reviews there seems to be die-hard fanboys defending the game blindly and aggressively)\n-Unfriendly:  Some spiteful players tend to emote laughs and other emotes after being extremely hostile in-game\n•Gameplay\n-Battle:  Fights tend to end in a stalemate with both players dying due to 3/6 chance of rolling attack (unless luck is involved)\n-PvP:  No allegences between players except between friends, everyone stabs you in the back eventually\n-Strategy:  There's almost no strategy, everything's situational; and the game's too random for there to be any kind of set strategy (the only strategy is knowledge of cards and what the opponent could have/do)\n-Crashes:  There are constant freezes and NMAs which seems to happen more frequently as the game updates\n•Design\n+Art:  I do love the designs of this game, but really that's the only positive thing I have to say about Armello\n○Sound:  Nothing too impressive, but it's not necessarily bad\n\nEven in private full lobby friend match there's no enjoyment to be had.  Everything feels like a matter of chance with no skill required.  There's no rewarding feeling you get when you win a match, because it's all luck-based.  After doing a good amount of private matches, we agreed to either playing a different game or just stopping all together.\nArmello has plenty of potential to be a fun game, but with the randomness of everything it just kills any enjoyment.  Winning sessions comes down to luck (almost every game ends with being really lucky, or really unlucky.)  Armello could be more of a strategic game if the random elements were toned down.  For now, this will be a negative review, unless several mechanics of the game are revised.","May 18","false","237.3"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","4"

I still find the game to be underwhelming and the enjoyment of it disproportionate to the love I see it getting. However, the community on the whole here has been EXCELLENT. I mean I have been pretty adamant (though respectful) in stating my opinions and I have to say with one or two excepetions the reaction has been civil. That does not happen on the internet. Except for here apparently. So if you are okay with taking the community health into consideration I am actually gonna go ahead and say I would Recommend this and move up my rating to a...\n\n5.1/10\n\nI also have to take into consideration that my expectations for the tile may have been too high. More frustarting is that many other people that like simliar games seem to be completely satisfied with the experience and delivery. Its pretty unusual that I wind up an outlier in satisfaction when I am (or felt like I was) a part of the core demographic. Armello seems to be enjoyed by people like me. I barely enjoyed it for 5-6 hours before I found myself searching for reason to like it but I just can't quite figure it out. Anyway if your on the fence I say give it a shot.\n\n\n\n11/9 Was pleased to see that with the new update the speed of the AI controlled players was adjustable. I would have to say that experience for singlplayer has been streamlined and improved dramatically. Sadly, I still did not enjoy the game. I only realized this after playing for another few games and realized I was searching for reasons to switch this game to a recommend.\n\nIn response to Kletian's comments to my review:\n\nI agree that picking your deck can influence the outcome however there are just too many random variables that are outside of your control. Is this game strategically superior to chutes and ladders? Absolutely. Risk? Not even close. Monopoly? Probably the best comparison. The random or uncontrolled variables in this game include:\n\n3 other players turns\n1 King turn (King's Guards)\nBanes Turn\nPlacement of Quest Markes\nCard Draw (Mitigated by choice of card type but still random)\nDice Rolls\nBoard Configuration\n\nThat's alot of randomness to contend with. I am in no way opposed to RNG or believe that it should be a left out of any serious strategy game. However the way this game is structured leaves little room for interesting choices as the game evolves. The randomn elements seem to dictate the way you should be steering your strategy and trying to go in another direction is almost always going to put you in the losers bracket. Armello offers you choices in your strategy but the design of the game itself hamstrings you into playing one way or the other and its just a tough pill for me to swallow.\n\nThe game is still gorgeous and I agree with Kletian's comments that game is more similiar to Rouge-likes in progression type. However, I would argue that old-school rouge-likes rewarded you for measuring chances and taking risks which is something I found lacking in my time with Armello. The end result was that were often (not always) rewarded for taking those risks to gain advantages and overcome challenges. In Armello you are rewarded for understanding which path to victory is most likely to be successful and than gearing your startegy towards acheiving that goal. Abberations to this formula do exists but they seem far to infrequent and unintentional to be considered a part of the strategy.\n\nFor a game that involves startegy and measuring risk I would recommend Chaos Reborn.\n\nI would take a pass on Armello unless you really love the art and animation (both are excellent).\n\n5/10\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW:\n\nI have very mixed feelings for this game. I'll keep this review short and update it as I play for longer.\n\nCurrent Playtime: 6-8 hours (5 games total on a friends account during early access)\n\nPros\n- Original and creative concept for a game\n- Ran Smooth on low spec computer with med graphics setting\n- No bugs encountered\n- Beautifully Crafted World (card art and animation are my personal highlights)\n- Limited Game Modes at Launch (ranked coming soon per forum post)\n\nAC/DC\n-RNG Heavy from a double down effect of having card draws and dice rolls as random factors\n-Universal Card Selection (no deckbuilding element if you are expecting a more typical CCG experience)\n\nCons\n-Repetition of Game Board Means it all looks the same after awhile\n-Some progression exists but a overall a little light on the RPG element promised\n-Balance - Several ways to win a game but two of these are extremely difficult to achieve\n-Long playtime for each game especially Multiplayer\n-RNG + Balancing Issues + Long Playtimes = Frustrating Experience\n\nEven shorter review:\n\n3-5 hours: Sweet! An Online Digital Board Game with RPG progression.\n5-8 hours: Slooow Moving Game (3 turns other than yours to contend with) and disappointed to find that a strategic approach is smaller element is secondary to dice rolls/card draws.\n\nI will keep playing as I still love the premise and several of the issues I have with this title have been acknowledged and are being worked on by the developers. Priced out at $20 US dollars in its current state I am going to have to give it a thumbs down for the time being.","September 2, 2015","false","12.6"," 34 of 59 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","34","59","0","5"

But the developers went a step further here, and took advantage of the game engine to mediate things in ways no tabletop experience could replicate as smoothly. This not only takes all the boring round by round management, tracking, upkeep, and calculating out the experience, but allows for hidden movement, trap placement, and other subtle elements that would not be possible at a table.\n\nBecause of this, the developers made a REALLY smart move by allowing Armello to be played at a table with a single device, because at its heart, Armello is still a board game, and being able to play it face to face will enhance the experience tenfold.

Aussie devs League of Geeks have done a exemplarary job - even the earliest build was a great deal better than most finished games, and they have continued to polish and refine the game, and built a thriving community of Armello enthusiasts that they have really listened to - this is kickstarter done RIGHT.\n\nThe final release reflects that polish, with love and attention to detail oozing from every pixel. It's unique mix of turn based strategy with RPG and card game elements is backed up by lush, Studio Ghibli inspired visuals, gorgeous music and inspired (and in multiplayer excceptionally devious) gameplay. There's a engaging story - a mad king, a kingdom under threat from the Rot, and now eight playable heroes attempting to either hold the kingdom together, take it over or destroy it. Each hero is unique, can equip different gear, and hold traps, hard won followers or spells for battle against the opposing players - some cards can not just snatch victory from defeat but change the nature of the game or the victory conditions if played well. Combat is via nicely animated dice rolls (themselves modifyable by the cards in hand) and often deadly - it's not uncommon for two heroes to kill each other in the same bout, there's the creeping horror of the Rot to fight (or allow it to possess you) and then there's the mad King with his strange edicts affecting all players who eventually will destroy the Kingdom if players allow it. Multiple victory conditions abound here, and the wily player may need to change their overall tactics multtiple times in a single play through.\n\nThe single player game against AI oponents in engaging enough, but it's in multiplayer that Armello truly shines. there are some utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moves available to the canny player, and interplayer communication, while cleverly limited, is more than enough to form (and break at a opportune moment) alliances. New players are well catered for, with excellent tutorials, and Armello is one of those rare games that's relatively easy to pick up but difficult to master. Cross platform support (it's available on PC and PS4 at launch, with ios and android coming) means you'll never lack for oponents.\n\nWith it's sheer beauty, devious tactics and engaging gameplay Armello offers something different, and the incredible beauty of the game is made more astonishing by the fact it was created by such a small team - only 5 people who literally risked everything to bring the game to life. League of Geeks have to date offered unparalleled support, and knowing their devious minds I imagine ther'll be more than just tweaks and bug support in the future - the premise certainly lends itself to further expansion in the form of new heroes, extra cards snd perhaps bigger DLC.\n\nIf you're a fan of board games, story driven RPG or strategy it's a must purchase - even for those who are more into other genres should definitely give this a go. I really can't recommend this superb game highly enough.\n","September 2, 2015","true","17.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The world is beautfiul and aethestically pleasing, the characters diverse and full of life in their designs and battle animations, unique movements for each one I must say. And for those who enjoy lore, one can find it in the form of cards, quests, or a certain follower known only as the Stranger. He adds an interesting depth to the game, but I'll won't elaborate on him. Armello is a simple enough game to understand, but it's very difficult to truly master.\n\nArmello is a digital board game with hexagonal tiles that can favor those who have put a considerable amount of time into it, but it doesn't mean that said players, myself included, will win. I have been a part of many a game where someone with far less time won or ruined me, even though I was employing my knowledge of the game to try and win to the fullest. How did this happen you might ask? The answer is simple and is partly why I enjoy Armello so much. RNG. It will make or break your game depending on your dice rolls or on the cards you draw. Sometimes you get fantastic rolls or draws, others are terrible, and often they're a mix.\n\nThe beauty of this is that it makes players think strategically about their moves on the campaign map, and how they can utilize their hero skills and the cards they've been dealt to the best that they can in order to win. Furthermore, when one is in battle or facing a peril, then they can burn a card provided it has a matching symbol, though the question is should one save a certain card for later or not. In terms of combat, it makes the player think about the risk versus the reward for killing a player or a bane; in that said hero could die, come out victorious and gain a prestige, or both combatants could die depending on the die rolls. What this means is that you can seek out combat or avoid it to the best of your abilities, and know that there are cards in the game that can increase your chance at a succesful combat by taking away health or delay an enemy player if they're pursuit. Provided RNG gives you said cards.\n\nNow, there are some factors that people claim are major issues with the game; one is the combat system attack die rolls, another is the comeback system after you die, and then there are those who claim some heros are more powerful than others.\n\nIn all my hours of Armello, I have seen many a die roll that either brought me victory or ended those hopes. Now, it is true that there are four sides of the die that favor attack, three in reality due to two of these sides being dependent on the time of day. And, yes, there is only one shield side, but that shouldn't get your hopes down. Rather, it causes you to think and plan how you'll play a round. Now, you can have a massive hand of say 13 dice and you only get three defence from them, or you can get 10 defense sides from them. It's all dependent on RNG. I've seen many a battle that netted a massive amout of attack, or defence, or even rot (Much to the benefit or detriment of the player depending upon their current status) and I can say that although attack is favored by the die, that doesn't mean you'll get attack die.\n\nAs I said, it's all dependent on RNG. Furthermore, if one is worried about defense, then there are plenty of defence item cards that grant automatic defense die without subtracting from your hand that can be aquired, provided you have the gold. Furthermore, you can burn cards with a defence symbol on them to boast your defense, though you must think tactically on the possible results and if they'll be better or worse.\n\nNow, there are those who complain that the comeback system is detrimental to players, but I say it causes one to rethink their strategies and pursue either the same old goal, or develop a new one to win. If you can't get to a quest because other players keep killing you, then change your tactics and focus on something else, say a dungeon or spirit stones. One does not need the quests to win a round in Armello, they simply provide benefits that increase your chance to win or even fail. I have lost plenty of games to people who never completed their quests but focused on other aspects of the game that caused them to win, be it rot, prestige, spirit stone, or combat victories. What's more, one can use this system to land them closer to their quest, if it's by their clan grounds, and that causes other players to think about the benefits or negative of killing a character in that sure you'll get prestige if you succeed, but what if it turns put you simply put them next to their quest which resulted in them winner. Choices, choices, choices.\n\nSome people say that some of the heros in Armello are overpowered, and that is only true if you let them be overpowered. Otherwise they're in a similar boat you, the player. If you know how a certain hero works, then you can utlize the cards in your hand to either deny of benefit said hero if they are an opposing player. What's more, there is a certain cost in regards to supposed overpowered hero abilites in that there are certain restrictions on them that can easily break someone's attempt to win.\n\nLet's take Barnaby for example, his power allows him to add or remove item cards and not dispose of them as what happens to other heros. Problem is, the amount of cards Barnaby can hold is entirely dependent on his wit level, and the only way he can dispose of said cards, outside of two very early decrees, is either burning in a peril, or in battle. And that's not even counting if RNG grants him decent or good cards.\n\nMulitplayer wise, Armello can either be quiet or bositerous depending upon the time of day and on how many people are playing. Granted, this is a bit of annoying area if you don't have friends or have not yet discovered the Unofficial Offical Armello community where one can often find a game instead of waiting a time for a random match. I will state that the vast majority of people who play in the random mulitplayer matches stay through to the end of a game, I rarely see someone quite because they couldn't do what they wanted, and most people who do leave simply DCed is all. Multiplayer Armello is utter joy with friends in that you can test your friendships, watch salt meters build, or determine which player RNG does not favor that round. One of my friends is noted for chasing the rest of us down if we are too annoying to him even if it means he's risking his attempt to win.\n\nOne more little morsel of information for you to sample. The community of Armello is wonderful from what I have found and there is a place where you can meet fellow Aremllians for a possible game. What's more, you can have a chance to face the devs themselves in a game of Armello pretty much every Sunday at 6 PST/PDT depending upon the year. Perhaps we'll see some of you there, and if so, then good luck.\n\nIf you've read down this far, then have some Bubble Tea or Hot Rot Wine on the house and know that I wish you a good time. In the end, only you can decide if Armello is right for you by playing it, trusting the word of others only gets you so far and is open to possibly damaging interpretations of a game.","April 22","true","258.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

There is the enchantingly crafted art style, the beautiful music, the fun varied strategies of differing hero's and victory types, it seems to really have it all. The only fault I find is that it is such a complete package and yet you are left simultaneously satisfied with the experience, and wanting more.\nNuts and bolts review:\nArmello is a digital board game,  unlike most of its kind it seems distinctly aware that it is in fact digital and takes such advantage of its medium from the animated battles to the day/night cycle of turns, they really knew what they were doing with the tools afforded them. That said the game is not without fault mainly your problems will arise from sometimes excruciatingly long queue times to the fact that if a player disconnects for any reason there is no way to rejoin the game you were in. These slights are unfortunate and like many board games matches run for around an hour so you have to allot time to play a match and really hope you don't have any issues towards the end of a particular session or else you can lose all that time you spent. There is also an element of luck involved with winning in any particular match and some of the victory types are easier to achieve than others, however the variety they afford the games strategy overshadows the seeming unbalance of their ease.\nPros:\n- music, art, and subjectively gameplay  are extraordinary\n- masterful execution of a digital board game taking advantage with animations and even important functions like the day night cycle that just couldn't be replicated on a traditional tabletop.\n- wonderful game to play with friends.\nCons:\n- connection issues while not extremely common can really be a big bummer.\n- there is a fair amount of luck involved in actually winning the game.\n- speaking of winning some victories are far easier to achieve than others.\n- queue times can be abysmal at times added to the fact that matches run long and it could take one and a half to two hours to get from queue to finishing a match.\n\nps. I don't normally write reviews more than a couple sentences long so I am aware this is a little disjointed and not the best but this game really deserves a longer explanation in my opinion let that serve as a recommendation in and of itself.","April 26","true","98.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Gameplay has an overwhelming reliance on RNG, resulting in skill and tactics offering no significant impact on the game's outcome and making the gameplay generally frustrating.  Armello is additionally hampered by numerous graphical and UI bugs, a finicky matchmaking system, and one of the worst online multiplayer netcodes I've ever seen.  Well over half of the multiplayer matches I've attempted have never been finished or even started due to one of the issues listed above.\n\nAvoid if you have any love for strategy board games and videogames, Armello is nothing of the sort.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI originally wrote a review for the game last year, shortly after the game's release, with around four or five hours of gameplay on my belt.  Although the game had beautiful visuals and a stellar artistic design, I was more than a little bit disappointed in the actual gameplay;  over-reliance on RNG for most of the game's challenges left little control to the player and made most actions unnecessarily frustrating.  I could look past the frequent crashing, bugs, and the sheer difficulty of finding a full game, but the gameplay was a real dealbreaker.\n\nAs of May 2016, the game's currently on version 1.3, and I have spent roughly 100 hours in-game.  There have been a number of changes made to the game's balance, additional content added, and some new mechanics implemented.  However, the real fundamental issues with the game were not fixed...  If anything, they've been increased with each update.  In it's current state the gameplay is so unbelievably FRUSTRATING that it overpowers whatever good the art, sound, and design give, and the developers really don't give any indication that it's ever going to change.  The real kicker here, though, is that most of the time you aren't even going to experience ANY of this.  The game's multiplayer functionality is completely broken and sporiatically functional, frequently crashing, freezing, or ending multiplayer matchmaking at a moment's notice.  The issues plaguing multiplayer matchmaking have been around since launch, but despite reassurances by the devs that they're working on fixes very little has actually been addressed.\n\nLet me explain my gripes with the gameplay in more detail.  Although the store page proudly claims that Armello has 'deep, tactical card play, rich tabletop strategy, and rpg element', spend a few hours in game and you'll quickly find that this is false advertising;  The gameplay is almost entirely dictated by randomness (in the form of card draw, success chance, or dice rolling), leaving virtually no room for any actual strategic planning.  When just going for a ride and messing around, the game's fine fun.  But, the moment you TRY to do something, be it as simple as moving to a specific tile or killing a near-dead creature, you'll more often than not be met with stupid amounts of frustration.\n\nWanted to move a couple of tiles to reach a quest?  Oh, sorry, you spawned an enemy bane that knocks you back, wasting a precious action and forcing you into a combat.  Have six dice for a peril challenge and need to meet only one symbol to beat it?  Sorry, you never rolled what you needed and you succumb to the trap.  Need some defensive equipment to ward off hyperaggressive players?  Wouldn't it be fun if all you drew for three turns straight were scouting, rot-related, or sword cards?    Forced into combat with an enemy, and have to push it out of the way to progress?  Hah, wouldn't it be a shame if you dont roll a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shield[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com], resulting in your spontaneous death and sending you back to start?\n\nThis level of crap doesnt happen to you EVERY game, but its not a rare occurance by a longshot, and in each game hands down at least one or two players are going to get the short end of the stick while the others move unhindered.  A little RNG is good for games, as it keeps them fresh, but EVERY ACTION you can do in this game is a gamble with very little reward and a whole lot of risk.  And, unlike other games heavily reliant on RNG, there's NO limitations imposed on it.  You're equally likely to get ♥♥♥♥ed over when you're down as you are when you've spent the game trying your best to stay in the top.  When the latter happens, it's pretty annoying, but when the former happens you flat out want to uninstall the game.\n\nEven when I win, it never feels earned, and from personal experience none of the players ever leave these games feeling particularly happy or satisfied.  I WANT to like Armello.  I keep diving back in now and then and try to find some kind of enjoyment for this game, but every time I end up closing the game for the same reasons.  I do feel like Armello is a huge waste of potential and could be a much deeper, skill and strategy-based game... but right now its just 'pray to the RNG gods for good luck'.\n\nIf you're art-focused and don't mind bad gameplay, can look past the astounding amount of ui, graphical, and gameplay bugs, matches randomly freezing, online randomly booting you out of parties, and horrible AI, you might enjoy the game more than I have.  But there's no way anyone in their right mind could ever call this mess a good strategy game.","May 24","false","115.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The mechanics and four different victory conditions centered around the King are particularly interesting.\n\nI'd like to see some diversity added to the Banes (AI minions that spawn on the map) and I'm generally not a fan of anything being dictated by dice rolls, but overall this is already a very solid and polished game.\n\nI'll have to play more before the cracks start to show through, but the quality of the game as is and the dev team seem to indicate any major issues will be addressed over the course of the six month Early Access.","January 23, 2015","true","7.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It certainly can use a bit of tweaking of the AI.  Although there is some truth to the fact that the game is set up to favor a prestige or combat victory, that's not a huge issue.  And with some tweaking by the devs, that can certainly be adjusted.  It's not a big issue, but it's one that others have mentioned.  The only actual bug that I've encountered since release was one related to an achievement, and the devs were able to fix that issue.  It's fun, and light-hearted, and I definitely recommend it.

After playing both the singleplayer and multiplayer game modes, I was extremely pleased with my gameplay experience. Be advised, however, that the game truly shines when played together with friends; singleplayer may get dull after a few playthroughs.\n\nIf you enjoy playing tabletop games – especially ones with dice-rolling, cards, and map tiles; managing only one character, and playing against other people, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good – the amount of detail in the character models, terrain tiles, and everything else is high and very well-done. The dice-rolling looks and sounds like actual dice, and the cartoon-style battle animations are fluid. The map can eventually become repetitive because the only change between each playthrough is the randomization of the tile placements. The sounds and music are great and create a nice fantasy atmosphere.\n\nControls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with. There are a number of tutorial missions that help you learn the gameplay mechanics and how each clan works. The learning curve is mostly minimal to moderate depending on your experience with tabletop games. Although the AI can be fairly challenging, the game is meant to be enjoyed with friends, so do not base the difficulty solely on the singleplayer experience.\n\nGameplay revolves around beating your opponents in a variety of ways, with a rapidly dying Lion King as your turn timer. After every player has completed their turns, the King will take one damage (starting the game with 10 health points) and issue a royal decree. The royal decree will change an element of gameplay until the next round – for example, one type of decree will force all players to pay 5 gold, and any unable to do so must give a piece of equipment. The player with the most valour points chooses which decree will pass. Valour points are obtained in numerous ways, such as completing quests, defeating monsters/players, et cetera.\n\nDuring your turn, you are given a number of action cards (categorized as magic, equipment, and guile) based on your character’s wit, which also determines your maximum hand capacity (high wit = more cards). Equipment cards may give you bonuses like extra health or dice. Magic and guile cards can benefit you (similar to equipment) or harm opponents (ex: damage someone within range). To play cards, you need gold or mana (if you are using a magic card). Cards played on opponents usually require you to be within a certain range of tiles.\n\nYou are allowed 2-3 moves, however, moving onto a mountain tile will cost 2 moves (but also provide a bonus to defence). Swamp tiles will damage you for one hp, ruins will give you a random event (yielding cards, damage, quests, etc), and town tiles will be captured and generate gold per turn.\n\nQuests can be selected when you begin, and completing them will grant you an item, bonuses, and valour points. To finish a quest, you will usually have to travel to a specific tile and can either risk a full (there is always a % of success/failure shown) or standard completion (higher chance of success).\n\nThe King sends out castle guards, and monsters spawn during the night- these can be fought for valour, however, attacking a guard will put a bounty on you (that other players an claim).\n\nDuring combat, your attack rating determines how many dice you get to roll; endurance determines how many dice you get when on the defensive. Cards/equipment can boost your dice count, and “selling” cards allows you to lock in a particular dice roll (for example, selling an axe card guarantees an attack roll, removing one die from your total pool). Your attack rolls are subtracted from the opponent’s defence rolls, and any excess do direct damage. It is possible for you and an opponent to kill each other. In the event of a death, you respawn on your next turn in your specific corner of the map, losing a number of valour points.\n\nTo win, you may do a number of things. If the King dies from his ailment (he is inflicted with chaos), the player with the highest valour wins. Killing the King, collecting all the spirit eggs from ruins and entering the castle, or attacking the King when you have more chaos points than him (you get chaos points from killing monsters/players) will also allow you to secure victory.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is fleshed out very well, allowing for smooth, fun experiences. The singleplayer can be a bit lacking due to repetitiveness (without the human element). There is a lot of replayability because you can unlock different starting items and abilities for your characters (usually by winning with them). Anyone interested in digital tabletop games should definitely give this title a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","October 24, 2015","true","4.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","10","15","7","0"

I'd also like to point out how bad the tile placements are in this game, usually I end up getting 2 swamps next to 2 mountains  in the general area of my clan grounds completely blocking off one side of the board. On more than one occasion I've had 2 dungeons next to each other and ended up spawning 5 banes (3 of which I managed to roll for in their RNG based dungeon system and kill) and the last 2 just straight up spawned from the dungeons at night targeting me and ultimately killing me.\n\nAnother thing I want to point out is how badly broken this game is, most of the time the game just freezes up when I enter the palace to find the king loosing about 45 minutes of gameplay this is VERY frustrating, another common bug is the Menu straight up not working, on occasion when it asks me to ready up the ready button dissapears kicking me into another lobby and punishing me for leaving the game because I couldn't ready up, even the main menu breaks to the point where i'm just stuck looking at a blurry background of the king sitting on his throne.\nAnother issue I have with this game is the online lobby completely not working at all, when i play with my friends we all ready up and suddenly it just throws us out of our lobby swaping fast between multiple lobbies of people waiting to play the game (I have no Idea how they plan to implement ranked mode with the current lobby system being garbage).\n\nFinally I'd like to finish this by saying that I had high hopes for this game but ultimately it ended up just being next to just another shovelware game, maybe the developers will fix it but probably not, I see people on their forums complain to them and the usually they respond with a snarky comment followed by people whiteknighting them.\n\nAll I can say to LoG is Maybe next time.","May 16","false","131.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

There's way too much luck involved, and most strategy you can conjure up hardly matters. The first two games I played I just happened to win because I was doing quests and playing cards when I could.\n\nA good game boils down to making interesting decisions, but when playing this game there's very few to be had. Most of it doesn't even matter. Do I pick the quest that gives me a 30% chance to get a Spirit stone and a spirit that I won't use, or do I pick the quest that gives me a not useful companion that gives the health I'll probably need?\n\nDo I win by killing the king because I happened to get some rot cards and died to the birds? Or do I kill the king because I got lucky enough to get two spirit stones from the dungeons and it was super easy to get the rest? It's just horribly dull.\n\nGameplay boils down to. "Pick a character, use amulets/rings to give them small advantages." This gives you the illusion that there's strategies to explore, but in actuality it ends up more like this:\n\nGo to quest. Hopefully get something good out of it, or don't 'risk' it. (But good luck having any sort of a chance if you don't.) Explore dungeons, get random stuff, or don't. Get into fights. Win/Lose them depending on what equipment you happened to get and how lucky you were on your rolls. Someone on the board gets enough Rot/Spirit Stones/OP equips to kill king. Very little you can do to stop them. They fight the king and usually win. Sometimes they'll die in the process and someone else who did nothing all game will win instead. Game's over.\n\nI hope more people explore the interesting design space there is in a digital board game in the future, but this game felt like all style and not substance.\n\nIf you're looking for a super casual game and have a high tolerance for swingy gameplay to play with a few buddies, then this is the game for you.\n\nIf you want something anything deeper than that, look elsewhere.\n\n2.5/5","October 5, 2015","false","2.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","3"

How and if you win the game are heavily dependent on RNG. This can be very frustrating to players who want a more strategy based game.\nRNG determines the outcome of dice rolls, dice rolls determine the outcome of battles, battles determine the outcome of the overall game. To be fair, dice rolls can be manipulated by cards in your hand and by your equipped cards. However, what cards you get is up to RNG and you may end up with poor equipped items or a lack of the card type you desire for any particular battle. Also, the amount of cards you can hold is determined by your wit stat, which always seems to be lacking unless you are a rat (at which point you have very little of any other stat).\nAside from RNG, my one qualm with this game is the speed. Waiting for turns to go through can be excruciating. While I recommend watching the characters (as you may find ways to trump them), there are times when all the characters are in stealth... So you will sit there, listening to them rummage around for a bit, waiting for your turn while almost nothing happens visually. I HIGHLY recommend turning on 'Quick AI Encounters' after your first game. This will speed up the turns quite a bit.\n\nThere are 4 victories you are capable of attaining: prestige, kingslayer, spirit stone, and rot. By far, the easiest victory to attain is the prestige victory; it depends more on strategy than any other victory. Rot is the hardest victory to attain; it is highly reliant on RNG. If you are a completionist, or even just want to attain all the victory achievements, you will be kept busy for quite a while. However, if you are fine playing it once through, it will maybe keep you occupied an hour or two.\n\nI recommend the game if you like to fight against the odds and have decent luck with RNG.\nI do not recommend the game if you hate RNG dependent mechanics (for which there are many).","April 7","true","18.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But now through multiple playthroughs and many different outcomes My overall opinion has changed on the game so let me break it down to three catagories, the good, the bad, and the ugly....\n\nThe Good,\n- The gameplay has improved over time, where at some times the game would drop a frame like skrillex drops a beat  expecially when rolling dice, but now it's much much more smoother.\n- The many ways you can ♥♥♥♥ over another player and prevent them from winning proves how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people are in games, in one scenario, I had high prestiege and prevented another player from slaying the king before I could claim prestiege victory.\n-there are many different cards you collect will change your strategy up a bit. makes for multiple playthroughs.\n- The Animations and opening cutscene are amazing!\n\nThe Bad,\n- Prestiege is wayyy to easy to win while other victories are much more harder... This needs to be balanced out.\n- Because prestiege is the easiest, even with different cards, the game can get repetitive sometimes\n- Even though there are alot of cards, I would like to see more, like you would see in card games... But this is a personal gripe of mine.\n- Would like to see bandit clan sometime soon\n\nThe Ugly\nNot really much that wasn't allready mentioned in the Bad Section\n\nOverall\nI do enjoy the game alot more than before, but at times it leaves me wanting more content in this game...","April 8","true","28.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

It's a very high quality creation. League of Geeks have created something very unique in execution and deserve plaudits for that.\n\nThat being said, I want to point out that League of Geeks are making a "digital board game" and that shows. If it was a physical board game, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat without a second thought. As a video game though it suffers from a short game time and a lack of rewarding play. With friends it's a lovely experience, but the single player feels very quick and lacks the level of strategy that is expected of a modern strategy game. The AI also feels basic and a little suicidal at times, attacking higher level opponents or players despite little chance of success.\n\nThere are bugs, but it's in Early Access, and I've only had 1 total crash in around 10-15 games some multi-player some single player. The only noticable other bug was I retained Magic when I should have lost it.\n\nLeague of Geeks have got the fundamentals of a board game down and added so much prettiness on top that I definitely recommend the game. Go into it thinking "I'm buying a digital board game to play with friends" and it's worth it.

So here's my quick review :D\n\nPros:\n- A lot of strategy: There is a time limit of around 1.5 minute online per turn. You really need this time to complete your turn properly. Every move is a decision.\n- Great artwork: The game just looks absolutely amazing. Especially the cartoonish artwork in the 'fight scenes'.\n- RNG: The game works with random cards you get in your hand, this makes every match a different experience. The fight system works with dices, so you can get lucky or very unlucky, but overall, the player with the best odds wins most of the battles.\n\nThe RNG part is something you may or may not like. I personally liked the RNG part, because the winner of the match is still mostly decided by skill, not RNG.\n\nCons:\n- Slow: In an online game you are waiting most of the time.

It takes the gameplay of a tabletop board game adds some strategy to it and becomes a digital game.

You like strategic boardgames dont miss out on this. I havent played boardgames in a while since my brother always won in axis and allies (he played online and knew every tactic), boring for me.

No matter how dark things look, even near endgame you can turn it all around and laugh as you crush your enemies confidence in their win. The only downside I can think of is the ragequitters and disconnects although they are replaced by AIs the AI isnt very smart and can cheat you of certain victory in the most stupid way like attacking the boss and dying in the progress giving the victory to your enemy.

There are still a few minor bugs with the gameplay BUT this is easily forgivable since it is still an Early Access game.\n\nSpeaking as someone that does not play many tile based and turn based games, I was a little hesitant when jumping in for the first time. The game, however, is very charming, not overloading you with books of dialogue about the characters or the kingdom. It feels more like an emergent narrative that allows the player to decide there own fate during the game play. It's very replayable as there are many unlockable items that can change your strategy when in game. There are also more characters confirmed for later release which looks very exciting.\n\nThe Art, as mentioned, is amazing and consistent all the way through. One thing that I do love is that they have 3D animations for tile game play and traditional 2D animations for combat. Any fan of 'Redwall' or 'Mice and Mystics' will be able to jump into this with no problems.\n\nDefinitely worth a look for anyone that enjoys tabletop and roleplay games!","May 14, 2015","true","66.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DesertMaverick/recommended/290340/","DesertMaverick","[NWE] DesertMaverick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DesertMaverick/","318 products in account","A visually stunning and impressive game. The game is a sort of adventure game of intrigue, combat, and politics. 8 characters across 4 clans of animals are playable in a game to either kill, or cleanse the king.\n\nEach clan has their own ring set to expand upon their playstyles to alter how you play. Amulets allow you to give a bonus stat at the start or a head start on some of the winning conditions in the game.\n\nGameplay follows a lot of your adventure board game stylings such as super dungeon adventure. The map is essentially a big diamond with various tiles for different effects. Each player has a quest to start with from 3 pickable ones. If you get to the tile you can either risk a roll for a bonus item but if you fail you will lose things such as health, magic, prestige, etc. This is all the while fighting off banes brought from void dungeons, other players, and occasionally the kings own guards. Each day has two turn cycles of day and night. Each day the king loses 1 of his 9 health until he dies on his own and at night his rot level grows by one. This means there are 18 turns in total until he dies.\n\nIn that time you have 4 ways to win the game. The first is that you have the highest prestige when the king dies on his own or by someone killing the king who dies by the kings hand in that same fight. The second is that you kill the king without dying to him. The third is to kill the king with more rot than him (Rot victory). Lastly is the cleansing victory which has you gathering 4 spirit stones found across the map occasionally or by finding one in the dungeon tiles.\n\nCombat in the game is an interesting concept as well. Each character has 4 stats to work with, Fight increases the number of dice you can use in combat/defending, Body determines your characters health points, wits increase card carrying capacity and peril dice, and spirit determines how much magic points you get at night to use on spell cards. Upon entering combat you roll dice equivolent to your fight stat against your targets fight dice. Any bonuses from equipment are considered as well. rolls determine your attack and defense numbers and are compared against your targets. Fights can end in double KO's.\n\nEach turn you can draw cards up to your wits number. Cards come in 3 flavors: Items come in the form of equipment, or useable one time items that require gold to equip or use. Magic cards allow you cast the spell on them for it's magic cost. The last card set is trickery, they allow you to alter events or cause trouble for a gold cost.\n\nThe soundtrack enhances the mood of the game quite well. It suits the fantasy medieval setting very well.\n\nNow there are some gripes with the game in some aspects. For the most part each character has a unique playstyle that doesn't have a glaring detriment. However there are two characters who's specific abilities aren't all that helpful to you in progressing towards a win condition. The first is the rat mercurio, whose ability of taking a gold from a settlement owner when he takes it himself starts becoming useless in the later parts of the game. The second is the bear Sana, her ability is that she can use her spirit stat as her fight stat when she fights anything that's corrupted. This is a big loss for her in the early game as the only thing that's corrupted early are banes (rot birds that spawn from dungeons), so unless someones going for a rot victory or you are going to try and fight the king, her ability is practically useless until the very late game.\n\nA second issue i have with the game is that you have a visual range of about 8 tiles of the board for clear visability. If you zoom out, the game gives a kind of through the clouds look which blurs your vision a bit. For a game that's supposed to be board game like, it would be nice to have an option to view the entire board clearly (outside of stealthed enemies). It is mitigated by quick keys to jump to certain sections of the board, but it would have been something nice to have.\n\nThe last one i have is that the online is a little to be desired. As a whole it functions, but you can't host an online match until you get a friend in your game nor is there a list of available games. Your options are look for randoms which with the low player count can take some time, or invite a friend then you can have others join you or fill with AI.\n\nI would recommend the game for anyone who enjoys adventure like board games but don't want to spend the 70-150 dollars it costs to buy them. The average game length is about 50 minutes to an hour and no suspend feature for online so make sure to have some time to play through to the end.","September 4, 2015","true","29.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Dokapon Kingdom is a fusion of board game and JRPG that - while immensely fun - was simply too long, too random, and encouraged players to jerk each other over far too much. Despite these flaws, Dokapon Kingdom is probably one of my favorite games despite the few situations where I find time to play it.\n\nArmello brings down the randomness quite considerably as battles are no longer a roshambo match and instead focus on dice and card usage, all determined by stats. The complicated class system is replaced by heroes that determine your abilities. The game length feels to be around 30 minutes a game as opposed to the 20 something hours that Dokapon Kingdom can take. While you can certainly attack the other player, no one ever feels the need to quit since the game is so short.\n\nBut these changes take out some of the charm of a game like this, if you're going to make a direct comparison to Dokapon Kingdom. There's less a sense of an adventure, the board is really small and you never feel invested in your towns since they change ownership so quickly. The lack of global objectives and the use of personal ones can also lead to the sense of a lack of interaction sometimes and your teammates become more random encounters rather than opponents if everyone goes different victory routes.\n\nArmello is nice, a nice light game to pick up your day. Probably not a game I'll invest 100+ hours in its current state, but a game I'll play every now and then.","September 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It eases the players into the (seemingly) complicated mechanics, but in an organic, story-driven way that is entertaining and informative.

On the mechanics part, they are easy to understand and use and, as soon as you get the hang of it, you will find burning cards is a wonderful feature which you should use often to get many different cards.\n\nOn the "bad" side, even though the maps are randomly created, there are not enough features to make a map feel special. For a boardgame, this is no problem, but a digitalized one could add more spice. I remember the digital Catan game, where you could zoom into the lands and see people work.

The 4 clans (Wolves, Rats, Rabbits and Bears) now try to gain the upper hand (or paw) and fight each other for the throne of Armello.\n\nYou play as one of the clans' heroes, like Thane the wolf warrior or Sana the bear druid. (4 heroes available right now, 4 additional heroes + 4 Kickstarter backer-exclusive heroes already confirmed)\nTraveling over the board in a turn-based system, you draw cards (items, spells, trickeries/traps, followers...), conquer villages and explore dungeons for gold (to play your cards) and treasures, complete quests related to your hero's backstory, fight monsters and other heroes for gold and prestige in a dice-based battle system and try to raise your stats (like number of dice, life points, etc).\nIn the end, you can face the king in battle. Or banish him with magical spirit stones. Or just collect the most prestige and wait for him to die. There are many different ways to win the game.\n\nA special feature of Armello is the rot. Your hero can become affected by the same curse as the king, completely changing the course of battles. If both you and your enemy are affected by rot, the hero with more rot gains the other hero's amount of rot as bonus dice. If your rot is high enough, it makes battles against other heroes or even the king way easier (when you suddenly roll 5 more dice than your enemy). On the other hand, you lose health every turn and can't use the healing stone circles anymore. Managing your rot  is an important part of the game.\n\nThere is no best hero or best way to win the game. Some lucky dice rolls, bad card draws or finding a good follower in a dungeon can and will make you adapt your strategy.\nMaybe you were the prestige leader the whole game and lose everything by accidently attacking a King's Guard. But then, a quest and some dark magic increase your rot and you suddenly have more than the king. Now all you need is more fighting power. With a bit of luck, you'll find enough gold in that dungeon over there to equip the expensive battleaxe you found two turns ago. Or wait until next turn and try to draw a card that lets you steal the rabbit's morning star...\nNo game is the same as the last.\n\nThe game has come a long way since the beginning of the Backer-Alpha and lots of things have been improved during the Backer-Beta (like a complete rework of the rot system). Now, with some of the things added and changed in the latest build, this Early Access version definitely is the best version of this game so far. If everyone keeps submitting bug reports and suggestion to make the game better and the developers at League of Geeks keep up their great work (and I'm sure they will), this game can become one of the best digital board games in years.\n\n------\n\nPros:\nGreat artstyle\nLikeable characters\nBeautiful animated cards\nEasy to learn\nSurprising strategic depth\nInteresting dice battle system\nGreat 4 player Online-Multiplayer (maybe still a bit unstable, but steadily improving)\n\nCons:\nBad luck can make you lose in a single turn\nAI sometimes too easy to beat/no difficulty settings\nSome heroes/strategies actually ARE stronger than others right now, but with more cards and balance changes, I'm sure this will be fixed after Early Access\n\nIf you like board games, fantasy settings or animals, or you're just looking for a relaxing game, I can definitely recommend Armello!","January 23, 2015","true","41.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

But Armello is fantastic!! In my experience, I have never played a game like it. The theme is awesome and probably the number one element that drew me to the game in the first place. The music is great, and the gameplay is unique. I really like the tabletop aspect to it. Armello has become one of my favorite games, especially for light strategy I like to call it. You can be in and finnished with a sinlge game relitivly quickly; probably between an hour and an hour and a half in my experience. And for me with the strategy games I play (Total War, Sid Miers, etc.) it feels nice. I feel satisfied when a game ends and I do tend to ask myself the question "Another round?"\nIn my opinion, there aren't many other games of this quality for this price and experience around.

The game has harsh coin-flippy rewards and a terrible snowballing potential, meaning your result on the first challenge (where it is most like a coin flip) determines the course of the rest of the game.  This, and some of the supporting systems, lead to the best strategy being to simply stack your highest stat as high as possible.  Three of the four stats eventually lead to a massive pile of prestige, which lets you win by default a few turns before any of the other victory conditions are possible (without extreme luck).  Better balance between the victory conditions would help, but ultimately the problem is that the game's randomness can only be steared when you're ahead.\n\nThere are other problems with the game - cards are samey, lots of useful information is animated away before it can be read, and the UI has some serious rough edges (burning cards has a pile of issues, in particular).  But the core problems with the strategy are what kill it.","September 9, 2015","false","4.9"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","1"

No rush rush clickig with precision. It requires very little memory of some complicated large map or massive playing pieces or an  understanding of some major large deck of cards.  It does work your mind very well in trying to figure the quickest route to victory given the few cards you are delt.  The game has a turn limit so, when it ends, it ends.  No sitting down for hours at a time.\n\nIin Armello, bad results early just mean you alter to victory through a different path based on the cards and die roles.  There are different ways to win, just choe the path to take given what you are dealt.\n\nCONS:  Getting to understand which route to take requires maybe losing  to the computer several times just to get the idea of what works and what doesn't.  As you are first learning the game, the music and artwork are sure to keep you affixed to the game and content in your progress.  Just playing the first couple games and losing actually opens up new items to use to enhance the character you choose to play so, a loss is never a loss to start your first adventures.","October 11, 2015","true","19.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is so good I'm very happy it isn't.\n\nThe game mechanics are really fun and well balanced, while the artwork and character design is absolute top notch excellent.\n\nOne of the things I didn't notice in videos for this game is the card artwork.

The illustrations of cards, menu, characters and fights are simply awesome and even though the game is not big on 3D work, it's good too. The system is explained and even though seems complex at start, it is easily explained multiple times it's not hard to memorise.\nThe 'fights' and also interactions have a massive downside of being RNG-based as of rolling the dice and has nothing to do with skill as of for most of the game too, but also at the same time giving the 'surprise' charm you get when playing a real game.\nStory isn't very special, usual magic adventure with a rather interesting character roster filling up for that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/290340/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","Having watched this game through Early Access iterations and release, I can say that the game is fun and also that the devs care that it is in a good state.\n\nHARDWARE\nGTX 970, Phenom II X6 @ 3.2ghz, 16gb RAM, SSD\nMouse and Keyboard\nSteam Controller - Works great, see below.\n\nPerformance - The game never drops below 60FPS and looks great 98% of the time.  Minor texture flickering may occur and occasional audio performance issues from using the newly released Steam Controlled and Big Picture mode it seems.  The game is being constantly updated.  I have experienced NMA (no more action) bugs only twice or so in my 74 hours of gameplay, some other minor bugs after its release from early access as well but the release is solid and you should not experience any real issues either.  Netplay seems to work very reliably and has Steam integration for playing with friends.\n\nGameplay - Armello is more or less a tabletop board game where you control one of several semi-customizable heroes in your quest to be the new king.  This is achieved by acruing the most prestige when the king dies of a magical corruption (or failed regicide), killing the king and surviving, or by collecting four artefacts required to cure him.   You have several decks of cards with themes of equipment, magic, and subterfuge, which you can draw and play towards your goal.  There's choices on how to progress your character, risks to weigh against rewards, and plenty of tussles to be had with the other players as you fight each other along the way.  The thematics in this game are all wonderful, and the art, music, and visuals all contribute to the great presentation.  The duration of a full-length online game is about 45-90 minutes depending on how long people take on their turns, and it can be less if a player achieves one of the other victory conditions,\n\nBut is it fun?  I think so.  The game has a strong element of RNG.  Random board terrain, cards drawn, AI character movement, fickle dice rolls, and other players strangely unpredictable behavior all contribute towards making the game seem a crapshoot.  One of the more prevalent complaints I have seen is how RNG heavy the game can be.   But strategy does exist and a large part of it is being adaptive to the state of the game and trying to sway the odds in your favor.   Knowing what decks to draw out of to try get the right cards you need, knowing what your objective should be for that phase of the game, and knowing what victory condition you should be working towards (and not just wandering the board aimlessly), these are all important and more.  True, this isn't always going to work, but the game would probably be a lot more boring if every player was able to run consistent strategies, or only a few consistent strategies existed.  The randomness of the game gives you more unpredictable 'oh-my-god that just happened' moments.   It wont require any sort of grand strategy game knowledge to enjoy yourself either, so if you like to just play by the seat of your pants you can do that too.  I think most importantly, if you can be a bit laid pack and not get upset over the outcome of a dice roll going completely wrong and maybe even losing you the game every now and then, you will have a good time.\n\nAll in all, its a great game.  I've played 75 hours and loved them all, and I hope to play many more.  There's been a lot of balance changes from Early Access up til now a few months after release and the devs do have an ear to the community for the most part.  There's some more content on the way in the form of new characters as well, and maybe even some more content DLC down the line (I hope!).  Its a good one.  I'd recommend it.\n\n-STEAM CONTROLLER-\nGame works great with the Steam Controller!  I would recommend my custom setup I have uploaded to the community profiles section, or you can read my suggested binding here.  This arrangement lets you easily and quickly view player positions and keep an eye on the action.

Even with rather light-hearted customization abilities, the character personalities and the separation via clans has you clutched in a constant internal battle of which character best fits you and what clan do you truly belong to. (Personally I prefer Rat clan, Mercurio is love, Mercurio is life).\n\nThe game really is simple to learn and easy to pick up, with hundreds of card combinations that allow for a different experience within each play through. I always find myself delegating each character to different victory types only to realize that I may have misjudged one, and having to play even more Armello to truly discover the potential each character has.\n\nHaving 4 Victory conditions, that being in Spirit Stone, Rot, King Slayer and Prestige also adds to the pace and variety of the game, as you may find yourself geared towards a King Slayer Victory only to realize that you have 4 Spirit Stones or a ton of prestige and thus having to change your method of plan in order to better suite the type of victory that you are geared towards. This also allows you to find different ways to play the same character and really discover their potential even further.\n\nThe game is loads of fun, every game is different, every play style is different, and having so many characters to choose from (with more coming soon) really allows for a fresh feel every time you play.  The board design is beautiful, with the chance of winter occurring and snow being sprinkled all over the land, as well as a really awesome transition in animation whenever you enter a battle sequence. The swift strikes of Mercurio's blade, the bulky bludgeoning blows of Brun's Mace and even the Cute and Adorable expressions that Barnaby makes when he swings his hammer really adds personality to the battles. But don't let that adorableness fool you because Barnaby can really kick ♥♥♥. I wlil admit the damage animation really surprised me as well I definitely wasn't expecting blood and the sound effects that accompany really instill the feeling of pain in you, you almost do feel annihilated when you are super over-killed by any character. This definitely livens up the battle and makes it a much more invigorating aspect of the game to engage in.\n\nI will say this however. Armello is hard to master, but not because of real complexities of the game and characters. Yes you can customize the stats of your character in so many different ways offering so many different ways for you to play, but at the end of the day Armello is all luck. Yes there are ways in which you can modify your stats and skills in order to better yourself for victory but everything down to the bone of this game is luck. The cards you draw, the dice you roll, the gains from dungeons, the spoils form quests, everything is luck and in the end you are basically finding ways to manipulate RNG to work in your favor.\n\nWhich brings me to defense. Armello loves seeing the attack dice stack up to ungodly amounts, (I myself have had 20 attack dice in a battle before) with 3 sides of the dice awarding you with a hit on either time of day corrupted or not, you can literally get infinite attack if the RNG works in your favor. Unfortunately there is only 1 of the six sides that awards you defense, making it extremely difficult to survive in some cases. Yes there are items and cards that can remedy this but again it is up to the luck of the draw and luck of the roll to gain shields. Even with that, you can enter a battle with 20 dice against someone with maybe 5 and still end up dead due to favored rolls for attack and getting no shield dice. You only need so many hits to kill and so many hits to survive and more times than not you will find yourself overkilling by massive amounts only to get hit just enough to die, making the overkill, very enjoyable to receive but meaningless in the end due to dying anyway\n\nIf you are looking for a game to play "competitively" Armello is honestly not your game, sure there is that wonderful rush of "you are never truly out of the game" but more times than not it is the game just rewarding you with lucky rolls and draws than it is you being rewarded for playing skillfully. Which is unfortunate because while it feels great to win games in Armello (believe me I take so many screenshots and share them happily, they make great desktop backgrounds) some of that glory is taken away by the shear fact that as strategic and skilled as you can be in the game, 90% of that was still RNG potentially playing in your favor or it playing your favor when it mattered most.\n\nWith that being said, I have played well over 300 hours and as frustrating as this game can be (believe me, it really can) it has that charm and style that makes you want to play more. Part of it is the competitive player in me not accepting a loss and having to prove the might of the rat clan (RNG please Mercurio loves you) but another part really just is the connection you establish with the game. The characters in my opinion are more than board pieces manipulated across a board. They are characters with personalities and styles that give life to the game you are playing. For the longest my twitter handle Read *Rat Clan* because I truly enjoyed the witty gameplay that came with Mercurio and the rat clan. This game is tons of fun to play with friends, and still an experience to behold online with other players. But I can completely understand people growing weary of it after a few hours of play and there are definitely ways for this game to be even better than it is.\n\nI end this by saying one of the biggest reasons I still play and have played over 300 hours is the community. The developers are really invested in the community, listening to forums, chats, hell every week they have a Dev v Community game stream where you can face the devs (I won one, not many people can say that ;)) and that really breathes a deeper life into this because you become even more invested in a game that you know is not only bringing you a satisfying experience but one that is listening to you as well. Mercurio knows that he can be OP sometimes but he is doing his best to understand your pain and tone down his desire to Hoodwink you. Buy the game, it is worth it, even if you only play a few times!","January 9","true","373.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I wouldnt even know the charecter backstory unless I read the wiki. That said it's a very refreshing experience, I love Catan and Dungeons and Dragons,  Armello takes some influence from them, but without others to develop the world via voice or any charecter interaction it makes the nostalgia fade at a shockingly fast pace.\n\nI would deffinatly reccomend this game to others, Steam Early Access has been riddled with terrible games but it feels like the Devs deffinatly care about players and the product theyre creating.

The rules were easy enough to pick up after one game, and any other questions we had were quickly answered by the game manual (which is hidden in the escape menu). The characters seem relatively balanced, and thankfully, not pandering to furries.\n\nThe game has solid depth, and I could see myself replaying it for the forseeable future before it gets stale (I'm estimating about 60 games). Playing around with different characters and pushing yourself for the more difficult victory conditions is a riot while everyone scampers around the map jumping on each other to prevent everyone from doing the same. While there's a healthy element of randomness to it all, much of the luck can be mitigated by smart plays, so generally the more skilled players win. That said, the card element is a little tricky to control, and I do wish there was a way of influencing your draws other than by card type.\n\nJust note: this is a short game that's meant to be replayed. There is only one 'map', and the game lasts around 40 minutes; even though the trailer would seem to have you believe that it's some kind of sprawling epic. The map itself is relatively small, but that serves to keep everyone running into each other consistently, which is point.\n\nMake sure you have a friend along for the ride, because the amount of banter you're about to get up to on Skype is worth the price of admission alone.","September 3, 2015","true","17.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I mean you can have high prestige at the end of the game(talking in multiplayer) and loose like 4 prestige at the last round because there's "anti-cards" to your strategy and stuff. That makes for a pretty interesting and fun gameplay(for those that get those cards).\n\nMultiplayer suffer in other areas too:\n1. Matchmaking is also suffering from the "someone picked my hero, so I'll go and rejoin another game". There's no penalty for leaving, and the ones that ragequit mid-game will get an AI instead. And yes, it has happened, the AI won that time :P\n2. There's no proper chat, it's all predefined lines you can say, like in Hearthstone. It opens for console of course, but it's kinda annoying that you can't "talk stragegy" at all. You can't say exactly what you want. But you can try add them on steam as their steam ID is the ingame one.\n3. You can sit awhile and wait for people to join the extremely simple matchmaking in like ONE lobby room. Games can take long maybe up to an hour or hour'n'a'half.\n\nLastly, I want to apologize to the one player that we kinda made a pact from the start of the game against the two other players. Some cards allow you to gain resources as long as one of you don't die. And that I had to kinda "backstab" him in the end, I had 10 prestige and was closest of the two of us to win, I had pretty good shields and I knew he had loads of +fight. And the quickest way I could get to the one about to attack the king was to get killed in order to go back home(and it was closer to the winning guy, due to perils blocking of the quickest path. And so we still didn't make it, but that wanted me to explain myself and my tactic after I attacked him and tossed ALL I had at him(had to maintain the prestige if I happen to win), but you can't.. Can't say anything, and he kept using the treathen lines at me.\n\nIt's a pretty addictive game over all,unlocking stuff as you win matches and gain "XP" for starter "items" and "favors" I guess they're called.\n\nAnd I'm really looking forward to future DLC of new characters, new cards, new rings and favors as well as new maps(? -because the maps are randomized every game) or new texture-set for current map.

Minor texture flickering may occur and occasional audio performance issues from using the newly released Steam Controlled and Big Picture mode it seems.  The game is being constantly updated.  I have experienced NMA (no more action) bugs only twice or so in my 74 hours of gameplay, some other minor bugs after its release from early access as well but the release is solid and you should not experience any real issues either.  Netplay seems to work very reliably and has Steam integration for playing with friends.\n\nGameplay - Armello is more or less a tabletop board game where you control one of several semi-customizable heroes in your quest to be the new king.  This is achieved by acruing the most prestige when the king dies of a magical corruption (or failed regicide), killing the king and surviving, or by collecting four artefacts required to cure him.   You have several decks of cards with themes of equipment, magic, and subterfuge, which you can draw and play towards your goal.  There's choices on how to progress your character, risks to weigh against rewards, and plenty of tussles to be had with the other players as you fight each other along the way.  The thematics in this game are all wonderful, and the art, music, and visuals all contribute to the great presentation.  The duration of a full-length online game is about 45-90 minutes depending on how long people take on their turns, and it can be less if a player achieves one of the other victory conditions,\n\nBut is it fun?  I think so.  The game has a strong element of RNG.  Random board terrain, cards drawn, AI character movement, fickle dice rolls, and other players strangely unpredictable behavior all contribute towards making the game seem a crapshoot.  One of the more prevalent complaints I have seen is how RNG heavy the game can be.   But strategy does exist and a large part of it is being adaptive to the state of the game and trying to sway the odds in your favor.   Knowing what decks to draw out of to try get the right cards you need, knowing what your objective should be for that phase of the game, and knowing what victory condition you should be working towards (and not just wandering the board aimlessly), these are all important and more.  True, this isn't always going to work, but the game would probably be a lot more boring if every player was able to run consistent strategies, or only a few consistent strategies existed.  The randomness of the game gives you more unpredictable 'oh-my-god that just happened' moments.   It wont require any sort of grand strategy game knowledge to enjoy yourself either, so if you like to just play by the seat of your pants you can do that too.  I think most importantly, if you can be a bit laid pack and not get upset over the outcome of a dice roll going completely wrong and maybe even losing you the game every now and then, you will have a good time.\n\nAll in all, its a great game.  I've played 75 hours and loved them all, and I hope to play many more.  There's been a lot of balance changes from Early Access up til now a few months after release and the devs do have an ear to the community for the most part.  There's some more content on the way in the form of new characters as well, and maybe even some more content DLC down the line (I hope!).  Its a good one.  I'd recommend it.\n\n-STEAM CONTROLLER-\nGame works great with the Steam Controller!  I would recommend my custom setup I have uploaded to the community profiles section, or you can read my suggested binding here.  This arrangement lets you easily and quickly view player positions and keep an eye on the action.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035856837/recommended/290340/","76561198035856837","Archimedes","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035856837/","119 products in account","It is amazing to me that I have yet to write one of these for this game but this is what I have to say about Armello.\n\nArmello is an amazing game, with astonishing visuals, awesome battle animations and amazingly crafted characters and variety that just screams "MUST REPLAY". Even with rather light-hearted customization abilities, the character personalities and the separation via clans has you clutched in a constant internal battle of which character best fits you and what clan do you truly belong to. (Personally I prefer Rat clan, Mercurio is love, Mercurio is life).\n\nThe game really is simple to learn and easy to pick up, with hundreds of card combinations that allow for a different experience within each play through. I always find myself delegating each character to different victory types only to realize that I may have misjudged one, and having to play even more Armello to truly discover the potential each character has.\n\nHaving 4 Victory conditions, that being in Spirit Stone, Rot, King Slayer and Prestige also adds to the pace and variety of the game, as you may find yourself geared towards a King Slayer Victory only to realize that you have 4 Spirit Stones or a ton of prestige and thus having to change your method of plan in order to better suite the type of victory that you are geared towards. This also allows you to find different ways to play the same character and really discover their potential even further.\n\nThe game is loads of fun, every game is different, every play style is different, and having so many characters to choose from (with more coming soon) really allows for a fresh feel every time you play.  The board design is beautiful, with the chance of winter occurring and snow being sprinkled all over the land, as well as a really awesome transition in animation whenever you enter a battle sequence. The swift strikes of Mercurio's blade, the bulky bludgeoning blows of Brun's Mace and even the Cute and Adorable expressions that Barnaby makes when he swings his hammer really adds personality to the battles. But don't let that adorableness fool you because Barnaby can really kick ♥♥♥. I wlil admit the damage animation really surprised me as well I definitely wasn't expecting blood and the sound effects that accompany really instill the feeling of pain in you, you almost do feel annihilated when you are super over-killed by any character. This definitely livens up the battle and makes it a much more invigorating aspect of the game to engage in.\n\nI will say this however. Armello is hard to master, but not because of real complexities of the game and characters. Yes you can customize the stats of your character in so many different ways offering so many different ways for you to play, but at the end of the day Armello is all luck. Yes there are ways in which you can modify your stats and skills in order to better yourself for victory but everything down to the bone of this game is luck. The cards you draw, the dice you roll, the gains from dungeons, the spoils form quests, everything is luck and in the end you are basically finding ways to manipulate RNG to work in your favor.\n\nWhich brings me to defense. Armello loves seeing the attack dice stack up to ungodly amounts, (I myself have had 20 attack dice in a battle before) with 3 sides of the dice awarding you with a hit on either time of day corrupted or not, you can literally get infinite attack if the RNG works in your favor. Unfortunately there is only 1 of the six sides that awards you defense, making it extremely difficult to survive in some cases. Yes there are items and cards that can remedy this but again it is up to the luck of the draw and luck of the roll to gain shields. Even with that, you can enter a battle with 20 dice against someone with maybe 5 and still end up dead due to favored rolls for attack and getting no shield dice. You only need so many hits to kill and so many hits to survive and more times than not you will find yourself overkilling by massive amounts only to get hit just enough to die, making the overkill, very enjoyable to receive but meaningless in the end due to dying anyway\n\nIf you are looking for a game to play "competitively" Armello is honestly not your game, sure there is that wonderful rush of "you are never truly out of the game" but more times than not it is the game just rewarding you with lucky rolls and draws than it is you being rewarded for playing skillfully. Which is unfortunate because while it feels great to win games in Armello (believe me I take so many screenshots and share them happily, they make great desktop backgrounds) some of that glory is taken away by the shear fact that as strategic and skilled as you can be in the game, 90% of that was still RNG potentially playing in your favor or it playing your favor when it mattered most.\n\nWith that being said, I have played well over 300 hours and as frustrating as this game can be (believe me, it really can) it has that charm and style that makes you want to play more. Part of it is the competitive player in me not accepting a loss and having to prove the might of the rat clan (RNG please Mercurio loves you) but another part really just is the connection you establish with the game. The characters in my opinion are more than board pieces manipulated across a board. They are characters with personalities and styles that give life to the game you are playing. For the longest my twitter handle Read *Rat Clan* because I truly enjoyed the witty gameplay that came with Mercurio and the rat clan. This game is tons of fun to play with friends, and still an experience to behold online with other players. But I can completely understand people growing weary of it after a few hours of play and there are definitely ways for this game to be even better than it is.\n\nI end this by saying one of the biggest reasons I still play and have played over 300 hours is the community. The developers are really invested in the community, listening to forums, chats, hell every week they have a Dev v Community game stream where you can face the devs (I won one, not many people can say that ;)) and that really breathes a deeper life into this because you become even more invested in a game that you know is not only bringing you a satisfying experience but one that is listening to you as well. Mercurio knows that he can be OP sometimes but he is doing his best to understand your pain and tone down his desire to Hoodwink you. Buy the game, it is worth it, even if you only play a few times!","January 9","true","373.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

There are multiple ways to win, and certain animals have a slight advantage depending on the way you plan to win, not that you are AT ALL limited in choices due to the creature you chose as your avatar.\n\nDying is a part of the game. You WILL DIE. But depending on the strategy youre using to win, you may find that an occasional death is helpful.

If you just want the short and sweet Review, Look only to the first paragraph. If you want the Essay...continue ^_^\n\n--Blurb--\nCurrently Early Access: Not all features unlocked, not everything is in final game form, soul of the game and it's potential is immediately apparent. Play with a friend or by yourself.\n\nGame of Thrones meets Redwall for an epic ride through the lands of Armello in the format of Settlers of Catan...without all the trading\n\nThis turn based strategy desktop gaming with a furry overtone will have you forming secret coalitions, laying deadly traps, braving forgotten dungeons, hunting deadly creatures, and praying to the RNG gods for their blessing. With multiple methods to achieve victory and only having 16 turns for you to accomplish one of those conditions, this mad dash for the crown will leave everyone scrambling till the last second.\n\nGoal of the game: Become King....sounds easy right?\nHow to reach that goal:\nKill the King and take the throne by force\nBanish the King with magic of the Wyld\nWin the loyalty and support of the people\nEmbrace the Rot and become the new Dark Lord\n\nPros (imo)\n-Achievement System: Good long term investment if you wish to discover different strategies of play\n-Card and Dice combat: Good Planning is countered by Good Luck and vice-versa, makes sure everyone has a chance\n-Questing System: RPG style of character building along multiple routes to aid you in your victory path\n-PVP and PVE Adventuring: Fight other players or monsters to enhance your chances of winning\n-Graphics: Beautiful art with minimal animations subtly draws you into the game as you play\n-Not a "Winner's Game": you've played them before. Everyone who spends 15 turns to attempt to achieve victory has a chance to achieve victory. Lovely aspect of the luck based combat system.\n\nCons (imo)\n-Combat Log: When first learning the game, you'll be swamped by a feeling of "what just happened" a lot. The combat log is small and hard to keep track of since every turn is packed with so much information.\n-Early Acces Bugs: Not completed yet, so if you're looking for a finished and polished game, you will not be getting that right off the bat. Community and Developers are working to iron them out and plan on improving the game throughout it's life span\n-Hidden Information: Lots of things about this game I don't know about. I don't know what the goal is, payment plans, development schedules, etc. Putting a lot of trust into the developers. However, considering how much they've done with the game already, I don't think that trust is misplaced.\n-Addicting: This is just me.....I put it as a con cause you may have a life....I love being addicted to this game.\n\nOverall Impression: Love the game, can't wait to see what else they do with it. More characters, cards, etc. So much more is planned for this game and I am enjoying seeing what comes down the pipe.\n\n--End of Blurb-- (Yeah...THAT was the short stuff ^_^)\n\n\n--Beginning of Rant and Praise--\n\nThe once beautiful land of Armello was ruled by a wise and benevolent King. The inherent animosity of the Bear, Rabbit, Rat, and Wolf clans were tamed under his rule. With fair hand and heart, the King provided a place where all would be welcome and war would cease. All was well and right in the world...until the Rot came. Dark magic permeated the land, spawning terrible creatures that roamed the night, preying on the innocent and frightened. With the King's guard called away to confront this evil, another evil arose to line their pockets with gold and wet their blades with blood. Without their protection, the citizens were terrorized by criminals and bandits who thrived in the chaos abound. The once peaceful coalition between the clans have been torn asunder and fear for the future has called the clans to call out for heroes, namely YOU, to claim the throne of a Mad King.\n\nThe writing in this game, when I take the time to look at it, is simple and straight forward. There is enough spirit and wit (there is a pun there) in this game to give it a kind of life that seems like the next generation of "board game" feeling. Growing up with a large family, we had lots of chances to play board games with each other and the once powerful alliance of one game quickly became a bitter rivalry the next. With the dawn of video gaming (that should indicate how old I am that I witnessed this transition), that tabletop game feeling seems to have died out. Why bother playing with such a static field when the bells and whistles of computers and consoles are so much more appealing. Somehow, this game has found a balance between those two aspects. With the graphics of a console game with the core mechanics of a tabletop board game. What's improved is that nobody is saying "that's against the rules" and digressing into a 30 minute discussion about what the manual means. The rules are programmed in, and everyone is always subjugated to the same ruling. Maybe that will change in the future when they allow us to create our own games with "house rules", but it doesn't change the fact that the rules are always going to be implemented fairly.\n\nThat's another big part of this game. Fairness. Although there are some things that need balancing still, the goal is to legitimately allow every player a chance at victory. Emphasis on "Chance". The luck system in the game keeps it so that there isn't really a "sure way" to win every time, you need to learn and adapt to the cards being played, how the board is laid out, and what your opponents are doing. Despite this, a "good player" who has strategy and executes their goals effectively will have a distinct advantage over a player who relies completely on luck. So there is a way to be a "good player" in a game and reduce the chances of someone sneaking a victory over you by being "just lucky".\n\nThat being said, there are a few aspects of the game that could use improvement. Many of them are mentioned and developed by the discussion boards and forums. The developers seem to be actively interested in the concerns of their gaming community and address each presented problem in some way. Again, the game is still in early access, so there is much to be done, but I have yet to feel like this is a game that is already set in stone, and I am going to just play it. From the time I heard about the game to the time I started playing it, which was only a few weeks, the YouTube videos are already showing that what was mentioned has been addressed and fixed thanks to the watchful eyes of the gamers. It's a very rewarding experience to be a part of.\n\nOne of the sad things is being forever in Queue to find a public game. Hopefully that will change when more people find out about the game and it begins to hit a larger audience. Playing with the AI, though easy to get a victory out of, allows you to polish and attempt strategies to see how the random luck player would do against you, but I am dying to test out my strategies on other players and interacting with them in this environment. The chat features are somewhat limited, but considering just how cut-throat this game is, perhaps it is best that players are not allowed to rage at each other with harsh words and foul language. This game really is "you vs the world", and though sometimes it may seem like every other character is just bashing you, you can still win. If 3 players decide to pick on only one person, and trolls will be trolls, there is still the chance that one person can sneak into the castle and Kill the King. Hopefully, if they change the Rot Victory prerequisites, if one person is being bullied in game, they can get ROT and win!..(am out of space)","May 28, 2015","true","347.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The art style is beautiful, and most of the mechanics are thoroughly ironed out for an Early Access Game. I admit, some things need balancing and it is lacking just a tiny bit more stuff. (i.e. Stealth really doesn’t work well, and AI needs to be buffed/has to have an easy-medium-hard slider.) But the game is already very complex and complete, with 4 characters to work with (4 more coming when it is fully released), several rings/amulets to choose from, and 4 ways to win. That’s not including the dozens of items, spells, and treasure you collect from wandering the smallish map and battling opponents.\n\nThe price I feel could drop 5 dollars where the game is at currently, but it is still early access, and with the implementation of 4 more characters + the Ranked Mode, I would say it is a fair, balanced price at 25 dollars.\n\nA great recommendation from me!\n\n~Wolfy","June 10, 2015","true","8.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game is wholly playable, including multiplayer. It takes a moderate amount of time to finish, but it never feels too long or too short. Like Hearthstone turned real cards into a fun, digital game, Armello does the same with a turn-based board game.\n\nI do have some gripes about it, which is kinda expected from a game in early access. The AI difficulty is laughable and more often than not they manage to get themselves killed. I have yet to see an AI actually win a game. Having to play lots of games to unlock some of the content is frustrating, but thankfully the system isn't DLC and you don't have to actually win to unlock stuff.\n\nIn its current state, I would say it has a 7/10 rating.

This was the last one. He had everything he needed to break the curse that had nearly devoured his king. And it was just in time - the king's mind faded with each day, and before long he would be beyond saving.\nOn his way to the castle, Amber, the infamous gold-digger crossed his path - the ignorant fool! Couldn't she see that his task was infinitely more important than quarreling over riches? Mercurio felt little regret as he pierced her heart.\nTo make things worse, Thane, the lord steward, fell to the curse, too, and driven mad with the rot, he was battling his way through the king's guardsmen.\nUnfavorable circumstances forced his hand; Mercurio had quite the way with words, and a fat purse to emphasize his arguments. He claimed the title of lord steward just in time to sign a decree that rallied additional warriors into the castle.\nThe king was safe - for the time being. All that remained was to overcome another valley, another forest; and the ever-present Banes.\n\nIt was a rough journey, but Mercurio did not come so far to fail now; battered and bleeding, he stood before the palace gates at long last... imagine his surprise when the very guards he rallied to ensure the king's safety approached him, weapons at ready!\nWhile he was busy battling the Banes, Thane, the corrupted madman, had put a bounty on his head!\nThis was the moment of truth. Mercurio played all his cards, pulled all the strings; accompanied by a group of mercenaries, he cut his way through the royal guard and into the throne room, hastily applying the Spirit Stones -\ndespite the circumstances, HE DID SAVE THE KING AND ENSURE PEACE AND ORDER THROUGHOUT THE REALM!\n\n---\n\nThe point: this game is absolutely charming and magical, and the people behind it clearly love what they're doing and care for Armello.\nWorth every penny <3","July 18, 2015","true","51.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","After my sixth game, I think I have a basic understanding for how the game works. It is definitely worth the full asking price, and I can see myself playing this game for another 20+ hours despite the repetition.\n\nI'm by no means an expert, but I think I have a grasp on what are the game's sources of improvement (as well as misunderstood expectations from negative reviews). Hopefully these insights will be of use if you're undecided.\n\nIt's Like Civ But Not Like Civ\nEveryone I've seen describing this game has used at least one of the three comparisons:\n\nRedwall Series (anthropmorphic grim fairytale with some realism) + Game of Thrones + Civilization 5 = Armello\n\nWhile I would probably use the same base description, some aspects might mislead fans of Civiliation 5 by accident. Here is the simple answer to the question, "How is it like Civ?"\n\nLIKE CIV:\nIt has a hex-based grid system that generates maps for every game.\nYou get that "Just One More Turn/Game..." feeling in a good game.\nThere are political and warfaring tactics, along with other means (in this game magic), to improve your odds.\nYou make a small amount of moves per turn, each cultivating in the always potential victory or defeat through your own choices.\nGrinding certain units for rewards, i.e. the Barbarians. (In this game, the Banes and Knights.)\nEach character caters to a specific playstyle and has some personality.\nYou can start the game with small bonuses to stats. (Unlockable things here.)\nUNLIKE CIV:\nIt's not a 4X game.\nEach game (for singleplayer with AI bots) lasts 45 mins to an hour and a half.\nYou control only a hero, not a settlement and armies.\nInstead of hundreds of turns, the game works with nine days (a round for day and night; 18 turns total).\nCharacter animations cannot be disabled (and there's a gameplay reason).\nThe goal of the game is to take the throne in one of four victories. (GoT comparison).\nAlthough some characters might be better for one playstyle over another, you can win with any victory condition.\nRNG elements are in plenty.\nThat last aspect is the most important one. Although Civ has probabilities, you still had a lot of control over your actions; in this game it's pretty much the opposite. But you can always better your odds.\n\nFor example, ALL of the win conditions (whether for avoiding traps, fighting, or even achieving a victory) is based on some luck. You can influence your chances by improving your Wits abilities at the start for traps. You can accomplish  quests (goals to get improved stats, cards or loot) to improve your character. Or you can use cards you get every turn to better your luck or help you in the game.\n\nLike old RPGs/tabletops, the challenge is working probabilities in your favor for success.\n\nThe Balacing Act\nThe game has an interesting gameplay element: The King. Everyone is out to kill/banish him and retake the throne from his madness, which is essentially the basic storyline. Each day the King loses one-heart, which he can only regain from killing a corrupted player. You spend one turn to breach the walls, trying to break the trap; the next one to finish the King.\n\nRegardless of your choices, the King will die at the end, and the victor is the one who suceeds him.\n\nThere are one of four victory conditions:\nPrestige Victory (the normal victory) is when the player who has earned the most fame/goodwill with the King takes his place when the King dies.\nKingslayer Victory is when the player kills the King in battle AND lives to earn the throne.\nRot Victory is where a corrupted player, higher Rot level than the King, kills the King AND lives to earn the throne.\nBanish Victory is where a player collects four banish stones and gets to use them on the King, ridding Armello of the Rot.\nOut of the four, the Prestige Victory is going to be the main outcome. (4 out of 6 games I won with that outcome; the other two I lost due to the same reason.)\n\nTwo of the victory conditions require you to live from the battle, which both players can kill each other in combat. So if you kill the King and die, the Prestige Leader wins. (And if you attack the King, you lose your Prestige). The "good" option takes some time to gather the stones and you also have to get lucky to banish the King.\n\nMy take on this system is that there is a reasonable risk/reward system for going for the King. Because the odds are against the player living from the battle, it keeps players from bumrushing  on his last heart, while at the same time rewarding the player who does live to take the throne. (Many times I play the Hyena route; get on the King's goodside before becoming a cutthroat).\n\nThere are plenty of means to take away Prestige from the highest player--bounties, special cards, King decrees, constant deaths, etc.--all of which are due to chance. But they are plentiful to never seem like a game is hopeless. The King Decrees are an option for the Prestige Leader to choose that may benefit him or hurt everyone--you only get two bad options that display the King's madness of power.\n\nThe Rot system, while benefiting the most corrupt in battle with extra dice, takes away one heart every dawn. The magic system recharges at every dawn too to some minimum stat. Burning cards only gives you one assured stat for Perils (traps) and battles.\n\nThe rest of the game is centered on luck, but measurable luck, as you can put on equipment or followers for extra bonuses and play other cards for temporary buffs or set traps. (For better or worse, you can play these cards when it's not your turn, which is helpful when an enemy gets too close or you set a pre-ambush. This is why the game won't skip animations when it's not your turn.)\n\nHonestly, the luck system doesn't bother me because I still feel like I have lots of input in my outcomes. And every decision I make feels all the more impactful when it cultimates in a victory of my own doing... But not always of my own efforts.\n\nNeeds Some Tweaks\nFor starters, having the King's health-bar be customizable might extend gameplay without ruining the balancing act. As well as having more variety in maps other than locations of settlements, dungeons, terrian, etc., randomized and given a different seasonal change.\n\nI think nine hearts system is fine since I like the compact Civ feel. The maps, however, are way too compact. I hate having to quickly backtrack to recapture a settlement because some player recaptured it after respawning at home. Again, player customizable options would be nice.\n\nAlthough the characters do not determine your playstyle, some characters feel pressured into one or two routes without a lot of bonuses in the game. More character classes too would be great. (Currently there are 8; two from each clan.)\n\nFor example, Zorro the Rat cannot take damage, at all, and he's good for sneaking up on players (disabiling their card-burns) and getting bounties.The only way I can see him killing the king is for going for a Rot Victory to get more dice. But he'll need a lot more health to not die in three turns.\n\nI think these limitations will give seasoned players some edge in spoting tactics with the characters tropes.The typical, "Foxes are doing something cunning; pigs are being piggish; weasels are weaselly"kind of cliche for anthropomorphic characters. (Am I the only one who hates that?) I do like that tropes are a potential mechanic.\n\nAlso, being stuck with a crap set of cards is annoying if you can't burn them often. A discard option outside of perils or battles would be nice for those nothing turns.\n\nTry Your Luck\nI really wanted to talk about the gameplay storytelling, but I think the balancing and misguided expectations were more important to address. This is a pleasant, little surprise for 2015.","September 24, 2015","true","9.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelesteTsukino/recommended/290340/","CelesteTsukino","Celeste Tsukino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelesteTsukino/","67 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKickstarted this game a bit ago and while the art style is gorgeous I'm left hoping that they'll fix some major issues I have with the game when it hits full-release.\n\nCONS:1. The tutorial is lacking and always feels a step behind the gameplay. You get plopped into the game and it just sits there. I didn't know what to do with my cards, how I moved, how to fight...everything was confusing.  I've played these types of games before so I DID figure it out after a bit but it was still worrying that a tutorial didn't kick in and say "Oh by the way here's how you do this thing!"\n\n2. Win/lose conditions aren't entirely clear. This goes back a bit to the confusing turotial, but quite a few times I was left wondering how or why something happened. I defeated the king but also lost? I killed this player, I survived...but also died? There is probably something I missed in some dialog box somewhere explaining this, but as it sits now it just left me disgruntled, confused, and annoyed.\n\n3. The music/audio clues need work (This may seem a bit nit-picky, but I believe it's worth noting). I realize that this is a pre-release version, but as it currently stands the audio of the game needs work. I found myself getting bored from the game's repetition that it was honestly putting me to sleep at 4pm. When things happen in the game that is a big deal (dying, battles, monsters appearing) there needs to be a bigger impact on the game audio.\n\n4. The game is, quite frankly, boring. This is harsh, but it needs to be said.  Everything about this game LOOKS like it should be a fast-paced adventure game based on mostly skill and a bit of luck, but it mostly ends up feeling slow and repetitive. The enemies don't feel scary, your deaths don't feel like they mean anything, and most of the time I end up saying to myself, "I have no idea why that happened...what's going on?" Yes, with time I'm sure everyone can learn what is going on and why things happen, but currently it doesn't feel rewarding enough to want to continue on.\n\nPROS:1. The game is gorgeous.  No really, this game is beautiful. It's very obvious that the art team spend a ton of time working on the art for not only the game board but also the game cards. The GUI is beautiful and streamlines and everything just makes sense as to where it is on the screen.\n\n2. The gameplay is smart. While certain things I've mentioned before need work, once you actually get to the meat of the game it's pretty good. Draw cards to gain followers, items, spells, etc...but make the wrong decision and you may be missing a necessary item when you go to fight an opponent. You need to plan a few turns ahead of time to figure out if you want to hide, stockpile gold, or attack. It's not a new concept in games by any means, but it IS an interesting one.\n\nConclusionWhile still in pre-release stage, I'm fairly happy with the way it is progressing. No major game-destroying bugs to be found yet, the gameplay is smooth, and for something technically not finished it played extremely well. For all of the CONS I gave it I'm still very optimistic that the development team will work out all the kinks in the future and this will turn out to be a terrific game.","April 19, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If there is one or two things I would change, it's the battle system and a story mode for the single player. Sure some strategy is used to place yourself in a favorable position, but it comes down to luck when it comes to getting cards and the die rolls. Can't tell you how frustrating it is to lose to someone who has lower health but get an awful roll. I've played a few time, losses on my part, and I still go back to play more. Adding in a story mode will give more depth into the lore of the Armello world and maybe even discover a thing or two about the characters.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable, this is a game where you'll learn from your mistakes and try to get that win that you always want through prep before game start.

I've played many great graphical games but few have given me the kinda of thrill I had tonight on this virtual board game. As Thane (the wolf) I was locked into this epic duel with the king as we both constantly kept endlessly drawing each other other in attack versus defense with him down to one HP and me down to 2 WHILE fighting off rivals THREE times all in two turns! It was amazingly epic.\nThis game is really addicting but every game has its cons sadly. But there's really only 3 i can mention, so I will just name 3 of each of my biggest cons and pros.\n\nCons:\n-Short gameplay. Even "Epic" setting isn't long. I don't like that the king auto dies after a period of time. At least let him retain one HP or have an option to turn rot off on King or something.\n\n-Map can feel small. It has some random generation but 4 heroes + 2 - 5 kings guards and banes (or even more) all at once can make it feel congested. That means lots of battles, which can be hard on people trying to be more stealthy. It might be just my lack of experience so far, but it seems flat out battling with decent equipment is the way to go. Did a round as the Wolf and never died once with a defensive build while managing to kill off most people by sacrificing saved up cards for +damage rolls when I felt needed to.\n\n-Lack of customization. I don't think there really needs to be one but it would be nice if we could, say, create a custom with our own name of choosing, cycle models and pick the one we like most then pick a playstyle or something. Either way, implemented or not I enjoy the current characters a lot.\n\nPros:\n-Creativity. Man does creativity come into play or you could find yourself surrounded by enemies. It's not a bad idea to draw some spell cards or trickery cards to lower someones HP or find a way to make a quick getaway.\n\n-Battles can get intensive and the world change instantly. You can go from peaceful to people surrounded by banes and guards going after player bounties. I love the complete randomness of it! Even quests are never a promised reward.\n\n-Freedom and Politics. Politics can change the flow of the game. And I love going from being the prestigious kings right hand man to stabbing him in the throat the next turn for fun.\n\nIn the end, this game is amazing. It's random, can change in a flash, and when you get into it you can FEEL the struggle sometimes. Seriously, worth the pay.","December 31, 2015","true","38.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A flashy video game with the heart of a solid board game. A sweet coating of eye candy with dark undertones. The gravity of Game of Thrones blended with the charm of Redwall.\n\nGiven a casual glance, this may appear to be a strategy game or RPG, but make no mistake... this is truly a multiplayer board game experience in digital form. Expect much card-drawing and dice-rolling. All players take turns in succession. Complete games are fairly short, about an hour or less.\n\nIt's very tightly designed, trading unnecesary complexity for satisfying depth. Each playable character has its own unique strength. While waiting for your turn, you are able to choose quests and play cards, so the thumb-twiddling common in many board games is minimized. Breaking from strict physical game tropes, there is a modest amount of progression in the form of unlockable amulets and rings that grant bonuses.\n\nOn top of all this, it's very pretty, the character designs are delightful, and the animated artwork on the cards is just wonderful.\n\nIt is not without its faults, though. Randomness plays a very large role, especially since conflicts are resolved with dice rolls. However, you can "stack the deck" in your favor with equipment and followers, and by burning cards. Also, the AI tends to make some pretty silly decisions at times, particularly when it comes to attacking the king. I have not played public games, so I cannot comment on the general experience there.\n\nOverall, Armello is easy to recommend if you love board games with dice and cards, especially if you can play with friends. If you are not a board game fan, this is still worth a look for its uniqueness and fun multiplayer.","February 19","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has it's basis in board and dice games, and I found the learning curve pretty easy. The graphics and music are beautiful.\n\nIt has single player as well as online multiplayer. Each game takes roughly half an hour. There are 4 different ways to win suiting different play styles, fight (fight and kill the king, and live), Spirit stone (Gather 4 spirit stones. You don't have to fight anyone if you don't want to), Prestigue (have the most renown from completing tasks/killing banes or other heroes when the king dies) and Rot (one of the hardest victories for me.)\n\nI would definately recommend this game.","February 20","true","48.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/recommended/290340/","TacticalTruth","TacticalTruth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/","184 products in account","Armello: Haphazard Regicide\n\nEver wanted to kill a king? No? Oh… Well, ugh, this is significantly more awkward, isn’t’ it? I guess– er, you know, forget I said anything.\n\nSo…Do you like anthropomorphic animals? Yes? Cool! Well… Remember that murder thing I mentioned…?\n\nArmello is a pretty rad indie game that simulates a stellar board game experience. One that mixes elements from Table-Top, Pen and Paper RPGs, and a bit of MtG to make for a very unique experience. Armello is pretty simple to play once you get the hang of the game’s systems. But it’s fairly complex to explain… Despite a bit of a learning curve, this game is definitely worth the initial hump of “What the hell am I doing?”.\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty, the main goal of Armello is to become the new Monarch. The current King has been stricken with an evil disease called ‘The Rot’. And as you would expect, he’s not doing so hot. Every night his condition worsens, and every day he inches closer to death. The Rot also affects his mind, sending him into madness. I feel bad for the guy.\n\nNow, how does this relate to the player? Well, every win condition involves usurping him, either by waiting for him to die and taking his place. Or taking the throne through force. Heck, even the condition that involves purifying the King of his Rot kills him. So you need to get comfortable with the idea of regicide. Despite it’s appearance, Armello is a pretty dark and rough game.\n\nThe death of the King is the impetus, and the final goal, of your actions. Almost everything you do will revolve around this end goal. But the King is more of a passive piece on the board. He looms over the game, and carries out evil machinations, but never poses an immediate threat. What you have to look out for is the three other people all actively scheming, and advancing their own plots. You’ll be put in situations very regularly that involve you prolonging the King’s life in order to ensure you’re the one to end it. The enemy of my enemy and all that.\n\nThere are a lot of moving pieces in Armello. Four players all working towards a similar goal. With alliances and rivalries beginning and ending on a turn by turn bases. What might appear like help from another player is really just them protecting themselves. I’ll help you this turn to back stab you next turn.\n\nEverything might be going exceptionally well on turn three, but by turn four the entire board state has changed and you must re-assess. It pays to think ahead, and have a plan, but it is invaluable to be able to adapt. There were many occasions where I was one turn away from winning, only to have it slip away from me when the AI pulled a total dark horse victory out of thin air.\n\nHow is this possible? Well, every player has a wide array of abilities that can, when used creatively, be applied to completely ruin another player’s day. There are pieces of equipment that increase your prowess in battle– making it easier to kill the King… or anything else. There are magic spells that give nasty status effects, such as: ending your turn prematurely, move you across the board, or possibly even killing you. And my personal favorite, traps. These can be anything from poison, killing companions, stealing their cards or gold, negating their equipment.. the list goes on. If you think through your actions, and use everything at your disposal, you can send someone in the lead into last place with one turn.\n\nThe order you do things in, and how long you wait to do it are incredibly important. On your turn you, usually, have three action points that allow you to do the various things at your disposal. Some take more than others… Simply moving three spaces can wreck havoc on another player. Scattered around the game’s map are little villages. If you move your character through them they will pay tribute to you in the form of gold. Without gold you can’t perform certain actions. Having three turns worth of set up be ruined because you’re short one gold is incredibly disheartening.\n\nThe swings in Armello are fast and hard. I’ve gone from first to last and back more than once over the course of a game. It’s never dull, and never boring. The pressure is almost always on. And the games are fast enough that you can play one over a lunch break.\n\nAside from killing the other players, there are also quests you can embark on that give various rewards. Sometimes the rewards can be game winning. Other times they can be a massive disappointment. But you’ll always walk away with some kind of a bonus, like an increase in your stats and Prestige. If the King dies of his Rot, the player with the highest prestige is the winner by default.\n\nArmello really requires you to think, and demands a good bit a strategy. The games go by quick so your plans need to come to fruition sooner, rather than later. I find myself planning for the end game on turn one. “I want to win via killing the king”. And adapting my play towards whatever will actively further that goal.\n\nIt’s a good mix of long term and short term planning at the exact same moment. If you realize that things aren’t going your way, you need to adjust your strategy or risk losing. By the time you realize “things are bad” it’s almost too late. It’s as much about furthering your own ends, as it is interfering with everyone else’s. Because everyone’s position is so precarious, just a small bit of interference is enough to make someone target you the rest of the game…\n\n“If I can kill the bear this turn, I’ll lower their prestige enough that when the king dies two turns from now I can win.”  Or even better “Well… If I can’t win, you’re definitely not winning either.”\n\nArmello is a very mentally stimulating experience… And I’ve only played with the AI. So I can’t speak for playing with humans. I have to imagine it’s a hundred times better. But, that’s one of the best parts of Armello. The AI is actually very good! Now, once I got really acquainted with the game I was able to out play the AI fairly easily. But they’re still definitely capable of einschrauben mich über, hardcore.\n\nAnd on top of everything else I’ve mentioned here. The game has some seriously great artwork. It has a great storybook style to it that is simultaneously both lighthearted, and very dark.\nWatching a cute little rat solemnly hand over money to the king’s guards as they terrorize the townsfolk hits way harder than you’d expect. He’s not happy about it… but it has to be done.\n\nArmello is awesome. It’s worth every penny. Seriously, support the Devs. If you like strategy, check it out. If you have friends, and want something to play together that doesn’t require a large time investment– Armello’s your game.\n\nBuy it. I highly doubt you’ll regret it.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out 100HourSave.com for more.","March 1","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This is due to the fact that you can aim for a variety of different victory conditions. It would still be cool if there was a secondary game mode that was some other task than trying to deal with the king and his rot. This could also be an avenue for creating a game that lasted shorter. As it stands, the games take quite a while (not too different from a board game). Some people might not always like that, or have the time to sit down and play for that long. If there was a secondary one that went quicker, that would be awesome.\nSecond, just give me more Armello! More heroes, cards, quests, and all the like! I just love the game so much, having more content to it, even though it really does have a ton right now, would be so sweet!\n\nSorry for the long review.

It's intrigue. I've always wanted to get the feel of a board game, with dungeon master and so on. And this game sort of digitalized the real paper table game, and creamed with beautiful graphics, highly detailed environment and cute looking fluffy characters. For what it is, looking at the real board game now is less appealing anymore because they are all flat papers, decolorized statues, packed cards, tokens and have to calculate the maths yourself. And there's no special effects (unless the dungeon master got creative) like clouds, snow, day and night cycle. And since its automated, everything is running based on strategic skill and luck (rolling the dice). And I imagined having this feature sort of reduced the chance of players going against the dungeon master for "fairness".\n\nIn the game players can either choose to go against each other or form an alliance (sometimes temporary). The main goal is to win the game in the end. And there's only one victor. Though most of the time I would just go in, and enjoy the pretty graphic, killing the monster spawned, or simply annoyed the hell out of other players by setting traps all over the map (to loose some steam). XD The cards of items and spells are fully animated, and I would dazzle by each new cards drawn.\n\nThere is a downside to this however, the entire game Armello is still running on a board game system. It IS a board game in the end. While we normally won't have any feeling towards the little miniatures that we used to symbolize our place in the board, after looking at the cute, beautifully animated animals we control in Armello, it's hard not to develop any feeling towards it.  While the tutorial prolouge did give off some insight to the characters, I would really looking forward for more. Like how the characters would really interact with each other in some kind of RPG way. But that brings me back to my early statement. When all boils down to it, it is a board game after all (digital version).\n\nFor those who are looking to enjoy a board game experience with friends, ranged from 1hour 15 min to 2 hours give or take. I would recommend trying it out. It has pretty graphics and very cute looking animals in it.","February 16","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I've played many great graphical games but few have given me the kinda of thrill I had tonight on this virtual board game. As Thane (the wolf) I was locked into this epic duel with the king as we both constantly kept endlessly drawing each other other in attack versus defense with him down to one HP and me down to 2 WHILE fighting off rivals THREE times all in two turns! It was amazingly epic.\nThis game is really addicting but every game has its cons sadly. But there's really only 3 i can mention, so I will just name 3 of each of my biggest cons and pros.\n\nCons:\n-Short gameplay. Even "Epic" setting isn't long. I don't like that the king auto dies after a period of time. At least let him retain one HP or have an option to turn rot off on King or something.\n\n-Map can feel small. It has some random generation but 4 heroes + 2 - 5 kings guards and banes (or even more) all at once can make it feel congested. That means lots of battles, which can be hard on people trying to be more stealthy. It might be just my lack of experience so far, but it seems flat out battling with decent equipment is the way to go. Did a round as the Wolf and never died once with a defensive build while managing to kill off most people by sacrificing saved up cards for +damage rolls when I felt needed to.\n\n-Lack of customization. I don't think there really needs to be one but it would be nice if we could, say, create a custom with our own name of choosing, cycle models and pick the one we like most then pick a playstyle or something. Either way, implemented or not I enjoy the current characters a lot.\n\nPros:\n-Creativity. Man does creativity come into play or you could find yourself surrounded by enemies. It's not a bad idea to draw some spell cards or trickery cards to lower someones HP or find a way to make a quick getaway.\n\n-Battles can get intensive and the world change instantly. You can go from peaceful to people surrounded by banes and guards going after player bounties. I love the complete randomness of it! Even quests are never a promised reward.\n\n-Freedom and Politics. Politics can change the flow of the game. And I love going from being the prestigious kings right hand man to stabbing him in the throat the next turn for fun.\n\nIn the end, this game is amazing. It's random, can change in a flash, and when you get into it you can FEEL the struggle sometimes. Seriously, worth the pay.","December 31, 2015","true","38.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The moment I saw the trailer of the game I was hooked, in 1:30 it managed to get me excited for the game. I'm not going to talk graphics and such as each game that's being released nowadays looks great, and so does this one. As for sound, after playing a couple of rounds I grew bored with it, turned it off and putt on some Youtube. Not to say it was bad, but you know, you can only listen to the same song and jingles that many times.\n\nControls! Oh boy, I have a couple of gripes here. One being the cards being to close to your dice in combat and perils. Sometimes you roll dice when you meant to grab the last card to burn it, it's annoying. This is pretty much the biggest one, but there are numerous others. Camera resetting to a zoomed in position while you zoomed out, your camera being jerked everywhere when something happens, I think you get the idea, I'd say it's annoying, not game breaking.\n\nBugs! This game is great when you play it casually. When you're trying to get the achievements, not so much. I had it happen numerous times that I was going for an achievement and the game just froze, in the menu, between turns, rolling dice, for no reason at all. This gets really frustrating at times and makes me want to punch the screen.\n\nMultiplayer. There is one, but I'm not going to try it because of the above reason. And also because there are exclusive characters you could only get when the game was being kickstarterted. I'm not playing against characters I know nothing about, it's an unfair advantage and these characters should be DLC at some point, be it with in a different skin, or some other model, I'm sure there is some solution.\n\nShould you buy it? Well, the game is worth the money, I'm at 44 hours now and have yet to get all the achievements, and some of the other unlockables. If the devs first work out the bugs, tighten the UI, and level the playing field multiplayer wise it's a solid title worthy of your collection.","May 21","true","63.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mountain_Man/recommended/290340/","Mountain_Man","Mountain Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mountain_Man/","162 products in account","SummaryA gorgeous game that seems simple at first but has a surprising amount of well-balanced depth.\n\nReviewArmello is essentially a board game.  Actually, it’s a very complex board game that could only exist in any practical sense on a computer.  When developer League of Geeks created a physical prototype during development to hash out the gameplay, the result required two dungeon masters to keep track of all the rules and calculations, which I imagine made it a chore to play.  The computer, on the other hand, is an extremely capable dungeon master and is able to make the numerous calculations in a split second, so Armello matches are always fast-paced and fun.\n\nThe King has come down with a sickness called “rot”.  Every morning he loses one point of health, and every evening he gains one point of rot.  This serves as a ticking clock because the King’s days are explicitly numbered - eight, to be precise - so games can’t drag on forever.  A menagerie of armored and weaponed bears, rabbits, wolves, and rats make up the four heroes vying for the throne, and whoever has the most prestige points when the King expires wins the game.  Of course you can be more proactive and seek to claim the throne by killing the King yourself before he succumbs, or you can collect four soul stones and cleanse him of his affliction.  There is a fourth victory type which requires you to become corrupted with rot and then kill the King, but this is generally the most difficult victory to attain and therefore the rarest.  You know, now that I describe the premise, it strikes me as rather brutal, but this isn’t immediately obvious when the main players are adorable woodland creatures.\n\nPlayers take turns moving their characters across a small hexagonal landscape and playing whatever cards they happen to be holding.  You acquire prestige by completing quests, killing banes (bird-like monsters from the underworld), and killing other heroes who then lose one point of prestige and are resurrected at their starting point.  Whoever has the most prestige at any given point in a match has the King’s ear and can choose which of the King's edicts to enforce each morning. This gives the prestige leader a small advantage, but it's mitigated by the fact that the edicts apply equally to all players, including the prestige leader.  During a player's turn, they can explore dungeon tiles which use a coin toss to decide if players are rewarded with treasure or if they awaken a deadly bane, claim towns which give gold, encounter a variety of perils that use dice rolls to determine if you succeed or fail, set traps for other players with trickery cards, hunt down soul stones which periodically appear in the mysterious stone circles, and pursue player-specific quests to improve your character stats. While you might be tempted to sit back and simply watch other players make their moves, it's important to realize that you can still play cards to the board even when it's not your turn. In fact, off-turn play is an important strategy.\n\nWhen you first play Armello, you may think that a prestige victory is the surest and least risky, and this might seem unbalanced.  After all, you just have to keep your prestige total higher than your opponents’ and wait until the King expires.  But by its nature, this is the victory that also takes the longest to achieve which leaves a big opening for more aggressive players to storm the castle at the center of the board and go mano a mano with the king or cure him with soul stones.  The prestige leader also has a big target on his back and will be under constant threat of direct attacks and treachery.  It’s not unusual to see the “Prestige Leader” title change hands several times during a game, so a prestige victory is never a sure thing.  It's often best to pursue one of the other victory types while keeping a prestige win as Plan B.\n\nOne of the more curious aspects of Armello’s design is how the developers have gone out of their way to conceal information.  It’s impossible to zoom out far enough to see the entire board, and once you get a small distance away, your view becomes obscured by clouds and haze.  Basically, the developers allow you to get an overview of your immediate surroundings, but they actively discourage you from playing that way.  If you want to get information about your opponents, you can open a panel that covers most of the screen and then page through each hero’s status sheet one at a time which can be a little tedious.  League of Geeks has said they do this deliberately to discourage “metagaming” because they want Armello to feel more like an adventure than a board game.  Basically, you’re either doing recon on your opponents, or you’re watching events unfold on the game board, but you can’t do both at the same time.  I will simply say that I don’t entirely understand or agree with the developers’ reasoning here, but it’s not a deal-breaker.\n\nOne thing I can say without reservation is that Amerllo’s presentation is outstanding.  This is a low-priced “indie” title, but it looks like it came from a AAA studio.  The heroes are well animated and full of detail and personality, and the game board is a lush palette of gorgeous terrain and a lovely day/night cycle.  Then there's the various cards which feature beautifully hand drawn and subtly animated illustrations which put even Blizzard's Hearthstone decks to shame.  In short, this is one fantastic looking game.\n\nOne of the more unique aspects of Armello is the dice system.  Dice rolls are used to determine whether you succeed or fail a peril, or how you fare in battle.  And when I say “dice rolls”, I don’t mean an under-the-hood random number generator but physically simulated three-dimensional dice that bounce around your screen.  Depending on the situation, there could be as many as a dozen dice in play which can be quite entertaining to watch.\n\nMost importantly, Armello is fun.  Matches against the capable AI can be as short as 20-minutes if you enable fast AI turns, so there's always time for a game, or you can dive into multiplayer if you want a real challenge. I've seen people complain that victory or defeat depends on random luck, from coin tosses to dice rolls to which cards you draw from the deck, but isn't that the case with every board game, real or digital?  This is, of course, where player skill comes in, and there are various strategies for dealing with runs of bad luck.  It’s the skillful player and not the lucky player who will win.\n\nI think this is a good start for League of Geeks, and I could easily see Armello’s rich tapestry expanded into adventure games, RPGs, and even the 4X strategy genre.","March 27","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Suffice it to say that if you’re a fan of card games or board games you’ll love playing this game. It’s deceptively simple but still full of strategic depth that anyone of any skill level should be able to pick it up relatively quickly and find something to enjoy. I’ve only played a handful of games but each one was different from the last. You don’t always get the same cards and each character has their own unique abilities that make certain strategies easier or harder.

I don't think video games are becoming any less popular as a medium of entertainment, but the last couple years have seen an incredible surge in the popularity of board games. Remember board games? Those things you were forced to play with your parents once a week while they tried to coax out more details about your life in some poor attempt at family cohesiveness? Yeah, those.\n\nBut at the same time, not those. Maybe I just wasn't exposed to the geekiest possible board games when I was young, but I remember playing Monopoly and Scrabble and Life. Simple games with simple rules. But those games are nothing like what we've seen come out of the board game renaissance in the last few years. Games like Risk and Settlers of Catan (ok, arguably Chess was very much this type of game as well) set the stage for incredibly complex games like Arkham Horror, Dead of Winter and Legends of Andor, games so complex that many of them could be played cooperatively against the board rather than against each other, which is still a novel idea to this day.\n\nMuch in the same way that Hearthstone before it married card games and video games in a way that simply couldn't have been done in any other medium, Armello is very much a child of these two genres and it works very well...for the most part.\n\nThematically Armello acts as a sort of combination of the Redwall books - which, for the uninitiated, feature tribes of anthropomorphic animals living together in a fantasy setting - and a very watered-down Game of Thrones. The basic premise is that you are a member of one of four clans - the wolves, the rats, the rabbits and the bears - and the ruler of Armello (a lion, natch) has been taken by the rot, a sort of corruption that threatens to drive him to madness before it, eventually, claims his life. Your goal, then, is to put yourself in the best position to take the throne from him and ensure your tribe's ascent to power.\n\nGameplay wise, Armello is very much a board game at its core. You have a set number of moves every turn and you negotiate the map for resources including gold (to buy things, duh) and cards to empower yourself or snare up your opponents. You must win before the withering lion king's last heart of health wastes away. If no one has claimed victory before then, the person-er, animal with the most influence over the throne (measured in prestige) at the time of the king's death wins.\n\nCombat and other conflicts - like fighting your way through one of the game's many "peril" cards placed by other players or even the king to hamper your progress - is played out through rolls of the dice (many, many dice in some cases) in which you try to match symbols for successes - in combat, swords and shields for hits and blocks and in "perils,"trying to match different symbols.\n\nIn these ways Armello is fun but not especially innovative. It doesn't so much bend the "board game" genre like Hearthstone, in many ways, did with the card game genre, doing things that games like Magic: The Gathering, in its physical medium simply couldn't. But it does it competently and with a nice veneer of paint that wouldn't have been possible on a drab board with cardboard cutouts. And keeping track of all the numbers of modifiers and cards would be a much bigger hassle in a physical medium anyways.\n\nThe one thing that Armello does that, while not impossible, would at least be difficult and unwieldy in a physical product is the implimentation of the king's "neutral" forces and the universally-hostile "banes," creatures of the rots. While clearly an antagonist, the king is more mad than hostile and while he can be turned on players for various reasons, he and his Labrador guardsmen are more obstacles and nuisances than outright enemies. He can even be manipulated into helping you in various ways. The banes, meanwhile, are a constant, AI-controlled threat that add some spice to an otherwise standard experience.\n\nIndividual games of Armello are fairly short and it would be nice if there was some level of customization to mix things up more, adding health to the constantly deteriorating king to lengthen the game perhaps even additional map sizes to mix things up a bit. But overall, they are enjoyable and nicely paced to be played in a single sitting. Unfortunately, multiple game sessions tend to feel very similar with the only variation being how you choose to attain victory, which mixes things up a bit but I predict not enough to give Armello permanently-lasting appeal.\n\nFinally, the game can be played single-player or multiplayer. I haven't had a chance to play it with my friend yet, but I predict that multiplayer is the way to go. It can be nice to get a feel for the game in single-player mode, but the AI is easily delayed and duped. In the few games I've played so far, I've won primarily by letting time tick away and maxing out my prestige. The AI makes a bit of a clumsy attempt to claim victory but nowhere near the concerted effort a human opponent would. It almost seems to stumble around until the game is almost over and then say, "oh right, I actually have to try and win" before trying for the only victory criteria it can accomplish...one in which it has done very little to prepare for. The promised addition of a ranked mode is interesting but I'm not yet convinced about the competitive promise the game might have.\n\nAll in all, though, I've very much enjoyed Armello. If you like board games, you could do much worse.","October 14, 2015","true","13.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Each day, the King slips deeper into madness, issuing edcits that become increasingly unhinged to inconvenience the players as they quest across Armello, and each night The Rot twists him deeper into darkness, causing monstrous Banes to spawn from dungeons and roam the land murdering and pillaging as they go.\n\nThere are four victory types in Armello: heroes can win with Prestige by questing across Armello, slaying monsters - and each other - to win the favour of the people and be named the king's sucessor when he dies from The Rot. They can get a Wyld victory by finding the four Spirit Stones and using them to purge The Rot from the king, saving the kingdom from darkness. Or perhaps their motives are more sinister... they can storm the palace and slay the king for a Coup victory, seizing power by force - or they can embrace The Rot themselves, becoming horrifying monsters weilding dark magics, killing the king and devouring his soul to win a Rot victory and plunge Armello into darkness...\n\nTHE GOOD:\n* 8 Playable characters - 2 from each House - each with their own unique, game-changing ability, with more to come\n* Amazingly atmospheric sound design and music to help immerse yourself in the setting, with music that changes to react to what's going on.\n* Adaptive, atmospheric map - at night as stones are gathered fog rolls in over the moors, the sun rises and sets creating shadows and bathing the map in amber light before giving away to night in the Day/Night mechanic\n* 4 Story-driven Prologue missions to teach you game mechanics without cramming it down your throat - take about half an hour to 45 minuites to complete and leave you multiplayer ready\n* Dedicated multiplayer matchmaking system that quickly finds players - rarley have to wait longer than 5 minuites or so.\n* Preset messages to communicate with other players to keep things civil - each character has a unique "phrasebook" you can use to send comments to other players\n* Procedurally generated maps randomises the layout of Armello each game. Two tilesets - winter and summer - keep things varied\n* "Digital Board Game" mechanics are new and interesting, utilising the digital setting without just being a dry port of a board game - card art is animated, and the digital medium lets the game use things like stealth mechanics or asymmetrical information to give each player a different view. Dice rolling gives players a clear view of how a mechanic reached a decision without being overwhelming\n* In-game quest system to let players improve their characters over the course of a game, gain items and learn more about Armello.\n* Completing games as characters and in certain ways unlocks new "rings and amulets" that change how your character plays in future game - nothing broken, just different.\n\nTHE BAD:\n* Some heroes still seem a little lacklustre - in particular, Sana's low Fight score in normal combat makes her very weak compared to other heroes, even if her high Body score makes up for it\n* The Random Number Generator is a cruel and capricious god and often seems to have it out for the player - minor gripe here :P\n* Singleplayer mode is perfectly servicable, but the game was made for multiplayer - Singleplayer is literally just multiplayer mode with bots, and more intended for learning than long term play.\n* Certain game modes are much easier than other - Prestige victories are trivial, for example, while Rot victories are seemingly downright impossible in most games.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n* Fairly major sound glitches still present in the game, resulting in all that lovley music and sound effects being hidden behind a horrible crackly noise.\n* Settlements being terrorised creates a quite frankly obnoxious screaming noise that *won't go away until they are un-terrorised*, which is incredibly frustrating to have to listen to while you're trying to get there to fix it only to bounce off a dozen banes.\n* New character River's special ability seems to confuse the game at times, meaning that she can slay the king but the game awards a Prestige victory to someone else. This is fairly situational - you have to attack the king as River when he has 1HP, and not be the Prestige leader - but it's a common enough situation.\n* Local and Ranked multiplayer still non-functional at release. I understand you're a new studio, guys, but this *is* the release version...\n* Several issues fixed during beta have reared their ugly head again on release.\n\nOVERALL: A charming, very fun game with more positives than negatives - though that sound glitch *is* a big one. When a lot of your game relies on atmosphere, making it sound like a fat man is munching his way through a crisp packet in my left ear isn't going to do you any favours...","September 3, 2015","true","90.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It tries to be casual enough to allow the players to get into the game with ease, but tries to be complex enough not to let its mechanics become boring after a short period of time. The game tries to reach for a wider audience and as a competitive game it deserves one, despite some of the more annoying problems that the multiplayer has to offer.\nAs a newly born world and lore, Armello only teases the players with its potential leaving them wanting more. The story options are limitless and I can’t stop myself what a positive influence a story mode could have on this game.\nArmello has the enchanting atmosphere of a fairy tale with the brutal gameplay of a deathmatch and the tactical decision making of a strategy, but with its fate trapped in the cage that comes with small budget indie development.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Charming world\n+ Awesome heroes\n+ Lovely 2D animations, art style and UI design\n+ Great music\n+ Easy to learn\n+ Good enough mechanics to stay interesting for a while\n\n\nCons:\n- A small map with no configurations available\n- Victory conditions aren’t properly balanced\n- Slow multiplayer\n- No chat\n- The game is crying for a story mode\n\nRead the full review at:\nhttp://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2015/09/armello-review.html","September 22, 2015","true","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So multiplayer clearly has some issues, and while some of them (network problems and game-stalling bugs) can be expected to be fixed in the near future, others are more tricky.\n\nThe average multiplayer game lasts 1 to 1.5 hours, and you don't have much to do during your opponents turns and game events (King's Guards and Banes) - that is, 70 to 80% of the time.\nIt would be perfectly ok for a BOARD game, where you can chat with your friends/fool around/do some diplomacy, but it i NOT a board game (although feels a lot like one).\nYou even don't have an in-game chat, only pre-defined emotes.\n\nSome options to overcome this:\n- play with friends and chat in Skype/whatever\n- read Twitter/what you prefer during other players' turns\n- have a beer in hand (always helps)\n\nThat being said, I still enjoyed multiplayer to a certain point, and single player is completely OK (although can get boring after 10-15 hrs).","September 20, 2015","true","50.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The sole change I might suggest is doing something so that most games DON'T end in a prestige victory (the equivalent of the out of turns/highest points victory).

However, it seems the developers are so passionate about their project that they added some abilities and mechanics that were not present in the original board game.\nEven though the game is perfectly playable and enjoyable in the current early access, they are still releasing regular updates nearly every 2 weeks. Some of these updates introduce new mechanics and remake old ones, but the overall effect is an ongoing IMPROVEMENT.\n\nGraphics: Simple 3D graphics on the main map + animated cartoon characters. The animal characters remind me of the Disney version of Robin Hood... but even MORE charming. Don't be fooled by the cartoonish characters >> this game is suitable for all ages and has enough depth and variety that older gamers will definitely find it worth playing.\n\nSound: Once again, simple and elegant. The music complements the graphics and atmosphere perfectly. If you play this game, you will wish that they make a movie from it. I'm not kidding. The immersion is that solid. The main downsides here are a lack of narration and voice-acting. Some music tracks can get a little repetitive. Adding 2 or 3 more tracks would be great.\n\nGameplay: The game has a perfect balance of complexity and accessibility. It is easy to learn but also requires your constant attention if you want to win. You currently play against 3 other players in both single and multiplayer (4 players only). There are 4 victory conditions, all of which are related to the King's inevitable death. (as you may have heard, it's like a Disney version of Game of Thrones... except it is way better than the current Disney stuff)\n\nIn Early Access you start with 4 playable characters. Another 8 will be available in full release (according to the forums). They all feel unique and each is more suited to certain victory conditions than the others. And you can still choose your starting bonuses with amulets and rings, so there are plenty of combinations for you to experiment with. Replayability is very high and rewards you with unlocking a variety of starting bonuses.\n\nIn terms of strategy, the game is mostly about making the best out of what you have and holding on to your advantages. It is currently difficult to aim for a specific victory condition without getting lucky (especially Rot and Spirit victory). So ultimately, the Prestige victory is the most likely end-scenario, especially versus AI (who is not the smartest). Nevertheless, they recently made new additions to the Spirit victory (and added cards that will help you achieve it). So the end-game scenario is gradually being improved. I anticipate a well-balanced game at full release.\n\nOverall, this casual yet engaging experience is recommended for anyone who enjoys Strategy/RPG and wants something more relaxing than Civ 5 every now and then. This is also a great game for families. If you want to introduce your kids to Strategy gaming and play with them, Armello is perfect for the job even in Early Access.\n\nEarly Access rating: 7/10 - worth the price\n\nFor more details, check out my Let's Play below! (NOTE: my Let's Play is from BEFORE the "At Wyld's Will" update. The Spirit Victory has been changed after that update. Keep that in mind.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTNtWWK1m9k&list=PLP90♥♥♥lxXzg5NX8zdhXRvjRA2ysLazzf","May 5, 2015","true","44.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Suffice it to say that if you’re a fan of card games or board games you’ll love playing this game. It’s deceptively simple but still full of strategic depth that anyone of any skill level should be able to pick it up relatively quickly and find something to enjoy. I’ve only played a handful of games but each one was different from the last. You don’t always get the same cards and each character has their own unique abilities that make certain strategies easier or harder.

I don't think video games are becoming any less popular as a medium of entertainment, but the last couple years have seen an incredible surge in the popularity of board games. Remember board games? Those things you were forced to play with your parents once a week while they tried to coax out more details about your life in some poor attempt at family cohesiveness? Yeah, those.\n\nBut at the same time, not those. Maybe I just wasn't exposed to the geekiest possible board games when I was young, but I remember playing Monopoly and Scrabble and Life. Simple games with simple rules. But those games are nothing like what we've seen come out of the board game renaissance in the last few years. Games like Risk and Settlers of Catan (ok, arguably Chess was very much this type of game as well) set the stage for incredibly complex games like Arkham Horror, Dead of Winter and Legends of Andor, games so complex that many of them could be played cooperatively against the board rather than against each other, which is still a novel idea to this day.\n\nMuch in the same way that Hearthstone before it married card games and video games in a way that simply couldn't have been done in any other medium, Armello is very much a child of these two genres and it works very well...for the most part.\n\nThematically Armello acts as a sort of combination of the Redwall books - which, for the uninitiated, feature tribes of anthropomorphic animals living together in a fantasy setting - and a very watered-down Game of Thrones. The basic premise is that you are a member of one of four clans - the wolves, the rats, the rabbits and the bears - and the ruler of Armello (a lion, natch) has been taken by the rot, a sort of corruption that threatens to drive him to madness before it, eventually, claims his life. Your goal, then, is to put yourself in the best position to take the throne from him and ensure your tribe's ascent to power.\n\nGameplay wise, Armello is very much a board game at its core. You have a set number of moves every turn and you negotiate the map for resources including gold (to buy things, duh) and cards to empower yourself or snare up your opponents. You must win before the withering lion king's last heart of health wastes away. If no one has claimed victory before then, the person-er, animal with the most influence over the throne (measured in prestige) at the time of the king's death wins.\n\nCombat and other conflicts - like fighting your way through one of the game's many "peril" cards placed by other players or even the king to hamper your progress - is played out through rolls of the dice (many, many dice in some cases) in which you try to match symbols for successes - in combat, swords and shields for hits and blocks and in "perils,"trying to match different symbols.\n\nIn these ways Armello is fun but not especially innovative. It doesn't so much bend the "board game" genre like Hearthstone, in many ways, did with the card game genre, doing things that games like Magic: The Gathering, in its physical medium simply couldn't. But it does it competently and with a nice veneer of paint that wouldn't have been possible on a drab board with cardboard cutouts. And keeping track of all the numbers of modifiers and cards would be a much bigger hassle in a physical medium anyways.\n\nThe one thing that Armello does that, while not impossible, would at least be difficult and unwieldy in a physical product is the implimentation of the king's "neutral" forces and the universally-hostile "banes," creatures of the rots. While clearly an antagonist, the king is more mad than hostile and while he can be turned on players for various reasons, he and his Labrador guardsmen are more obstacles and nuisances than outright enemies. He can even be manipulated into helping you in various ways. The banes, meanwhile, are a constant, AI-controlled threat that add some spice to an otherwise standard experience.\n\nIndividual games of Armello are fairly short and it would be nice if there was some level of customization to mix things up more, adding health to the constantly deteriorating king to lengthen the game perhaps even additional map sizes to mix things up a bit. But overall, they are enjoyable and nicely paced to be played in a single sitting. Unfortunately, multiple game sessions tend to feel very similar with the only variation being how you choose to attain victory, which mixes things up a bit but I predict not enough to give Armello permanently-lasting appeal.\n\nFinally, the game can be played single-player or multiplayer. I haven't had a chance to play it with my friend yet, but I predict that multiplayer is the way to go. It can be nice to get a feel for the game in single-player mode, but the AI is easily delayed and duped. In the few games I've played so far, I've won primarily by letting time tick away and maxing out my prestige. The AI makes a bit of a clumsy attempt to claim victory but nowhere near the concerted effort a human opponent would. It almost seems to stumble around until the game is almost over and then say, "oh right, I actually have to try and win" before trying for the only victory criteria it can accomplish...one in which it has done very little to prepare for. The promised addition of a ranked mode is interesting but I'm not yet convinced about the competitive promise the game might have.\n\nAll in all, though, I've very much enjoyed Armello. If you like board games, you could do much worse.","October 14, 2015","true","13.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So is it bad? No...\n\nAs a strong believer in pre-production and heavy design in order to combat rng and give space to balance and skill, this game showed me new possibilities for luck and uses it in a way that hasnt really been seen in Boardgames before.\n\nMost decisions in the game, involve luck ( % ), however, it is post luck, as in, first macro decisions (where you go, what you do and so on) then micro decisions that will have luck mechanic. To illustrate: you gear your character, move him on the map and decide whether you want to engage in luck events or not. IF you do, then your gear, character info (relative to race, buffs, etc) shall weigh the outcome of the event, may it be a battle or some other encounter.\n\nSo luck serves as a weight to your moves in order to make the game more competitive and dense Strategically wise.\n\nFurthermore, the game uses really amazing Aesthetics to brush off unecessary intensity and soothe your experience, as a hot soup blow. So when rng does get on your nerves, you will barely notice it over the amazing music, illustrations and whole experience.\n\nThe only con to the game, is the amount of info you must attend to simultaneously. Meaning that, while it does have a good UI, it uses the fact it is a digital boardgame, to incert more information than anyone could possibly process. PLus, the learning curve is indeed steep and although tutorial process is connected storywise, it is still a dull process....\n\nAll in all, this game is really really good and worth cutting through the tough leathery learning membrane.\n\nOnline games are really intense but still manage to maintain the shoothing game's vibe. 8/10","September 13, 2015","true","20.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would give it a 7/10 though, few reason which I'll give below.\n\nPros:\n-Lovely Art Style\n-Interesting play style of the old hexagon rpg table tops\n-Animations are well done and fluid\n-Concept of the game is imagnitive\n-Multiplayer works well and tests your friendships (Who will help you or end you)\n-Interesting Game mechanics, from complete dice modification, to in game affect through choices.\n-Loveable and cute characters: I mean look a Barneby, He's so damn eager to bonk them.\n\n\nCons:\n-No game customization (You can't alter your map experience, each map is rerolled at a set size. Ways to fix this would be allow an option of multiple map sizes, with other game alterations)\n-Winning is single minded: You win by having the highest prestige, whether or not you have slayed the king or not. (Ways to fix this, Make prestige victory a draw breaker [both player and king die or king dies without a killing blow being dealt] I beleive the game could have alternative ways to win as well, fix the king, remove the rot from him, corrupt him fully, etc)\n-Restricted Character: The block on the additional bandit clan almost made me not buy this, and some of my friends refunded because of this. This is a good way to hurt player base when you have a purchasable game with locked characters, if the game was FTP then it would be understandable, or if they were purchasable from a DLC (Which would be a good idea for future clans as well, or adding them in as free updates)\n-Short: This game is short, if you don't love it, you'll get bored quickly.The map is as big as a small continent from Sid meiser's Civ games. Quests only go to about 5 or 6 (haven't counted persoanlly) before you get end game quest.\n","September 8, 2015","true","51.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Become king/queen. Your competeing with three other heros and the current king himself at times, to do just that. The way you go about playing is all up to you. Do you build up your character before walking right up to the king and kill him man to man? Or do you politicaly bide your time, gaining the king's favor and eventualy when he dies, the crown.\nThe board on wich you play is new every time. This coupled with the fact that there are eight characters currently (supposivly more in the future) means that each game can be entirely diffrent. I look forward to seeing what they do with this game.\nA note to the devs if only for the giggles, a playable vulpine character of any sort. Seriously, I will chuck money at that if I have to.

However, it seems the developers are so passionate about their project that they added some abilities and mechanics that were not present in the original board game.\nEven though the game is perfectly playable and enjoyable in the current early access, they are still releasing regular updates nearly every 2 weeks. Some of these updates introduce new mechanics and remake old ones, but the overall effect is an ongoing IMPROVEMENT.\n\nGraphics: Simple 3D graphics on the main map + animated cartoon characters. The animal characters remind me of the Disney version of Robin Hood... but even MORE charming. Don't be fooled by the cartoonish characters >> this game is suitable for all ages and has enough depth and variety that older gamers will definitely find it worth playing.\n\nSound: Once again, simple and elegant. The music complements the graphics and atmosphere perfectly. If you play this game, you will wish that they make a movie from it. I'm not kidding. The immersion is that solid. The main downsides here are a lack of narration and voice-acting. Some music tracks can get a little repetitive. Adding 2 or 3 more tracks would be great.\n\nGameplay: The game has a perfect balance of complexity and accessibility. It is easy to learn but also requires your constant attention if you want to win. You currently play against 3 other players in both single and multiplayer (4 players only). There are 4 victory conditions, all of which are related to the King's inevitable death. (as you may have heard, it's like a Disney version of Game of Thrones... except it is way better than the current Disney stuff)\n\nIn Early Access you start with 4 playable characters. Another 8 will be available in full release (according to the forums). They all feel unique and each is more suited to certain victory conditions than the others. And you can still choose your starting bonuses with amulets and rings, so there are plenty of combinations for you to experiment with. Replayability is very high and rewards you with unlocking a variety of starting bonuses.\n\nIn terms of strategy, the game is mostly about making the best out of what you have and holding on to your advantages. It is currently difficult to aim for a specific victory condition without getting lucky (especially Rot and Spirit victory). So ultimately, the Prestige victory is the most likely end-scenario, especially versus AI (who is not the smartest). Nevertheless, they recently made new additions to the Spirit victory (and added cards that will help you achieve it). So the end-game scenario is gradually being improved. I anticipate a well-balanced game at full release.\n\nOverall, this casual yet engaging experience is recommended for anyone who enjoys Strategy/RPG and wants something more relaxing than Civ 5 every now and then. This is also a great game for families. If you want to introduce your kids to Strategy gaming and play with them, Armello is perfect for the job even in Early Access.\n\nEarly Access rating: 7/10 - worth the price\n\nFor more details, check out my Let's Play below! (NOTE: my Let's Play is from BEFORE the "At Wyld's Will" update. The Spirit Victory has been changed after that update. Keep that in mind.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTNtWWK1m9k&list=PLP90♥♥♥lxXzg5NX8zdhXRvjRA2ysLazzf","May 5, 2015","true","44.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

A very beautiful game with a lot of care and craft put into it so far, but not without its problems.\n\nPROS:\n\n- The artwork is amazing, making even the humdrum activities like running into perils (traps set by other players or npcs) or picking out items sublime. This alone is worth the purchase IMO.\n\n- The blend between board game and computer game is carried out well. While on the surface Armello may appear to be an adaptation of a board game for computers, what with the map, the dice, the cards, etc., the automation of the game format allows complex rules and events to be streamlined in a way no board game could reproduce smoothly. It manages to be both casual and relaxed while still involving the players and suspending disbelief.\n\n- The graphics are not only serviceable but quite nice to look at. The aesthetic is strong visually, and there's very little clutter. The models for the characters and npcs are very faithful to the art.\n\n- The sound, while not spectacular, is pleasant and fits the thematic elements of the game nicely. After hearing the music over the dozen or so games I've played I can still say that it's not grating.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The price point of $25 is a bit steep if you ask me. Perhaps it's just because it's still early access that I feel this way, but for those of us on a tight budget it's a shame to have to hold off on purchasing such a beautiful game for want of funds.\n\n- Understanding that this is still early access, I can't help but feel that, after 18 hours of playing this game, it's starting to wear a tad thin. They do release updates fairly regularly, adding new cards and quests, but it is starting to feel repetitive.\n\nThere's only one game mode and right now only four characters. This means that every game of Armello will run pretty much the same way, with some variations. Apparently four more characters are coming with the full release (in fall maybe), but I'm not sure that even that will be enough to get me to invest another 18 hours. Generally the game follows one of three possible outcomes (prestige victory, spirit stone victory, or killing the king), with the same time limit every game based on the king's deteriorating health. Personal quests vary the game quite a bit, but often you can only get one or two done before the game's conclusion.\n\nI would like to see the introduction of optional modifiers. Perhaps options to extend the game, or perhaps team-based play could help the repetition. Or maybe different ending objectives, such as we see in Talisman, could improve replay value. Something like a bane-rush mode, where Banes spawn more rapidly, or where players work cooperatively to repel them.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThis game has its problems, but I don't hesitate to recommend it. Quite possibly the most beautiful game I've ever played. It plays to the strength of the board-game style while keeping things smooth and exciting with the speed of a computer game. However, don't expect to get it on sale before full release; the devs have specifically stated that they do not intend to put the game on sale any time soon.","June 15, 2015","true","102.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have played about 80 hours on the game and have probably unlocked all the rings, each game taking about an hour or so. I bought this game out of curiosity since the graphics were just amazing to look at. The sound impressed me as well. What I like about it is that it is a friendly game that doesn't have in game chat. It kind of hinders the social experience of the game but keeps it civil, instead having the built in text to choose from. This game has an interesting concept of having four ways to win which is rot victory, highest prestige, 4 spirit stones, and defeating the king. It's really fun how there are lots of ways to win and kill your opponents. There is a lot of strategy going on, such as skill cards, magic cards, and trap cards. You must go on with your quest while defeating your enemies and winning by one of the four victories. There is a lot going on in this game. The dice is also an excellent touch, since it allows you to click on it randomly which allows it to be fair aND challenging. Beware that although I do recommend this game, there are still more developments that should be made. Such as when the Internet connection is loss, you are automatically kicked out and cannot join the same game. Penalties for leaving games should be longer since it destroys the overall game play of having to play with AL players. Ranked matches are also not availible yet.

It is a wonderfully thought up board game, but developed to be played in a digital format, as a result it can do things that tabletop boardgames just can't. Players using stealth vanish from the board, there are neutral 'characters' who have their own agendas in game, the game itself is very carefully crafted and cleverly put together to be interesting and gets very challenging if you go online.\n\nBut all of this is secondary to the one thing that League of Gamers utterly nailed, and that is the theme. The aesthetic of Armello is a joy to behold, from the serene looking map and hauntingly simple but evocative background tunes to the cheery character designs and battle animations and card art that will make you want to stop and take the time to appreciate it from time to time.\n\nOkay, sure, the AI players are a little easy and finding a game online can be a little difficult depending on your time zone and when you're looking, but there is still development going on and content being added, with the Bandit clan DLC on it's way and recent 'the stranger' update shaking up the ruleset a little, it seems hopeful that we'll see some more expansions and further improvements to an already wonderful game.\n\nHighly recommended to any lovers of board games.","March 1","true","94.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is really a multiplayer game best played with a group of 3-4 friends. I can't say that I found it to be riveting, as at times it does seem to be somewhat repetetive in the way that it plays out, but nevertheless I have enjoyed playing the various characters, who each have their own strengths and strategic paths to victory, and the overall vista of the map.\n\nOne criticism I would really like to make, and what better place than here, is that there is an effect where somewhat transparent clouds obstruct your view of the map when you are fully zoomed out, I assume as some kind of 'atmospheric effect', but in actuality it is very annoying and I would prefer a crystal clear view of the board at all times, if it is available to me.","January 28","true","20.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Death isn't perminent or even the end, it's just a setback, so you have to plan properly for both combat, and spiritual stuff, and know when to use basically 'trap' cards. I highly Recomend this game, and best of all, no voice chat, so no annoying children screaming at you about the size of your ♥♥♥♥ or how they "pwnd" you, not even text chat, only default test gestures you can use!","May 12","true","14.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game is a real hidden gem; it's fun, it's cheap to buy, and it's still getting cool new stuff added to it.\n\nI enjoy the competition and wild unpredictability of multi player mode the most, but be warned: it's a turn-based game, and sometimes you get a player or two that is reeeeeeally slooooow at taking their turns, which really ruins the game flow.\n\nI think as time goes on, you'll be seeing mostly players who are pretty quick at taking their turns though. It's the noobs who tend to agonize and overthink their turns, somehow not noticing that the biggest factor is simply your dice rolls.  And once the current sale is over, I think we'll be seeing a lot less noobs.\n\nFor sheer fun, and cartoon animal silliness, Armello is a definite 10/10. And if slow turns get you down, there's always single player, which plays VERY fast. Almost too fast, because AI opponents love to try to kill the king and end the game ASAP. Make sure you're always #1 in Prestige ranking when you do single-player, cuz often the AI opponents aren't even close to being geared enough to kill the king and survive, so the winner ends up being the player with the highest Prestige.","May 20","true","185.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Great concept.  Reminds me of the old MB Dark Tower game, with some great dice throwing and card dropping depth that absolutely keeps the game creative without going to the depths of slow 4x games or too much to read otherwise great turn based games.  Don't have to worry about spamming multiple units here either, unless you like spam.  Just your charcter moving across the land questing, fighting, dropping stuff on the board for others to run into.  The only drawback for me is the devs have kept the graphics options limited to "LOW" only for now due to the graphic memory of my computer....wish they wouldn't have.  Other systems I am sure enjoy more eye candy.  GW2 Runs great on this machine by the way!  I have an iMac: 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7,NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 1024 MB...

( Kingslayer Barnaby)\n\nIf you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons mixed in with Game of Thrones, with a Dash of An American Tale. This Game is for you, the art is just a feast for the eyes. Each character is unique in both appearance and design. For a board game that encourages adventure, it is truly a unique experience. As I played hours as Barnaby, the Screwloose genius who’s pretty much a medieval MacGyver in brass armor and is a tan Rabbit. Using certain item combinations, I used my bag of tricks I outsmarted the guards and killed the evil king. The land is once again cleansed of evil. The age of oppression is gone, finally we took back our home! We must fight the evil, and this land is once again ours and we’ll see it wiped clean of the scourge of Rot Banes that has ruined Armello. Free from tyranny! Armello will see freedom. Let the other houses squabble while someone takes the initiative. I see Barnaby sitting on the throne after killing the evil king, bruised and battered, He remembers all those whom have given their lives to see him succeed; as he now contemplates on bring back the Armello to its former glory.\n\n( And This is my story when I played the game. This happenes everytime when I play this game online. It is just..I am a loss for words. It is unique in everyway and I hope to see more from this series)\n\nThis game is centered on killing the Evil King who’s ruled the land for far too long. He is plagued with the disease known as the Rot, a sickness that turns the characters into crazed killers, as it corrupts the mind and makes them into shadows of their former selves. Combined with political treachery and betrayal from the other houses, you cannot trust anyone in this game, not even your own house! It is a mad dash to the throne, whatever way possible. Cure the king, but in doing so he dies. Or challenge him to a duel. become a kingslayer that killed the mad king. You can even go the political game and gain prestige, by gaining the peoples approval. However you can go to the darkside and kill other players and become corrupted with the rot, sending Armello into eternal darkness. You have the power to do anything, just make sure it is the right one. This game is not perfect but it is a good start. I want to see this series grow into something wonderful.","September 11, 2015","true","449.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Perhaps I'm not understanding everything yet, but success or lack of failure rather, seems to boil down to minimizing attrition, because unless you have substantial gear/followers,  you are very suseptable to to being killed in one encounter.  This is due to the variability of dice/cards and the numerous modifiers within the game.  Even at full health, with some good cards, your not safe. This makes early game survival critical as heroes are going be getting sent home frequently.  Making matters worse is the variability of the cards and drawing a hand full of cards you cant use.  Sure, you can burn uneeded cards and lock rolls, but I seem to need to do that far more frequently than I'd expect.  Its easy to get discouraged when, no matter what you do, no matter what options you choose, there is little chance of success, and no real option other than restarting.  This makes the prospect of online match-made games pretty grim, as players will quit in the first few turns as soon as someone has a clear advantage.  Perhaps I just suck and don't get it yet, but before they dumped money into the beautifull, triple-A assets,  they should have playtested the crap out of the game in a physical version to expose what feel like game ballance issues.  On the otherhand, I'm going to continue playing, becuase it's presentation is so slick, I'm optimisitic the frustrations I have so far are just because I'm no good.","September 4, 2015","true","15.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It looks beautiful, the world is rich, and the gameplay is that quintesential "simple to learn yet difficult to master" style I love. Best of all, every game can be drastically different from the last, and they all end within 45-90 minutes, even if they are multiplayer. I find this a refreshing session time for a strategy game, as opposed to the endless and sometimes arduous hours I've found myself devoting to other titles. This is especially important when it comes to multiplayer, because unlike other turn based strategy games whose time commitment to multiplayer seems to span far into the next century, this game can be won or lost in the time frame of an hour or two. This amazing quality removes the drudgery that has bogged down other strategey game experiences I've had with friends, and allows me to enjoy the thrill of cursing them incessantly as they stab me in the back with wanton disregard for the future of our relationship. This is fantastically juxtaposed by the aesthetic style presented, letting the players watch these almost Disney-esqe animal archetypes vying for the throne in the most machiavellian of ways. I highly recommend Armello for anyone who enjoys boardgames, but hates when they take forever and therefore stop being fun. Armello's comparatively short and sweet nature guarantees a freshness that will keep you and your friends playing for a long time, but only because one more game couldn't possibly hurt.","September 15, 2015","true","93.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

(Excluding some wyld die explosions)\n\nThe game is quite versatile, it has 4 different victory conditions, a robust cast of characters and each also has further customization options with rings and amulets that makes each one of the very vast number of possible combinations feel unique and it changes the playstyle quite a lot, making each game feel (and play) differently.\n\nThere are a few parts to touch on however, even if the game has a huge amount of character customization it lacks settings for the game itself, unable of setting a longer or shorter duration of the game (by modifying the initial health of the King) or even changing the size of the map.\n\nThe single player game while it's (very) fun you won't find any difficulty modifiers, so if you're looking for a challenge I'd suggest you to play with friends who have experience with the game instead. The AI controlled units are decent, after a few games you can start predicting their patterns if you pay attention to their moves, also sometimes they make some very questionable (or well... just plain dumb) decisions so there's that.\n\nWith all this said, right now it's early on the game's life and so far I'm amazed by every aspect of it. Can't wait to see what else LoG will do with this gem.\n\nI hope this review is helpful to you.\n\nI give this game 8/10 in its current state, seriously consider buying and playing it with some friends.","September 18, 2015","true","52.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is a very polished and enjoyable game. That said I do have some things that bother me about it.\n\nIt becomes slightly tedious watching each other players' turns at the same speed as you take yours and the veiw limitations of the game board seem strange when veiwing through a large monitor. This essentially means you are spending 3/4 of your time playing the game watching your opponents (if you can see them). While it is valuable that you pay attention to what your opponents do, sometimes it becomes a chore. The other issue is how the board will not allow you to zoom out and see more of it, and when you try it becomes blurry and unfocused. This gives me a sort of magnifying glass feeling when trying to look at the board as a whole.\n\nI am eagerly looking forward to any DLC or changes that they make to this game to improve on these faults and polish this gem of a game. If the Developers are reading this, I humbly suggest adding more characters/clans and customization to the player.","September 14, 2015","true","22.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Armello is a grand swashbuckling adventure that combines three styles of play; The deep tactics of card games with the rich strategy of table top board games, combined with a character role-playing system.\n\nAs a hero from one of the clans of Armello, you'll quest, scheme, hire agents, explore, vanquish monsters, cast spells and face off against other players, with one ultimate end goal in mind — storming the palace and becoming King or Queen of Armello. The Kingdom of Armello is as dangerous as it is beautiful, perils, banes and bandits hide around every corner and a spreading corruption known as the rot is leaving no creature untouched.\n\nArmello is League of Geeks’ attempt to revolutionise digital board and card games, whilst providing players a rich world within which they can craft their own stories of epic adventure. The aim was to create a rich game full of backstabbing, close shaves, shattered alliances, ruses and empty promises - a perfect game to play with your friends. - Highly Recommended!","September 15, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Do I recommend this game? In some ways, yes! I love the game. I love it too much. I've been involved with it from Day 1 back on Kickstarter. I love the art and the premise and I feel like playing it every day.\n\nHowever, here are the reasons that I have uninstalled this game with a heavy heart:\n\nI've played several games of Armello, some multiplayer and some single player (Note: more than what Steam quotes, as I have a different version from Kickstarter). The major flaws at this point are evident. One, in every single game I have been able to finish, the game has been won by the Prestige Leader. Every other victory condition is unbelievably hard to attain and I have never seen it done. As noted in a previous review, getting stuck in an endless cycle of dying and restarting is rampant and extremely difficult to break out of, which leads to the game timing out before anyone can achieve anything. In literally every game I have played, I have set out with the intention of winning with Spirit Stones, and while I have no problem getting enough of them, getting to the king is impossible with this endless cycle of dying.\n\nNow, onto more clerical problems. In each game I have played (literally every one), something or a lot of things have gone wrong with the running of the game. In two or three, my Gold counter has gotten stuck at a certain number and I have no idea how much I have to work with. I don't know if it is logging my newly acquired Gold, but when I try to use a card, it will always tell me I cannot afford it, despite sometimes saying I have 12 Gold even. I have run into a couple of games where it will freeze so to speak and the characters are just in a constant loop of "fighting," but the game does not progress. This has been documented by two of my Steam friends as well. Two or three times, I have had friends kicked off the server and the game has been restarted automatically. The gameplay and music/sound effects often lag (like, almost always) and are choppy (even with turning down the resolution, shutting down all other processes on my computer, and changing to a more powerful computer). I have had a couple instances when playing multiplayer that a countdown clock will never appear on the player screen, or we will be stuck in an "all-ready" screen with nothing happening.\n\nWhile attempting to play with my friends, they are asking: "Is this game in early access!?" Unfortunately, it kind of feels that way. The minute a patch is released to fix these gameplay issues, I will be re-installing this game, because it is honestly my love right now. My recommendation is that you will want this game. Hard. But right now, maybe it needs a pass for a little while.","April 9","false","5.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrostyWinds/recommended/290340/","FrostyWinds","Frosty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrostyWinds/","193 products in account","I want to love this game, I really do. It's just that it's held back by absurdly clunky UI, lack of graphical options, and the fact that stat-boosting items are progression locked for some inexplicable reason. While the game's atmosphere and its core mechanics are interesting, it's just bogged down by its appalling execution. There is a strange lack of borderless windowed in the video options and there is no way to turn off the clouds above the game board if you try to zoom out. There isn't even a way to look at the whole board, nor does the in-game UI give any at-a-glance information. Instead, you are stuck clicking in and out of menus just trying to keep track of each player's information.\n\nThe gameplay itself is incredibly boring, even by board gaming standards. Eighty percent of the time is spent waiting for things to happen, only interspersed with several seconds of dice rolling, reformulating strategy, or watching the AI take its turn. Even the amount of RNG in the game is exceptionally high. While granted, there are several ways to reduce the RNG required, the sheer number of times it comes up-- spawning enemies, loot tables, King's choices, perils, dungeons-- puts it way over the top. The card decks are heavily watered down with seemingly no copies of cards, meaning that the chance of drawing specific cards in order to avoid RNG or simply be useful are slim. The only way to remove useless cards from your hand is to blindly charge into perils or combat in order to 'burn' them.\n\nIf you want a strategy game, look elsewhere. If you're into dice-rolling and short trips to your local Taco Bell but can't afford to play Warhammer 40k, then this is the game for you.","May 26","false","5.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The game reminds me somewhat of a game of Risk but while having it's own set of rules, gameplay elements and identity.\n\nI am not a huge fan of these type of games but playing Armello in short bites ( 1 or 2 games depending on how long the matches are ) really makes want to comeback the next day and play another match or 2.\n\nAll of the designs are lovely and feels alive with the little animations on the cards and in combat. Music is fantastic as well.\n\nWith the devs actively looking for feed back and with more content on the way, i can safely say that Armello is a game worth to be explored.","December 10, 2015","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Uh. Not sure how that's -exactly- relevant? But it is. Armello's been an amazing experience that I'm trying to currently push on my friends. To note: This -is- basically an videogame boardgame, but it's super fun, and the animation is smooth. The tactics are varied and interesting, and there's a lot of room for risky play. Anyways, I'm probably more coherent when I hate a game. It's hard to praise a game as much as I have, so I'll get to the cons:\n-There's only one game board.\n-There's a pretty small character selection.\n\nThat's uh, about it. That and turns can take a little long, but that's okay when you're doing singleplayer anyways, because you can just turn on quickturns. I'd really love it if the developer considered DLC addons for maps and characters. I would definitely buy both. I'd be happy to support a developer that's made a wonderful game like this, anyways.","November 27, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a unique hybrid that has elements of board games and strictly PC RPGs.   It is not a couch party game (at least not yet) -- not sure if it would work or not since it has a stealth element.  Controller support in-game is nice for SteamOS (though you can't  navigate menu yet).  I think it is a better version of Wizwar or Talisman (more stratedy and ways to win) though there is still some luck/badluck that can frustrate or make you jump for joy.\n\nOverall, I have tried many Early Access games and many seem to progress very slow.

There are some quirks to it but that's quickly overshadowed by all the fun you have playing the game. For starters:\n\nThis is a turned based game that has a lot of cool mechanics which are and are not limited to:\n\nMana usage - Cast spells on opponents during your turn and on someone elses turn (can't target players that is taking their turn)\nMoney usage - Funds the perils and trickery cards which turn the battle for Armello in your favor\nPerils which are traps\nDifferent character types and abilities for each of the clans united by the King\nA generator map that is different everytime you play it.\n\nThis game is really fun but the core of the game is how you're suppose to win. There are 4 ways of winning the game.\n\n1. Win by Prestige. Most common winning method by my experience. You pretty much do good deeds and kill enemy heroes and banes. You can also complete the quests.\n2. Win by King Kill. Go into the Palace and kill the king to win the game!\n3. Win by Spirit Stone. After stepping into the Palace, you can win instantly by exiling the king.\n4. Win by Rot. Compete against the King to whoever is the most corrupted. You gain additonal die for having a higher rot score.\n\nThere are different ways of playing the game, but why don't you buy it and try it yourself? It's 20 bucks and well worth the amount of money being put into the game.\n","October 5, 2015","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Both the 8 year old and the 18 year old in me are giddy with joy!\nSo to start I'll sum up what is generally not well liked by pretty much everyone and get that out of the way. Firstly, nearly everything in this game is in some way randomly generated. I could explain the systems and what I think were the design choices that led to the extreme amount of RNG in this game but it really isn't worth the time. Suffice to say that the one consistent element in the game is the number of tile you can move on a given turn.\n\nThere have also been what I see as contradictory complaints about the game being too long to be fun and too short to be playable. I fundamentally disagree with both of these assessments on the grounds that A) I have only had difficulty achieving one play style after less that a days worth of play and B) a game will last you less than an hour to complete when something like irl Dungeons and Dragons will take like three just to get from town to town and a grand strategy game like any of the Civ games can take multiple days to finish on lengthier settings. And to be clear, I mean the game will take less that an hour because the game has what is effectively countdown clock built into the game with the way that the king (the victory condition in this game) works. Basically, the game ends when he dies and he is already on the way out the door by the time the game starts.\n\nSecondly, There is, at this time, not exactly a wealth of content available. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU WILL PLAY THE GAME ONCE AND BE DONE WITH IT. What it means is that there is effectively one game mood and one map. What keeps the game fresh, in my opinion, is the very randomness that some people seem to distain. From what I have seen on the forums accessed from within the game, they are still actively working on bring more playable characters into the game and genuinely seem interested in improving the game with time. As for maps and game modes, I haven't seen any developments of note. In my personal opinion, the game is well worth its price as is but that is a very personal evaluation I leave up to you.\n\nIf these are concerns for you, you may wish to avoid this game, at least for the time being.\n\nOtherwise, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS AN ABSOLUTE JOY.\n\nThe art is lovely in a way that I won't even attempt to describe. It manages to be both whimsical (prob mispelled) and sufficiently, well not exactly bleak but fitting for the sort of dark fantasy game that they were going for.\n\nThe RPG elements, which I admit are a tad simplistic, are very rewarding if you take the time to read the in game text, consider you actions through the lens of you character, and put in the smallest effort to care about what your doing. In short, use your imagination for 5 seconds. Its good for you. There is some RPG style progression and a wealth of collectables of extremely high quality (such as animated cards that you unlock for viewing after being played) and trinkets to change the way each kingdoms champions play after you have used them multiple times.\n\nI personally love the gameplay. Note that I say this as someone that plays Dungeons and Dragons semi-regularly and has absolutely no problem waiting for 15 minutes while Sir Mixalot (actual name of friend's character) makes a decision as to what song he is going to play and then roles like thirty dice just to see if it all amounts to anything meaningful. Yes, it is undoubtably slow as a result of there being no way to skip the AI's turns and it is most certainly very random. However, it is not the total cluster that some of the negative reviews might lead you to think. Each character has certains stats at which he or she is better equiped to use. If you pay attention, you might even pick up on the fact that each of the 4 kingdoms is designed to be better at a certain type of victory condition, of which there are 4. And when I say might have noticed, I mean play throught he tutorial up until the point where the game literally tells you which victory each of the AI players are going for and which you should aim for. If that wasn't a big enough clue, maybe just put on your thinking cap an realize that trying to win a game by killing a lion as a rabbit is probably not the best course of action. It's a lot like rock, paper, scissors except this time with "fatal" consequences.\n\nAlso, not that this is the biggest thing to note, but the music is very pleasent. I'm not talking like Bastion levels of amazing or even Skyrim levels of IS THIS EPIC ENOUGH FOR YOU. It's more subtle and relaxed in a sort of "what if Game of Thrones didn't make you have an minor heart attack everytime you watch" sort of way (note that I do realize that a great deal of GoT is just people talking at each other and not all that eventful).\n\nONE LAST WORD OF CAUTION: I do think that a large part of my personal enjoyment of this particular game comes from the theme and setting. When I was a younger, I read a great deal of the "Redwall" series by Brian Jacques that I mentioned at the beginning of this review. It is in no way an understatement to say that these book made me love to read. I can really explain what it was about them as a whole that I responded to but I know that, by shear virtue of the easy parallels between the books and this game, that Armello stirred within me many of the emotions and affections that struck me as a child while reading the collective works of Mr. Jacques. If you, like me have any fondness for those book I highly recommend giving this game at least a cursory glance before passing it up. If you don't then go read any book from the Redwall series right now, or at the very least keep them in mind if your looking for something to gift to an 8 to 12 year old. I say all of this as an admission of bias. Please do take it into consideration.\n\nSo to sum this whole thing up, if the idea of midieval furry simulator 2015 sounds the least bit interesting to you, give this a chance.\n\nForgive any spelling or grammar error you might find in this thing. I wrote it at 1 in the morning.","September 25, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Even better when they're so close to winning)\n- Then get sabotaged in return (Sucks when you're so close to winning)\n- Dice rolls, mhmmm, don't even let me start on that. Unique but still partially dependent on your luck xD (RNG !@!%@!)\n\nAdditional stuff:\n- I do get this weird rough-ish sort of sound in game and sometimes it gets a little annoying (not that it affects the entire gameplay anyway).\n- Game might be still a little buggish (or maybe it's just my PC's issue x.x) but developers are quick to respond xD.\n\nTLDR;\nGreat game, should try getting it if it's on discount if you feel the price is a bit eheh. Not that type of game which you can play for 5 hours straight, a game or two a day with friends makes it all the better xD. If you're not the board game type of person, might not be entirely worth it to get it at full price but it's a great way to spend time with friends, so do give it a try :D\n\n9/10-ish.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceekur/recommended/290340/","Ceekur","Ceekur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceekur/","478 products in account","Armello is a mostly turn-based strategy game played with up to 4 players. Your ultimate goal is to overthrow the Mad King and restore peace to the land. Or rule over it with an iron paw; this game isn't about what comes after, but the hard-fought journey to it. It is a fresh take in the turn-based genre, where you don't simply go from point A to point B and finish first. You must use this strange land as a tool to build up and achieve victory through combat, magicks, or trickery (usually a combo of all three!). Each player chooses a hero each with their own passive ability and allocation of stat points. Afterwards, you choose a ring, granting an ability based on what clan they hail from. Then an amulet from a shared set that can boost a stat by 1 or make a particular victory condition slightly easier to obtain.\n\nDice appear in combat and perils (traps that require the dice to match symbols), where you either hit, miss, or defend. Each shield blocks one hit, where misses are 33% likely, hits are 50% likely, and shields are merely 1/6 likely. Attacks are resolved at the same time, so mutual kills can often happen unless you were geared up defensively. I don't feel this is a flaw exactly, just a design that requires player understanding and adjusting accordingly. However, you can guarantee certain dice rolls by burning your cards, matching its symbol on the top-right.\n\nCard decks are used whenever you start your turn and draw new cards up to your Wits stat. You may choose from Items (healing, equipment, movement), Magic (stat buffs, teleportation, peril spells), and Trickery (traps, resource stealing, sabotage). While you are free to pick, your ideal choice lies with your character, position on the board, and time of day. Almost nightfall and you still have some magic? Draw a spell and use it up before you receive more for free. Have a lot of settlements under control? Draw trickery and take advantage of your discount per owned town.\n\nI say it is mostly a turn-based game, in that you can play cards during other player turns. You can equip items to prepare for a potential battle, use buffing magic cards, play perils on the board, even teleport off-turn. While you cannot use a spell directly onto a player currently moving, you can still place traps in their way. Overall, this is the best time to modify or cement the strategy to be used on your next turn, rather than always being bored waiting for the three other players.\n\nThe "rule of four numbers" is a reoccurring theme in this game. There are four hero clans: Wolf, Rat, Bear, Rabbit; and you must always play with 4 players, even if the remainder is AI-controlled. There are four main stat points: Fight, Wit, Body, Spirit. There are four "resources": Gold, Magic, Prestige, Rot. There are four ways to win the game, and you must keep all of them in mind to hinder the other players' progress while slowly reaching your own under the radar.\n\nEach player starts in their Clan Grounds and have 3 movement points to use on the board, which itself is divided into different hexes. Each hex is a particular terrain type which may help or hurt you or your enemy from their current goal. This is an important distinction from other board games: CURRENT goal. Maybe you need to finish a quest to get another stat point, maybe you need a couple towns under your control for gold next dawn, maybe you're hunting a monster (Banes) or another player for more Prestige. None of these actions is a direct victory action; you are building tools and resources to aid you in reaching victory.\n\nThe map is not very big, but the land of Armello is a dynamic, living entity that is randomly generated each match. During the match, perils, hazards, and enemies will move around or be added/removed by player actions and influence. As the King is slowly dying each day, there is a time-limit for the players to work. You may win by Prestige where you inherit the crown after the King passes. You may collect 4 Spirit Stones to banish him after you breach the palace grounds. Or you may throw down the gauntlet and use brute force to combat him directly. OR take to the dark side and show just how corrupt one can get before facing him.\n\nYour stats help you combat the hazards in the game. Body is the simplest stat; it is your max health. Fight almost always determines how many dice rolled in combat. Your Wit determines your maximum cards drawn at the start of your turn, your dice if Evading in defensive combat, and rolled dice in some perils. Your Spirit is how many magic points you are balanced to each nightfall and how far you may cast a spell from your character, and your dice against magical perils.\n\nThe presentation of the game is fantastic. Every character model is sharp and inspired, with a colorful fairytale-esque aesthetic. Shadows cast across the land based on the time of day/night. Beautiful animated art is on every card in the game, even viewable in the gallery. The idle animations are done well for each hero and fit their personality. They play a "boast" animation on certain conditions, such as on killing their combat target or finishing a quest. Even Guards, Banes, and the King himself have subtle animations that follow these same rules!\n\nArmello is visually designed to feel alive during a match, and when everything comes together, I really get that feeling. Instead of a static board, it is a living world that we adventure in. The developers have invested a lot into polishing this game, and it shows. The music is excellent and further immerses one into its world, covering the right moments of atmosphere, tension, and drama. Hearing more about our heroes in the future would be great. However the lore is provided indirectly through guides and stories that won't immediately be visible during matches. Quest logs do explain what your character is going through to get the throne though.\n\nThere is a good amount of randomness to the game, which may turn some players off, as they are expected to be strategic in a game where fate keeps dealing you the wrong cards or combat dice rolls came out poorly despite beating all your opponent's items and stats. Nonetheless, each player can manipulate the situation to best be on top. Try not to end your turn near a dungeon if night is coming and you cannot handle combat if a Bane were to randomly spawn from it. See if you can afford to go around a peril if you aren't prepared to (literally) roll with it. Don't always choose Risk on quest rewards. Don't make enemies too early just because you can. Ultimately, you are your own ally and alliances are temporary - Finding balance between risk and reward, and having a Plan B are key in this game.\n\nThe developers are still looking towards future updates and game balance, and are occasionally tweaking different cards, items, and elements. It's a very polished, visually-pleasing game to play that takes 60-90 minutes once you know how to play. Deeper down, there is a lot of replayability to be had if given a chance. Even now, there are elements of counter-play involved when choosing a character. Playing against Thane, the sword-crazy wolf who can passively cause armor-piercing attacks? Play a spell-caster or Zosha who can Ambush at night. In a match with multiple spellcasters try a Witty character and focus on a non-combat victory while countering with Trickery. With four players, there is never a true counter-class to everything, meaning your best skill is improvisation and never surrendering even if you were killed and sent back on the final day.\n\nI have really enjoyed my experiences with the game and encourage others to give it a try. It mixes a board game formula with a very lively aesthetic and dynamic gameplay, pushing you to think ahead about What Ifs, threat priority, and resource management. Don't let the random elements be a turnoff, enjoy the potential the game has to offer, and ultimately play in your way that lets you have fun.","January 6","true","172.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some quirks to it but that's quickly overshadowed by all the fun you have playing the game. For starters:\n\nThis is a turned based game that has a lot of cool mechanics which are and are not limited to:\n\nMana usage - Cast spells on opponents during your turn and on someone elses turn (can't target players that is taking their turn)\nMoney usage - Funds the perils and trickery cards which turn the battle for Armello in your favor\nPerils which are traps\nDifferent character types and abilities for each of the clans united by the King\nA generator map that is different everytime you play it.\n\nThis game is really fun but the core of the game is how you're suppose to win. There are 4 ways of winning the game.\n\n1. Win by Prestige. Most common winning method by my experience. You pretty much do good deeds and kill enemy heroes and banes. You can also complete the quests.\n2. Win by King Kill. Go into the Palace and kill the king to win the game!\n3. Win by Spirit Stone. After stepping into the Palace, you can win instantly by exiling the king.\n4. Win by Rot. Compete against the King to whoever is the most corrupted. You gain additonal die for having a higher rot score.\n\nThere are different ways of playing the game, but why don't you buy it and try it yourself? It's 20 bucks and well worth the amount of money being put into the game.\n","October 5, 2015","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's not far off.\n\nAt its core, this is a board game. Or at least it's styled as a board game. Besides the tutorial, there's not really a campaign. Each play offers you a small array of quests to choose for your character that form into something like a story. And that's fine: You're not playing against the program. In true board game fashion, you're playing explicitly against other people.\n\nThe game is designed with enough complexity and win conditions close enough together, so that it never feels as though there's simply no hope. If you're not doing so well with one strategy, try switching to another. Play is well-balanced and fun. The art and animation is absolutely gorgeous. It all blends together to build a very well-crafted board game-like experience.\n\nIf you enjoy the turn-based spendor and strategy of board games, Armello is perfect for you. Grab a copy for yourself and convince a couple friends to buy, and have a great time. If you find board games in general kind of slow and not really to your taste, it's simply not for you.","October 15, 2015","true","65.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Plus a solid singleplayer experience for when you're antisocial or your friends are away.)\n\n3)  Procedurally generated maps mean every board is different.\n\n4)  With eight different characters and a variety of customization items to select before the game starts you'll quickly find a style of play you love.\n\n5)  Rewards extra customization itmes based on who you play and how.  (Let's face it, we all love customizing things.)\n\n6)  It's pretty to look at, which never hurts.\n\nCons:\n1)  When playing single-player the AI sometimes makes some quirky decisions...  Like walking through a swamp before attacking someone and consequently losing a fight it might have survived.\n\n2)  The Prestige Leader vicotry condition is a little odd in cases of a tie.  Several hours and a dozen games later and I'm still no entirely sure how it picks a leader in the case of a tie...  That being said in this game ties don't last long at all.\n\nThe Overview:\nArmello is a beautifully rendered boardgame that is easy to pick up and learn but deliciously difficult to master.  You may gear yourself up with a particualr victory in mind (there are four different ways to win afterall) but quickly find that your plan isn't falling into place they way you had hoped.  This is the kind of game that rewards opportunists, flexible thinkers, and clever tacticians.\nThe entire game is played on a hexagonal board and you spend your turn moving, collecting cards that give you powerful items, spells, or tricks you can use to hamper or kill your enemies, and possibly fighing off the king's guards, banes, or other players through dice rolling.  Fulfilling quests boosts your stats and grant generous rewards so you'll constantly be trying to plot the best route from A to B.  Your final objective is to overcome the corruption in the land represented by the king by either killing him, cleansing him, becoming the new king of corruption (and also killing him) or by becoming the most famous hero in the land and succeeding the king upon his death.  The king draws closer to his demise every sunrise so you'll constantly be racing the clock to amass your power and wrestle victory away from the other players.\nAlso all the characters are represented by animals, which is kind of neat and gives the whole thing a Redwall meets Game of Thrones kind of feel.  This game is wildly fun, deceptively challenging, and has immense replay value.  All in all this is a fantastic game I would recommend to anyone who loves boardgames or games that reward you for being quick on your feet and flexible in your planning.  Best played with one or two friends once you've mastered the game concepts but as I said, the solo play is strong with this one.

Also since this game isn't finished at the time so this could be added. To tell the truth its so much fun to play that I don't really think of the cons as big deals. I recommend this to anybody who likes board game. If you DON'T well, uhhh, sorry.

The king. the honourable , kind, benevolent king that managed to unite the clans, has fallen into corruption, the "rot" how they call it in the story, takes him over  a couple turns at a time, turning him more and more into a corrupted monster, and damaging his life every 2 turns.  his days are counted, and dark days come for the land you live in if he is not stopped in time, Banes will appear and desolate the place, other corrupted individuals will want his head on a pike just for power, brave warriors will see the end of the horror by the sword, aristocrats will seek his side, stay on top of the popular food chain so , when he dies, the noble of higher name takes his place. and spiritual  leaders from all around will seek to purify the rot, no matter the cost. this is how you win the game, none of them easy to get, since you will always be playing against other 3 champions, who of course, have their own agenda.\n\nAnthropomorphic characters, lovely music, Fantastic artwork and animations, visuals are more than enough to immerse yourself into the world. this game is a rough diamond that's constantly being polished and promises hours of fun.\n\nso... do i recommend this game?\nthe short answer is yes,\nthe long answer is ♥♥♥♥ the hell yes.\n\n10/10 would cleanse myself by accident with the stones again.\n","October 3, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combine that with the items, and no game really plays quite the same.  However, due to the winning conditions, yes the end game will appear on the surface to be the same, but how you got there, and the actual board situation can differ significantly from game to game.\n\nHow you build your character and what items you get into play are very important.  Taking items that provide additional dice, will typically give you a better attack, but they leave you vulnerable in defense.  If you take defensive items, you tend to get guaranteed die rolls (shields), but you give up some attack potential to do so.\n\nHowever, you need to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing.  If they are building defensively, and they have higher base health than you, going defensive is not your best option.  If they are going for a high attack, it might be best for you to rely on subterfuge and obstacles to achieve your aims.\n\nI highly recommend this game, but having a liking for boardgames definitely enhances the enjoyment.","February 18","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/recommended/290340/","GoldenHopper1983","Ryebread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/","205 products in account","Armello is a beautifully picturesque board game. From the thrilling battle exchanges, to the delightfully animated cards and intro sequence, to its storytale-like writing that paints a small saga for your character through your quests, this game is a treat for the eyes and a fun dice-rolling way to occupy about an hour. However, as Armello is primarily a board game, you may turned off by its randomness and its slower pace.\n\nFor me, Armello's chief strength is the quality of its visuals. You can see this yourself, as a number of a YouTube gaming channels have recorded their playthroughs of it during Early Access, including: Northernlion; Stumpt; and Jesse Cox. There have been a number of changes to the game since it exited beta status, but what you can see from those channels is largely how Armello looks in its final state. You should also notice the "talking woodland creatures with swords and magic" theme, which can prove to be quite the nostalgic bonus for those of you read Redwall novels and Mouse Guard comics. Armello also features a "dynamic sandbox", which essentially means every game will have most of the terrain tiles on the board randomly generated, ensuring a different experience and requiring different tactics for every game.\n\nIt must also be noted that Armello is quite friendly to new players. While the game starts off simply as your chosen avatar explores the land, a player can be swamped by the variety of cards and events he'll face. Fortunately, the game is very informative through its in-game guide (easily accessed from the main menu and during play) and is sufficiently detailed in its hover tips. This is especially the case with the cards, the major method you'll be using to interact with Armello's world. Each card comes with a short but clear description of their uses, so the player should never be left in doubt. Furthermore, the game has already seen two patches since its full release, and both patches have added new free content to the game including new items and cards. Details on these past updates can be found here at Armello's website[armello.com]. As is apparent, Armello has a dedicated development team behind it, one that fully intends to keep the game alive by bringing even more to it through future updates.\n\nMind you, if you find yourself frustrated with the randomness and waiting of board-games, then Armello may similarly irritate you. While some strategy is possible, victory in Armello is greatly dependent on the luck of the draw and the luck of the roll (though this can also be an appealing spice for the adventurous). Also, every game of Armello requires 4 players, whether they be human or AI controlled. This means you'll find yourself sitting through quite a bit of downtime, watching other players go through their turns. In the game's options, you can opt to skip AI vs AI battles to lessen your waiting time, but you can't fast-forward all of it. You could leave the computer while AI turns play out, but watching other players' moves is also part of the game (i.e. planning your own moves based on where your opponents appear to be going or what they may be planning to do).\n\nAll in all, Armello is a wonder for the eyes, and one round is a delightful way to spend half an hour to an hour. While PvP games online are completed in one go, offline player vs AI games can be saved and continued at a later date, making this game a fine option for a short spot of casual fun as well. If all this tickles your fancy for fantasy, delve deep into Armello and try for the Lion's throne.","April 1","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Even better when they're so close to winning)\n- Then get sabotaged in return (Sucks when you're so close to winning)\n- Dice rolls, mhmmm, don't even let me start on that. Unique but still partially dependent on your luck xD (RNG !@!%@!)\n\nAdditional stuff:\n- I do get this weird rough-ish sort of sound in game and sometimes it gets a little annoying (not that it affects the entire gameplay anyway).\n- Game might be still a little buggish (or maybe it's just my PC's issue x.x) but developers are quick to respond xD.\n\nTLDR;\nGreat game, should try getting it if it's on discount if you feel the price is a bit eheh. Not that type of game which you can play for 5 hours straight, a game or two a day with friends makes it all the better xD. If you're not the board game type of person, might not be entirely worth it to get it at full price but it's a great way to spend time with friends, so do give it a try :D\n\n9/10-ish.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narkulus/recommended/290340/","narkulus","Narkulus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narkulus/","617 products in account","Edit: Originally not recommended, it was borderline. After many plays, the game is in fact a lot of fun to play and the characters add a lot of variety. My gripes with the game still stand though, some crazy RNG, user interface issues, lack of options, easy AI, slow pace with no current way to disable animations.\n\nHere are the selling points from the store page and my breakdown of said features.\n\n◘ Easy to Play but Hard to Master - Armello is an intuitive game, easy to pick up and experience but with deep and emergent strategy. Full release will include a tutorial mode.\n\nEmergent strategy basically means that there is no long term strategy, things change from turn to turn, a new card draw with less than stellar cards means you may have to try and burn them off rather than continuing to your quest marker so maybe you'll get a better draw next time. The card draw is one of my biggest gripes in the game. There are a lot of different cards in the deck, so you can never really plan on what you want to do with your character based on equipment and spell cards, you just have to develop a new plan based on each draw. I wish the game gave you a little more control over the card draw.\n\n\n◘ Fast & Thoughtful - Adventuring in Armello is fast-paced fun but filled with deadly tactical and politically complex decisions requiring careful forethought and planning.\n\nThe pace is simply not fast, you have to wait for your opponents to finish their turn and it takes forever. You can occasionally play some cards off turn, but it's rare. Planning is thrashed by card RNG, if it works against you, your opponents will quickly outpace you in stats and equipment. Poltical descisions are not complex at all and you basically choose between a or b, prestige in the game is relatively easy to get.\n\n◘ Multiple Playable Heroes - Full release will include 8 playable Heroes. Each unique Hero possess a special power, stat line and Ai personality. Also heroes can be customised with Amulet and Signet Ring load-outs to match your play style or counter an opponents strategy.\n\nFair enough.\n\nEdit: I didn't elaborate, but characters are all very different and require different tactics. My favorite to play at the moment is Amber (dungeon RNG reducer) . Upcoming Bandit Clan DLC will also add to the variety with new characters and different buffs.\n\n\n◘ Dynamic Sandbox - Armello features a gorgeous dynamic world which procedurally generates a new map each and every game, complete with a dynamic quest system ensuring no two games of Armello are ever the same.\n\nI don't feel like the quest system was very well fleshed out. Pick the stat you want, travel to get it, a random dice roll risk if you want a little extra.\nRandom map generation does not really help replayability because of the small map size and a small handful of different tiles, I feel a larger map with increased action points and more tile variety would have been more immersive. I feel like I travel the same tiles, and take the same route over and over.\n\n◘ Turn-Based Day & Night Cycle - Armello features a fuzzy turn-based system, cycling between Day and Night phases. The fuzzy turns allow you to still play cards and do certain actions when its not your turn, and when it is you use Action Points to move around the hex board.\n\nI wish there was more to do when it's not your turn, this is less of a problem late game though as players begin to rush the palace.\n\n◘ World Class Music & Audio - By Michael Allen, internationally acclaimed artist Lisa Gerrard, Stephan Schutze and Jacek Tuschewski.\n\nThe audio is outstanding.\n\n◘ Animated Cards - Armello will feature over a 120+ beautifully animated in-game Cards, from artists all over the world.\n\nThey do look nice. No complaints.\n\nEdit: The game is truly gorgeous to look at, I mentioned it in my ea review, but didn't mention it here,  the all around atmosphere of Armello is near perfection for a game, I don't think there are many games in my library that come close.\n\n◘True Tabletop Feel - We spent months making sure we cherry-picked the best parts of the tabletop experience, like our custom physics-based dice!\n\nThere are some things that are not consistent with a tabletop feel.  During a King's decree, the camera locks and I can't even scroll the board. I want to look at my card descriptions while trying to figure out a quest, nope, not happening. The devs have reduced the fog in the game for better visibility, but I just want to zoom out more and see the whole board at once, but the devs are obsessed with the artistic atmosphere and zoom is nerfed.\n\nMultiplayer makes the game a little more fun, as the AI is not great and makes some puzzling decisions, but the pace slows even more and it's agony if you've fallen behind.\n\nFor me, Armello could have had some more strategic choices (especially card draw mechanics) and less battling with the RNG.  I do play quite a bit because RNG games have a place in my library. I will also continue to play in the hope of seeing some improvements, but I'm afraid this is the devs final vision (except for some tweaking) and it's not gonna change much.","September 2, 2015","true","74.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","38"

That's not far off.\n\nAt its core, this is a board game. Or at least it's styled as a board game. Besides the tutorial, there's not really a campaign. Each play offers you a small array of quests to choose for your character that form into something like a story. And that's fine: You're not playing against the program. In true board game fashion, you're playing explicitly against other people.\n\nThe game is designed with enough complexity and win conditions close enough together, so that it never feels as though there's simply no hope. If you're not doing so well with one strategy, try switching to another. Play is well-balanced and fun. The art and animation is absolutely gorgeous. It all blends together to build a very well-crafted board game-like experience.\n\nIf you enjoy the turn-based spendor and strategy of board games, Armello is perfect for you. Grab a copy for yourself and convince a couple friends to buy, and have a great time. If you find board games in general kind of slow and not really to your taste, it's simply not for you.","October 15, 2015","true","65.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What's more, the digital platform has allowed for beautiful gameplay, and new and creative stretches to the genre.  It looks great, feels authentic, and tantalizingly hints at a deep and rich mythology that the devs are slowly revealing via updates and dlc.\nSome people have complained about the gameplay mechanics, I haven't found them at all random, I mean,  no more than you would want with a game of its type.  The game is incredibly complex but easy to learn, and the devs are always releasing new tweaks, they really listen to feedback, and their patches and updates help, I particulary like the +1 body to all heroes, not to mention the slew of new content that is coming up.\nThe game is ground breaking.

(I haven't touched multiplayer yet, so I'll be leaving that out)\n\nFirst off, this game is awesome. Fairly simple, easy to get into, and from what I've seen of the dev's website, continually updated. A single game on the default settings usually take 30-45 minutes to complete. You have the choice of eight different characters to play as and two different maps. You also have the option to equip one ring and one accessory that up different stats from the beginning of a game.\n\nYou never know what's going to happen in a game, and you may even set out to win in one way, but end up on a different path later on. The card system adds a very deep layer to the gameplay, especially since you can play cards during other players' turns. Maps do seem small, but the way the map is used with quests and different terrains makes it feel a whole lot bigger.\n\nIf you like turn-based games, get this. If you like card games, get this. If you like RPGs, get this. This game has all that and more for the very reasonable price of $20.

Both the 8 year old and the 18 year old in me are giddy with joy!\nSo to start I'll sum up what is generally not well liked by pretty much everyone and get that out of the way. Firstly, nearly everything in this game is in some way randomly generated. I could explain the systems and what I think were the design choices that led to the extreme amount of RNG in this game but it really isn't worth the time. Suffice to say that the one consistent element in the game is the number of tile you can move on a given turn.\n\nThere have also been what I see as contradictory complaints about the game being too long to be fun and too short to be playable. I fundamentally disagree with both of these assessments on the grounds that A) I have only had difficulty achieving one play style after less that a days worth of play and B) a game will last you less than an hour to complete when something like irl Dungeons and Dragons will take like three just to get from town to town and a grand strategy game like any of the Civ games can take multiple days to finish on lengthier settings. And to be clear, I mean the game will take less that an hour because the game has what is effectively countdown clock built into the game with the way that the king (the victory condition in this game) works. Basically, the game ends when he dies and he is already on the way out the door by the time the game starts.\n\nSecondly, There is, at this time, not exactly a wealth of content available. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU WILL PLAY THE GAME ONCE AND BE DONE WITH IT. What it means is that there is effectively one game mood and one map. What keeps the game fresh, in my opinion, is the very randomness that some people seem to distain. From what I have seen on the forums accessed from within the game, they are still actively working on bring more playable characters into the game and genuinely seem interested in improving the game with time. As for maps and game modes, I haven't seen any developments of note. In my personal opinion, the game is well worth its price as is but that is a very personal evaluation I leave up to you.\n\nIf these are concerns for you, you may wish to avoid this game, at least for the time being.\n\nOtherwise, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS AN ABSOLUTE JOY.\n\nThe art is lovely in a way that I won't even attempt to describe. It manages to be both whimsical (prob mispelled) and sufficiently, well not exactly bleak but fitting for the sort of dark fantasy game that they were going for.\n\nThe RPG elements, which I admit are a tad simplistic, are very rewarding if you take the time to read the in game text, consider you actions through the lens of you character, and put in the smallest effort to care about what your doing. In short, use your imagination for 5 seconds. Its good for you. There is some RPG style progression and a wealth of collectables of extremely high quality (such as animated cards that you unlock for viewing after being played) and trinkets to change the way each kingdoms champions play after you have used them multiple times.\n\nI personally love the gameplay. Note that I say this as someone that plays Dungeons and Dragons semi-regularly and has absolutely no problem waiting for 15 minutes while Sir Mixalot (actual name of friend's character) makes a decision as to what song he is going to play and then roles like thirty dice just to see if it all amounts to anything meaningful. Yes, it is undoubtably slow as a result of there being no way to skip the AI's turns and it is most certainly very random. However, it is not the total cluster that some of the negative reviews might lead you to think. Each character has certains stats at which he or she is better equiped to use. If you pay attention, you might even pick up on the fact that each of the 4 kingdoms is designed to be better at a certain type of victory condition, of which there are 4. And when I say might have noticed, I mean play throught he tutorial up until the point where the game literally tells you which victory each of the AI players are going for and which you should aim for. If that wasn't a big enough clue, maybe just put on your thinking cap an realize that trying to win a game by killing a lion as a rabbit is probably not the best course of action. It's a lot like rock, paper, scissors except this time with "fatal" consequences.\n\nAlso, not that this is the biggest thing to note, but the music is very pleasent. I'm not talking like Bastion levels of amazing or even Skyrim levels of IS THIS EPIC ENOUGH FOR YOU. It's more subtle and relaxed in a sort of "what if Game of Thrones didn't make you have an minor heart attack everytime you watch" sort of way (note that I do realize that a great deal of GoT is just people talking at each other and not all that eventful).\n\nONE LAST WORD OF CAUTION: I do think that a large part of my personal enjoyment of this particular game comes from the theme and setting. When I was a younger, I read a great deal of the "Redwall" series by Brian Jacques that I mentioned at the beginning of this review. It is in no way an understatement to say that these book made me love to read. I can really explain what it was about them as a whole that I responded to but I know that, by shear virtue of the easy parallels between the books and this game, that Armello stirred within me many of the emotions and affections that struck me as a child while reading the collective works of Mr. Jacques. If you, like me have any fondness for those book I highly recommend giving this game at least a cursory glance before passing it up. If you don't then go read any book from the Redwall series right now, or at the very least keep them in mind if your looking for something to gift to an 8 to 12 year old. I say all of this as an admission of bias. Please do take it into consideration.\n\nSo to sum this whole thing up, if the idea of midieval furry simulator 2015 sounds the least bit interesting to you, give this a chance.\n\nForgive any spelling or grammar error you might find in this thing. I wrote it at 1 in the morning.","September 25, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some quirks to it but that's quickly overshadowed by all the fun you have playing the game. For starters:\n\nThis is a turned based game that has a lot of cool mechanics which are and are not limited to:\n\nMana usage - Cast spells on opponents during your turn and on someone elses turn (can't target players that is taking their turn)\nMoney usage - Funds the perils and trickery cards which turn the battle for Armello in your favor\nPerils which are traps\nDifferent character types and abilities for each of the clans united by the King\nA generator map that is different everytime you play it.\n\nThis game is really fun but the core of the game is how you're suppose to win. There are 4 ways of winning the game.\n\n1. Win by Prestige. Most common winning method by my experience. You pretty much do good deeds and kill enemy heroes and banes. You can also complete the quests.\n2. Win by King Kill. Go into the Palace and kill the king to win the game!\n3. Win by Spirit Stone. After stepping into the Palace, you can win instantly by exiling the king.\n4. Win by Rot. Compete against the King to whoever is the most corrupted. You gain additonal die for having a higher rot score.\n\nThere are different ways of playing the game, but why don't you buy it and try it yourself?

The devs are very responsive to any bugs or problems that may arise in the game, and I honestly haven't seen that many anyway.

I normally don't do a lot of multiplayer due to min/max metagamers of nerdy rage; but this game was meant to be played with humans. Just like any game worth its salt, you can learn through loosing and win through experimentation and luck.\n\nOnce you have the mechanics of the game down, it's time to learn the cards and characters. Then you can formulate your strategy. Some players give a negative review of the game due to "too many attack dice" being used- they just didn't pray hard enough to the RNGod is all. Dice are random, and you have to be able to take your losses if you want to play this game.\n\nIf your friends never have time to get together in person, this is an activity you can easily fit schedules together with.

Kickstarter is both a great tool for people to gain funding for, and put forward ideas for, projects they are passionate about. It’s also a recipe for disaster. Projects often over-promise and under-deliver, much like the last decade for Peter Molyneux. And there’s no guarantee that the people behind the projects have any concept of how to manage a small business, which is essentially what kickstarter is enabling.\n\nFortunately, the Kickstarter that is Armello did not over-promise and ended up resulting in a great game. League of Geeks, backed by Screen Australia and Film Victoria, have developed a digital board game, and one of the first that I know of that isn’t an adaptation of an actual board game.\n\nWhat makes Armello a great game is its use of the digital medium. It does things that most other board games couldn’t. There are several different game systems which make this a complex game, but complexity is fine in this medium. When you move into forests at night, you become invisible, something you couldn’t do with a hardcopy game. It also allows the NPCs to be a force of nature in themselves. The king and his guards have their own agenda, the banes that spawn out of the rot also act individually. But the best thing about having a digital board game is that there’s added character and personality in the game. The guard dogs sniff the air as they stand to attention. Some of the cards have animations. Day and night is actually day and night. You have a little advisor which pops up when you need to choose a new quest.\n\nI’m yet to play with other humans, which will definitely provide a stronger challenge than playing with AI (one difficulty setting), and I’m looking forward to it.\n\nFor full review, visit: http://icarusreviews.net/2015/10/12/armello/","January 4","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Luckily, the community is healthy, supported, and talented. Here's a couple reasons why:\n\n1. Developer Dedication - The LoG crew streams 3 times a week, providing answers to questions, insight to new developments, and generally being a stand-up crew. It's well past launch, and the developers continue to be a positive presence in the community.\n2. Player Community - On both the forums and in the streams, you'll find dedicated players willing to answer questions, consider strategies, and talk about the future of the game. Games online maintain a friendly but competitive atmosphere. Because at its core, Armello is a digital boardgame, with all the pros and cons of one.\n\nA number of reviews have brought up the pace, the danger of battles, and the tendency for Prestige victories to be more common. These are all true, but they're part of what make Armello great.\n\nFor pacing, you wouldn't rush through a board game, you want to take the time to consider your actions. Plus, you can also play a lot of cards while it isn't your turn. This is where the strategy of Armello really shines.\n\nThe battles, I've found the battles are very dangerous because the rewards are significant. Especially when there is a bounty on the player's head, or you're fighting the Prestige leader, or you're clearing a bane from a settlement. All of these can generate +2 relative prestige, which is an enormous boost. With careful maneuvering, you can easily go from underdog to leader, if you roll well.\n\nFinally, yes. I've won a ton more as Prestige Leader than any other. That's what develops the tension. From the very beginning of the game, every player is working toward Prestige victory. That's the long term goal, but sometimes when you are coming up short. That's when you can invoke some of the others such as Spirit or Kingslayer to steal a victory from the Prestige leader. Being flexible and adjusting to changing game conditions is part of the fun of Armello.\n\nThere are numerous other critiques players have brought up, which I've considered, and I've now come to terms with. A lot of them are part of what makes Armello great and provides the challenge in the game. I don't think this game is for everyone, it isn't an RPG where you grow stronger and unstoppable. Nor it is a strategy game where consistent good decisions will insulate you from doom. Instead, Armello is a dynamic game full of life and capable of catching you by surprise. And that's why I recommend Armello.\n","January 8","true","110.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play against other folks online or against computer opponents, on a rather small but artfully rendered map, with the goal of becoming leader of the kingdom in one of four ways. You increase your stats by completing quests, defeating other players (or evil critters known as banes) in battle, or by luck of the draw from a deck of cards. Cards can grant you bonuses, temporary or otherwise, or you can play disadventageous cards on your enemies. Cards can also be "burned" (exchanged for a sure roll on your dice) in battle.\n\nWhile strategy has a decided effect on the outcome of a game, sometimes there is nothing you can do against a bad run of luck, and that is my only real complaint - too much luck is involved in gameplay, what with the cards, the dice rolls, and the arbitrary appearance of the quests and perils. I won my very first game almost purely by luck, because I really had no idea what I was doing.\n\nDespite this, I find Armello enjoyable and well worth the cost.

Sign me up!\n\nIn Armello, you take turns with your opponents in a closed 10-rounds match that will decide the future of a kingdom in ruins. There are different gameplay strategies that you can adopt, the rules are easy to master (though it does have some meta with the whole item system) and soon you will be holding grudges against one or other character, just like in a good board game.\n\nSince this is a board game presented in a digital medium, it does make use of great graphics and sound to improve the experience. Everything in Armello is animated (even the CARDS), the SFX are good and the music is calm and fitting. Also, if you like talking animals (or furries, admit it) you will probably love the characters in the game. Their animations and style are strikingly good, and on top of that each one has their own perks, adding more replay value.\n\nAll in all, it's easy to see that the game was developed by a team who loves what they do. Great attention to detail, polished UI, and just enough content to justify the time and money spent on it. Only criticism I have is not even related to the game itself: I find it hard to find other players for multiplayer matches.\n\nOne of my favorite casual games in a while, and certainly one I would recommend to anyone who enjoys tabletop games.","January 23","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceekur/recommended/290340/","Ceekur","Ceekur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceekur/","478 products in account","Armello is a mostly turn-based strategy game played with up to 4 players. Your ultimate goal is to overthrow the Mad King and restore peace to the land. Or rule over it with an iron paw; this game isn't about what comes after, but the hard-fought journey to it. It is a fresh take in the turn-based genre, where you don't simply go from point A to point B and finish first. You must use this strange land as a tool to build up and achieve victory through combat, magicks, or trickery (usually a combo of all three!). Each player chooses a hero each with their own passive ability and allocation of stat points. Afterwards, you choose a ring, granting an ability based on what clan they hail from. Then an amulet from a shared set that can boost a stat by 1 or make a particular victory condition slightly easier to obtain.\n\nDice appear in combat and perils (traps that require the dice to match symbols), where you either hit, miss, or defend. Each shield blocks one hit, where misses are 33% likely, hits are 50% likely, and shields are merely 1/6 likely. Attacks are resolved at the same time, so mutual kills can often happen unless you were geared up defensively. I don't feel this is a flaw exactly, just a design that requires player understanding and adjusting accordingly. However, you can guarantee certain dice rolls by burning your cards, matching its symbol on the top-right.\n\nCard decks are used whenever you start your turn and draw new cards up to your Wits stat. You may choose from Items (healing, equipment, movement), Magic (stat buffs, teleportation, peril spells), and Trickery (traps, resource stealing, sabotage). While you are free to pick, your ideal choice lies with your character, position on the board, and time of day. Almost nightfall and you still have some magic? Draw a spell and use it up before you receive more for free. Have a lot of settlements under control? Draw trickery and take advantage of your discount per owned town.\n\nI say it is mostly a turn-based game, in that you can play cards during other player turns. You can equip items to prepare for a potential battle, use buffing magic cards, play perils on the board, even teleport off-turn. While you cannot use a spell directly onto a player currently moving, you can still place traps in their way. Overall, this is the best time to modify or cement the strategy to be used on your next turn, rather than always being bored waiting for the three other players.\n\nThe "rule of four numbers" is a reoccurring theme in this game. There are four hero clans: Wolf, Rat, Bear, Rabbit; and you must always play with 4 players, even if the remainder is AI-controlled. There are four main stat points: Fight, Wit, Body, Spirit. There are four "resources": Gold, Magic, Prestige, Rot. There are four ways to win the game, and you must keep all of them in mind to hinder the other players' progress while slowly reaching your own under the radar.\n\nEach player starts in their Clan Grounds and have 3 movement points to use on the board, which itself is divided into different hexes. Each hex is a particular terrain type which may help or hurt you or your enemy from their current goal. This is an important distinction from other board games: CURRENT goal. Maybe you need to finish a quest to get another stat point, maybe you need a couple towns under your control for gold next dawn, maybe you're hunting a monster (Banes) or another player for more Prestige. None of these actions is a direct victory action; you are building tools and resources to aid you in reaching victory.\n\nThe map is not very big, but the land of Armello is a dynamic, living entity that is randomly generated each match. During the match, perils, hazards, and enemies will move around or be added/removed by player actions and influence. As the King is slowly dying each day, there is a time-limit for the players to work. You may win by Prestige where you inherit the crown after the King passes. You may collect 4 Spirit Stones to banish him after you breach the palace grounds. Or you may throw down the gauntlet and use brute force to combat him directly. OR take to the dark side and show just how corrupt one can get before facing him.\n\nYour stats help you combat the hazards in the game. Body is the simplest stat; it is your max health. Fight almost always determines how many dice rolled in combat. Your Wit determines your maximum cards drawn at the start of your turn, your dice if Evading in defensive combat, and rolled dice in some perils. Your Spirit is how many magic points you are balanced to each nightfall and how far you may cast a spell from your character, and your dice against magical perils.\n\nThe presentation of the game is fantastic. Every character model is sharp and inspired, with a colorful fairytale-esque aesthetic. Shadows cast across the land based on the time of day/night. Beautiful animated art is on every card in the game, even viewable in the gallery. The idle animations are done well for each hero and fit their personality. They play a "boast" animation on certain conditions, such as on killing their combat target or finishing a quest. Even Guards, Banes, and the King himself have subtle animations that follow these same rules!\n\nArmello is visually designed to feel alive during a match, and when everything comes together, I really get that feeling. Instead of a static board, it is a living world that we adventure in. The developers have invested a lot into polishing this game, and it shows. The music is excellent and further immerses one into its world, covering the right moments of atmosphere, tension, and drama. Hearing more about our heroes in the future would be great. However the lore is provided indirectly through guides and stories that won't immediately be visible during matches. Quest logs do explain what your character is going through to get the throne though.\n\nThere is a good amount of randomness to the game, which may turn some players off, as they are expected to be strategic in a game where fate keeps dealing you the wrong cards or combat dice rolls came out poorly despite beating all your opponent's items and stats. Nonetheless, each player can manipulate the situation to best be on top. Try not to end your turn near a dungeon if night is coming and you cannot handle combat if a Bane were to randomly spawn from it. See if you can afford to go around a peril if you aren't prepared to (literally) roll with it. Don't always choose Risk on quest rewards. Don't make enemies too early just because you can. Ultimately, you are your own ally and alliances are temporary - Finding balance between risk and reward, and having a Plan B are key in this game.\n\nThe developers are still looking towards future updates and game balance, and are occasionally tweaking different cards, items, and elements. It's a very polished, visually-pleasing game to play that takes 60-90 minutes once you know how to play. Deeper down, there is a lot of replayability to be had if given a chance. Even now, there are elements of counter-play involved when choosing a character. Playing against Thane, the sword-crazy wolf who can passively cause armor-piercing attacks? Play a spell-caster or Zosha who can Ambush at night. In a match with multiple spellcasters try a Witty character and focus on a non-combat victory while countering with Trickery. With four players, there is never a true counter-class to everything, meaning your best skill is improvisation and never surrendering even if you were killed and sent back on the final day.\n\nI have really enjoyed my experiences with the game and encourage others to give it a try. It mixes a board game formula with a very lively aesthetic and dynamic gameplay, pushing you to think ahead about What Ifs, threat priority, and resource management. Don't let the random elements be a turnoff, enjoy the potential the game has to offer, and ultimately play in your way that lets you have fun.","January 6","true","172.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Luckily, the community is healthy, supported, and talented. Here's a couple reasons why:\n\n1. Developer Dedication - The LoG crew streams 3 times a week, providing answers to questions, insight to new developments, and generally being a stand-up crew. It's well past launch, and the developers continue to be a positive presence in the community.\n2. Player Community - On both the forums and in the streams, you'll find dedicated players willing to answer questions, consider strategies, and talk about the future of the game. Games online maintain a friendly but competitive atmosphere. Because at its core, Armello is a digital boardgame, with all the pros and cons of one.\n\nA number of reviews have brought up the pace, the danger of battles, and the tendency for Prestige victories to be more common. These are all true, but they're part of what make Armello great.\n\nFor pacing, you wouldn't rush through a board game, you want to take the time to consider your actions. Plus, you can also play a lot of cards while it isn't your turn. This is where the strategy of Armello really shines.\n\nThe battles, I've found the battles are very dangerous because the rewards are significant. Especially when there is a bounty on the player's head, or you're fighting the Prestige leader, or you're clearing a bane from a settlement. All of these can generate +2 relative prestige, which is an enormous boost. With careful maneuvering, you can easily go from underdog to leader, if you roll well.\n\nFinally, yes. I've won a ton more as Prestige Leader than any other. That's what develops the tension. From the very beginning of the game, every player is working toward Prestige victory. That's the long term goal, but sometimes when you are coming up short. That's when you can invoke some of the others such as Spirit or Kingslayer to steal a victory from the Prestige leader. Being flexible and adjusting to changing game conditions is part of the fun of Armello.\n\nThere are numerous other critiques players have brought up, which I've considered, and I've now come to terms with. A lot of them are part of what makes Armello great and provides the challenge in the game. I don't think this game is for everyone, it isn't an RPG where you grow stronger and unstoppable. Nor it is a strategy game where consistent good decisions will insulate you from doom. Instead, Armello is a dynamic game full of life and capable of catching you by surprise. And that's why I recommend Armello.\n","January 8","true","110.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Uh. Not sure how that's -exactly- relevant? But it is. Armello's been an amazing experience that I'm trying to currently push on my friends. To note: This -is- basically an videogame boardgame, but it's super fun, and the animation is smooth. The tactics are varied and interesting, and there's a lot of room for risky play. Anyways, I'm probably more coherent when I hate a game. It's hard to praise a game as much as I have, so I'll get to the cons:\n-There's only one game board.\n-There's a pretty small character selection.\n\nThat's uh, about it. That and turns can take a little long, but that's okay when you're doing singleplayer anyways, because you can just turn on quickturns.

Kickstarter is both a great tool for people to gain funding for, and put forward ideas for, projects they are passionate about. It’s also a recipe for disaster. Projects often over-promise and under-deliver, much like the last decade for Peter Molyneux. And there’s no guarantee that the people behind the projects have any concept of how to manage a small business, which is essentially what kickstarter is enabling.\n\nFortunately, the Kickstarter that is Armello did not over-promise and ended up resulting in a great game. League of Geeks, backed by Screen Australia and Film Victoria, have developed a digital board game, and one of the first that I know of that isn’t an adaptation of an actual board game.\n\nWhat makes Armello a great game is its use of the digital medium. It does things that most other board games couldn’t. There are several different game systems which make this a complex game, but complexity is fine in this medium. When you move into forests at night, you become invisible, something you couldn’t do with a hardcopy game. It also allows the NPCs to be a force of nature in themselves. The king and his guards have their own agenda, the banes that spawn out of the rot also act individually. But the best thing about having a digital board game is that there’s added character and personality in the game. The guard dogs sniff the air as they stand to attention. Some of the cards have animations. Day and night is actually day and night. You have a little advisor which pops up when you need to choose a new quest.\n\nI’m yet to play with other humans, which will definitely provide a stronger challenge than playing with AI (one difficulty setting), and I’m looking forward to it.\n\nFor full review, visit: http://icarusreviews.net/2015/10/12/armello/","January 4","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combine that with the items, and no game really plays quite the same.  However, due to the winning conditions, yes the end game will appear on the surface to be the same, but how you got there, and the actual board situation can differ significantly from game to game.\n\nHow you build your character and what items you get into play are very important.  Taking items that provide additional dice, will typically give you a better attack, but they leave you vulnerable in defense.  If you take defensive items, you tend to get guaranteed die rolls (shields), but you give up some attack potential to do so.\n\nHowever, you need to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing.  If they are building defensively, and they have higher base health than you, going defensive is not your best option.  If they are going for a high attack, it might be best for you to rely on subterfuge and obstacles to achieve your aims.\n\nI highly recommend this game, but having a liking for boardgames definitely enhances the enjoyment.","February 18","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This can be fun, but one thing that sets Armello apart is that they actually take advantage of the medium and do things that would actually be impossible in a real-life board game, but yet they never take away from that dice-rolling, peice-moving wistfulness that comes from playing a good board game. The game looks and sounds fantastic, with battle animations and background music, all while rolling dice and drawing cards. It's a very nice balance of a board game and a video game, without sacrificing the charm of either one.\n\nAs for the game itself, you pick a anthropomorphic animal hero, then move around the board to try and overthrow the kind before one of your three opponents do. There's combat, and spells, and stragedy, and many options for how to win. Not a whole lot to say here, except that if you like turn-based, board game combat with some stragety and thinking but also some luck, you'll like this game.\n\nTo anyone who likes board games and video games, this is an excellent example of how to properly merge the two genres.","February 22","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's also made from an Aussie studio which is awesome!\n\nThis game is great. The art is nice, graphics are pretty. The audio (sound and music) are superb. The gameplay is fun, deep yet intuitive with different tactics/strats. It has high replayability and great for online play. You can also customise the rules online/offline to play however you like.\n\nNow the negatives. The game lacks some content, it's not an expensive game, it's actually quite cheap but for $20USD I'd like more than 1 level or at least some content for us solo players like a short campaign with a basic storyline. More characters and amulets/rings would be nice too, or at least more of the former. I'd also like a better matchmaking system with more detail and selections like choosing a public lobby. The prestige victory is also like the only worthy strat in most cases, this isn't a big deal as maybe it's supposed to be that way but the Rot victory is so hard to get, I got it on my 2nd day, but with AI, on PS4 only 0.8% of all players achieve a Rot victory and about 5.5% on Steam. The game does rely on skill and thoughtful strategies to win, however it's quite RNG dependent too, moreso than Hearthstone...but that's a bad example...I'd say slightly more than Chaos Reborn or at least on par.\n\nIt sounds like there's more negatives, and there probably are more negatives, but they're quite small specific aspects. Don't worry, it wasn't a tough decision between a Yes/No for my recommendation. It was an easy "Yes." Don't buy it though if you don't like a little RNG, or boardgame/dice/card-type games with heavy multiplayer aspect and only 1 map. I'll now explain how the game works and go into some more detail (unfortunately my last unsaved review was way more in-depth and of clarity but this will make do). Also, I'd just like to quickly add that if this review made you or helped your purchase the game (or avoid it) give it a thumbs up or add me for some multiplayer goodness. I can also teach you the game! :) I'm really friendly and looking for friends. I'm an Aussie and have Skype and can download other software, I prefer using Discord though. Or we don't have to talk at all.\n\nIt's a board game, where the object of the game is to succeed the king who is dieing from his infection by either slaying him, banishing with 4 spirit stones you collected or having the most prestige when he passes.\n\nThe most common method of winning and the default (when time runs out) is a prestige win. The king suffers 1dmg each dawn, which is the same as what happen when you're infected with Rot. Although the infection can benefit or hamper you depending on your strategy, although I love playing for Rot/slay victory it's quite difficult and an all-or-nothing strat that often fails.\n\nYou pick a character with a unique skill/ability, and a unique ring and amulet which give bonus stats. Then you start of with 3 AP (action points) to move 1 adjacent tile. There are different types of tiles which have different effects upon landing. Anyway, in fights, you roll dice which are determined by how much "fight" your character has, and in perils (like challenges to match symbols or traps) you roll your wit count and burn cards to win. Each cycle (dawn/night) you also draw cards up to the amount of Wits you have. You can choose from 3 decks which are equipment, spells/magic and trickery You can earn gold via settlements which is mostly used to play trap or equipment cards. And each night your magic fills up to how much Spirit you have and is used for magic/spell cards.\n\nSo that's pretty much it for the basic outline of the game, it's a board game involving a lot of RNG (dice) and playing cards. It's also pretty fun, quite polished, and very fun to play with friends but I just wish it had more solo content (I love these types of games like Chaos Reborn, Armello and Hand of Fate which is also an Aussie game btw) or at least a way to join certain public lobbies rather than just search the queue and invite friends.","May 19","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a fun and cunning game, where anything can happen at any time and where no one is ever counted out. Up until the last turn, you can easily pull off a victory despite having virtually nothing going for you -- but only if you can deal with your opponents accordingly! The game feels a bit like a mixture between a lot of Mario Party, a good dose of Civilization, and a touch of Skyrim. My only gripe is that turns aren't simultaneous, making it so that you watch your opponents play more than you play yourself.","December 28, 2015","true","58.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The king. the honourable , kind, benevolent king that managed to unite the clans, has fallen into corruption, the "rot" how they call it in the story, takes him over  a couple turns at a time, turning him more and more into a corrupted monster, and damaging his life every 2 turns.  his days are counted, and dark days come for the land you live in if he is not stopped in time, Banes will appear and desolate the place, other corrupted individuals will want his head on a pike just for power, brave warriors will see the end of the horror by the sword, aristocrats will seek his side, stay on top of the popular food chain so , when he dies, the noble of higher name takes his place. and spiritual  leaders from all around will seek to purify the rot, no matter the cost. this is how you win the game, none of them easy to get, since you will always be playing against other 3 champions, who of course, have their own agenda.\n\nAnthropomorphic characters, lovely music, Fantastic artwork and animations, visuals are more than enough to immerse yourself into the world. this game is a rough diamond that's constantly being polished and promises hours of fun.\n\nso... do i recommend this game?\nthe short answer is yes,\nthe long answer is ♥♥♥♥ the hell yes.\n\n10/10 would cleanse myself by accident with the stones again.\n","October 3, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That is, when you enter the game with an understanding of what you’re about to embark on in this quest of art and mind.\n\nWhen stresses of life and the insanity of other games I enjoy tend to wear me thin, this is the game I always run back to with my arms wide open. The visuals are soothing. The gameplay is perfect for someone that just wants to relax after a long stressful day of getting scolded from their bosses or hearing the screaming of impatient children. Grab a glass of your beverage of choice, make those nachos you have been craving all week and sit down and enjoy the bliss and relaxation as you laugh along with others when you are riddled with bad luck or good fortune.\n\nThe series of set phrases that you will have in this game, used to communicate with others in multiplayer, bring a special roleplaying aspect that makes it very hard to get angry. (That is, unless you’re just angry by trait) Having a sense of humor will take you a long way; here in this game and in life.\n\nI encourage everyone to pick this game up for themselves, friends or their kids (Great for all ages because the chat between everyone is talentedly limited) and have a great adventure of mind and visuals. Armello is one of the best relaxed yet, challenging turn-based strategy board like games I’ve come across. And, oh! I am so glad I did.","May 27","true","147.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are a fan of board games, rpgs, or mtg, then this game will be right up your alley. The gameplay is well refined and balance (unlike most games these days), which gives every player, no matter how nooby, an equal chance to win the game. Now I must adress that there is RNG elements in this game, its based off of drawing cards and rolling dice, many people are against RNG in games but do feel that it plays very nicely into the game and makes the game more enjoyable! Overall I definitly recommend this game to whoever seems the slightest interested, the Devs and Community is very open and wil help you with any questions.\nP.S.

My single and only problem is that sadly I am runnning Yosemite OSX for Mac and ever since I installed it I have had difficulties playing certain and specific games and at current this game has a graphical issue once you enter combat, and it is pretty unavoidable, that all the text becomes blocky and illegible. All that aside I still recommend getting it, unless you have Yosemite too, which then I say wait for a hotfix.","January 29, 2015","true","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

From the music at character selection to the card animations, there's a lot of aesthetic pleasers in this game. Each game has ran about 40-60 minutes for me so far (single player) and it was a bit of a curve to get familiar with everything (like most board games, though). I really do enjoy almost everything about the game so far. I feel like so far it's been fairly difficult to win, unless by means of prestige. If I find myself behind in prestige about half-way through the game, I almost know that there's no way to catch up and kind of already consider myself having failed which kind of burns my gameplay morale - but besides that! This is an amazing game so far and I can't wait to see what comes out in the full release in 6 months.

Play from eight characters and four clans, each one with unique rings and amulet combinations to power up your characters.\n\nEasily one of my favorite games.","December 24, 2015","true","73.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Gorgeous artwork that was clearly held in high importance during development. Matches move at a decent pace, giving you limited, but not entirely absent, actions to perform during other players turns. Length of each match is nice, most taking under an hour, giving you enough time to figure out a playstyle or character and moving on to another. The music is pleasant and fits mood nicely, but does not stand out in any particular way. Combat is simple, using a unique D6 system that is supplemented by combat and spell items and based off various symbols as opposed to numbers. Could benefit from an initiative system, as of now both characters engaged in combat simply get their full attack turn with no real importance to order unless they are outright slaughtered, going nearly negative their full health pool.","October 27, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Armello is a video game which bases itself in board game principals where four heroes, a wolf, rat, rabbit and bear, compete for their clans to secure the throne.\n\nThe goal is to gain more prestige points than your opponents by the time the king dies of his illness, or to smite him yourself. The game has three methods of doing this, and takes familiar elements and mixes them in ways that work extremely well.

That's currently the best way to describe this game right now.  I've played a few times, won a few games, lost a few (even against the a.i. which was a fun suprise, usually the a.i. in games arnt challenging enough).  However the game lacks the long term strategy aspect that most games like it thrive off of and prestige victory seems to be the most viable option for a game lasting only about 20 turns/10 days. the upside to this is it gives you a game where you can sit down and play a game in 40 minutes without worrying about saving.\n\nThe game is ideal for playing with your friends and for those days where you need something to do for the next 30-45min.\nIs it worth the price?  So far for me...  $25/6.3hrs of play=$3.96/hr  for me that is worth it as I know that price will drop as I play more.\n\nOverall rating- 7.1/10  -  The game has alot to offer at an early stage.  But a game speed option should be added to fit the needs and wants of the average strategy gamer because lets face it, failing all of my quests at 40-60% is just pure bad luck and there's no way to bounce back from wasting 15 turns on failed quests in a 20 turn game.

Gameplay is easy to pick up, but has enough nuances and options to keep players hooked and learning more and more each match.

Best played with friends (since the AI lacks that edge and ability to cooperate which makes the game that much more entertaining).\n\nArmello was originally prototyped as a physical game, and that feel carries through into the digital version, from the dice physics to the card decks, without requiring the mental chore to keep track of all the math / board counters / other variables that would bog things down in real life.\n\nEach space on the board has different terrain and variables -- towns give gold when claimed, forests give stealth in the cover of night, druid circles heal anyone who enters, and dungeons have the option of offering treasures or waking monsters. Players are given quests to travel across the kingdom and commit deeds of heroism that strengthen them for their eventual confrontation with the mad king at the center of the board. Equipment cards affect the number and types of dice you have to roll when facing tests and combats, and there are various spells, items, and traps that can be played to  terrain and/or players that can help or hinder them. Combat and perils are challenged with dice rolls -- you gain dice by equipping items and using spells to tip the odds in your favor.\n\nThere are currently 8 different characters (with more planned), each with different skills to complement different playstyles, from magic-using tank to sneaky hit-and-run thief, to item-hoarding situational card-swapper. The flow of each game requires players to be able to adjust their strategies for victory or be left at the mercy of more ambitious opponents. Either challenge the king directly or work to sabotage the plans of others and grab a win through trickery and amassing personal prestige. Literally stack your dice with clever use of your cards and abilities, and make a grab for Armello's throne before someone else does.\n\nIf you are a fan of tabletop and card games, then Armello is definitely worth a try. :)\n\nCons: No auto-reconnect if a player acidentally disconnects, no ingame chat (voicechat improves the boardgame experience feel, imo)","September 14, 2015","true","116.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although not especially deep at the moment, it's fun and has\ngreat potential for future patches.\n\n---\n\nPros:\n* Art - The art style in this game is absolutely beautiful. The cards\nare lovely with their subtle animations and the 2D character art lends\nthe heroes a lot of personality. Sound effects and music are\nappropriate and lovely. I'm looking forward to the DLC at least as\nmuch for new art and cinematics as I am for new mechanical content.\n* Fun and Balance - Hard to quantify rigorously, but the game feels\nfun - it rewards being thoughtful without demanding that every action\nis supremely calculated. Characters feel pretty well balanced given\nthe recent release, although not perfectly so. Mechanics like\ncorruption and the special abilities of followers mean that a single\ncard can be applied in different, interesting ways.\n\nCons:\n* Arbitrary - Serious board game fans should realize that Armello has\na fair amount of luck involved: Drawing the right cards is important\nand the outcome of almost all conflicts is dice based (although you\nmay burn cards to reduce the factor of luck here). However the real\nelement of luck is in the placement of random events, quests, and\nperils around the map. You may lose a game due to an unlucky\npositioning of an early quest or win one because of a timely spirit\nstone spawn. To win, the rewards from the 'risky' option of quests are\nvery important, but you'll often have about a 40%-60% chance to fail\nthese, taking an expensive penalty instead. This is particularly\nnoticeable when two players are both close to victory and the\ndetermination may hinge on one being a single turn ahead or having a\nlucky/unlucky teleport. It's all fine for a video game, but players\nexpecting a more rigorous experience like mageknight or agricola may\nbe frustrated.\n* UX Issues - The game permits you to play effects during an\nopponent's turn, but doesn't offer a good way to pause or an interrupt\nsystem like Magic's. The result is an imperfect blend of real-time and\nturn-based feels that is jarring at times.  I also experienced are some\nminor issues in the game such as UI elements disappearing or the sound\nfailing during certain effects. None of it threatened stability, however.\n\n---\n\nAs for a sense of how the game plays, you spend your turns travelling around the map, preparing yourself through items and quest rewards to face the King, while trying to prevent the other players from doing the same. Usually there are several objectives you could pursue at once (is it worth taking an extra turn to reach my quest if I explore a dungeon first? What about one less turn if I take damage by going through a swamp?) to keep the mind sufficiently tickled. The game has a stronger emphasis on inter-player conflict than board games like Dominion so many of these decisions may involve whether to spend resources pulling yourself up or pushing someone else down.\n\nTime factors into all of this. There are a very limited number of turns before the King dies. This introduces conflict between the players pursuing different victory conditions: As the King grows physically weaker over time, a player planning the regicide victory may wish to wait till late to face an easier battle. But if they wait too long and the King dies 'naturally' from his advancing corruption, the current prestige leader will win a diplomatic victory as heir.\n\nOverall if you want a beautiful, clever game and don't mind a bit of bad luck, you'll probably like Armello. If nothing else, your eyes will thank you.","September 8, 2015","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The UI desperately needs a button that gives a player a quick comparison of hero stats and standings (for all players).\n\nI need to play more games to see if there is a runaway prestige issue. Prestige serves as both a potential victory condition AND a means of enacting temporary rules that benefit some players and punish others. A prestige leader is not only in a winning position but can continue to enact edicts that keep the other players down. This may be a positive design choice that prevents too much wildly swinging, bash-the-leader gameplay but I need to see more games before I can judge.\n\nRecommended with the caveat that the buyer realizes that they are buying a "digital board game" (essentially) and I would have felt a lot more comfortable paying $15 (or less) as it currently feels like a very well-made ipad game.\n\n","September 7, 2015","true","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The trick then is to be able to revise your plans immediately and go for a new victory condition, if that one seems more plausible than your old one. Also, sadly, a lot of online games I've playe so far are marred by people disconnecting. But that's a problem with the player base.

Don't be decieved because it's a "board game". If you have an old computer that struggles to run Civilization 5 then you will run into the same problems\n- Turns feel really long.\n- Feels incomplete. I feel that it's missing some features that it should have like the options to fine tune graphics or gameplay features. I'm sure these features will come in time.\n- No hot seat gaming.\n\nNow some people complain about the RNG. I don't think it's a problem because it actually averages out. For example, if you have a character with 6 dice rolls. You have a 1/2 chance of getting 1 point of attack per roll. That means on average you should only get about 3 attack rolls. You might get more or less but point is you are very unlikely to score all 6 dice rolls as attacks. If you take this in mind rather than hoping to getting "double sixes" then it will be a much more pleasant experiance.\n\nIt's a board game so expect to lose some games because you were not lucky enough.\n\nOverall I'd definitly buy it if you enjoy board games and can get 3-4 friend to play with.","September 12, 2015","true","40.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Gameplay is easy to pick up, but has enough nuances and options to keep players hooked and learning more and more each match. Matches tend to take an hour to complete roughly, but in Single Player the autosave function guarantees you can drop out and back into the action at any time. If you're even remotely curious or interested in this game, I'd certainly recommend you purchase it!","September 8, 2015","true","38.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has beautiful visuals and is a fun digital board game. There are four win scenarios with 8 characters and 4 clans. Each character has unlockable upgrades and special abilities unique to them and their clan. Most critique comes from the chance based system and "randomness" nature of the game, but it is a board game. Most board games have that random factor (especially dice games), but Armello has strategy behind it. It is also a hell lot of fun (especially with friends) and has online! I definitely recommend the game and if you still feel on the fence about it, wait for it to go on sale! You'll have fun!!!","September 6, 2015","true","23.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The UI desperately needs a button that gives a player a quick comparison of hero stats and standings (for all players).\n\nI need to play more games to see if there is a runaway prestige issue. Prestige serves as both a potential victory condition AND a means of enacting temporary rules that benefit some players and punish others. A prestige leader is not only in a winning position but can continue to enact edicts that keep the other players down. This may be a positive design choice that prevents too much wildly swinging, bash-the-leader gameplay but I need to see more games before I can judge.\n\nRecommended with the caveat that the buyer realizes that they are buying a "digital board game" (essentially) and I would have felt a lot more comfortable paying $15 (or less) as it currently feels like a very well-made ipad game.\n\n","September 7, 2015","true","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although not especially deep at the moment, it's fun and has\ngreat potential for future patches.\n\n---\n\nPros:\n* Art - The art style in this game is absolutely beautiful. The cards\nare lovely with their subtle animations and the 2D character art lends\nthe heroes a lot of personality. Sound effects and music are\nappropriate and lovely. I'm looking forward to the DLC at least as\nmuch for new art and cinematics as I am for new mechanical content.\n* Fun and Balance - Hard to quantify rigorously, but the game feels\nfun - it rewards being thoughtful without demanding that every action\nis supremely calculated. Characters feel pretty well balanced given\nthe recent release, although not perfectly so. Mechanics like\ncorruption and the special abilities of followers mean that a single\ncard can be applied in different, interesting ways.\n\nCons:\n* Arbitrary - Serious board game fans should realize that Armello has\na fair amount of luck involved: Drawing the right cards is important\nand the outcome of almost all conflicts is dice based (although you\nmay burn cards to reduce the factor of luck here). However the real\nelement of luck is in the placement of random events, quests, and\nperils around the map. You may lose a game due to an unlucky\npositioning of an early quest or win one because of a timely spirit\nstone spawn. To win, the rewards from the 'risky' option of quests are\nvery important, but you'll often have about a 40%-60% chance to fail\nthese, taking an expensive penalty instead. This is particularly\nnoticeable when two players are both close to victory and the\ndetermination may hinge on one being a single turn ahead or having a\nlucky/unlucky teleport. It's all fine for a video game, but players\nexpecting a more rigorous experience like mageknight or agricola may\nbe frustrated.\n* UX Issues - The game permits you to play effects during an\nopponent's turn, but doesn't offer a good way to pause or an interrupt\nsystem like Magic's. The result is an imperfect blend of real-time and\nturn-based feels that is jarring at times.  I also experienced are some\nminor issues in the game such as UI elements disappearing or the sound\nfailing during certain effects. None of it threatened stability, however.\n\n---\n\nAs for a sense of how the game plays, you spend your turns travelling around the map, preparing yourself through items and quest rewards to face the King, while trying to prevent the other players from doing the same. Usually there are several objectives you could pursue at once (is it worth taking an extra turn to reach my quest if I explore a dungeon first? What about one less turn if I take damage by going through a swamp?) to keep the mind sufficiently tickled. The game has a stronger emphasis on inter-player conflict than board games like Dominion so many of these decisions may involve whether to spend resources pulling yourself up or pushing someone else down.\n\nTime factors into all of this. There are a very limited number of turns before the King dies. This introduces conflict between the players pursuing different victory conditions: As the King grows physically weaker over time, a player planning the regicide victory may wish to wait till late to face an easier battle. But if they wait too long and the King dies 'naturally' from his advancing corruption, the current prestige leader will win a diplomatic victory as heir.\n\nOverall if you want a beautiful, clever game and don't mind a bit of bad luck, you'll probably like Armello. If nothing else, your eyes will thank you.","September 8, 2015","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art is great, the characters are very well animated, and the weapons are very original.\nIn short, take turns with the three other heros and pick 1 of the 4 different ways to win the game. The game play does not take that long. Normally by dawn 8 or 9 the game, (this being the longest). If you can kill the king sooner, then it will be even quicker. If you are going for a prestige victory then you are keeping the other heros away from the king. Which again, turn 8 or 9 depending on events. Time wise I'd say the game takes 40 - 60 minutes.

It's a little like dungeons and dragon's, where the randomness factor comes into play during combat and cave exploration. Anyway, the world itself is gorgeous. at the start of the game you can go through a tutorial (which  highly recommend you do) and it will run you through the main characters, and their passive's and perks, e,g, river, from wolf clan, she carries a bow and arrow with her, if YOU attack anything, she will fire her bow and deal 1 damage before attacking, making her an excellent asassin. The end goal of the game depends on how you play, and play as/with. You can win either by, killing the king, and not duying during the combat, waiting for the king to die and (if you were well renound throughout the kingdom) take his place automatically, or you can bring 4 spirit stones to him, cleansing him of his corrupt ways. Thats just the main point's of the game.\n\nAs soon as i understood how the game mechanics worked, i  was immedietly captured by it.\n\nNow this game is good, and kept me busy for a couple of rounds in a row, but after a while, you have to walk away, now thats not a bad thing, EVERY TIME, its a new quest,journey,story and experience, you can and probably will come back to it over and over again, the fact that you can come so close to winning and to lose it all in  an instant, is just great, for once it feels good to NEARLY win, still getting xp for that clan and for your self, it's just great.\n\nanyway,ill leave it here, yes without a doubt, recommend this game, no faults with it, it's in good committed hands ( i think) and i hope more branches of this game. love it.","October 28, 2015","true","34.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Indeed, succesful players are going to be those who are able to think on their feet rather than those attempting to execute a long term strategy.\n\nThe map is small, yet difficult to cross, with numerous obstacles and choke points barring the way. Players can win this game "on the board" by holding strategic positions, through playing cards that provide various spells, buff/debuffs, by setting traps to disrupt other players, or by defeating the corrupt King of Armello. Players can achieve political victory by accumulating prestige, military victory by defeating the king, magical victory by destroying the rot infesting the land and inflicting the king, or by becoming rotten themselves. A number of resources and skills are available to the player including gold, wit, magic, prestige and rot, and all provide advantages or can be spent in battle or in general play.\n\nCombat is conducted via die roll where players attempt to gain an advantage by equiping various items, and by becoming more experienced and applying various spell to themselves and their enemies. Terrain and the use thereof can also provide significant in combat, be it through stealth or defensive bonuses for fortifying oneself in mountains or settlements.\n\nGames take about an hour to complete, and each will provide a new challenge.

Much much more could be done with the platform and I hope that LoG takes advantage of this more and more, with more quests, more cards, different game modes (maybe with alternate map for coop campaign roleplayey thing?), more house rules, more characters, some sort of faction system to do 2v2, LAN multiplayer (The GoG version has or used to have a 4 digit number for each private room that you had to give to your friends to join and it works on LAN, while the multiplayer of this version is solely through Steam (you need Steam Overlay activated or it is a complete no go).\n--\nHere are some things that dont click too well with me or suggestions:\n\n-I noticed that the quests are generally the same, you can expect the same three for your first quest and so on. Combat is fine, with some ok armor and weapon any character can be an ok fighter.\n\n-But I do have a little bit of an issue with questing being the sole way so far to increase your stats permanently, there is no real benefit to killing banes or heroes other than the rot, prestige or healing bonuses, and there is no real benefit in defeating perils unless you have a bard follower. Also some perils could make use of different stats, facing a band of mercenaries should be "fight" instead of "wits" and dealing with a magical peril should be "spirit" and not "wits".\n\n-As a suggestion I think you should have some bonus to fighting infected or corrupted heroes (and banes) if you have collected the necessary spirit stones, you are even glowing magestically, yet corrupted heroes (and banes) are unphased by this (and you can still take rot points like usual).\n\n-Also, I would like to be able to start my games with a completely empty hand so I can draw what we would like to start with, seems pretty sensible, but that's just me (get OK gear, then worry about other things).\n\n-And finally characters characters characters, the more the better!\n---\nAs for the praise:\n\n-Visuals are amazing, you will not be dissappointed. And the Steam version seems to be well polished, I havent experienced a single crash with it, and there are some minor bugs but they will not impede gameplay (that I have seen so far).\n\n-It provides a pretty satisfactory multiplayer experience.\n\n-It also appears well optimized, which is a surprise to me nowdays since I run on an outdated system (aka, a pentium 4 with an old 6200GS and DDR1 ram, WinXP SP3 32bit) and it runs surprisingly well. I just hope that this doesnt change with upcomming updates like other games I played *cough* Starbound *cough* sorry.\n\n-Soundtrack is absolutely excellent, you should get it, I should get it, everyone should get it.\n\nAnd that's all. If the game changes enough, I may update this.","November 17, 2015","true","31.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Excessive reliance on RNG. RNG itself isn't bad, but when its an overwhelming factor that takes more importance than strategizing or good tactics, it just feels like you're playing a more complicated version of Monopoly in the end. There's thankfully some strategizing in how you choose to play certain characters and highlight their strengths, but it still feels somewhat limiting as their seems to be one dominant playstyle for a character. There's also a pretty strong snowballing effect, so when you're consistently dying / not hitting your quests due to random luck, you just feel sort of screwed.\n\n2. Lack of chat. The developers have chosen not to implement chat due to concern regarding 'safe spaces'. I don't particularly understand the concept of playing multiplayer without being able to chat with each others (and no, pre-set voice commands don't count as chat), let alone playing a board game / table top game without being able to communicate. The entire fun in a board game is communication. Furthermore, Armello games take roughly 1-2 hours to complete and you'll be waiting 5~ minutes for other players to finish their turns at sometimes. Not having chat to kill the time while waiting is a pretty awful decision. You can get around this by playing with others and there is an online community, but if you're looking for a quick game you might end up waiting for a while.\n\n\nConceptually, the game is interesting, but I think the gameplay could use some tuning to be less luck-oriented and more skill-oriented, while the chat thing is just absolutely silly.","May 29","false","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The community continues to grow, the game continues to get better, and I can only imagine what amazing things are in store from its actual release and onward.\n\nLoG and the rest of the Armello community are some of the best people I've gotten to know, and every dime spent on this project was well used. I can say with a surety that this game is well worth your money, and that this game is ten-times as good as it was in its Early EA.\n\nIf you're still unsure about whether or not this game will interest you, I suggest keeping an eye on LoG's twitch channel, and watching the weekly community vs devs games (they're a hoot!).\n\n~~~\nEdited Original Review:\n\n\nSo, even after my first match with AI, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. The TLC that LoG constantly states they've given this game is quite evident, even from the main menu and first few turns. Literally everything in this game works together to create quite a triumphant and easily enjoyed experience that does not disappoint. The art work, fabulous. The music, fantastic. The gameplay, classic, yet new.\n\nPerformance:\nI have helped LoG (and continue to help them) squash as many bugs as possible, and I can honestly say that they are rather fast and efficient at getting rid of game bugs. Thankfully this game runs rather well on my lower-mid level laptop. Not to mention that it has a rather low space footprint for a game of this kind.\n\nAesthetics:\nThis game is very pleasing to look at and to listen to. If you don't believe me, you obviously haven't watched the trailers. The trailers alone send shivers down the spine, and leave a considerable amount of chilling goosebumps upon one's person. I sincerely hope that the OST will at some point be available, because it would be an easy buy, even if you don't play the game, for the music, too, plays an integral part in sweeping you away to the magical land that is Armello.\n\nGameplay:\nArmello is designed to play a lot like a table-top RPG/Card/Board game. Each of the 4 base characters have initial stats and a unique ability, and receive bonuses based on a ring and amulet of the player's choosing. The characters play a large part in how the outcome of the game can be achieved by catering to different playstyles, making the character choice a rather important one - though, not necessarily game-defining. While one can achieve different types of victories with the same character, some conditions are easier met by certain characters.\n\nEach turn can easily be a game changer, as players are constantly in a close struggle to gain prestige, gold, magic, or treasure all necessary things to taking the throne, the ultimate objective of the match. There is seldom a point in the game where one can relax, because someone else is almost always on your heels in terms of strength, or physical/magical gains.\n\nExperience:\nThis game is rather easy to jump into and enjoy, however, it is highly recommended to look into the game guide here on Steam. Even with its current, early mechanics, this game is easily replayable. Each match and turn is able to bring quite a different experience, and only gets better in a game against other humans. The characters and other pre-match choices can make a large difference based on who's playing who, so the strategizing happens from the get-go.\n\nI chose to buy in because this game interested me, and I know that being an Indie Dev is far from easy, and every dollar counts. However, I do again, sincerely hope that this first project doesn't leave a bad taste in the gaming community's mouth because of a mistake made in their infancy (the KickStarter incident, which as since been cleared up!).\n\nPseudo TL;DR -\n\nThis game is a rather specific purchase...If this is a game you're looking for, I can personally recommend it.\n\nFor those of you sitting on the fence: Trust me, this game is well worth it, and the community is truthfully one of a kind.","January 23, 2015","true","64.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I cringe and hand over my money—I braved the depths of the local dungeon and potential face-off with a Bane to obtain it. There are but a few days left of the King’s life, and I’m incredibly close to obtaining the means to cure him and save the land from devastation. I am now forced to decide between trying to cure him (which may be impossible in the allotted remaining time), or attempt another approach.\n\nThis is but one playthrough of League Of Geeks’s first title, Armello—a high fantasy digital board game. Currently in Early Access, Armello sports a unique design centered around 4 players (Human or AI controlled) attempting to either overturn the beleaguered King, or to save him against a mysterious plague known as The Rot. Armello also maintains a somewhat procedural design, in which map tiles are randomly placed each game in order to create unique playthroughs each time. It’s with this design in mind that it makes sense the Armello game board is so small, but at the same time it often feels a bit too cramped.\n\nArmello’s 54 tiled design makes for fast paced sessions, coupled with the ability to move up to 3 spaces per turn (or 2 if you intend to cross a mountain), accessing a lot of the board’s missions and special objectives seems quite easy. Or so I initially thought. Attempting any of Armello’s 3 possible game endings means staying heavily focused on a series of gameplay elements at all times and more often than not (unless you get insanely lucky), you will find yourself abandoning your current ending goal for the most common: Prestige (more on that later). But at the same time you will likely be bumping into one of the other 3 Heroes, the King’s Guard, or the terrifying Banes. Sometimes this can get in the way of gameplay and feels somewhat oppressive, albeit understandable.\n\nPersonally I would love to see larger board sizes incorporated into later builds of Armello so I can further customize the experience for longer and more in-depth sessions. This, however, leads into Armello’s fairly short session time thanks to each playthrough lasting a maximum of 18 rounds (9 Day/9Night turns). Not having an option for more turns really puts the squeeze on the game’s potential win outcomes. Rounds are managed by the King’s health, which drops by 1 after every Night turn passes (1 day/1 night). Day turns are the safer of the two as Banes deal far less damage and appear less frequently, while night-time makes them stronger, and occasionally spawn from dungeons. Some Heroes, such as Thane, gain benefits at night like an extra attack die.\n\nArmello uses Gold and Magic Points as currency for using their myriad card selection ranging from equippable combat effects, to direct player sabotage. You can also take your cards and burn them during dice rolls to guarantee specific dice outcomes; this removes a number of dice equal to the number of cards burned, but can potentially guarantee winning or overcoming a trap.\n\nArmello’s other form of “currency” is Prestige, a form of positive notoriety that is earned from killing Banes, other Heroes, finishing Quests, or from cards. The player with the most Prestige gets to pick the King’s daily decree each Day Turn, and will win should the King die (end of turn 18) via a Prestige Win. This type of win is the most common from the games I played, and is the easiest to obtain. After 3 times of getting a Prestige win I found the mechanic a bit unbalanced and boring. The other possible ways to win are: Killing the King and surviving, and curing the King via Spirit Stones. Both options require intense player building with the latter needing a focus on good timing and Quest management.\n\nAll of this in mind, Armello sports some of the most amazing art and music I’ve seen in an Early Access product. The character models, the animations, and even the cards themselves are all beautifully crafted to bring the game to life. It has this undeniable charm that pervades every aspect of the game, from the Heroes both majestic and shifty, to the Banes—unearthly Rot creatures—who maintain an air of danger and threat. There are a few minor hitches such as the King’s Declaration graphic staying on-screen for far too long and obstructing any action taking place during that event. The music as well is moody and ethereal, creating a mystical atmosphere throughout each playthrough. However, when browsing cards on the Main Menu there are no sound effects when clicking on cards.\n\nIt’s still very soon in Early Access, but Armello is definitely one of the more tightly designed digital board games I’ve played as of late, and its future developments could prove quite interesting. I suggest keeping your eye on it if you’re on the fence. If you really enjoy digital board games, though, grab this and run with it along the development process.","June 10, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I enjoyed the tutorial. The graphics are lovely. There is a potentially deep, intelligent, strategic game under here. So here's why I feel like I wasted my money:\n\n1.) The AI is terrible. I "won" my first game vs. the AI because they killed the king while I was prestige leader. There is absolutely no reason for them to do this - it was a move which ensured a victory for me which I could not have secured for myself for many turns.\n\n2.) A game will last somewhere between 25-40 turns as a guess, but is generally decided within the first 3-4. It is very, very easy to get into a position where either A.) one player is so far ahead their victory is certain, but won't happen for another 3/4 of the game B.) you can't win because you lost a few early battles to the RNG and now can't hope to get back on your feet.\n\n3.) The battles are a snooze-fest and you are forced to watch *every single one*. I don't mean every one you are involved in - I mean battles between two characters who aren't even opponents of yours (essentially NPCs) on the other side of the map which have 0 bearing on your strategy etc. Battles you do not care about. Battles that last around a minute and consist of randomly thrown dice.\n\n4.) There is some small element of strategy involved in dice throwing -you can trade your cards to lock dice into position - but god knows why you'd want to when a dice roll can and will randomly reroll itself giving you extra victory points/defence/etc if it lands on the "right" side. Why would you trade the possibility of this potentially infinite loop for anything else?\n\n5.) I think the game is supposed to be primarily multiplayer - but the same problems of it being essentially a dice rolling sim persist. What's more the "chat" system is restricted to a handful of clickable speech buttons which don't actually even say the thing that's on them ("oops" becomes "well, that could have gone better" etc.). Also see the game being won/lost in a few turns yet lasting so much longer than that it's literally painful.\n\nI played for less than 5 hours I know, and I would say at least 2 of those were me giving it extra play time so i could be sure I was being fair. I do not understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this game. If it was £3-£5 or still in early access I would give it a break but as it stands this is a real waste of your time and money.\n\nFinally: everyone who disagrees with this review, please, please, please explain why I am wrong. Like many of the other negative reviews say I desperately *want* to love this game but I could get the same gameplay value rolling a dice and trying to get the same number 5 times in a row. If there is something I am missing that makes this game amazing despite my reservations, please point it out!","February 5","false","11.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","6"

Due to connectivity problems, my playtime has not been registering correctly for many games. That being said, I played this for about two hours.\n\nEver read that book series called "Redwall?"\nThe imagery in this reminds me so much of when I read some of the books in that series years ago. Your choices for characters are anthromorphic animals, with different strengths and drawbacks. I will confess that I expected more of an RPG than a board game with this, but that was my mistake. The imagery is definitely rich here, and if you're into fantasy novels, there's a good chance that you'll enjoy looking at the game for awhile. The visuals were probably my single favorite part of this game, but I can't say that's not due to my weak understanding of the genre.\n\nGrid-Based Board Game\nReally, I should have prepared myself better for this. I'm not very good at this type of game, and I don't know if that's because I haven't played very many of them, or if it's because I'm simply impatient. The gameplay is easy to get the hang of, the tutorials are supremely helpful, and for a gamer like me it probably presents more of a challenge than it would for someone accustomed to this sort of thing. The inclusion of multiplayer is a big plus, I can see that being a determining factor when other people I know obtain the game and want to play something. The board game aspect is very strong with this - dice rolling, cards, etc. I'm a sucker for this sort of thing, but it works so much better within a multiplayer setting, where my playing was focused on a single player campaign. That's not to say it wasn't fun, that's just to say that I'm confused easily by this sort of game.\n\nGotta Love That Soundtrack\nThe soundtrack for this is awesome. I've played a lot of games recently with great soundtracks, and it's starting to spoil me. My biggest complaint about most games prior to recent plays is that the soundtracks just aren't that great - for whatever reason this ignores that rule and creates a great atmosphere. As I said about the feeling of the book Redwall, earlier, I imagine that this would be a soundtrack to a movie or game made from the series, and combined with the imagery, it creates a pleasant atmosphere that doesn't become stale quickly.\n\nOverall Opinion\nGraphically, musically, this game ranks very high on the list. Without being able to comment on the gameplay with any authority, because I don't normally play this sort of game, I have to say that it's rather difficult to get started with...It's not a "get-up-and-go" sort of game, but if you're a stronger fan of the genre than I am, I'm sure you'll find it pleasant. The screen is packed full of things that you can use, actions to take, and the way the tutorial system is set up is fantastic.\n\nI will probably have to play this game more when some of my friends get it, because I am recommending it! Based on my limited knowledge of the genre, but enjoying the overall atmosphere and pleasantries of the game, I'm not hesitant to give it a solid 7.5/10.\n\nSo, final: 7.5/10\n\nI will probably revisit this review after I play more of it, and definitely after I play a multiplayer campaign. As it is, I failed at nearly everything I tried to do - so the game is a challenge if you're not familiar with the genre!

The 4 characters introduced with the initial early access build each play up different strengths and weaknesses exposing distinct strategies, while still allowing for a variety of general strategies. With the different game winning conditions, as long as players are active a couple setbacks do not feel game ending. The prime example of what feels like an out of the box come back is the rot win, allowing death to be the means forwards. I've had a great time playing the game and look forward to the new cards, additional heroes and an expanded community of players.","February 18, 2015","true","211.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've put about 4 hours into the game thus far into this early access title and overall, I've enjoyed it. The game has a great card game/board game hybrid feel to it and there are some distinct "Game of Thrones" vibes to the game that I really enjoy. That being said, I do feel after a few hours that the game is slightly repetitive at this early access stage and sometimes I find the AI to just generally not be the brightest. Do not misundertstand, this game feels very polished- particularly for a title in "Early Access", but it does not yet feel complete at this stage. I think there is a really great game buried here, but I don't believe it's reached that point yet. I hope League of Geeks will continue to flesh out the game and push this game farther along. They could have a really great game on their hands with some additional content and mechanic tweaking.\n\nIN SUMMARY: Despite some flaws and repetition, I would still recommend this game as a "Buy" as I'm confident the final product will be very solid and you can definitely have some fun with the game "as-is". I will follow-up on this review as the game continues to develop.","January 25, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The gameplay is very good and well structured, although it does require some more balancing. It's much much easier to win by prestige amount than any other way. As soon as that's balanced a little more, this game is a pearl among rocks I would recommend to everyone.\n\nTechnically I've only had issues with the game not registering my graphics card correctly and thereby forcing me to play in lowest quality, but as it's on an Early Access state, that's more than understandable at this point.\n\nI've had great experiences with this so far and can't wait to see what's in store for the final version.

Would the RPG element be complete enough? Would the game be deep enough in a one hour play through? Would it be exciting enough to get me to play it over and over?  More importantly, would I ever choose to play Armello when I could otherwise play Settlers of Catan or Dominion on my kitchen table?\n\nThe answer is YES, to all of these questions.\n\nThe RPG element is too downplayed to really be called "RPG". It is more "inspired by" RPG. The closest thing I can think of to it is Munchkin—the RPG parody. Yes, you go around and get treasures and equip weapons, but the real reason for doing this is to get a strategic advantage, not just to make yourself more badass. The advantages are sufficient that you are encouraged to quest not because the quest is interesting (it's not) but because if you can complete it, you'll be one step farther than your opponents to achieving late game dominance.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics and win conditions, the latest update, Engines of Fate, has greatly improved the chances that trying for another victory condition other than a prestige (points) victory could nab you the win. Better, even if they don't, trying for another victory condition could give you the advantage you need in the late game to lock down a prestige victory as a fall back. It is this full-game strategy that makes Armello worth playing. Once the full version is released, I expect that this to be an extremely replayable game, and a refreshing change from most turn-based video games like Civilization that take most of a day or longer to play.","April 6, 2015","true","45.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's essentially a turn based board game which supports up to four players at once, with players attempting to win the game in one of the four ways to win. Each player selects a character and each character has different starting stats and a unique ability. Each player will begin the game and select a quest out of a few different alternatives. The quest will boost a stat and give a chance to win gear. Gear is great in this game and I've seen most games come down to gear loadouts and, of course, dice rolls. Oh yes, a public service announcement: anyone who doesn't like dice mechanics should probably bypass this title as it is ALL dice!\n\nThere is also the rot game mechanic. Rot is a stat that is basically like evil corruption. I mention this separately, just in case there are any players, like me, that like to take the left hand path and play evil. Armello indeed has the low road and it takes the form of rot. Get to a higher level of rot than the King (the villain) and you will get a huge bonus. Plus, I have rarely seen other players use that route, increasing its novelty with multiplayer.\n\nNow here are some things I dislike about Armello. I think that there are some balancing issues, especially for Corrupt characters (ie. very rare corruption cards) and a complete lack of aesthetic customization to characters. I'd love to take my evil bear priest and trick her out.\n\nAgain, if you like strategy, board games or RPG's, pick up this title. Armello is one of my new favorites and with multiplayer matches only lasting just above an hour or so, I'm not sinking a whole afternoon into it.\n\n","September 7, 2015","true","48.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's fun, it's replayable, and it's nice to look at.\n\nBut if you like reading longer reviews -\n\nArmello is a turn-based strategy roleplay game, built much like one would build a board game. In fact, I would go as far as to call this a, 'Virtual Boardgame'. The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from that: Rolling dice, moving tiles, drawing cards, and collecting stuff, until you can claim victory, or the timer runs out. Gameplay is a bit repetitive, but you certainly don't play Monopoly because of the ways you can innovate. There are several ways to aquire victory; some of which are somewhat hard, and there are playstyles that show through that. It's very hard to secure a 'Rot' victory, but fairly easy to accumulate prestige, and simply wait the timer out.\n\nI really like the art style, and I am a big fan of the 'furry' theme. Don't worry, non-furs, there's no Yiffing here. It's visually appealing, and the music matches what's going on on the board very well, as well as helping to really immerse you in the game. Though, I wouldn't exactly say that the soundtrack alone is worth half the game's pricetag, (at a whopping $9.99 at the time of this review) it definitely helps my score. It's very moving, and flowing, and keeps a light-hearted tone until the grim of battle finds you for the first time.\n\nOverall, I have to give the game a 8/10, marred only by the steep pricetag, and a lack of a campaign.","September 7, 2015","true","26.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The devs were remarkably on-point with updates for content, AI, and game play issues.  I am just floored by the experience of watching this game grow.\n\nAs for the game itself? It has a small community right now, but even the single player creates amazing scenarios and so many moments of nail biting tension that you will love and hate and get to experience every time you play. It is probably one of the best uses of a digital platform for a board game design I've ever seen, up there and perhaps beating Civilization.  It feels like a board game that simplifies what would be an immense amount of complexity and a game box the size of a Cathode Ray Tube TV into background programming.\n\nThe negatives are there, of course. The graphics can suffer at high res, the mouse sensitivity has cost me a few games (mostly from a card not burning in time, or being played to the wrong hero) and the Rot victory is incredibly difficult to get if you don't base your entire game around it, but it is so, so satisfying when it works that I cannot truly fault it for that.  The first two issues are likely because of the game being also developed for mobile, and the last feels a bit more like the game designers discouraging you from being totally evil the entire game.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game very much so to all the folks looking for a game that's fun, gorgeous, and will leave you sweating until the king's crown has fallen down.","September 7, 2015","true","41.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A very good product of a designed based on hybridizing board/dice/card games with RPG / 4x-esque games.  It might be a bit too oversimplified, but deeper strategies do exist.\n\nMy favorite part about the game (and the part in which I think it does the best) is its job of developing and presenting the theme.  The artwork, the lore, the presentation of the entire story (which is unforutnatly a bit short) was very well done.  The win conditions are all very fitting, from slaying the king in direct combat to submitt oneself to the corrupting Rot, it all goes with the lore very nicely.  At the end of each game you can pretty much imagine a tale written about what happened in the past 1 or 2 hour of gameplay, as the mechanic of the game trasnlates into a story smoothly.\n\nNow the gameplay in itself is not bad at all.  People say it is too luck dependent, but really it's just a factor you stratgize around.  The actual range of risk analysis isn't so big.  Sure, rollin 4 dice might sometime beat someone who is rolling 6, but that should be in your consideration of margin of risk and possiblity.  Engagment with dice differentiation of 4 or more is rarely unexpected.  Furthermore, the overall health of all the character is relatively low in comparsion too all the things that can kill you.  It's more often than not that both combatants just die from fighting than one guy winning purely due to chance.  The only thing that is bit too chancy is quests and spirit stones.  Although they normally don't change the outcome too much, it's a weird mechanic of odds with a payoff that doens't really makes much sense.\n\nIn other words, the game has set a very good premise on this hybrid genre.  It has a good base, a great art form, phenomonial theme and lore.  All it needs is to expand on the mechanics, extend compaign story, rework the chance mechanics a little.  I hope they can pack a lot of more good content in a DLC or something, because otheriwse there would be little incentive to keep working on the same game.\n\n8/10 for novelty.  10/10 if you are big on thematic and artistic elements.","September 8, 2015","true","47.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Some of them have been pretty good.\n\nPick one of 8 heroes, each from one of four clans. Wolf, Bear, Rat, or Rabbit. Chose the ring and amulet that will give them special, clan specific, bonuses. On top of the heroes unique ability. Then begin the quest to become King or Queen of Armello. The king will succumb to the Rot a little after a week. Depending on certain choices made before day 9. Or the king defeats a few would be heroes.\n\nChose cards based on three types. Trickery, that may require gold, or prestiege. Magic, wich requires the magic resource to use. Or Items, requiring gold. Each type may also cause corruption. Corrupted weapons, magic, and trickery will cause the user to contract Rot. Becoming corrupted has its own benefits and drawbacks. And is one of the four ways to claim the throne. You could also win by being prestige leader. By combat. Or by spirit stone, and banish the king. Its never clear how you will win each game. Or who will ultimately become the next ruler of Armello.\n\nPositives:\n+ Nice artstyle\n+ Neat game and dice mechanics\n+ 4 different ways to win\n+ No two games play exactly alike\n+ Immersive music\n+ Procedurally generated maps, no two maps are exactly the same\n+ Interesting and animated cards\n+ Addicting, reminds me of hearthstone in a way\n+ Can still use cards, even if it isnt your turn\n\n+/- Luck plays a big part in some games, epic underdog wins happen.\n\nNegatives\n- Only 8 characters currently, the amount of heroes feels small\n- Maps only have one size & cannot be changed, currently\n- Games are short, only four-ish quests can be done before the king dies\n- No animation skips, you have to watch the AI's turns.\n- No team game modes. A Clan Vs.

It's essentially a turn based board game which supports up to four players at once, with players attempting to win the game in one of the four ways to win. Each player selects a character and each character has different starting stats and a unique ability. Each player will begin the game and select a quest out of a few different alternatives. The quest will boost a stat and give a chance to win gear. Gear is great in this game and I've seen most games come down to gear loadouts and, of course, dice rolls.

The devs were remarkably on-point with updates for content, AI, and game play issues.  I am just floored by the experience of watching this game grow.\n\nAs for the game itself? It has a small community right now, but even the single player creates amazing scenarios and so many moments of nail biting tension that you will love and hate and get to experience every time you play. It is probably one of the best uses of a digital platform for a board game design I've ever seen, up there and perhaps beating Civilization.  It feels like a board game that simplifies what would be an immense amount of complexity and a game box the size of a Cathode Ray Tube TV into background programming.\n\nThe negatives are there, of course. The graphics can suffer at high res, the mouse sensitivity has cost me a few games (mostly from a card not burning in time, or being played to the wrong hero) and the Rot victory is incredibly difficult to get if you don't base your entire game around it, but it is so, so satisfying when it works that I cannot truly fault it for that.  The first two issues are likely because of the game being also developed for mobile, and the last feels a bit more like the game designers discouraging you from being totally evil the entire game.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game very much so to all the folks looking for a game that's fun, gorgeous, and will leave you sweating until the king's crown has fallen down.","September 7, 2015","true","41.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The artwork is fantastic and the game does a great job building an interesting environment.\n\nWhile Armello does take some time to adjust to, the gameplay is quite interesting and provides for plenty of opportunities for strategy. With four different paths to victory no two games will ever be the same. Armello does a great job combining elements of RPGs, card games, and other tabletop mechanics.\n\nWhile my playtime is currently kind of low, Armello is not the type of game where I would play multiple games in a row but it is the type of game that I plan on playing every so often.\n\nIf the concept behind the game interests you and you like board games in addition to video games, I think you will really enjoy Armello.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Armello. Other than the review copy I received no other compensation for this review and receiving the review copy had no impact on the content of this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","September 10, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The art is drop dead gorgeous, and the game a ton of fun to play, especially in multiplayer. A special mention to the cards which are all animated and look quite stunning for the most part. It is a game where each turn brings new surprises that you must adapt to with what you have in hand. While there is a strong element of randomness in how fate affects you, you can do a fair bit to mitigate it and adapt to circumstances. The pacing of the game is perfect, there is very little down time. Armello rocks!","September 11, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It features some old ideas but executes them so that they feel new and original.\n\nThe game can be played straight from the box but, as the player gets more involved, the various strategies and mechanics become clearer. Do you strive for strength in close combat or opt for tiptoeing around the world, searching for spirit stones, and using long-range tactics to shatter your opponents?\n\nI love the way this game has been designed. It has the power to immerse and captivate you with plenty of variation and scope for future expansion. Each of the heroes provide a different approach to winning the game and can be further defined by completing quests and obtaining a wide range of useful objects like armour, spells and follower companions. The element of luck and random outcomes makes every game different and entertaining.\n\nIf you enjoy employing your brain, I think you'll really like Armello!","April 2, 2015","true","98.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The real question is, is it enjoyable, and the answer is a resounding yes. Is it worth 25 USD? Well...\n\nBeing early access there are still a few kinks I feel the game needs to work out, but the developers are constantly tweaking the game to make it as fair for all players and strategies as possible. New characters can currently be previewed in game and on the forums, so the current four are certainly not the end all, and more content and game modes are still being worked on. Multiplayer is operating, though it's currently easier to schedule a time with friends than wait for a public match. Single player is still a hoot though, and will keep you busy for hours as you try and achieve the different win conditions for in-game rewards that can be used in multiplayer matches. Artwork and design is also stunningly beautiful.

Multiplayer is regional block by Steam. To change region, go to\n\nSteam -> Settings -> Download -> Download Region\n\nEurope has a big fan base, my favourite region is UK London. I notice that multiplayer's strategy changes base on region.\n\nThis is a tabletop games, takes 10-20 hours to unlock all rings and amulets. Then the only thing left to do is multiplayer. You don't have to put much time into this game to be powerful, don't have to worry that you can't catch up with others after leaving the game once a while. Just play with people whenever you want. You need skills and luck to win, neither devotion nor pay to win.\n\nMove three cells each turn, draw a number of cards base on wit. Cards can be equipments, useable items, spells, traps, etc. Finish quests to gain more stats and rewards. Three ways to kill king, or win with prestige. Every character has their own special ability. Each clan has their unique rings. As a result, strategy is diverse. You can speed up AI in option, and push . button, to speed up AI further, too. In multiplayer, people uses strategies that you never see with AI. I learned a lot in multiplayer.\n\nFor those who complains about randomness. I have played so many turn-based strategy games, a few notable are heroes series, Xcom series, talisman, Elder Sign, Hard West, King’s Bounty, etc. I tend to play on highest difficulty and get boring because it is too easy. In Armello, I win 70-80% against AI because of randomness and I enjoy it. I won’t play this game if I know how to win 100% every time.\n\nMultiplayer is where the real challenge begins. Where you feel anxious and tense, the intense pleasure, a kind of addiction. The stimulation is too good...You don’t want to go back to single player anymore.\n\nConclusion: A Hidden gem. Must play.","May 18","true","202.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

By completing personal quests you get items, gold and other usefull stuff to beat all other players. But beware of them trying to interrupt you.\n\nIt is pretty much RNG at many times - too much for many guys. But it is a board game with dices - so there have to be RNG. However it's much more about how you take adventage of your luck and make your way to victory not too obvious. I really enjoy this game.\n\nIt's pure fun and beautiful.","May 15","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I started it up and sat there doing something else while i waited. the games can be just as slow as the match making but that is expected in a turn based game.  the long slow paced games along with the long slow paced match making just ruined the whole thing for me. On top of that every time i picked a character it gave me a completly random one while the other players all got their choices.\nin short lost of wasted time on a game that isnt interesting enough","May 24","false","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Every choice and strategy I tried to implement was meaningless because the dice never came up my way, and while I appreciate the desire to force the player to change their strategy due to circumstances it became very tedious when it happened all the time.\n\nThis was all from the singleplayer experience, I didn't try multiplayer.  I can't imagine anything would have gone differently though.\n\nPerhaps a decent game for a luckier person, but if you're the sort who rolls poorly this game is just going to be a lesson in frustration.\n\n","May 13","false","4.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","2"
