The controls are sluggish and unresponsive, the physics are pretty janky, and although these is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you can instantly reset a stage whenever you want, restarting can also screw with you because your controls sometimes just don't work for a few moments after you restart, which is frustrating when you get to some later levels that require essentially perfect execution to get a full score, which is hard enough with the game controlling the way it does. Predicting the Plumber's path can be difficult at times, because his timing seems to be somewhat inconsistent in relation to your position, although that might have been me not being accustomed enough to the game. The music gets grating after a while, too.\n\nAlso, whatever you do, do not alt-tab the game (at least if you're in fullscreen). I made the mistake of alt-tabbing, which caused the game to completely lock me out, and after I had to shut it down and restart it, I lost all of the progress I made up to that point. This happened twice, because I guess I don't learn from my own mistakes.\n\nI'm not saying the game should be completely avoided, there's some fun to be had with it, and as I said, the core idea is good enough to carry it. But in it's state right now, it plays like a mess and feels unrefined.","January 1","false","0.6"," 83 of 118 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","83","118","3","8"

Oh yes! be the enemy and the only hero in your kingdom of goons. You know that time when a famous super plumber jumps around the world killing everything he sees? well then let's rotate it. Keep your princess alive and save her before the plumber gets her! kill the plumber well.. not the one with the letter M on his cap.. ugh.. JUST A PLUMBER! Start with a goon that can't even jump, but gets stronger and more powerful level to level. The more levels you beat, the more you unlock. The plumber has unlimited lives, but you have more tries! Stomp him, spike him or freeze him! all of these things are in game and there are even more to check out! Fight through very difficult levels, but thats not a problem, the plumber is the problem! Make Grassland, Desertland and Iceland clearer and saver so the plumber has no more possibility enter these areas again.. if he's not dead. Get all three stars on any map to access the Lost Levels (Map 1) and Minus World (Map 2) also new Lost Levels 2 (Map 3)\n\nWhy I recommend it:\n\nWhen I was a kid I was wondering how it would be if the enemies are the heroes, now we know it!\nI played all day to unlock more troops and bosses. Kill The Plumber plays really great\nand there are no difficult achievements to get. Also a fun challenge fighting through a speedrun mode that takes you time to beat.\n\n- Challenging and enjoyable levels\n- Great working enemies\n- Cool ideas\n- Nice level design\n- Good music\nand more great things!\n\nKill The Plumber is definitely worth to buy. You can also test this game out before buying: www.dojo.com/game/kill-the-plumber (this isn't the new kill the plumber, it's just the old browser version of this game. It doesn't include new worlds and enemies.)\n\nI'm excited for new updates and features\n\nThanks for reading :)","January 9","true","37.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

And it works great.\n\nSave your kingdom from a maniac, princess-stalking plumber who's on a brainless roll. Control several different enemies, often more than one at once. Kill, survive, drop him off the screen, even be a big boss. You get to beat him in many different scenarios, and the faster you do it, the better rating (from 0 to 3 stars).\n\nTruth be told, this is a puzzle game. You need to figure out how to (usually) kill the plumber, which is solving the puzzle. You get lots of puzzles, each with a twist. There's a difficulty curve so you feel the progression. Controls have great response, the plumber always behaves as it should (nothing erratic), and the mechanics are easy to grasp. There are bonus levels in each of the three worlds that are a lot harder, and there is also a time-attack for all the stages in each world. Achievements are included!\n\nThe game looks spot-on considering it's classic platformer theme. It's theme is a parody, so characters are easily recognizeable with their similarities. The interface does it's simple job efficiently, It's easy and really quick to go from levels to options to achievement room (it looks obvious when you play it, which is the point: it's well designed). Art style doesn't look too cartoony nor too stiff.\n\nI've been having a great time with it. I barely ever play single player games, but this one reeled me in. Some more bang to your buck than usual. If you like it's idea, killing the plumber in memorable moments, I deffinetly recommend it.","January 1","true","7.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markofthedead/recommended/420070/","markofthedead","Markness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markofthedead/","135 products in account","Disclaimer: Don’t froth at the mouth/get all grumpy because I am writing a review for a 4 dollar game while having less than 200 hours of gameplay. You get the gist of the game without having to clock in a ton of time, and I am writing this because I want to basically get to the point of figuring out whether this game is worth it for you the consumer (spending 4 bucks).\n\nAnd on to the review..\n\nKill the Plumber is an award-winning 2D platform game where you play the game of Mario, except with a twist.. You are one of the minions whose duty is to take out Mario himself. The man has gone on way too long causing a disturbance in the land where all is edible, so now it is up to you to take out the man who has been giving your people a problem for way too long...\n\nLets get on to the first part of my review:\n\nGameplay: The game itself is fun. It used to be free on a website before, and the developers saw the popularity of the game and decided to try and actually make money from it. So what happened? Well, they added more levels apparently and other stuff, but I cannot really tell as I only have played the paid version of this game. And as mentioned before, this game is fun, it is a nice change of pace from other games, and it is a game that you can pick up and put down (well at least I can). The fun is all about trying to finally be the one who gets to be the hunter instead of the hunted.. So I give the game so far 2.0/2.5 for gameplay.\n\nControls: This is an easy criteria to get a high score for me. And you’d be suprised at how many developers botch it up while putting games on the PC (I’m looking at you Resident Evil 6). But as for the controls for the game itself, it is as good as it can get. But that isn’t too much to be proud of.. 2.0/2.5 for controls.\n\nBugs/Glitches/Game-breaking stuff: Nothing I’ve noted so far, and checking out the steam forums all seems well there too. This is quite surprising as indie games launch as well as a NASA ship taking off on fire.... 2.0/2.5.\n\nValue: This to me is the most important criteria when it comes to buying a game. For others, this may not matter so much. But, the basic calculation I always do is can I get 1$ per hour out of this game? Personally, I don’t think I will. It is hard to tell, but I am blowing through the game. Those of you who are really into this genre and want to perfect this game will definitely get full value however... 1.0/2.5 (for balancing purposes).\n\nOverall  7/10.. Not a bad score, and the real question is whether or not the game is worth 4 bucks. Sure, you’ll have a good time, but is it worth it more than that double-cheeseburger from that place down the street... I dono.. Up to you to decide!\n\nTake a look at my first-impressions of the game if you'd like to get a better look:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=invK7fnjFCQ","January 1","true","2.3"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","16","29","4","6"

You play as the various enemies in the Mushroom Kingdom trying to defeat Mario in a series of single screen action puzzles. Except they obviously don't have the license to those characters, so you are lookalikes trying to kill "The Plumber". Fine. If this didn't feel like a rushed, free flash game with awful music and had proper controller support it could've been pretty good.  Why it lags so much I have no earthly idea. If Nintendo were to use the idea (and perhaps someday they will)  I think they would've done really great things with it.","January 21","false","5.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

Best example is the game 'Spoiler Alert', but with a little more variety than just one character going backwards and having to avoid obstacles. 'Kill the Plumber' tries to take on modern slivers of gaming for those with ADHD when it comes to gaming, and it just turns the original successful formula into something sluggish, boring, and completely uninspiring, all for a higher cost than the original app version just because it's on Steam and has Steam achievements.\n\nI think Charlie Day sums up my reaction to this game about fifteen minutes in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FYTc55nGEI\n\nI can't say it's worth putting in for a refund over.

Or perhaps, exacting revenge on Mario for all the death he's tolled out over the years?  The levels range from easy to a bit annoying/aggravating, however the "difficulty" was a bit scattered throughout for me (instead of a steady escalation).  There were a few levels that involved some pretty darn precise timing that got me stuck for awhile...  I COULD get more than 4 hours out of this...if I practiced to try to "speedrun" each world in the target time shown, but a few of the levels are aggravating enough for me that I have no desire to complete ALL the achievements in this one.\n\nOverall though I had a lot of fun as the cut scenes and mechanics used for the various...enemies?...allies?...were cute tributes to the Mario series.  I picked this up in the Indie Gala bundle that's going on now and I'm glad I had.  While I had fun with this title and would recommend it if you like tribute and puzzles games, I think I would have been more inclined more towards 2 dollars or so (especially as you can apparently play it for free on Newgrounds or whatever).  Like I said, I got mine from a bundle so that was worth for me.","January 21","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can even throw boomerangs that look like socks!\n\nThroughout the game Mario has various abilities like invincibility and fireballs, and sometimes, you even have a time limit for beating the level.\n\nThere are also a bit less than 30 fairly challenging achievements for feeling good about wasting your life killing Mario!\n\nI recommend this game if you want a fairly short, challenging and fun experience.","January 24","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But once you actually try it out, you find out it uses a simple multi stage format similar to a mobile device game where you try to "three-star" each level.
