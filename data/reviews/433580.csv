Ancient cultures, challenging puzzles, time travel, multiple endings. What's not to love? I still have a boxed (yes BOXED) copy of this game on my shelf.\n\nUnfortunately the steam version has serious display issues on my screen. Graphics issues and frequent black screens make it nearly unplayable.\n\nDESPITE that, I'm still recommending it. On sale right now its just a little over a dollar. Buy it and pray they patch the graphics issues!","April 22","true","0.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
