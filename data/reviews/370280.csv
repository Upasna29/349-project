The story is nicely crafted and well thought out, as you are given the perspective of the story from the different characters. In addition, the artwork of the game, as well as the soundtrack, are excellently presented and add meaningful immersion to the story.

Season of 12 Colors seemed appealing to me due to its warm rural summer setting. After finishing the game, though, I was a bit disappointed.\n\nThe story starts off light and then turns into a bittersweet tragedy with magical fantasy elements. What I didn't like about it is pretty close to what bothered me in "Ame no Marginal" and "40 Days and 40 Night of Rain": The fantasy elements primary seem to serve to purpose of creating the drama; they aren't part of the world until they are needed, and inventing whatever rules are needed to give the story some emotional twists feels artificial to me.\n\nI also wasn't too pleased with the writing quality. The translation was okay in general, but there were quite a few typos, grammar mistakes and awkward-sounding phrases – probably lines translated too close to the original text that don't sound good in English. Example:\n\n"She has a simple life.\nShe has the 'current' moment.\nShe has a cute child with a laughter like sunshine."\n\nLine 2 sounds really unnatural and line 3 makes no sense at all; it should probably be "was" instead of has.\n\nThe writing style is pretty simple, and while that's not necissarily a problem, "Season of 12 Colors" has (like most visual novels) no recognizable style which makes it feel a bit generic.\n\nThe art is pretty good. Warm colors, beautiful backgrounds, nice characters designs. The music was also decent.\n\nOverall it's not a bad story, but if feels constructed and the writing style is fairly generic. I can see why people find "Season of 12 Colors" appealing – and I genuinely like some of its ideas –, but it just doesn't work for me. I can't say I regret the purchase, though, the pricing is very fair.\n\nRecommendations for people who liked "Season of 12 Colors":\n- Ame no Marginal -Rain Marginal- (short visual novel (~2-3h) available on Steam in the same style, but with more elaborate world building)\n- 40 Days and Nights of Rain (short (~1h) free visual novel in the same style)\n- planetarian (short visual novel (~5h) available on Steam with very good world and character building)\n- True Remembrance (free short visual novel (~6h) with excellent writing, good world building and very sweet and warm character interactions – http://trueremembrance.insani.org/ )","March 17","false","1.7"," 47 of 77 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","47","77","7","2"

The art looks like beautiful painting through most of the game and the game has great animation where applicable. The scenery is some of the most beautiful I have yet seen in any visual novel. The story is sad and thought provoking in the same way as Ame no Marginal and features characters that could be personal to players  in many ways but who are also interesting and unique in their own ways. The story is quite confusing and starts a little slow but it's more than worth it once you get to the decode part of the story. This game is great for visual novel fans of all ages, no adult content here just a great story and beautiful art well worth the cost.\n\nNote: took me at least 4 hours to get all card drops.\n\nI give it a 10/10 and can't wait for the DLC continuations of the series.","March 18","true","4.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

There he meets a mysterious girl and as the plot develops you find out more about the protagonist, the heroine and what's going on.\n\nThe plot can be kind of confusing so don't worry if you are not following it very well, after you finish the main storyline the "decode" section is unlocked and after going through all its chapters you should at least have a good grasp of what's going on. After reading all of it, I wish it was longer so the plot could have a better development and make you more attached to the characters but it still left me thinking about it for a while after closing the game, which is a good sign.\n\nThe art is pretty good, voice acting is in Chinese and I suppose most of us aren't familiar with the language so it might sound weird. I noticed a couple of typos in the text but it's nothing too bad to complain about. The music is okay overall, it's an indie game so you shouldn't expect super quality, some tracks are better than others.\n\nIf you enjoyed VNs like 40 Days and 40 Nights of Rain, True Remembrance and Planetarian then there's a good chance you will enjoy Season of 12 Colors (I consider those VNs to be better than this one though). If you like that kind of story then go ahead and buy this game, it's very cheap anyway and you'll be helping people to improve and create more similar content.\n\nEdit: Today's update (04/29/2016) claims to have corrected typos and improved the translation.","March 22","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And although not everything about it was entirely great, I stand by my statement that this is well worth the £2 and I would happily have paid more for it.\n\nThe story is short but sweet; about three children who can only meet a few times during their lifetimes and under certain conditions, bound by time. The ending leaves room for interpretation and, for what it's worth, it was a fairly touching story. The "main story" is only a part of this and it should probably have been called something else because if you only play the "main story", you're going to think this game was a pile of garbage. Because not only is it not the whole story, but it is also fairly bland and has a lot of holes. You have to read the rest in order for things to make sense. All in all, I enjoyed the story.\n\nThe art, in my opinion, was pretty damn good. The simplistic style really seems to fit, especially considering it is Chinese and not Japanese. It was not made to be like other visual novels with a Japanese art style and I am happy they didn't take that route. Because of the art, this visual novel stood out to me. Not in any words I could put together to make comprehensible sense, but it stood out to me.\n\nThe music, going from one end of the spectrum of the other, at times, was damn irritating. The music box song in particular was verging on "difficult to bear". The rest of the music was nice and when combined with the art, created an atmosphere quite different from a lot of other stories.\n\nThere isn't much to say about the characters. We don't go into much depth about them since the story is the main focus and it is about what has happened to these characters during this time. There is very little character development and personality building and I suppose, that is okay. What we do see of them though are just standard children growing up in a small village. Playful, active and in every other respect, what you expect of children, and as they age, their personalities mature.\n\nTo conclude, I think that this visual novel is very much worth the read. But it seems to suffer from the same thing that a lot of good stories suffer from: you have to look past some things that without fail, will put a great number of people off before they progress. Fault milestone one and its prologue, Steins; gate and its slow start. This has a bland start and irritating music. I'm not comparing this low price visual novel to some of these really great pieces of work that will no doubt, still be being read far into the future because this will likely, and sadly, be forgotten. But, it is still a great piece of work well worth the £2.","March 17","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's so much creativity and thought put into this work that it really shows, from the use of CGs to the music to how the story is put together. This VN just blows my mind, and in a short amount of time mind you. And the story I can speak so much about. To put it simply, it's a tale of these two children and their carefree days, creating memories that hopefully stand the test of time. To get deeper into this story, it's about a curse and the impact they have on these characters. And I'll leave it at that.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone, even if you don't read visual novels that often. Even with its short length, I think it's worth every penny. This is by far the most original and well-done visual novel I've read on Steam.\n\n9/10\n\nRead my full, in-depth review here: https://kupowrites.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/seasons-of-12-colors-vn-review","March 16","true","1.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"
