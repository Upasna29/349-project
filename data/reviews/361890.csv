(but hey steam refund?)\n\nTwo factions, Russia and China.\nStrange selection of units, both factions have similarities, but the stats aren't 1:1 even for similar units.\nThen there is the unique units per faction, like China getting Rocket-launcher infantry, flame tank, while Russia doesn't, as some examples.\nInfantry comes in squads, they can be healed, but if a soldier in the squad dies, he can't be replaced.\nThere's repair truck and ambulance for both factions.\n\nThere's a campaign with 14 missions as Russia, there's no Chinese campaign.\nSkirmish is just 1v1 on a choice of four different maps, you can play as either Russia or China.\nThere is also IP/TCP multiplayer with 1v1 and a choice of those four different maps, I haven't tried Multiplayer to know wether it works and what ports are needed.","November 20, 2015","true","7.2"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","30","39","2","1"

Even while i already finished whole game in far 2009 - this game just totally unplayable and i ask you nicely to save yourself and your nervous system.\n\n- Absolutely mad controls, pathfinding and unit's AI! You can ask your tank move somewhere - he will answer to you "fu*k you, man! i will stay there and even will ignore any enemy from now! >=(". Tanks unable to shot while enemy move directly to them (they shake with turrets and can't aim). If you have more than one unit - better command them separately, otherwise they will spread over all map and will lost forever! If you command unit atack enemy - you have 50% chance that your unit will ignore everyone and everything from now and only one way to solve this it is ask nicely: "Stop! Stop f*cking idiot!! STOP!!!" and he will go somewhere-only-god-know-where-and-why and probably will die because when you will ask him return to base he just will sit on the ground with scream: "i not understand what you all want from meeeee! x;(("...\n\n- Totally unbalanced and unplayable missions - some missions ask you to do something impossible or unreally hard while you must control 1-99 units with such idiotic AI and controls, and after all - you can just lose mission randomly without any reason because script worked wrong or developers randomly made additional objective too important for primary scenario (but this is happens only in one-two missions). And mission about taking airfield will ♥♥♥♥ your brain.\n\n- No autosaves, if you lost mission - you will be sent to main menu and game will ask you to repeat all game from first mission!\n\n- Most important of all - horrible optimisation! In massive battles FPS can drop so hard that you will be unable to command army (probably you will lose game because of this many times). And this is game of 2009 year even on pretty new PC!\n\n- Time control as a key feature - it is mostly a piece of s*it, it is just a ability of one single unit of russian army (and key character-hero have this ability too but if he die - you lose). You can call T34 and "Katusha" from WW2 times and some futuristic robot from future times - and there fantasies of developers about "Soldiers of all times fight on one battlefield" ended. In game scenario nobody will be even surprised that T34 come from nowhere, shot some chinese and disapeared, no one little talking with any character from the past or something like this (that can be pretty interesting and even touchy, while game already have wallpaper of modern VDV soldier drinking with soldier from the future). It is just unplayable and full of bugs strategy about tank-spaming.\n\n- Boring ending.\n\nSo... what about reasons why i forced myself to finish this pretty long scenario campign even while it is was really painful to play?\n\n+ Different missions with really different conditions and objectives, not so bad scenario and voice acting in russian version.\n\n+ Cute Russian vehicle models.\n\n+ Very cute graphics (even with such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥et optimisation).\n\n+ Very good music on background - for first time looks like this game is one big piece of trolling about Russian-Chinese war of 2015 year and music work for this pretty good, but longer you play - more serious this game looks for you :o\n\n+ I had no other games for playing, so... i had not so big choice.\n\nP.s.- sorry for my epic english...\nP.P.s.- i can't get cards for this game :<\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJa_rDSZ1Gs","March 20","false","1.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Odd as in: This game is weird on all fronts. But is it a good game? My response: Ehhhenehe....\n\nGameplay:\nI'm not stranger to rts gameplay that originally started off from Westwood's very own: Dune 2: Battle for Arrakis, and of course the Command and Conquer series as well. So the gameplay is simluar to that...Except this: The gameplay feels jerky. Like incredibly jerky. It almost feels like I'm lagging, in which, with my pc, I'm not lagging. But here, even with a DirectX 8.1 graphics which, in fact, in this day of age is super cheap. And I know you don't need super-hyper-ultra-advance graphics to make a good game. Which I'm fully aware of that. Here though, it lagging! Even selecting units is lagging. Scrolling over a number of units across the screen can sometimes be frustrating, even to the point of being almost unplayable.\n\nAlthough, even know it's similar to C&C it's, well, not all that different in fact. We got characters with a Time Stopping abilitiy which is similar to the Red Alert series from C&C, and overall the feel of the gameplay is well not different to, again, Command and Conquer. Another thing about the gameplay is the units. You get the usuals as always: Tanks, Infanty, Rocket Troops, Heils, etc. So you might think that's all, right? Wrong. In this game, the units can regerate! I know that in the real world they fixs vehicles and heals soldiers during battles, but let's just say that, in fact, this game follows like every rts game ever. Here, the units can regerate like nothing even happen. So with the right strategy you're units can be semi-immortals! Although they will die, but still, semi-immortals!\n\nSo overall, the Gameplay is nothing different from, for example (again!) : Command And Conquer. But with it's jerkyness/laggyness that infects the Gameplay in the most severe way makes it kinda hard to play the game, also with the units making it in the middle.\n\nGraphics:\nStrangely enough, the graphics itself isn't what you except from the video and in the pictures on the store page, instead it have a shell-shaded style of graphics, making it look like a graphic novel of some sorts. Other than that though, it's not bad at all. Even know it's nothing to wirte home about, but the way that units die however is pretty lackluster. For some of the units they explodes, and lose a tire. And they sink into the ground to dissapears FOREVER! And that's all, really. It's nothing really to talk about really, so...It's okay.\n\nSound:\nSound overall is also something not to wirte home about as well. In fact, some of the sound really is borrowing from different sources that sounds like it came from a site with free sound effects. Heck, some of the sounds like the explosion that hits a tank is pretty underwheliming. And...It's not bad.\n\nStory:\nThe game's story is set in the far, distance, unimaginable future of...2015. Yep. To be fair this game was release in 2009, so...Yeah. Nothing new here.\n\nOverall, the story isn't nothing new. So: Eh....\n\nOverall: Chronostorm: Siberian Border is probably one of the better Russian games that been release on Steam so far, and I've played other Russian games as well. More notably: The Stalin Subway Series. And those suck! But this is, as fair and just, is a okay to semi-tolerable. I might play a little more, but overall the price of the game is perfect for the quailty of the game as well, so no need to fear about spending all of your money for something you might regret on your Steam Walet.\n\nAnd it's pretty light with 2 GB of Hard Drive, so if you can give a try, do so. But it's gameplay is it's greatest weakness, and might turn off gamers from playing this game even more. I only recommend this game for those who are curious.\n\nGameplay: 4.5/10\nGraphics: 5.5/\nSound:6/10\nStory:5/10\n\nOverall: 5/10\n\nRecommendation( For most gamers) : No\n\nUPDATE:\nI just look at the map, and yes, I'm wrong. Good god, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing stupid! So I might as well put a bullet in my head to get it ♥♥♥♥ING WORKING GOD DAMNIT! Still, the score is the same.","November 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","25","52","4","11"
