Decided to write it again to inform people about a few things.\n\nThe game has two big problems:\n\n1. Lack of new players\n\nMost of the servers are empty. The game is dead.\n\n2. The attitude towards new players\n\nJust check out these pictures for example\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ychx5XT.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PQQpeZj.png\n\nYou guys NEED new players to keep the game alive. And you just keep pushing them away. You're killing your own community.\n\nI played the game for a few hours and had fun. Until I got into an argument with some "old veteran" who liked to votekick noobs from the server to make room for his friends to join. I got votekicked and couldn't play on that server anymore. There were not many servers to play on. Maybe 2 or 3. I didn't touch the game since.\n\nThere are some people who are nice to new players but if the majority of the community are self-centered elitists, the game is going to die. It already has died.","February 8","false","24.3"," 86 of 95 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","86","95","3","4"

Not sure if it's still alive/active or whatever and I can't exactly find out since my account is just, I don't know, gone?  It's weird.\n\nIt was really fun, though.  Like a lot of games that have an overall account level, though, it wasn't the most balanced.  Later upgrades and planes were just, you know, objectively better than starting things.  The ships aren't necessarily rock-paper-scissors in design but there are elements like that to them.  Having said that, the starting ship is probably the best one, which is good for beginners.\n\nRegardless, the ships were balanced enough that you could play whatever and probably be fine in most situations.  The game modes were varied enough.  You had death match and team death match, yeah, but there was also a mode where you destroyed an enemy base, and another where you effectively played soccor with the space ships.  I really liked the last one, but they were all fun and I'd play whatever when I did.\n\nControls were fine, graphics were fine, sounds were fine.  The only problem I ever encountered were some latency issues, where people would just appear to teleport somewhere else or where you were clearly disconnecting (everyone was falling or flying into walls).\n\nYeah, every now and then I boot this up and try to figure out my old account, or to make my old account work, but it never happens.  Had a lot of good times and I would totally play some more, if not a lot, should I ever fix that.  Good game, if you see it on sale, do check it out.  Assuming it's still alive.  It might not be!\n\nThe edit: game is mostly dead except for old elitists, apparently.  Shame.  Guess they are a pretty closed off community and not friendly to newbs.  Oh well.

I can easily say this is one of my top 5 favorite games, but, it does come with ample warning -- it is most definitely not for everybody. Let me explain... (TL;DR version at the bottom of the post)\n\nCurrently, the largest issue is the lack of new players. Within a week, you can usually catch about 50 or so veterans at least once (many every day). However, it is becoming rarer each day to find new players. This means that unless you're playing with bots, you'll probably have a hard time.\n\nI'd suggest getting a few friends and hosting a server of your own in order to get decent at the game before hopping onto, for instance, ball dojo (the "top tier" open server). Who knows, you might become good enough to join a permanent team or recieve an invite to ranked. The hardest part of this game is most definitely the initial push to be able to compete with the big dogs of Altitude, and after that, it's always extremely fun (and many times equally frustrating) to play.\n\nI do not claim to be an extremely great player. Sometimes, I can get a goal. On a great day, sometimes 3. However, much of the veteran community is much better than I am and sometimes it really shows. I only bring this up to say that even when your team is losing and you're one of the last players on it (maybe because you accidentally passed to an enemy that zipped past you to score), it is still a very fun game.\n\nWorst case scenario, you just wasted... 0.00 dollars/pounds/euros/colourful rocks. If not for anything but for the sake of the community, give the game a shot. It is very friendly and close, since most people know of eachother (and if not, somebody else that knows who they do not). Many people are willing to help teach you and give you pointers.\n\nOh yeah, and gameplay. The steering is tight (mouse+keyboard at least), there are literally controls if you use mouse+keyboard (3 on the mouse, up and down on the keyboard), you rank up in order to unlock new planes then new parts for said plane, there is a prestige system in order to get a better graphical rank, and there is absolutely no in-game purchases with real money. That alone is extremely rare for a free-to-play multiplayer game, and for these many reasons, I cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt will be a very difficult game at first, but after getting used to it (no more than a week at most, really), you will wonder how you've never played this game before. Not a huge community, but it's hard to tell since there's always at least 2 viable servers. NO in-game real cash payments. Tight controls and gameplay that doesn't feel repetitive. And, it's completely free -- there's no reason it's not worth trying.","September 5, 2015","true","66.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

So WHAT COULD THIS MEAN?\n\nAnyways - I've been playing the demo for HOURS now on my mean bean machine (otherwise known as Linux, LOL) and I'm still puzzling it out...   Tux logo + unavailble on Lin(T)ux...  I dare not click "OK" when the answer must be so OBVIOUSLY staring me in the face - I mean, there's probably an achievement for a perfect runthrough (I mean, if I click OK i'd be admitting what?  That you shouldn't put pictures of Tux next to things that don't run on Linux?  Uh, DUH!

The screenshots and gameplay videos don't really accurately portray how much fun it is, though. It's /lots/ of fun. It's deceptively simple, but extraordinarily strategic. Where Altitude shines, though, is in it's unique form of football (or for the Americans, soccer). Adding in lots of bots and a few players creates a mass chaos as everyone dogfights, passes the ball, and limps down the field in an effort to score goals. Granted, the other play modes are fun, but nowhere near as fun as "Ball".\n\nWhile it can get boring fast, I find that played in short bursts, Altitude is really fun. And for exactly free dollars, how can anyone complain? If you don't like it, you'll know in the first ten minutes. And since it's free, you spent ten minutes of your life on a game that didn't work out. No harm, no foul. Give it a go.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/41300/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nAltitude is 2D-Indie-"flight simulator" developed in 2009 by Nimbly Games, the game implements different playable craft, different game modes, and fairly basic controls. (up, down, throttle down, throttle up, pew A, Pew B)\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  There isn't really a story, this game is basically a 2D-indie-MOBA.\n\nGame Play: As I said earlier, the controls are very simple, but it does take into account gravity, firing arc, and several other aspects that makes the strategies far more complex. For example, if you're flying higher than your opponent/target, you can dip lower and fly faster because of descending altitude (puns, ha!).\nUnfortunately because Altitude is a MOBA, the game relies heavily upon other players. (This is the key downside to the game for achievement hunters; or people who want to unlock new aircraft) There are usually a few servers that are up with people playing, but for the most part the community has been shrunk down to a nearly-non-existent-size.\n\nAchievements: There are three achievement categories: 1) Get tons of kills with this plane without death, 2) Get tons of kills overall 3) Do this training mission. Many of the planes you need for achievements aren't unlocked until you rank higher, adding to the difficulty of getting the achievements, with the prerequisite of "ranking up first". With less words: It'll take a lot of time, and unless you're playing with friends the achievements are a skip.\n\nPrice: Altitude is Free to Play, so there's not much excuse to not trying it... Unless you're a normal steam gamer, and have hundreds or millions of games in your steam library... in that case... yes, that's a good excuse. But if you're cursed by financial limitations like the person writing this review, then free games are nice! :P\n\nConclusion: Since the game is free... you are probably only looking through the reviews to see funny comments. There's a good chance you won't even see this one; since there are those crazy guys who have 500-1,000+hours in the game who reviewed it when the community was still strong.\nStill, I enjoyed playing it, and it deserves to be recognized as a fun indie game. This game will appeal to most people who enjoy other Indie games, but the people who enjoy MOBA's and flight mechanics will get the biggest kick out of the game.","May 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is one of the very few games I've ever played where I can stop playing it for a week then jump right back in whenever I want and feel comfortable and relaxed. It's like riding a smooth bike.\n\nWhen I think about this game, I think of a multiplayer space shooter game I played a long time ago called SubSpace.

The layout of the area and the speed, position and angle you have relative to your enemy when you encounter them all affect how the battle plays out.\n\n\n\nSome beginners tips:\n\nThe most popular map, "Football", has no obstacles so is easy for beginners.\n\nThe bots who sometimes fill out teams on public servers are mostly on difficult settings with perfect aim, and can give even experienced players trouble. Their main weakness is that they will focus completely on whatever target or objective they have at the moment, ignoring other enemies unless you go straight in front of them.\n\nWhen on a server, press TAB and look at the player's levels next to their badges. If there's no number, they're level 60. Sometimes a level 60 will start over from level 1, for prestige, but you can tell them apart by their more complex badges vs a beginners cartoony blue and yellow ones.\n\nAnyway, level 60 people are usually pretty good. Sometimes I don't even fire at low level guys, just circle around them dodging their shots, and they often crash before managing to kill me :) The game has a high skill-ceiling. So you might want to find a server with beginners, the servers with just a few players on them often are.\n\nNow, get online and try to hit me :)","February 17","true","409.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is both single player and muliplayer. The solo missions are basically prep for multiplayer. Although you can play multiplayer at any level, it's best if you level up your plane to -level 21-. At this point you have an awesome ship that most players use. (It teleports and takes a beating.)\n\nSince there are only around 50-100 people playing online at a time, you will play against all skill levels and planes. This means it's really wise to play the campaign fully before jumping into multiplayer.\n\nWorth $10\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

It's a nice casual game about planes shooting each other down.\n\nModes include Free For All (Death Match), single life team death match, Ball (Football/soccer/hockey), and Team Base Destruction.\n\n\nNot only is this a free game, but it has achievments too (If you're an achievement junkie).  So really, you're not losing anything.\n\n\nThe only real criticism I have is that the community is pretty much toast.  Though you'll find life in about 3-6 servers.  The rest are simply filled with bots.   So, you could say it has more life than Gun Monkeys.\n\n\nGood game for casuals, though a little skill will be involved....so I guess hardcore gamers might like this title too.

There are death match and team death match game modes like you would expect from a shooter, but you also get "ball" modes that involve getting the ball through the goal, and bomb the base game modes.\n\nAltitude comes with a map editor that you can use, and the game can be played single player or multiplayer. I have noticed that it seems to have a decent amount of players most of the day as of me writing this review. So you should not have much trouble trying to find a game for a while (as of 9/13/14).  I would recommend this game to any of my friends looking for a free to play multiplayer game, its pretty neat but you will probably like it more if you are a fan of indie games or pilot games. Altitude is free now on Steam, so you should try it if you think it may interest you.\n","September 13, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There are death match and team death match game modes like you would expect from a shooter, but you also get "ball" modes that involve getting the ball through the goal, and bomb the base game modes.\n\nAltitude comes with a map editor that you can use, and the game can be played single player or multiplayer. I have noticed that it seems to have a decent amount of players most of the day as of me writing this review. So you should not have much trouble trying to find a game for a while (as of 9/13/14). I would recommend this game to any of my friends looking for a free to play multiplayer game, its pretty neat but you will probably like it more if you are a fan of indie games or pilot games. Altitude is free now on Steam, so you should try it if you think it may interest you.","September 19, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You control cartoonish planes in various gametypes, which feature the standards you've come to expect: deathmatch, CTF, etc. There are a few spins on that, like Airball which plays much like a soccer game with shooting.\n\nYou start off with a basic plane, and can unlock more through leveling up. You level up by completing objectives in the games, or finishing matches. The gameplay is simple enough to learn, can control with a keyboard or gamepad, and features a tutorial to teach you about all the game typles. The visuals are very cartoonish, which match the arcade playstyle. This is by no means a simulation. The planes do not control realistically at all, so don't expect that.\n\nSince this is a multiplayer game, you will have to rely on other people actually being online playing this game. On the occassions I've tried, there only seems to be one-two populated servers at any given time. You can play offline with bots, but that always takes some of the fun away from a multiplayer game. Plus, the bots don't really play like human opponents anyway.\n\nBecause of the lack of community (which frankly can be expected from a game a few years old without a really great hook), I do not recommend buying Altitude at this time. While it is fun enough in short spurts, you'll have to rely on there being available servers, which is not a guarantee at this time. Try it out if you already own it, but the pricetag is too high for newcomers.\n\nGrade: C","July 1, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

Maybe if this were a PvE RPG setting that would be OK however this has been advertised as a 2D TF2 and results in "noobs only" servers and "big kid" servers to divide up the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf you have a group of friends to play with this could be great fun. On it's own it has little replay value unless you want to grind through the kiddie pool in order to play the "real" game.","November 22, 2010","false","2.0"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

I don't many hours on Steam, but I have a couple hundred hours through Nimbly Games itself. Altitude is fun, simply put. I enjoy the gametypes and the maps; the lag is small and player base is pretty decent. The graphics are cartoon like and thats what makes this game genuine. It is good for everyone of all ages and I love the fact that it has a level-up system to where you can do something similar to some FPS game franchise (insert name here); it allows you to reset your level back to 1 and relive all the action once again. Hooray!\nAlthough its fun, there is one downside: it doesn't have a story and basically requires multiplayer to function. The classes available do have some variation and custom changes that can be made, but Nimbly could have inserted another plane or two to give the game more variety.\nOverall, this game is a good buy, on sale or not; its worth the money.\n\n8/10 c:","June 3, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, however, I can only barely recommend this game.\n\nThe game itself is fantastic. It's a 2D, side-view, multiplayer dogfighting game. The controls are tight, the gameplay intense, and the game plays so quickly (rounds last only a few minutes) that it induces "just one more game" syndrome. To keep things from getting too repetitive, there are variety of plane types and boosts that can be earned through an XP system. There are also a number of game types - of particular note is the "ball" game type where players attempt to carry and shoot a ball into the opposing team's goal without being shot down in the process. Scoring the goal is just as exciting as it is in any sports game.\n\nSo why can I no longer wholehearted recommend the game? Well, it has encountered the fate that any multiplayer-focused game that isn't as popular as, say Counterstrike, has met: lack of players. There are very few people playing the game now and the few active players left are INSANELY good. Even someone like myself who was half-way decent as a ball runner finds respawning to happen way too frequently.\n\nThat leaves two options for enjoying the game: either skirmish against the bots or round up some friends. As with most games of this ilk, playing with and against bots is okay but not a perfect substitute for live players. Perhaps the best way to enjoy the game at this point is to round up a few friends who also own it and host a private game.\n\nAltitude is a great game whose lifespan has run its course. I recommend it for a group of friends or if it goes on Steam sale again (not extremely likely given its age) and creates an influx of new players. Otherwise, I regrettably recommend passing on a game that not enough people enjoyed.","December 9, 2013","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very charming, the gameplay holds up very well, and customizing your planes with perks is a nice way to play to your own strengths without really screwing around with the whole game's balance too much.\n\nSpeaking of customizing, you can unlock new skins for your planes by spreading word of Altitude like a self-servient virus.

Due to the tools available it has a multitude of gamemodes and maps.  The progression is rewarding and allows you to learn and modify your playstyle as you unlock more options for your planes.\n\nUnfortunately for Altitude the servers are pretty empty even after becoming free, vets of the game will be mixed in with completely new players and can create frustrating matches for both parties.  It runs off dedicated servers so no skill based matchmaking here folks, sorry.\n\nIf you didn't have reason enough to play it before, do yourself a favor and play it now that it is free!\n\nedit: rewrote review since game has gone free.","July 22, 2011","true","97.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very fun for brief stretches of time, and the server options are customizable to favor both the experienced and the new.\n\nIn a sense, Altitude's multiplayer reminds me of the feeling of old-school FPSes with the openness of maps and hectic gameplay. The flight and speed of the varying ships have a bit of a learning curve, but once you find that ship that's "just right" for you, you'll either feel like a aerial master or a bomber of death.\n\nThe levelling system with perks do lock away some interesting abilities, but for the most part, we haven't seen an issue where the perks themselves overpower players. Thankfully, the only real determining factor is a person's piloting skill. Learn to fly, and you can get into this game without a problem.\n\nKeep gameplay short, as playing it for long stretches of time will wear you down.\n\n4 out of 5 foxes.","December 5, 2013","true","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't played it in quite some time, but when it first came out, I was completely addicted. If you're into casual, team-based battle royale-type arena games, give it a go. Don't be turned off just because it's about dogfighting -- it's much more about cleverness, reaction, and strategy than piloting, since it's a 2D game.

I keep hearing it described as "Soldat with planes," which holds up to a point, sure. Anyway, it's a lot of fun! Even if you're playing online with other players! Something about the fun/colorful graphics seems to prevent me from taking it seriously enough to get angry at it. It's very charming, the gameplay holds up very well, and customizing your planes with perks is a nice way to play to your own strengths without really screwing around with the whole game's balance too much.\n\nSpeaking of customizing, you can unlock new skins for your planes by spreading word of Altitude like a self-servient virus.

Altitude is a game I keep coming back to.  The level restrictions are an unnecessary pain, distinguishing yourself from your allies can be difficult and the hoops required to earn skins are ridiculous.  However, the various modes of side-scrolling battles which form the game's core are solid.\n\nBoth shooting opponents and performing mode objectives are fun.  Dying causes no permanent damage and respawning is generally quick.  There are multiple servers and the ability to host your own.  Players can hop in and out, bots can fill uneven teams and there's a single player training mode for those who are still too timid.

I don't know what all the hype is about with the little kids on this game. Perhaps its the intrigue of gaining levels to fly different planes. The planes each have different strengths and weaknesses, none over-powering the others, which is nice. But because of that it seems advancing in levels to play a different plane is unnecessary.  I wouldn't say this is a must buy, unless you really feel you must buy it. :P","December 2, 2010","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This means that beginners can easily stand toe-to-toe with hardcore veterens.\n\nVarious modes are available, such as a soccer-like team game, and good old deathmatch.\n\nIt's not my cup of tea, but one of the better indie releases out there.","December 7, 2011","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Super simple premise -- 2D dogfighting with a total of 5 different planes to choose from as well as numerous options to customize each one. Lots of game modes from DM, TDM to Bombing the Opponents Base or a great sports themed mode where you have to shoot a ball into the oponents goal.  I like to play this when I'm winding down from a Counter-Strike bender :)","December 29, 2011","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
