So this is what the wait for Half Life 3 feels like.\n\nHalf Life 2 Episode Two is the sequel to Episode One and begins straight away. We find ourselves in the outskirts of City 17 as the Citadel has now opened a portal to the Combines home world and it's now up to us to find a way to the rebel base and shut down the portal once and for all.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to previous titles in the Half Life 2 games.  Overall there's not much to say here as it's basically DLC to Half Life 2.\n\nGraphics wise this game looks a tad bit better than Half Life 2 due to the range rendering, which I thought was under used in Half Life 2 Episode One. The portal coming from the citadel can be seen throughout the entire game which looks outstanding.\n\nThere is a reason this is my favorite Half Life title and that's the action sequences. This game is like a great action movie. Action scenes after action scenes after action scenes and it all ends up to one of the biggest cliffhanger endings in history of gaming. I'm not joking it actually pains me not knowing what happens next.\n\nI also love the incredible soundtrack. It's beyond kick ♥♥♥ and is one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.\n\nIn the end Half Life 2 Episode Two is a thrilling ride and it should be played by everyone. I'm glad I finally joined the bandwagon. Now I can join the Half Life 3 waiting community.\n\nFinal Rating:\n10/10 - A must own and a must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 121 of 129 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","121","129","13","2"

I missed new enemies and new environments there but this episode delivered all of them. The story is interesting and it is a shame no conclusion is reached once you complete the second (and probably last) expansion to Half Life. The Source engine now runs an enhanced version and you can immediately see the better effects and more beautiful surroundings early on in the game.\n\nThis is a very decent expansion pack; I only wish there was a third and final episode that would conclude the story or perhaps leave more room for Half Life 3.","March 29, 2014","true","10.0"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","51","53","0","0"

Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance must continue their fight, alongside the resistance, against the evil Combine. After the ever so slightly below par Episode 1, Episode 2 is a real return to form. Everything that was so good about HL2 is developed here and made even better. The narrative arc is strong, the dialogue well-written and witty, the voice acting accomplished and convincing, the environments spectacular and varied, and the mix between puzzle solving and combat just right. We meet several new enemies and some of the combat is pretty challenging, especially the final battle which is big on scale and mayhem and requires real strategy to complete. It’s a tough finale but well worth the effort. There’s so much to enjoy in the whole Half-Life series I can’t recommend these games enough.\n\n5/5","December 1, 2013","true","30.0"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","60","67","0","2"

After finding nothing and getting "I don't want to comment on this yet" from thier CEO Gabe Newell, I decided to give up. I noticed gaben with a large grin on his face as i walked away from Valve HQ it saddens me more. Then I look up as a woman asks me "Are you that guy investigating valve?". "Yes I am". She then said "I'm Gaben's old maths teacher and when looking through his old maths tests I found one question he got wrong!". "What was it?" I asked. "2+1"she said. A true look of surprise crossed my face. I looked back to where Gaben had been. He looked concerned and frightened. I began running as fast as I could back to Valve HQ. But Gaben was faster he used his long fall boots to jump straight down the stair well. He then boarded the front exits with filling cabnets using his gravity gun. I shouted at gaben to let me in but his only reply was "THESE THINGS THEY TAKE TIME!". I was to angry to give up now. I sparta kicked the door and filling cabnets down. Gaben ran for the stairs throwing a barrage of crowbars at me. I refused to stop. Chasing him up the stairs I found him in his office. In one hand he helled one of his many swords and in the other a copy of the illusive Half Life 3. "If you come a step closer I swear to god i'll destroy this and bury it where no one will find it, in a mexican land fill!". "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!" I screamed. I jumped at gabe and grabbed half life 3. However Gaben managed to stab me in the proccess. Gaben tried to grab half life 3 but I wouldnt let him. I dived out the way as Gabe charged at me. He missed and hit a wall and was knocked out. I ran as far as i could from Valve HQ as I could which was about a metre. I fell to the ground in an alley way just to the side of Valve HQ. I layed up against the wall slowly bleeding to death. "We made it Gordon" I said. but we hadn't, just then Gaben came round the corner. He kneeled down in front of me. He stroked his finger down my face "shhhhh" he exclaimed and threw an egg at me. "It will never be oger" he wispered gently to me. I began to fall unconcious as he walked away. I felt myself slipping but as I died I let out a tremendous "33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333!".

More importantly  the story was just  BADASS , there were so many amazing turn of events and the way they introduced new enemies, new wepons and stuff and funny aspects, the least i can say is i loved it\nBut i still have lots of questions in my mind.. like what happens after Alyx's father was murdered? What legendary borelli were they talking about? What ship Alyx's father asked us to destroy? To answer all these question they need to make Half-Life 3 but  according to   Gaben's  math teacher... gaben used to get sick by hearing the number 3.. so i guess Half-Life 3 is not possible but i see slight chances of Half-Life 3 in PS4's generation becuz:\n\nps4+ps3+ps2+ps1\nadd the numbers\n4+3+2+1=10\nDivide it by the number of consoles\n10/4= 2.5 round it off = 3\n\nHALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED!!!!","March 6, 2015","true","6.8"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","83","68","82","41","34"

It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life 2: Episode One.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two follows up Gordon Freeman story from Half-Life 2: Episode One after the destruction of City 17. This time you're not going to play in City 17 anymore, the city is gone, and you're going to see more places in Half-Life universe and also, meet some new and more dangerous enemies.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two is another good sequel to the Half-Life series.

It was awarded as the Game of the Decade in the VGA Awards. The award was received by Gabe Newell, Valve founder.\n\nThe game takes place 20 years after the Black Mesa incident of Half Life ( The game that chaged it all ) . Gordon Freeman awakes from hibernation in City 17 and become part of the resistance to face the Combine Empire and attempt to defeat it. In the game Gordon meets Alyx Vance,  who is part of the resistance. The game is one of the pioneers in introducing a playmate .\n\nHalf Life 2 presents different enemies . The Headcrabs still produce that feeling of rejection when they attack. The action is breathtaking but it breaks , not like Call of Duty games where you shoot without breathing.\n\nThe narrative is implemented throughout the game, not with recording or notes , it is not necessary. The experience is brilliant. The Source engine allows good management of physics and the introduction of a new weapon. The gravity gun . The technology also allows open spaces in addition to traditional outdoor passageways and internal spaces .\n\nThe handling of the narrative and physics puzzles changed the way the FPS games developed from there into the future . It was a turning point in games history the same way it was the first Half Life .\n\nThe game was released for PC under Windows , required a 2 Ghz processor . 512 MB ​​of RAM , and a graphics card compatible with Direct X 8.1 . For the few resources sought at that time the graphical quality of the game was very good and ran very smoothly .\n\nThis is one of the "must play" games if one is serious about being a Gamer ,not only for its quality but also for being part of the history of video games.","November 26, 2013","true","0.1"," 74 of 98 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","74","98","0","4"

What is disappointing is why Episode Three has never been released.  Valve, we are your gamers.  We are fans of the series.  We were so hyped after we played this years back, and over time, that hype has slowly faded and much confusion replaced it.  I mean, what exactly happened?  Did developers leave the project?  Voice actors go on strike?  Did a very important voice actor pass away or go missing?\n\nI don't get why no clear answers are given.  We would understand if something went wrong that would cause major delays or a halt on the project.  We just want answers.  It's been 8 years.  Don't we gamers deserve a response?\n\nIn any case, Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and all the episodes are fantastic.","November 24, 2015","true","53.6"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","29","30","0","0"

The Hunter for the Combine, and the poisonous archnids.\n\nThe game also has awesome levels. The arachnid lair for example. At one point of the game, you will also get a car.

From then on it's a fight to get to safety and find Alyx's father.  With a lot of exterior battles and action, this game in the series feels very large while still maintaining the short packed with action game that an episode should be.  However, you should know that the game ends with a huge cliffhanger and that there is no sight of Half Life Episode 3 or Half Life 3 coming out in the near future.  This is rather disappointing, but at the same time has kept many a fans chomping at the bit for a new release in the series.","January 4, 2015","true","16.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","1"

It takes place immediately following the occurrences of Episode One, and contains somewhere between 4-5 hours of quality content depending on how you play it.\n\nEpisode Two does a great job progressing the title through every aspect when compared to Episode One, just like Episode One did in comparison to the base game. With Episode Two you will find slightly updated visuals by the way of textures and lighting, various new mechanics, and a couple of new enemies and weapon types. However, the narrative is easily what develops the most, which is at the same time the most frustrating part of this installment. Great strides were made into understanding the plot, you become more invested than ever, and then BOOM! Everything is stopped in its tracks, a huge cliff hanger occurs, and nearly a decade later there is no extension to the series. I took all the self-control I had to get this far still writing a genuinely informative review, so I'm just going to let it all out now.\n\nPersonal Rating: ♥♥♥♥ YOU VALVE (10)/10\nThe Combine gather, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall find no medkits, hold no ammo, father no children. I shall wear no helmets and win no glory. I shall live and die with the vortigaunts. I am the crowbar in the darkness. I am the researcher in the labs. I am the missile that burns against the Combine, the light that brings the end of their days, the siren that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Lambda Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.","May 6","true","4.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game takes a different and  longer path than Episode One, but stunning and gripping nonetheless while following Gordon's adventures. Continuing straight off of Episode One, the game takes you through a tour of the more nature and abandonment parts of the Half-Life 2 universe. The graphics are enchanced greatly, and include some features and characters as well as some new enemies as well.\nThis game sadly leads off a huge cliff hanger, which leads to the development of the very late Half-Life 2: Episode Three, which will come some time in the future. Other than that, the game is absolutely great, and we will all hope the Episode Three will come as soon as possible, but in the meanwhile, we will look forward this great masterpiece of a series that came to Steam.

Let me explain. I am a total sucker for great endings (which is the main reason Portal 2 is my favorite game ever) and this one REALLY delivered. I mean, even for a series that ALWAYS ends on a cliffhanger, this is one damn big cliffhanger. The gameplay is solid, but it's a half-life game so thats a given. The new enemies were a lot of fun to fight. You will die a lot, especially on the final fight, which is a blast. But yeah, go buy it if you haven't yet.\n\n\n\n\n*SPOILER ALERT*\n\nThe reason the ending got to me is that it's something that wouldn't fly in a modern game. It's not even done in a cutscene. The fact that they decided to kill Eli, a character who's been with us since the very beginning, shows Valve's got guts.

It does distinguish itself on a number of points though.\n\nEpisode Two picks up where Episode One left off and once again tells you to save the world. Like Episode One there is very little new in this, most of the areas and encounters feel like repeats and you'll quickly become boring with the monotone gameplay.\n\nEpisode Two does jump a bar above Episode One by giving you quite a bit more story as you travel through the game and that does help keep you playing for a little while longer.\n\nIn the end however it feels too much like what has been done before and the verdict is much the same as Episode One. Get it if you want a few more hours of Half-Life 2 single-player but don't expect any more than that. It's an entirely forgettable expansion.","November 13, 2012","true","94.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You’ve probably completed it years ago, or at least have a pretty good idea of what it is and why people like it. So I’ll just use this ‘review’ to recommend a puzzle mod for Episode 2, Research and Development. Simple, but amusing puzzles. Great slapstick humor. Looks really good. There’s plenty of combat too (lobbing things at the enemy for the most part, no actual weapons). Oh, and It’s probably worth checking out just to see Mr. Whirly in action.\n\nThe mod won’t start out of the box (thanks to the Steampipe update), but it’s easy enough to fix. Just open gameinfo.txt from ‘Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\research and development’ and replace the contents with this stuff[pastebin.com].\n\nYou can use this technique to fix many of the old HL2 mods, more information here.","December 25, 2013","true","13.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The part where you must get the extract from the Gaurdian larvae is axtremely nerve racking and heart pounding. Going through that tight tunnel with that huge thing was one of the most amazing parts of the game. The silo defense is absolutely BRUTAL, but fun as heck and great for running over hunters.

Alyx's ♥♥♥ is also counting if you're a certain friend of mine.\n\nThe game is starting after the crash of your train and the destruction of City 17. You're alone with Alyx in a forest and after finding an abandoned outpost, you're attacked by an enemy you've never seen before. Alyx is badly wounded and her life is at stake, only Vortigaunts can save her. And from there, you're going to a journey in a mine. And reaching the White Forest base will take time too.\n\nThis episode was released in the Orange Box, that is including Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Portal and Team Fortress 2. It was the first Half-Life on PC to have achievements, because of the release on X-box.\n\nWhile the game is short, the episode is still intense as you're meeting more Antlions (and new types too), you have to defend the outpost from them in an intense battle, a new car makes its appearance, a new combine type is also making its debut, spicing up the game but also, you're finally face to face to a real Combine. And that's scary because you can't do anything about it.\n\nThe White Forest ambush is also a good moment but the most difficult passage is White Forest defense against Striders. If they reach the base, it's game over. But with the Magnusson devices, you can quickly kill them. If you manage to make them stick, that's it.\n\nHowever, while this passage is really hard for the achievement with no building destroyed, the most annoying quest (for achievement, you're not forced to do it) is to bring the gnome to the rocket. And the gnome in your car?  Well, it's falling off every 5 seconds. So, in other words, you're going forward, stop the car, get the gnome back, restart the engine, advance, stop the car, etc... And another one that can rival that is to kill every Antlion larva in the mine (333 to crush) and some of them are well hidden.\n\nWith the cliffhanger, you'll understand why it's since 8 years that we're waiting for the Episode 3. Or Half-Life 3.","November 19, 2010","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is really split into two different parts for me, the part up until leaving the caves, and then the part after that. The first part resembles Episode One greatly, very tight enviorments and not as memorable. However, the second half of the game is absolutly amazing. The most open world Half Life has ever gotten! The scale just gets so much larger! One of the most notable differences are the Hunters. They are kinda like a smaller version of the Striders. They are yet another unique enemy that takes a lot to get it down. (And they travel in packs, so watch out for more than just one!) There is another driving sequence which is better than all pervious, and the last playable part in this game is so frustrating and yet so rewarding. And the ending... Lets just say Half Life 3 needs to get here now...\n\nPros:\n+Everything Half Life\n+Story\n+Open enviroments\n\nNeutral:\n*First half of the game\n\nNegitive:\n-No Half Life 3\n\nOverall: This was tough... 9.5/10 If only the first half was as good as the second! Then it would be perfect! I personally think the second half was better than even the orginal Half Life 2! But again, do not buy this seperatly, please get the Orange Box.","March 15, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Winton_McCloud/recommended/420/","Winton_McCloud","Winton Rainford McCloud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Winton_McCloud/","281 products in account","I am just going to say this right now. I really loved this game. This is going to be a long review as well. Just sayin'.\n\nNow, I do have reasons to say so. I personally disliked Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Episode 1. Still buy them, because to get the full experience of Episode 2 you need to know not only the story, but how much the game improved.\n\nNow, the entire Half-Life 1 (classic?) series was great, while sometimes buggy. What can I say? Golden Source is golden. The gameplay was smooth, the weapons were nice and powerfull-ish, and you played as a variety of characters.\n\n(STILL BUY THIS GAME! SKIP IF YOU DON'T LIKE CRITICISM) Here is where Half-Lfe 2 comes in. Gordon Freeman in a City 17 train, waiting with the rest of the ctizens. Commence with an overly long section without even a crowbar, picking up and throwing spare junk. A little while after, you spend way too long speeding around in an airboat. Then the Gravity Gun, to pick up and throw even more spare junk, but at high speeds. A dunebuggy with suspension level ten thousand, not to mention two types of portable infinite ammo. Last but not least, the 1500 Megawatt Black Mesa Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Gravity Gun. One last way to run around with over 9000 HEV and the one weapon to rule them all. The NPCs in the game? "Oh, Gordon Freeman. We worship you, even though you basically caused this whole mess and only saved yourself." Barney Calhoun, the dropout hero of Blue Shift? "Headhumper. Headhumper. Hey, I finally took one down!"\n\nAll of these were fun, but too drawn-out. No offense to Valve, but the majority of gamers can learn how to use a gimmick in much less time than otherwise thought. Overall, Half-Life 2 had long expanses of nothing, but in reality some of the best  gameplay experiences I've ever had.\n\n(SERIOUSLY, STILL BUY THIS GAME! YOU, THE READER, HAVE THE POWER TO SKIP AT ANY TIME!) Half-Lide 2 Episode 1. Where do I begin? Morg- Gordon Freeman wakes up, and for some reason goes right back into the Citadel. Here he aquires the Conveniently Temporary Over-Powered Blue Zero-Point Energy Manipulator. I didn't think highly of this game from up front, remembering the whimper in which Half-Life 2 ended. From here on,  The gameplay is mostly indoors with airducts, similar to Half-Life 1. But, the story was meh. To add, Alyx's AI walked right up to every enemy, and died too often. The fights were really intense, though. All being said, the game kind of ended after about three hours and one strider.\n\nOverall verdict: intense, even difficult action, but compressed into too little time, squeezing out story.\n\nvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\nHalf-Life 2 Episode 2. This game is EXCELLENT. If I can say this to the entirety of Steam after knocking the rest of Half-Life 2, I must mean something. Gordon now wakes up inside of the train that crashed. As the train slowly topples over, the obstacle course that you need to climb down changes. I also happen to love changing terrain, so good first impression. Now I begin to notice things. The flashlight that wore out in about ten seconds in the other games was replaced with one much more similar to Half-Life 1. Also on an individual battery, allowing you to dash for more than a few seconds. I gaze deeply into my teammate's eyes, she awkwardly turns away to avoid eye contact. Very human of her. The car is come-and-go. You can struggle through most areas either with or without the car. It lasted just as long as it was needed. and no longer. As for action, there was never a point without it. All was unique, as well. Half-Life 2 got stale, while Episode 1 was overwhelming. Episode 2 managed to get just the right mix of the two, combining into THE perfect balance. Rochelle- I mean, Alyx's AI was realistic, even to the level of the player. Then there's the Gnome. My good friend the Garden Gnome. As a display of how much Valve in the greatest compaby on this side of the universe, you get an achievement for carrying this guy through almost the whole game. While a pain as some points, I kind of grew to like the guy. The ALyx Vance mauled by a Hunter? "Don't look, Gnome. Shield thou purest of eyes." It's a showcase of how great the gameplay is. You literally could have taken ANY item throughout the entire game. Now, back on topic. The Characters were recovered to what they should have been. Barney as a security guard. Refugees as refugees. The vortigaunts actually using their green electricity bolts. The characters were essential to the rich storyline. The storyline alone could have made a movie, as it was what made me start rooting for Half-Life 3. Basically, every problem that I have found in any other Half-Life game was remedied in this one fantastic sequel.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nSeriously, just buy the game.\n\nNow.\n\nSell your house if you really have to.","January 26, 2014","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

In comparison to Half Life 2 Episode One this was a breakthrough and I also believe that this game is better than Half Life 2. Within the game there were various mechanics that amaze me and have clearly been worked on for a long time. The story however is the best part of Half Life. This game had emotion that is not seen in most games and the animation with it made it even better. Each part of the game was highly detailed and it did not have any long and boring parts (well, at least for me). This game was brilliant except for the jaw-dropping cliff hanger (why VALVe, why?). This was the only part that annoys me and I still anticipate Half Life 3.

Episode Two continues where Episode One left off, and is so far the last game in the Half-Life series. Once again you have Alyx as a partner, though you'll spend a part of the game by yourself because of story reasons. There's also a lot more driving around this time. It's about as long as Episode One so if you liked Half-Life 2 and Episode One, you'll probably like this. Though be warned, once you finish this game, you WILL be frustrated with the fact that Valve still hasn't come out with Episode Three or Half-Life 3 yet.","February 27","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Half-Life 2: Episode Two was developed by Valve Corporation and released late 2007.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: The story picks up, right where Half-Life 2: Episode One left off; Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman are going to be reunited with Eli Vance and Dr. Kleiner to plan the next step in their battle against the Combine forces.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577049\n\nGameplay: This game returns to the more familiar setting of Half-Life 2, you aren't forced to rely solely on the Gravity gun like in most of Half-Life 2: Episode One. There is a new NPC that you encounter called “Hunters”, these are savage killing machines that are very imposing and at times down right freighting when encountered.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577103\n\nAchievements: There are 22 achievements on Half-Life 2: Episode Two. One third of the achievements are unlocked just by playing through the story. The rest are pretty tough and require careful planning, or a very long time running around.\nThe most noteworthy achievements in this game are: Get Some Grub (“Squish every antlion grub in Episode Two” – That took forever.), and Little Rocket Man (requiring you to Carry a Garden Gnome from the beginning of the game to nearly the end) – I have an obsession with garden gnomes because of this achievement, stay away from the precious!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577080\n\nPrice: Half-Life 2: Episode Two is priced at $7.99, you're better off purchasing The Orange Box for $19.99, where you will gain all the Half-Life 2 games + Portal 1.\n\nConclusion: I think Half-Life 2: Episode One, and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, really should have been one amazing game. Separate they're short but sweet. To quickly recap, Story: Excellent. Gameplay: nearly identical to the previous games. Achievements: Getting 100% completed will take longer then Half-Life 2, or Episode One. Price: a bit high, but the orange box is an excellent deal for the whole series.\nI recommend this game to anyone who's played Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One. You don't want to jump into this game, you will want to play the previous games first.\nThank you for reading my review!\n\nRelated reviews\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode One\nHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...(Pleaseeeeee Gabe Newell, my life will be complete... my Half-Life!)","September 21, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepenguinfaggot/recommended/420/","thepenguinfaggot","Jacob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepenguinfaggot/","119 products in account","SPOILERS AHEAD\nContinuing the plot of Half-Life 2 and Episode One, Episode Two consists of seven chapters telling the story of Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance's journey to a large Lambda Resistance base called White Forest. The Combine's Earth occupation forces have used the destruction of the Citadel to begin opening a massive super portal which, if allowed to reach critical size, would allow the Combine to call in reinforcements from their homeworld and destroy the Resistance. However, as explained by Dr. Kleiner's broadcast in Episode One, it has also caused a communications blackout, leaving the Combine isolated and disorganized in the meantime. In addition, Combine Advisors, some of them still unhatched from their pods, are scattered about the region after evacuating the Citadel. A crucial part of the plot is the Combine's message home, which was copied by Alyx and Gordon before making their escape, that the Combine sacrificed the Citadel to send. It contains data on the Combine portal code, which the Resistance can use to collapse the portal before it forms completely.\n\nAfter Gordon and Alyx climb out of the wreckage of the train they used to escape City 17, they proceed away from the former city on foot. At an old transmission station, the duo temporarily establish communication with Dr. Kleiner and Eli Vance, who are currently at White Forest. After an update of events at the now-destroyed Citadel, as well discovering the importance of the transmission packet copy that Alyx had made, they are cut off as Combine sweep the area, forcing them to move. At an abandoned mine, Alyx is critically wounded by a Hunter. A vortigaunt discovers them, and leads them to an underground Resistance shelter. The vortigaunts there have the power to heal Alyx; however, Gordon must first venture into the nearby antlion colony to recover the larval extract necessary for the healing procedure.\n\nGordon retrieves the extract and the vortigaunts begin to heal Alyx. While they are distracted, the G-Man is able to contact Gordon for the first time since the start of Episode One. He hints at Alyx's importance to his own long-term plans, revealing that he saved Alyx's life at Black Mesa despite objections from an unspecified third party. The G-Man then instructs an unconscious Alyx to tell her father to "prepare for unforeseen consequences."\n\nAfter Alyx has recovered, she and Gordon proceed to White Forest. They arrive before a convoy of Combine troops, despite being slowed by multiple ambushes, road blocks, and a near-death encounter with an Advisor. There, Alyx and Gordon are reunited with D0g, Dr. Kleiner, and Eli Vance. The player is also formally introduced to Dr. Arne Magnusson, another former Black Mesa scientist who is egotistical, verbose, and authoritarian. The team of scientists are preparing a rocket, which they plan to use in conjunction with the Combine portal code and the satellite array launched by Gordon in Half-Life, to close the Combine superportal.\n\nAfter Gordon fends off an initial Combine attack on the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman which she recovered at the Citadel in Episode One. It contains footage and the current coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, as Kleiner explains, one day suddenly vanished into thin air along with part of the surrounding drydock. Although it is not explained what technology the ship contains, Kleiner insists that it should be used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters that it is impossible to control and must be destroyed. Regardless, they agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx then unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, who is physically shaken. After having Alyx leave temporarily, Eli reveals to Gordon that it was the G-Man, whom he refers to as "our mutual friend," who provided Black Mesa with the test sample that caused the "resonance cascade" (the Black Mesa incident) in Half-Life, and whispered that same strange warning to him just as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to further discuss this with Gordon after the superportal is closed.\n\nWhile the rocket is being prepared, White Forest comes under attack by a dozen Striders escorted by Hunters. Gordon engages and destroys them using experimental explosive charges created by Magnusson. The rocket is successfully launched and the super portal is closed, isolating Combine forces on Earth from their homeworld. Alyx and Gordon then prepare to leave for the Borealis, at which point Eli again warns Gordon about the ship's "cargo". The three of them head into a hangar, intending to board an old helicopter which Alyx has restored. However, a pair of Advisors burst into the hangar and restrain them. Alyx and Gordon watch helplessly as Eli is killed by one of the Advisors, but as the second Advisor prepares to kill Alyx, Dog bursts in through the roof and attacks it, causing both Advisors to flee. The game fades out slowly as Alyx, sobbing, clutches her father's body.","December 12, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepenguinfaggot/recommended/420/","thepenguinfaggot","Jacob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepenguinfaggot/","119 products in account","SPOILERS AHEAD\nContinuing the plot of Half-Life 2 and Episode One, Episode Two consists of seven chapters telling the story of Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance's journey to a large Lambda Resistance base called White Forest. The Combine's Earth occupation forces have used the destruction of the Citadel to begin opening a massive super portal which, if allowed to reach critical size, would allow the Combine to call in reinforcements from their homeworld and destroy the Resistance. However, as explained by Dr. Kleiner's broadcast in Episode One, it has also caused a communications blackout, leaving the Combine isolated and disorganized in the meantime. In addition, Combine Advisors, some of them still unhatched from their pods, are scattered about the region after evacuating the Citadel. A crucial part of the plot is the Combine's message home, which was copied by Alyx and Gordon before making their escape, that the Combine sacrificed the Citadel to send. It contains data on the Combine portal code, which the Resistance can use to collapse the portal before it forms completely.\n\nAfter Gordon and Alyx climb out of the wreckage of the train they used to escape City 17, they proceed away from the former city on foot. At an old transmission station, the duo temporarily establish communication with Dr. Kleiner and Eli Vance, who are currently at White Forest. After an update of events at the now-destroyed Citadel, as well discovering the importance of the transmission packet copy that Alyx had made, they are cut off as Combine sweep the area, forcing them to move. At an abandoned mine, Alyx is critically wounded by a Hunter. A vortigaunt discovers them, and leads them to an underground Resistance shelter. The vortigaunts there have the power to heal Alyx; however, Gordon must first venture into the nearby antlion colony to recover the larval extract necessary for the healing procedure.\n\nGordon retrieves the extract and the vortigaunts begin to heal Alyx. While they are distracted, the G-Man is able to contact Gordon for the first time since the start of Episode One. He hints at Alyx's importance to his own long-term plans, revealing that he saved Alyx's life at Black Mesa despite objections from an unspecified third party. The G-Man then instructs an unconscious Alyx to tell her father to "prepare for unforeseen consequences."\n\nAfter Alyx has recovered, she and Gordon proceed to White Forest. They arrive before a convoy of Combine troops, despite being slowed by multiple ambushes, road blocks, and a near-death encounter with an Advisor. There, Alyx and Gordon are reunited with D0g, Dr. Kleiner, and Eli Vance. The player is also formally introduced to Dr. Arne Magnusson, another former Black Mesa scientist who is egotistical, verbose, and authoritarian. The team of scientists are preparing a rocket, which they plan to use in conjunction with the Combine portal code and the satellite array launched by Gordon in Half-Life, to close the Combine superportal.\n\nAfter Gordon fends off an initial Combine attack on the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman which she recovered at the Citadel in Episode One. It contains footage and the current coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, as Kleiner explains, one day suddenly vanished into thin air along with part of the surrounding drydock. Although it is not explained what technology the ship contains, Kleiner insists that it should be used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters that it is impossible to control and must be destroyed. Regardless, they agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx then unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, who is physically shaken. After having Alyx leave temporarily, Eli reveals to Gordon that it was the G-Man, whom he refers to as "our mutual friend," who provided Black Mesa with the test sample that caused the "resonance cascade" (the Black Mesa incident) in Half-Life, and whispered that same strange warning to him just as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to further discuss this with Gordon after the superportal is closed.\n\nWhile the rocket is being prepared, White Forest comes under attack by a dozen Striders escorted by Hunters. Gordon engages and destroys them using experimental explosive charges created by Magnusson. The rocket is successfully launched and the super portal is closed, isolating Combine forces on Earth from their homeworld. Alyx and Gordon then prepare to leave for the Borealis, at which point Eli again warns Gordon about the ship's "cargo". The three of them head into a hangar, intending to board an old helicopter which Alyx has restored. However, a pair of Advisors burst into the hangar and restrain them. Alyx and Gordon watch helplessly as Eli is killed by one of the Advisors, but as the second Advisor prepares to kill Alyx, Dog bursts in through the roof and attacks it, causing both Advisors to flee. The game fades out slowly as Alyx, sobbing, clutches her father's body.","December 12, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

Though it ends on an infamous cliffhangar that won't be resolved (shots fired) and it has an slightly tedious intro involving a cave I would say it's still worth getting. If you've some how never played this I'm torn between recommending this as it's great or skipping it so you won't be stuck...waiting for a resolution. In terms of pacing you'll be moving around a lot better than in Episode 1 as with one exception there aren't any places for them to lock us up while they dump exposition on us even if it is as always well written and interesting. The highlight of Episode 2 is it's open environments in the great outdoors which were also present in Half-Life 2.","June 24, 2015","true","106.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
