"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/recommended/429260/","MeltingComet","Èæç Rip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/","329 products in account","Shmupping again!\n\nI got a key from the developer of the review. It doesn't change my opinion in any bit whatsoever.\nSIG reminds me of Platypus, and carries both it's best traits, and it's worst.\n\nPros:Fun power-ups with a variety of bullet sprays to play with.\nThe Time Distortion mechanic is really awesome! It doubles use for helping you dodge bullets and getting extra hits on a enemy.\nCo-Op Mode is pretty great too, like Platypus!\nA great variety of enemies!Nitpicks:The game is way too difficult. That isn't to say shmups like this aren't as difficult as this, but it's difficulty is sort of the back-bone of this game's content. It's gonna take awhile to beat it, despite the short number of levels. It's a double-edged sword.\nMusic? What Music? (not memorable)\nNo rebindable controls. Xbox 360 has to use the horrible d-pad to play\nWhen some explosion happens, the screen starts shaking. Nice effect, if it didn't make me feel sick.Cons:The artstyle is a clashing mess. The boss sprites look pretty good but the rest look like a horrible 8-bit mess. It doesn't feel coherrent.\nThe Sound Effects are really, really gratingThe Review\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=617019227\n\nSeriously, doesn't this game remind you of Platypus? I like the variety of power-ups that drop, and most importantly, the balance of the power-ups. The overpowered ones that do a insane amount of damage but you can lose them in a single hit. It's not a perfect balance, but is that really important? The best weapons will make the game much more easier at the cost of it losing the minute you get hit. The power-ups drop a lot though, so don't be too worried on losing your weapon.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=617019206\n\nCo-Op was a pretty neat highlight too. Hook it up and you've got a fun game to play with friends! Definitely reminds me of the days when I was playing [i[Platypus[/i] Co-Op with some good ol' buddies. Now despite how much I like Platypus, it's main flaws in it's cheap "one hit you're dead" mechanics were really grating. SIG doesn't have that thankfully, but it does have Platypus' main double-edged sword, and that's it's difficulty. Seriously, the best I could get was level 6, this game is way too hard!\n\nAlso, the screen shakes a lot and that's really annoying\n\nThe real highlight is the Time Distortion mechanic. While it doesn't work like it, it feels like the Bayonetta Witch Time. You can double it as a way to dodge narrow bullets, or get a ton of shots at a opening. I like that kind of dynamic mechanic, and it really makes what would otherwise be a simple shmup so much more interesting.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=617019171\n\nMy biggest gripe are the bosses. They are literal bullet sponges, go down easily with the OP weapons, and with a few upgrades only take a long time. They feel uninteresting to say the least, and are absolutely disappointing. And the sound design is absolutely grating.\n\nOtherwise though, I can see this being a good time killer. It's hard to get down with completely due to a lot of problems, particularly it's incoherrent artstyle and poor bosses, but it's not a bad price for a great game to play. And I freaking miss Platypus so much that I've been longing for another shooter like it. Doesn't exactly fill the quota, but still fun!\n\nTL;DR - It's not exactly high quality, but what it's quality shines at is being absolute fun.\nFINAL VERDICT: Recommended with Caution. Also recommended to fans of Platypus.\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!\nYou can find the game here:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/429260","February 5","true","0.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarvellousM/recommended/429260/","MarvellousM","@MartinNLS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarvellousM/","534 products in account","A mild recommendation, partly because I like schmups and this one is really cheap. I think what bothers me, and this isn't super important to gameplay I admit, is the art style. On the one had we have these quite charming 8-bit style sprites such as the characters you play as and some of the enemies. Then other enemies look like they were thrown together in MS Paint and are utterly hideous. These sprites just look dreadful and I found them a little distracting, why not stick with the blocky pixel art for all of the sprites?\n\nStill, you can't go wrong for just a few bucks and it's fun enough with enough different powerups and a decent difficulty curve to make it worth a laugh. Playing co-op is probably really fun too as the screen can really fill up with all sorts of chaos. If they were to change how some of those enemies looked though I wouldn't complain.","January 18","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I really wish you could, space imo works much better as the shoot button.\n\nNaked guy is obviously the best skin","January 23","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
