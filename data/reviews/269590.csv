It looks to be abandoned at this point in time.\n\nThat said, I certainly don't think that this is a bad game. It is an uncomplete game, yes, but what's there is solid and fun to play. However, being solid and fun to play does not save this game. There is nowhere near enough content to the game to keep long-term interest from someone looking for a meaty rogue-like to whet their appetite.\n\nSadly, as mentioned previously, the developer seems to have lost his interest in updating the game in any way. That being the case, I cannot recommend purchasing this title even at the five dollar asking price.","October 31, 2015","false","1.2"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","0"

But, Alas, I can not do that. Although I do think the overall game play is enjoyable, there is far too little content to leave one satisfied. The last time this game was updated was Early in 2015 just after the new year, Although it did provide a new level to the dungeon after the first Boss was defeated (Making for 2 Dungeons essentially), sprite upgrades and a few visual fixes, as well as an audio upgrade (Which had to be hot-fixed).\n\n\nThe communication attempts towards the Dev on Forums (Even his own website) go unchecked and unanswered. I honestly had a good feeling about this game as I LOVED Desktop Dungeons (Which plays very similar), but it DOES seem like the Dev has just dropped this game, as sad as it is for me to say it.\n\n\nAs far as purchasing this game goes, Part of me says buy it for the roughly $5 its at and try to have fun anyway (Like I now do), or play it safe and don't give a cent to a Dev that dropped a game like so many before him have.","May 21, 2015","false","42.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/recommended/269590/","cognitiveagent","PariahDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/","776 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGameplayRoguelikes are characterized by a list of gameplay mechanics, such as procedural level generation, permadeath, turn-based gameplay, and randomized loot. The latter includes random stat generation for equipment and unidentified potions and scrolls. This game includes all of them, but unfortunately not much else. As it stands right now, the game is a barebones roguelike in terms of gameplay. Compared to its competition in terms of gameplay, the game is running far behind. If Claustrophobia wants to stand out - even while in early access - it should have gameplay elements unique to it. Be it a fusion of gameplay elements from different genres, or simply a new set of mechanics not seen before.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple. You start your character by picking a class, and (if desired) you can do some very minor modifications. You are subsequently dropped in a dungeon where you get to fight a very small variety of standard mobs. Think of the rats, zombies, skeletons, and spiders kind. Your character has a set of abilities that cost 'mana/stamina' to use, but at the very start you will not have access to many of them. You defeat the aforementioned enemies, pick up whatever gear you find and wear it if its an upgrade or sell it if it's a downgrade if you encounter a shop.\n\nControlsThe game controls pretty well. The animations and UI are very indicative of the commands you give, and that's pretty much all that can be said about it. WIth turn-based gameplay in the standard roguelike fashion there is not much to controls. While the game has fairly little 'meat' to it as of yet, the controls are not convoluted. What I like is that you can bring out the map and click on locations to auto-walk there. Skill use and target selection is also very intuitive with a nice layout indicating range.\n\nDifficultySo far the difficulty of the game is lacking. While there are traps around, I have yet to step on one by accident. My juggernaut without any trapfinding skill is pretty much capable of seeing and disarming every trap so far encountered. While disarming a trap can still fail (and deal damage in the process), the game's health regeneration mechanics make this trivial.\n\nEvery turn you automatically recover health as long as you are not starving (in which case there is simply no health recovery). While enemies don't seem to roam through the dungeons (they stay nicely put in their enclosed rooms) waiting and healing is not dangerous at all. With the common availability of food, it is even possible to easily kill bosses simply by beelining to the entrance stairs and safely recovering your health on the previous dungeon floor, before you can resume killing the boss again.\n\nAs is common with roguelikes, positioning is key. You don't want enemies to surround you. Instead, enemies should be funneled through so only one enemy at a time can engage you. With the dungeon level design this is fairly easy to do. There is (so far, as I have discovered) only one enemy type with a ranged attack who can foul this tactic.\n\nGold seems to be too common in the game, especially since you can sell the gear you don't use. So far I have been able to purchase any gear I wanted from the shops, which means your character is more often than not well supplied with equipment of fairly high strength.\n\nLevelingWith the aforementioned ease of getting equipment, I often even forget to level because the 2 points I can add to my stats makes barely an impact based on the gear upgrades I'm getting. This makes the attribute system rather pointless. Even worse, item requirements are not tied to the base score of an attribute, but to the total score. Thus, you could wear +strength items to sufficiently increase you strength in order to wear the gear you want. This often makes me forget 2 attribute scores are given every time you level.\n\nEvery odd level you also get 2 further points to level in a skill tree and a specific ability. This system is really too convoluted. First you will need to find a skillbook of the ability you would like to use. Then you have to read it, but reading it requires a minimum amount of points in a certain skill (e.g., defense skill, or assassination skill). If you have enough points in that, you can read the book but haven't learned the skill yet. You then have to spent one point into the ability in order to learn and use it.\n\nThis system should be reworked, because it makes you require 3 things before you can use an ability, while abilities should be fairly important as they diversify combat.\n\nGraphicsGraphically, the game reminds me a lot of Pixel Dungeon (free mobile game for android devices), which actually does a much better job gameplay wise. It is nice that this game changes the looks of your character based on the gear being worn. The graphical style is good, and makes also for a clear UI. Unfortunately so far there is fairly little variation in the graphics, but this is not a point I will stress too much since it is still in early access, and graphics aren't the most important factor in roguelikes.\n\nFinal JudgementThe Good\nNice graphical style\nVery clear UI\nThe Bad\nBland and lacking content - nothing this game has to offer is unique to this title as it carries to bare minimum of what would constitute a roguelike\nIt is far too easy based on its core mechanics (health recovery per turn, ease of getting gold, dungeon layouts making enemy-funneling easy)\nThe leveling system is not that great. Convolution in one part, and barely significant in the other.\nNo variety in gameplay. The skills are limited due to the leveling system, and the currently available skills don't seem to have that much of an impact. In games like Tales of Maj'Eyal skills are essential for survival - here they barely seem to make a dent.\nThe game does what all other roguelikes do, but nothing extra. It currently lacks a lot of content and doesn't stand out among its peers. This is basically the harshest criticism of the game there is, because making a roguelike (or roguelite) nowadays seems common practice among indie developers. For now it is "just another roguelike", and despite its early access status nothing has been added that hints at interesting new mechanics. Its lack of content furthermore makes it lack much replay value aside from trying out the different classes.\n\nIf you want to satisfy your hunger for rogue-likes, try out Pixel Dungeon (mobile game, great controls, good graphics, and currently better gameplay than this game while also being fairly bare-bones) or Tales of Maj'Eyal, which is a difficult and full-featured roguelike.","January 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

I have quite a few hours on this game on Desura (eww) and quite possibly may be the reason I got Desura in the first place.

The dev is really awesome and commited and I wish all indie devs took their projects as serious and gave as much love to them as this one.  I won't go into gameplay and stuff, you can watch the videos.\n\nI would conservativly give this game a 8.5/10 anyday.

Claustrophobia has options; lots and lots of options!  Different classes, armor and weapons, shops, and spells for every class, not just the mages.  Now add unknown scrolls and potions, traps, teleporters, and dealing with hunger,  Then add the management of character stat points for each level as well as dealing with your choice of specialties and you quickly realize Claustrophobia is a different game every time you play.\n\nAnother thing I enjoy about this game is it's fair.  The best way I can explain it is every time I have died, it is because I made a mistake and I know it.  Thismay not be a good thing if you're a roguelike veteran who makes very few mistakes.  Personally, I prefer strategy over luck-based gameplay and Claustrophobia does a good job of making the game tough, but fair.\n\nI'm going to confess that I'm not a fan of roguelikes but I am having a blast with this game.  It feels like a good dungeon delving RPG with tough objectives.  I die a lot, but I get a little better every time I play.  I look forward to seeing how Claustrophobia develops further; it's quite playable already.","January 5, 2015","true","16.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Period.\n\nIt is turned based, meaning for every action you take or over movement you make, the monsters also take a turn.  You can't out-move or click your mouse fast to get extra strikes on them... that will get you killed fast, trust me, hehe.  Instead, take your time, plan strategically in your battles and movement, and that is where this game shines.'\n\nThere is tons of loot, store 'rooms' inside the dungeon that you can find where you can pawn your junk and buy needed gear.  There is level ups that give you points to add to stats, new special abilities/spells to add, and new perks to unlock.  Add to this all the real feeling you get of 'exploring' the dungeon as rooms are revealed from the darkness as you explore them, and this game is a simple, but deep and very fun little gem.\n\nThis game is worth three times it's asking price.

Every encounter is tense, you never know when or where more supplies are going to turn up from, you are kept on your toes and if you get overconfident, you die.\nIt really is a thrill and many of us would agree that you feel crushed when you die in a Rogue-like game, but from the ashes you rise again!\n\nHell, even games that aren't rogue-like in nature may feature an ironman mode or a hardcore mode such is the legacy of the rogue-like.\n\nEnter this game.\n\nRouge-likes are supposed to be hard!\nFor me, I've played a lot of rogue-likes or games with perma-death and without a doubt the one recurring theme is that you take the safest build possible. This obsoletes most of the other things in the game. Build health, build just enough damage to kill things respectabley and not an iota more. Build defensive stats and evasion. Horde food.\n\nPlaying through this game was just me going through the motions. It didn't bring anything new or "challenging but fair" it was just another rogue game, designed like it was painting by numbers.\n\nBut wait! You can customize your own class! That's what the promotional blurb said anyway.\nI won't critique the interface for not being clear on this aspect, that is subjective. However how can I customize my class when there are no classes to customize with! We have warrior, shieldbearer, ranger, thief and hex-caster/warlock. With the exception of pairing up Warrior and Shieldbearer, none of those other classes work well, combined! An arguement can at least be made for ranger/thief since thief gets stealth but what on earth are you going to combine warlock with?\n\nDoesn't matter anyway because here is the golden rule. Stun rules.\nRules every game that it is in and this is no exception. Shieldbearer and Warlock get stun, you may combine the two classes if you want but regardless you will want shieldbearer since he has the longest stun, no matter how you build your class, get that stun or you are going to get annihilated.\n\nThis game is a struggle to keep playing\nUltimately the game is not good. It is drowned out by a sea of games that do what this is trying to do but better, much better. The music is good, the art direction is very good, but the game is just paint by numbers. Traps you can't see? Check. There is a perk for that by the way and it is the ONLY perk worth your while. Hunger? Check. An outdated relic but hey, Rogue did it so we'll be damned if we don't! Monsters that outscale you horribly? Oh yes, got to have that, so playing Melee is a huge waste of your time. I could go on but you get the idea and really the only question worth a damn is; is it good? To which my answer is no, it is too tedious and too boring because that is the only playstyle that will keep you alive. Stun, hit a few times, run away. If Ranger, place a trap, run away. If thief, you are already dead. If Warlock, cast poison, run away.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","September 23, 2014","false","9.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","5"

It has taken obvious inspiration from Dungeons of Dredmor, and in many ways I think it personally succeeds and being superior. The animations, the moving, the combat is so lovely and clean compared to D&D which I find jittery and sometimes buggy.\nAt the moment though, C:TDS is very much an unfinished game. Once you get the hang of it, and it will take you several new characters, and once you have descended through each floor and fought the final "boss" you have then reached the end of the current version (I think this is about 5 floors?). You are told how the game is in alpha stage and that there are plans for much more content, which I think will truely make this game fly. But for now, you are sent back to the beginning of the (randomly generated) dungeon to face harder and meaner foes.\n\nAs I mentioned before, when/ if this game is fully finished, I believe it will be very successful. Much like D&D.\nThe loot system is superb. I found myself grinning with glee everytime I stumbled upon a new weapon/ piece of armour/ piece of jewellery with awesome stats and felt very satisfied as these improved stats worked their magic quite visibly so.\nThe combat is beautiful, and so... Idk, clean! It has nice sound effects which makes killing enemies very satisfying.\n\nThe hunger system is a nice little added tidbit which makes it very challenging. You will be very pleased to find a big slab of meat lying on the ground, even if it is green and potentially unsafe to eat, as long as if satisfies your hunger, you're happy!\n\nOne final note/ plea: Please devs! Please complete this game! I love it so much and it would be even more perfect if it were complete with the features hinted in the final message at the end of the dungeon.\n\nOverall I give this game an 8.5/10. I will happily update my review once the game has more content.","October 10, 2014","true","9.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neko-Furry/recommended/269590/","Neko-Furry","7hunderhorse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neko-Furry/","274 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off, I'm not saying that this is a bad game. As it is, Claustrophobia is a fully fuctional roguelike dungeon crawler that certainly captures overly unforgiving nature of the genre. However, this is not to say that the game is all that great either, especially when compared to other (very) similar games.\n\nWhile most roguelikes tend to follow a similar gameplay regime, Claustrophobia does very little to make itself stand out from other games, namely Dungeons of Dredmor. Aesthetically, it uses the same 3D top-down dungeon view as Dredmor, and the cartoony style of the sprites is very similar as well. Even the title screen appears to have taken influence with the logos using almost matching fonts and the backdrop depicting a very similar scene. And while Dungeons of Dredmor implemented an extensive skill system and an imaginative cast of baddies, Claustrophobia seriously lacks in the character customization department. And the enemies?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sawadegan/recommended/269590/","Sawadegan","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sawadegan/","605 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAbandoned Game\nI bought this game due to the fact that, it looked pretty good, graphic-wise, and the fact that I like rogue-like games.\nWell, I'm disappointed, the developer, who seemd to want to create something fun, has pretty much abandoned the development of this game. Until the developer decides to do something, this review remains negative. I can't recommend this Early Access title, and I won't. Has potential, but no kinetic energy, as of yet.\n\nThe game IS fun, it's very fun! But with the lack of features, the lack of support, and the fact that the dev. no longer responds is a big issue. When the developer comes back, I'll fix this review.\n\nGameplay:\nIt's the same as any other rogue-like game; take turns, open doors, kill monsters, collect loot, and travel farther down. I hope for an option to keep your character's stats, rather than just looks (and maybe even name?), as it can get extremely repetitive just re-statting characters. There are multiple items throughout the game, and many pathways you can take. Luck based game, you either open a door a lucky-man, or open a door and die as an un-lucky man.\n\nStory:\nThe story is what you make of it, it's a role-playing game (duh). The only thing you know is that you have to survive and dwell deeper into the tower(?).\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are simple, which is expected, and it can only appeal to fans of the genre. Plus, as a bonus, you can change textures/art in the folder, which is always nice. The art is not clunky, not too serious, but just right.\n\nClasses:\nThis is one of the better elements of this game, albeit the short amount of classes (3). You have your basic classes: rogue, warrior, shaman, and archer (archer is the best in my opinion). Instead of being forced into the game with the generic class skills, you have skills/skill trees you can choose before you get into game; warrior's can use the shaman's black magic, same applies with rogue and so-forth. It's fun to mix up classes and skills, just to see how far I can get with said skill-set(s).\n\n6/10\nThis game easily could have been an 8/10, but due to having no-updates (being in Early Access), I can't recommend this. Unless, of course, you're looking for an unpolished rogue-like game. The game itself is fantastic, so far, but it REALLY needs some updates. The lack of armor/weaponry, buffs, enemies, textures (same textures), and other things, are totally fine, but the fact is, the developer hasn't been here to take care of that stuff, which is disappointing.","December 2, 2015","false","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As stated in the description, this is more of a demo/proof of concept than a game as of this date that you can support. It is very short and shallow. Everything levels up with your character so RNG has little impact currently. I really hope the author introduces more RNG that forces you to make strategic decisions on what limited resources you consume each new game. I also feel like using the skills should be more strategic and possibly buffed instead of just resting and using them all every fight. The resting mechanic should be removed or changed to make this possible. I don't think a cooldown system can work well and maybe should be changed to a energy/mana system with limited replenishment. It is early access, so I have hope it will become a great game!","September 29, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Your gameplay, gear and skills are important too.\n\n+ Nice Graphics, UI & musics\n+ Easy shop system\n+ Roguelike, permadeath\n+ Rpg system : 4 classes with attributes/skills/spells to manage\n+ Many enemies to kill (normal, champion, elite, boss) with challenging fights\n+ Cheap price\n+ More features in future (craft, bosses, dungeons, item, ...)\n+ Devs seem to correct bugs very fast and take care on Steam forum.\n+ Recommended (even if i give a negative here), you can buy it\n\n- Unbalanced rooms (difficulty and number of mobs)\n- Mobs are all able to open doors & follow you as soon they spot you\n- Starving system ruin your progress if you don't find food to feed you.

Yes, the whole dungeon crawl premise is being over done, but I feel like this game captures it pretty well without making it overly difficult. A bit complex, yes, but it balances everything out with the equipment you can get and if you have the mind for it you will overcome any challenge thrown at you.\n\nThe game randomly generates the floors of a dungeon, with certain things being certain per floor, such as shops so you can spend the hard earned gold from killing monsters. Each class starts with two skills, and earns more from shops, searching bookshelves, and possible monster drops. The hunger system is actually a really interesting mechanic that adds that extra layer and helps to seperate it from other games of the genre. If your character gets to the point you are starving (I say if because food is quite generous in the game, unless you get really unlucky) your health regen stops entirely, making your only way to gain health potions and leveling up (which will become a lot more difficult even with great gear). You generally find the food on the floor or in boxes, and you can find rotten food for those times when you are real desperate and NEED your health regen back to get back into the fight.\n\nThe level up system is interesting as well. It's not your typical "Level up your skills and base stats" even though it uses some of those aspects. You get the choice of what you want to do with the points. You get 2 points to spend on your base stats, which I enjoy because the other games generally give you 4 or 5 making it rather easy to make a tank, DPS, or just impossible to hit character, and every other level up (I believe it's the odd number ones, if you prefer to keep track that way) give you one point for traits and one point for skills (HOWEVER you must keep in mind that in order to level up your skill you need to find a book for a skill first and waste your skill point learning it). The traits are interesting and vary from skills that increase your hunger so you won't have to worry about food to trap detection/disarming (Both from same trait/feat) so you can alter your character each run. OH, right, once a character is dead, that's it. So that means no "Oh, I'll run in, level up, die and start with him again" nope, none of that, it's on the spot thinking to keep you on your toes and make you think about what you level up before you jump right in.\n\nAll that being said, if you like the sound of that this game, I absolutely recommend it and think you should pick it up because you will have hours of fun playing it and seeing how well you end up doing. If not, well, I'm sure you'll find something that you will enjoy. After all, Steam has plenty of games for everyone.\n","March 1, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
