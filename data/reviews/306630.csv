I am British so I don't have any real feeling of immersion playing the American Civil War but like any strategy game its the act of fighting a strategic war, with historical troops, and finding out about things you didnt know about that makes this game really interesting. The Civil War is an interesting period of history as well in that both sides had it tough, the war was a long brutal one, with much movement and innovation. So its an interesting conflict to play.\n\nThe mechanics in this game are spot on. For example you dont move alone you move at the same time as the enemy does, so you have to predict where they are going to be and often you can get surprised. So thats very realistic. Far more realistic than attacking a paused enemy. Also you have very detailed heirarchy of troops including armies and corps, a lot like Paradox's Hearts of Iron 3 in fact. You get bonuses to things like supply and attack coordination for being well supported and organised which is good.\n\nYou can use gunboats to support your attacks, You can syncronise your attacks, You can even have neighbouring friendly armies 'march to the sound of guns' and automatically move to support you in a battle.\n\nPretty much everything you feel should be in the game is actually in the game, and this game is far more polished than the first game.\n\nThe only downsides are that the game might not be all that stable - many crashes have been reported and I had a critical error crash in the first tutorial, five minutes into the game on my first turn's generation, but none in the actual game since. Also the GUI is rather bland looking compared to the lovely period one in the first game but its far easier to see whats going on and there are mods to add cosmetic improvements to it.\n\nOverall I would say this is probably the most complex strategic game I have ever played. The complexity does put you off playing it unless you have a bit of time and brain power to spare, but for those who love very deep strategy games this is about as deep as they get.","July 9, 2014","true","15.6"," 113 of 116 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","113","116","0","7"

I ended up getting the game and was very very happy with it. It has a tremendous amount of depth, features and choice options on how to manage your side of the conflict. I really enjoy the strategic and regional level choices, while coordinating supply and unit command formations.\n\nI hate bugs and I hate crashes, when i read that in the reviews it was very dissapointing and I almost didn't purchase the game. If you are experience crashes, there are several suggestions in the forum as to fixes. For me personally I used the userpath.ini delete fix and thought that worked very well cutting down on crashes. Also something to note, you can get the game to auto save between 3-12 turns...so crashes or tech issues shouldn't stop anyone from playing as you can easily recover, and sometimes just reprocess the turn.\n\nImmersion, This game via its strategic and regional level options combimed with supply, unit production and army configurations is defintely a deep, rich and immersive experience. The map is huge, has many fiters and the wego system is by far the best system to be used on this kind of game. I want to really reiterate that, some games I don't think its great for and this is the first game I've truly been able to say, is better off for having the wego system as it provides the best gaming experience for this war/era.\n\nThis is not for the light hearted gamer nor the total war style of gamer. This is actually more realistic because in a grand strategy sense you are not some godlike presence that can order every individual unit on the battlefield. You do choose who commands your bde, division, corps or armies, you do get to build up these types of units and combine them to make your composition of forces, and if you pay attention to the ground your fighting on, supply, unit cohesion and all the other factors the game takes into account, you will do well. However, if you take 20k men into a seige, tell them to assault the walls with no arty support, guess what, ur men are gonna get slaughtered.\n\nI personally spend 1-2 hours per turn, the game does 2 week time frames, early in the month for the first two weeks and late in the month. This works great because the game using the wego system processes each turn into 15 days. So coordination of forces matter a lot and in reality u have every single day of the war being played.\n\nI had never been a fan of the ageod battle system, I personally dont think its right for the american rev period, nor do i think its right the for world war one era, for the civil war and the napoleonic era though its really is the most realistic and superior system for those time periods. I encourage you if you are a grand strategy fan, to try it and give yourself a few days of playing to get used to it. I believe like myself you will see the benefit and the beauty of the system in this time period for this title.\n\nYou will absoutely get your monies worth if you put in the time to learn the features and options. The Grand strategy genre is my absolutely favorite and those are the games I really excell at because of all the different things you have to manage. I know this isn't billed as grand strategy because you can only play two sides, but the amount of choice, different options and features in the game make it a grand strategy title to me. Indeed, I wish they came out with a game like this that allowed u to be any country in the world like a lot of the paradox titles allow you to do.\n\nAll in all i highly recommend this game if you love history, the civil war, and grand strategy games.\n","September 17, 2015","true","81.2"," 66 of 68 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","66","68","2","0"

It is for people who enjoy taking the time to plan their actions, to include both short and long term goals. Playing as the CSA in the gam'es largest campaign is quite difficult and you will develop an appreciation for the strategic and logistical problems the South faced during the War of Northern Aggression. The AI is quite good at exploiting your weaknesses and, playing as the CSA, I have often fallen afoul of Federal raids into the relatively undefended regions of Louisiana and it's important industrial center of New Orleans. The AI has also done a good job of reacting to my offenses and will quickly trade a weakened force for a stronger one.

The game requires you to micromanage a lot of units, even simple actions require hundreds of clicks and repeating the same tedious minutiae over and over again.\n\n1. The game is poorly optimized and resolving a turn takes way too long.\n2. The UI is very user-unfriendly and the game is absolutely horrible at providing you the information  you need to understand what is going on. This is a huge issue with a game of such large scale.\n3. The map gets cluttered with unit stacks and sorting these out is a tedious and unnecessarily long process.\n4. The game's command chain and army organisation rules are interesting, but are poorly implemented which inhibits gameplay.\n5. The AI makes poor, illogical choices - Confederate AI in late 1861  for example moved teh vast majority of troops from Richmond in order to mount a pointless offensive at Cleveland Ohio. As a result I took Richmond in December 1861 far too easily.\n6. Only supports Play By Email multiplayer. We did it back in the 1990s, time to move on AGEOD.\n\nThe end result is that the game is tedious, slow and user-unfriendly at its very worst. I'm thoroughly disappointed by it., especially after reading the positive reviews. Sadly the reviewers failed to report on the game's numerous shortcomings.\n\nLong, detailed version:\n\nGAMEPLAY,AI, RULES, REALISM:\n\nThe AI is in general not very good and will pursue both historically implausible offensives as well as moves that are plain dumb. In my game as the Union, the confederate AI moved most of its army from the Shenandoah and Richmond to launch a strike at Cleveland Ohio. This allowed me to take a mostly undefended Richmond in December 1861, while the AI was gallivanting at lake Erie.\n\nSupply rules are very poor and create absurd situations - that Confederate army in Cleveland was cut off from the south entirely, but stayed in supply as Cleveland was a city with a harbor and thus generated a lot of supply. The game did not "notice" that said harbor was at a lake controlled by the Union.\n\nPolitical and economic decisions are good, like in most AGEOD games. However, again like in most AGEOD games, these take a back seat to actual military action and that's where the game does not perform well at all.\n\nCombat results are poorly explained and I found myself scratching my head many times. For example, a 5000 men division of mine collided during movement with a 11 000 enemy force. Both were in clear terrain, 100% supplied, I was the attacker and my general was a very poor one, my units mostly volunteer militias and I did not have enough Command points for this stack either. For some absurd reason I basically overran the enemy unit, dealing 5000+ casualties at the cost of 700 men. I checked all the after-battle reports and found no indication why this was so. The report even stated that some of my men deserted at the face of the enemy! (no such status for the opposing side) So why did I won?! This is just one example, I seen such outcomes numerous times.\n\nThe tactical options once a battle takes place are very simplified, you do not get to command any units on a tactical map or nothing of that sort. Instead you pick from a series of strategy cards, which function much in a scissors-paper-rock fashion. Very disappointing.\n\nOPTIMIZATION:\n\nThe game is poorly optimized, Even with the "Give AI more time" options turned off resolving turns takes a lot of time. On average (counted for December 1861 and March 1862) each WEGO turn takes 3.5 minutes to resolve and that is just the units moving, I'm not counting the time consumed at simulating battles. The main campaign has 114 turns, which gives you 6.6 hours of just waiting for the computer to resolve the moves.\n\nUI:\n\nThe UI in most AGEOD games is bad, but here the sheer amount of units greatly increases the problems one has with this. The eastern theatre between Washington and Richmond becomes quickly cluttered with numerous stacks that with their graphics cover beneath them objectives and terrain. This made sorting out my Army of the Potomac a huge pain and took a lot of time each turn.\n\nIt is absolutely necessary in the game to combine brigades into divisions, these into a corps and these into armies. The game does a poor job at depicting which corps stack belongs to which army - to check you have to click on it every time and even then all it does is to flash the army command stack - which might in some cases be a screen or more away. To remove a single brigade from a division, you need to manually disband the whole division and then re-form it. You will need to do this all the time, in order to send damaged brigades to the rear to let them rest and refit.\n\nOn  a map of this size, with so many small units being built in various locations it becomes vital to quickly locate the unmoved newly deployed units. Yet the game does not have a "go to next unmoved unit" button. So each time you need to open the ledger with some 80+ unit stacks listed and search for that 3 unmoved militia brigades that you want to ship out by rail. Which can be a big pain, as you need to distinguish them from 16 other militia units you placed in various regions to act as immobile garrisons - the ledger will not filter these out for you.\nThe ledger was so unwieldy and user-unfriendly, that I actually resorted to al-tabbing and creating an excel spreadsheet to keep tabs on various units.\n\nRenaming stacks could help with this mess, but sadly there's a bug which did not allow me to delete the old name and replace it with a new one. Very frustrating.\n\nIn short, the horrible UI combined with the huge scale of the game made it near unplayable - it was a tedious, long and annoying process just to understand what is going on the map.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nWhile graphics in strategy games are not that important, I would like to observe two things\n1) Unit and leader graphics were clear, crisp and pleasant to look at. Definitely one of the stronger sides of the game.\n2) The map on teh other hand felt bland, the colors were unrealistic and annoying. My eyes became tired after a few hours looking at the map, which is a bad sign - does not occur in most strategy games. This is a real downgrade from AGEOD's first civil war game, where the map was in soft, natural colors and much easier to look at.\n\nSOUND:\n-Sounds felt generic, not bad nor very good.\n- Music was ok as it was period instrumental tracks. Sadly most were very short and after s few hours became very repetitive.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\nOnly supports Play By Email multiplayer. We did it back in the 1990s, time to move on AGEOD.","February 26, 2015","false","19.2"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","44","61","4","2"

It's extremely complex, but that translates into a realistic feeling:  war is complex.\n\nUnfortunately, AGEOD has dropped the ball in 2 major areas:\n\nFirst, the bugs.  Almost all players have commented on them, so it's the game, not individual computers.  In a campaign, the game crashes about every 3rd turn.  Fortunately, reloading the game with a previous save allows the war to go on.  Except I reached March 1863 and encountered a hard crash that's unrecoverable, recurs after reboots & reloads.\n\nThat's hundreds of hours down the tubes.  (I'm running an i7-3770 w/ 64 GB RAM & 4GB VRAM, Windows 10).  The game's been out almost a year -- 6 months since the last patch.  Obviously AGEOD has taken what money suckers gave them and gone on to other projects.\n\nThe 2nd problem is balance.  In my games, whenever the USS Monitor meets the CSS Virginia, the Confederate ironclad is obliterated in a single battle, leaving the Monitor unscratched -- and able to navigate the Atlantic in winter to reach the Florida keys without refueling.\n\nIt's impossible for the South to capture Washington.  There are over 1000 points locked into the city, ready to be released any time a Southern unit steps foot in Montgomery County (even if the unit is retreating from a minor skirmish in Frederick MD).  Not only that, a union army of about 500 points suddenly appears in Fairfax VA out of nowhere.\n\nDon't capture and then exit a union town.  A unit suddenly appears out of nowhere and retakes the town.  Though only 17-points strong, it can withstand seige by a 200-point division for more than 5 turns.\n\nSigh.  CW II would be such an interesting game, if only AGEOD could invest just a little more time to fix the remaining problems.","January 3","false","59.7"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","31","43","0","1"

You can see by the hours I have put in that I like this game. It was my first AGEOD experience and at first I admit I was rather confused at what to do.  But after reading the AGEOD forums I found that not only is this game amazing and the best American Civil War game available, but that the developers are very interactive with their gamers and have numerous other games for different time periods while they contantly improve on their methods.\n\nYou have to like the game board turn based style.  If that is not your thing, maybe its not right for you, but you never know until you try. I am now a huge AGEOD fan and it all started with this game which I bought on a whim and despite other negative reviews from people who probably prefer to play Assasin's Creed or a similar game.\n\nMy opinion? 100% recomended. Right now it is by far my favorite game.

Only they would have the time to play such a complex game.  Not that I don't like complex.  I love Dwarf Fortress and Hearts of Iron III.  But in this game they somehow mixed complex with abstract information.  For example, a battle result screen covers the whole computer screen but I can't find where it says who won.  And also, it measures a unit's strength by giving it a 'power' number.  Hmm..how about just telling me how many soldiers or horsemen or artillerty it has?  It makes judging how much force you have in a certain stack kind of hard.  Is 230 a good number?  What about 890?  And this, of course, is not a solid number - as weather, terrian, and other factors can change it during the battle.\n\nOnce again, let me point out, that I have played and enjoyed complex games.  Norm Koger's The Operational Art of War, with the 160 page manual, for example is a great game.\n\nBut this game....\n\nOrganizing your units has been made more complex than it every needs to be.  Units who are part of a chain of command do better than those out on their own - which makes sense.  But forming Armies and moving them can take much of your time.\n\nSadly, for such a complex game, the political and economic parts of game are nothing but you triggering certain events that cost money and victory points and so on.\n\nThere is also supplies, training, transporting, and so-on, so-forth.\n\nThe UI is the most complex I have ever seen and the tutorials are good for what they explain.  But I would say they cover about 50% of the game's interface and do not even touch on the naval forces or blockades.  Even the manual points out that tooltips are needed because many functions are not covered in the manual.  Let me repeat that.  The manual states that many functions are not covered in the manual.\n\nYou will not even be able to get a refund as the tutorials will take you more then two hours.\n\nI strongly suggest this game only for gamers who a lot of time, who love the American Civil War, and are willing to spend a few days learning how the game works.  Other wise....skip it.","September 7, 2015","false","9.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

This game captured my attention right from the beginning, right from the main screen.\n\nThere was something about it, that made it look very "authentic", so I gave it the oportunity, and went through all the tutorials. It probably takes you about 2 or 3 hours to go through all the tutorials when reading the whole thing, but it was worth it.\n\nWhen I started my first solo campaign, I started experimenting, moving the pieces. I have to be honest, sometimes I felt lost. It takes some time to get used to the user interphase. When I started to get more familiar with the game, thats when the sense of achievement started invading me. Enacting the economic, military and diplomatic decisions, recruiting a great variety of units, choosing the right generals for the right army, corps or division... OMG, loved it!\n\nRight now after 50 something hours in the game, I'm still enjoying playing the Union. I think I'm still going through the learning curve, since I believe there are still some tricks I'm missing in order to dare starting a full scenario siding with the CSA (that is a challenge).\n\nUsually I don't like writing reviews, but this game is a true gem, and as such, I think it is my duty to spread out the good word.","August 9, 2014","true","113.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

While the game developers did take some historical liberties creating game, they did accurately demonstrate the complexities, nuances, and difficulties of single-handedly commanding an entire war - let alone the American Civil War - which I have yet to see repeated. So, if you're a die-hard Civil War or turn-based strategy games, you might want to check this game out.\n\nOn the other hand, the game can be buggy, the AI intelligence can be slow at times, and you essentially need a massive adderall prescription to comprehend the manual in a single reading. Furthermore, the game is offers a strictly *top-down" all supreme commander's perspective of the war. Probably for various reasons, the game developers decided to omit tactical enagements (much to my, and others, chagrin). Also, the game's price tag is pretty steep; the only reason why I purchased the game is because I think there are a dearth of great Civil War video games for me to nerd out on in lieu of my social life. Yet, price is a matter of perspective I suppose.\n\nFinally, I know my review is rather cursory: I didn't delve too deeply into the mechanics of the game, its graphics, its GUI, and so on. I suspect anyone with a deep interest in the Civil War will probably overlook their qualms with these elements of the game just to enjoy burning Atlanta to the freaking ground (I sure did, anyway). I'm sure there are other reviews which offer a more detailed account about the game and its mechanical flaws anyway. So, in conclusion, if you're hardcore Civil War nerd, then by all means - buy the game. If not, you'll most likely want to save your money for other titles that've been tickling your fancy lately.

However enough ruminating - the game itself offers a very entertaining model of the strategic military aspects of the war.\n\nLeadership and command ratings of the various generals are brilliantly realised - which is somewhat of a disadvantage with the game as it has a large bearing on influencing tactics i.e. rush to get your most able generals promoted as early as possible - but , as wargamers. we have the invaluable benefit of hindsight to know that Grant, Sherman, Forrest, Cleburne et al were extremely capable - the enjoyment is in giving them opportunities to shine in other theatres and to change the course of history.\n\nRelated to this is the extremely well realised Army and Corps structure - with the most able generals 'marching to the sound of the guns' and turning a desperate situation into a glorious victory. It also makes historical scenarios repeatable as it's extremely viable to tempt an opposing force into a seemingly winning situation only to throw a nasty surprise his way ala Lee and Jackson.\n\nSupply is another strength of the AGEOD engine - it's possible for many a glorious victory march by a well led force to flounder in the face of cut off supply routes.\n\nMy only issue so far (playing as the CSA) is that compared to the first incarnation of the game (Blue and the Gray) is that the Union AI appears less apt to stretch my resources in the western theatre or with his naval superiority - but that might be due to me being more prepared for these eventualities.\n\nI'd recommend this game to fellow ACW affeciandos - however it won't be to everyone's tastes - you either enjoy the AGEOD engine and it's sometimes annoying fatal crashes (but every turn is auto saved and in terms of hours played they aren't that frequent) or you don't.\n\nIn short the best strategic game of the Civil War you're likely to find.","June 19, 2015","true","211.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you are impatient, have a low tension span, or like fast-paced games then this is not for you. The game takes a while to learn which I really like. It's fun in the learning stages but can get frustrating at some points.\n\nThere are two cons I have with this game- 1. The UI could use some tweaking.  2. The game has much needed work on the stability issues (It usually crashes between 7-11 turns).\n\nWhere this game really shines is how you can change history, but in a much detailed level. From industralizing the South to making decisions to convincing the border states to join the CSA, it has it all.\n\nThe games engine allows you to organize your army as you see fit. When you do, many minor or major factors apply which can be game changers for the next battle. So make sure you use the system of organization wisely (brigades, divisions, corps, and armies)","June 5, 2015","true","105.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While wonderfully deep, this strategy game is almost unplayable due to the amount of time the AI takes to make a turn. While you're itching to get in that one more turn you'll be sitting there waiting for the computer to finally make their move. Most of the game will be spent sitting and waiting to go again.

The description details it as a multiplayer game.. any experienced gamer would expect to to be a multiplayer game.. but no.. they call it multiplayer because you can PBEM thats.. play by email. MULTIPLAYER!\n\n2. This game eats itself in only a matter of turns.. and anytime I have anything interesting about to happen I get a flurry of fail messages in french. Some can be skipped by and you get to go back to a dying game that you know can go no farther. In this state its often unable to create a new save game. So it reverts on the next resume.

This game is from the 2004 time.  Built to run on Windows XP!!!!  There is virtually no playability at all.  This game was promoted as a new game!!!!!!!  I want my money back!!!!!!!!  I paid 49.95 for this useless game....................................\n\n\nAccount mebotz","December 7, 2014","false","10.0"," 2 of 28 people (7%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","7","2","28","5","0"

It gives you a bunch of numbers, names of units, etc. that mean absolutely nothing. It is just one big crap shoot. Take all of the time to tediouslly make your moves and then ?????? NOTHING MATTERS! Some units don't even move, some take forever to move a couple squares, some may fight with the outcome like throwing dice, others don't even fight. They just both occupy the same town square.\nYou end the game always feeling like you have been cheated.\nBecause I was! What a waste of money on CRAP!!

Im not one who needs all the bells and whistles that a game like TW Shogun 2 offers although i absolutely love that game, this is different however with no rts at all just turn based GP. the graphics, if your into that kind of thing are lame at best and the game crashes about every 6-10 turns on average (which is unacceptble for me since i payed full price) and i have a pretty sweet rig so i know this crappy game isnt maxing my pc out. simply for me to write a review on any game should speak volumes to anyone reading this as I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS but this game has P****D me off for the last time.\nSo to sum this up people its got awesome historical value, i love the depth at which i can organize my units i.e brigades, divisions, corps and finally armys, GREAT. however all that aside for $40 these guys are completely insane like i said i can play shogun 2 on the highest graphics settings with the max # of troops possible and it doesnt even phase my rig SO WHY DOES THIS S****Y A*S GAME KEEP F*****G CRASHING ARE YOU KIDDING ME SERIOUSLY GUYS GET YOUR S**T TOGETHER AND FIX THE GOD***N GAME I PAYED YOU GOOD MONEY FOR THIS TURD WITH NO OPTION OF A REFUND SO THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS PUT OUT A D**N PATCH OR SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!\nWith all that said please dont do what i did and read all the reviews and think "nah my rig is bada** it should be fine" BECAUSE IT WONT DONT BUY IT PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD I SPENT 10 MIN OF MY LIFE WRITING THIS TO SAVE YOU, THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS HEED MY ADVICE............ thank you\np.s the devs should be ashamed im serious this is the only game review ive ever written but this is not the only bad game ive played (so whats that tell ya) usually i can chalk it up as loss and move on but as i said in the begining i do like the game and most of the content i just want so badly for it to work but after getting on the net and reading more into it can see thats not going to happen.... DONT BUY IT FOR F*CKS SAKE PLEASE...\n\n..................................................\n\nok so they did put a patch out sometime ago that fixed the issue so the games alright i just quit playing after a while. i did end up being able to complete 1 campaign all the way through a long time after i wrote this review like i said i just got fed up quit playing finally. so changing to a positive review and i appreciate the devs listing to their customers.","March 24, 2015","true","87.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

There's a lack of polish there though, some bugs, and some things definitely feel unfinished (like text entries for elements still containing placeholders), but it's a worthwhile time and money investment overall.","May 31","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
