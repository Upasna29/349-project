"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/246800/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I love music. It's always been a huge part of my life, whether that's listening to a fresh track or making my own, and I couldn't imagine a world without it. The citizens of BeatBlasters III aren't as big fans of it, in fact they've gone so far as to outlaw any and all music being played or listened to in their quaint little suburbia. Obviously this simply won't do, and thus you must liberate the town from itself...by escorting monkeys to choppers and protecting panda bears from giant gumdrops?\n\nTo try and make sense of BeatBlasters would be a foolish endeavor, as everything about it is as nonsensical and random as any game I've ever played. Putting you in the head bobbing, foot tapping shoes of the musically powered Gina and Joey, each level tasks you with a bizarre objective requiring you to utilize your three abilities: a shield, a plasma shot, and a hoverboot jump.\n\nWhere the musical aspect comes into play is recharging said abilities by tapping to the beat of the song. Keeping a steady rhythm forms combos which let you charge them faster, making getting into the groove a necessity as levels quickly become more challenging. It's a moderately interesting idea, but in practice only serves to frustrate.\n\nEverything about BeatBlasters is slow and clunky, from your movements to character animations, to the awkward transitions between track layers which constantly skip and repeat themselves. It's frustrating to play even when it works, but during hectic moments requiring quick timing it's an abysmal mess of trying to charge your shots and complete your objective in time. The objectives themselves are of little consequence, as almost all fall into the same mold of protecting or escorting the  dumbest NPCs to ever inhabit a game. You would be forgiven for mistaking them for being on deaths door for how sluggishly they move through levels, all but begging enemies to kill them and get it over with.\n\nThe artwork itself hovers from moderately interesting, too simplistic and unimaginative. Characters especially suffer from awkward transitions and an extremely limited move-set. I can appreciate the variety in locals, but even then there is little character in the backgrounds and no consistency with whatever theme the developers themed to be going for. As a musically themed game, the loop heavy tracks are uninspired and aggravating to hear continually repeat themselves off time as they unsuccessfully attempt to sync with your actions.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what I expected from BeatBlasters III, but what I got was a dull, repetitive and unpolished experience that wouldn't cut it as a third-rate flash game. There's nothing I can recommend about it besides not being inherently broken from bugs, as the presentation, controls, and underlying mechanics all work against themselves to suck any fun that could have been had with the game.\n\nAnd if King Banana wants anymore bananas he can bloody well get them himself!","April 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","1"

(Going through all stages one time on easy or normal should take around three hours.) This is a really fun music-based platformer that is quite a bit different from any other platformer I've played. The rhythm element is tied to a meter for recharging powers so there is this tricky balance of mastering when to attack, when to defend, and when to pause for a moment to activate the charge tempo bar, all on the fly.\n\nThe controls definitely take getting used to, but it's rewarding when you finally master them and start taking on the unlockable insane difficulty level. Many of the achievements force you to complete stages in clever ways without being able to charge or only using a particular power. Once I began replaying levels I did encounter a number of bugs with achievements not popping after the requirements had been met, but after notifying the devs hot fixes were quickly patched in to address the problems and everything is now working as it should.","February 26, 2014","true","8.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/246800/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","Some other reviewers call the controls slow and sluggish, but that's because your walk speed is slow & jump is floaty. It intentionally forces you to use the boost to move around (which means you have to be good at the rhythm system to recharge your boost meter). If the controls were more responsive and enemies were faster to match (the enemies are slow as well), you'd never have a chance to recharge your meters. You should be recharging every chance you get anyways so that you have your special ready for when you need it. I used a Xbox 360 controller and found the controls fine. Keyboard controls probably don't feel as good.\n\nI 3-Star'd normal levels until the cats and then realized that you can just get the 3 stars from the easy difficulty as well (no punishment) and finished the rest of the levels at 3-stars easy. I found it to be a game I could learn the mechanics and coast through to the end. There is a bit of variety for each stage in terms of scenario and objectives and there aren't so many stages that it felt repetitive. Probably not worth it at full price but I'd recommend on a sale or bundle.","March 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/betadaysuk/recommended/246800/","betadaysuk","BetaDaysUK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/betadaysuk/","747 products in account","I was unfamiliar with BeatBlasters 1 or 2 (in reality I can’t actually find anything on these games at all) when I was invited to check out the third instalment of the franchise by Chainsawesome Games.\n\nDescribing itself as a “rhythm/action-platformer” game I was a little bewildered as to what to expect. Was it Super Mario Bros. game with Guitar Hero elements? No. With BeatBlasters III it’s not that simple.\n\nStory wise you play either Joey or Gina (choosing either appears to have no value other than cosmetically) a musically inclined pair as they, for reasons not explained, decide to visit a town called ‘Accepella’ which in true Footloose-esq fasion has banned ‘groovy tunes’ (possibly not all music is outlawed I suspect, maybe it’s just the dubstep ‘beats’ the pair produce which would be quite understandable). The ‘ruler’ of the town promptly sends the pair packing and thus begins a strange journey to return to the town and, err I guess, you know, free the town? Again it’s not very well explained. Each level is inhabited by, but again not explained; quite random occupants (butterfly cows, pirates, ghosts, monkeys, penguins – both good and evil, robots etc.).\n\nSo how does it play? As blurbed it’s a platformer for one so your character has to navigate a 2D side-scroller world both protecting and defeating the surreal world inhabitants with your abilities, of which you posses three: attack, a shield and a rocket jump.  Often the levels have you using these powers frequently so management is essential - which is where the ‘beat’ element comes in. When not shooting, protecting or jumping you need to replenish each power. This is achieved by putting yourself into a recharge mode (holding down a button) and then rhythmically tapping that ability button to an electronica tempo matching a swinging metronome. Having to recharging keeps you busy and being good at doing so, especially when under pressure, can be difficult to do. Once successfully recharged all of your skills you’ll also unlock the ability to for a short time let loose an infinite energy burst of all powers at once. The better you tap in time, the faster you can recharge and the better you score. Thus in turn the better you play the more stars you earn at the end of each level to upgrade your abilities. Because of the three powers plus recharge button it’s nay impossible to play with a keyboard. A controller is definitely recommended.\n\nGraphically the game is easy on the eye with a Rayman gloss that looks good and animations for the most part are quite well done (although the characters jumping movement doesn’t look quite right). It’s vibrant and colourful with its own art style making it stand out. As with in-game graphics, the presentation is solid with good clear menus, options and features well laid out. To be expected from a game that relies on rhythm the audio is of a good high standard however does lack some diversity with each level only giving a slight variation on a theme.\n\nIts shtick is that it’s certainly unique. I’ve never come across this type of game in my years of playing and in some ways it reminds me of a modified tower defence or Plants vs. Zombies type game. Some levels (only 16 in total!) are more puzzle geared while others have you require more platform dexterity. I found the escorting character missions to be very tedious and boring and only wishing to scrape by (getting one star by allowing only one of my party to survive) just to progress to the next level. Naturally doing better scores you more points to spend on upgrades, but had little inclination to do so.\n\nCertainly unique and ‘niche’ I found at times I had fun, but oh so often I was left asking myself “Why am I playing this?” Although novel with a innovative mechanic I found the game slow, tedious and offer little in the way of longevity/replayability. Yes the game is budget (£6.99) but I just didn’t get enough out of BeatBlasters III to enjoy it. Maybe I was expecting it to be a little more casual, but instead found it too slow and at times challenging – even frustrating in moments. The pace is all over the shop and its gimmick didn’t hold my attention. Perhaps if the game had some charm and humour I would have been more enamoured. Failing that if they had given each level  a different musical genre with its own tempo or, dare I say, even use a licensed or recognisable track (classical or a parody of a known song could avoid licensing costs) may have made the game more fun.\n\nI’m going to wait for BeatBlasters VI to see if they make it more enjoyable and maybe have that X-Factor (pun intended).","April 26, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The levels range from killing all enemies to escorting NPCs to a destination, defeating a giant cat while defending civilians to breaking ice off of pipes before the pipes fill up. The twist comes into play with the player's powers. Shooting, activating an energy shield, and using rocket boots consumes energy that is specific to each device. Recharging energy is done by entering charge mode and tapping the button for the device to the beat of the song. Keeping time increases a combo meter that, in turn, increases how fast the device charges. You are also graded on how close to the beat you hit the buttons(Perfect, good, ok, miss) and these help fill your energy faster as well. The highlight of the game is definitely the bosses, though that isn't to say the rest of the game is less than amazing either.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who loves rhythm elements fused into other genres or any platformer fan in general.","March 18, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It features a great soundtrack along with good looking characters and backgrouns, these two come along pretty nicely with some really smooth animations. The art style might not appeal to everyone but I do certainly like it. While the story is quite weird, to say the least, it actually is kinda funny and everything looks pretty great. The core mechanics of the game are pretty simple and easy to learn. You have 3 abilities, one is an attack which launches balls of fire synced with the beat. The second ability is a flying ability which lets you fly and move faster and the last ability is a shield which you can use to protect yourself or others along with moving certain objects in a direction.\n\nHowever, you can't just spam these abilities, for they have to be charged once their "energy" is depleted. To charge an ability you must sync your abilities with the beat, everytime you successfully sync the abilities with the beat, your energy for that ability charges up.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty simple, and that is perhaps, along with the lack of a better storyline, what kept me from playing this game any longer, I lack the motivation to beat it. Still, I do think that BeatBlasters III is a good game and one that has the potential to provide fun to other people, I unfortunately I'm not one of those people but I did enjoyed quite alot the soundtrack.","April 20, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The player character moves slow and jumps low, but there's not much actual platforming anyway, so this is more of a needless annoyance than an aspect of challenge.  The rhythm and music aspect is weak.  It just plays short, repeated riffs while using and charging powers.  Charging the powers does use a rhythm mechanic, but it just disrupts the already poor flow of things.\n\nIt's unfortunate because there is potential here.  Ditch the escort missions and power charging, build some full fledged platforming levels with rhythm based design, make the player character more agile, and make a more complex soundtrack with more varied responses to what's happening onscreen, and I think BeatBlasters IV could turn out quite well.","February 10, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is some plot to get you slightly motivated.\n\nPros:\n- nice graphics\n- if you like dubstep then the music is quite okay\n\nCons:\n- pointless plot - for me at least. You save Guerilla King that get transported to the helicopter then you need to beat big bad robot cutting down trees, then you need to help some penguins, then... really, I don't care\n- the need to fill your abilities by clicking a button to the rhytm using a special bar - that's the one at the top with a ball bouncing left and right\n\nGo for a demo if you would like to try this one out. It's not an universal platformer that would fit many peoples' tastes as it is pretty niche.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","January 17","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Use your musical powers to protect peanuts, protect eggs, and protect a monkey driving a car.\n\nThe majority of this game is spent waiting for things to happen, while you do a trivial rhythm game to power your abilities.  The saddest part of this game is that the music is made up primarily of tiny loops around 10~15s which is a crime for a game that's supposed to be based around music.","February 3","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
