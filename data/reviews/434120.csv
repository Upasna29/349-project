As a reader, I can recommend it to everyone else who reads any sort of material, as a person who was never interested in text based adventures or things like that, I can still highly recommend this game. I saw the 'mostly positive' status of this game's ratings and that HAS to change.\n\n\nI don't know where to begin, the perfect, dark, black and white shades, for a melancholic and mournful experience such as this one.\n\nYou unveil the history of a town, which lies in perhaps a gothic-european architectural spectrum, step by step, verse by painful and beautiful verse.\n\nAnd what else? It is free to play, give it a try, soak in the words, experience and sorrowful yet exquisitely beauiful adventure.\n\n\nThis game is like a walk through the garden with only dying flowers, and you know, all flowers in this world are dying, so this is as good as it gets.\n\n10/10","January 21","true","2.2"," 113 of 131 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","113","131","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitepixel/recommended/434120/","whitepixel","blackяabb1t","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitepixel/","57 products in account","TL;DR: A surprisingly well-written text-based experience! While the game's design lacks some fundamental elements found in other titles of its genre, To Burn In Memory overcomes this by presenting a rich and in-depth story. 8/10.\n\nLong Review:\nTo Burn In Memory is an extremely well written text-based adventure. Unlike the numerous poorly written click-through adventures on the Steam Store, this title is reminiscent of both traditional MUDs as well as interactive adventure novels of old.\n\nTo simply compare this to other interactive adventures is to do it a great disservice. The writing style and overall quality is above average. The author paints a perfect picture of a city devastated by warfare: riddled with death and destruction and yet maintaining the notion that it was once great. The use of imagery through describing colors and the city's architecture make game's setting well fleshed out. Even the selection of quotes in the game's introduction are well selected.\n\nWhile I don't want to give too much away, To Burn In Memory seemingly takes place in alternate re-telling telling of our own history (yet I'll let the narrative speak for itself as some things aren't clearly explained). The few technological innovations illustrated seem to be almost steampunk-ish, plausible in their "old world" existence but dissimilar from our own (at least my grandparents never gave me an Oroboros trinket). This story is told through "memories" that you'll experience along the way, learning of the city's hellish past and the lives of its denizens.\n\nTelling the story is one of the game's strengths but there are a few glaring weaknesses. There's no Steamworks integration at all: no cloud saving (or any other kind of saving), achievements for seeing the title through to the end, or screenshot capability (if you have a favorite moment or like a well written segment of the story, you can't store it for later).\n\nAnother weakness - why I can't give this a higher rating - is that the in-game navigation is terrible. With the exception of Free Roam mode, you're supposed to collect items around the city in order to advance through locked areas. But losing your way is easy: there's no compass and the descriptions do not always match up with the directional options. What's the point in putting "east" or "south" in the choices if we don't know what's in the north or west (just an example)? Many MUDs had better directional control, many interactive stories do as well. I get that there are only a few options for movement but it probably could have been handled better.\n\nThere's also a negative that can actually be taken as a positive: the story is extremely linear. This isn't "choose your own ending." Because "north or west" aren't defined, the story's path is usually pretty clear. The narrative is actually tight because of this clarity. It also makes the game less "game-like" and more like reading a story (though the inclusion of background music probably wouldn't have hurt). Some think this is a negative, I don't. But the game should also be tagged as a text-based adventure since some gamers obviously don't read the reviews before installing.\n\nI'm a huge fan in the way in which the story unfolds on screen. The story's elements present themselves as memories: initially you start with little paragraphs of text and to see the whole history of a thing, you need only click to "experience" it. Additionally, you can rush the entire game in Free Mode by not reading any of the memory entries (I'm not really sure why anyone would do this!)\n\nCollectables needed to unlock areas of the game to advance are listed on the right-hand side of the screen. The only collectable I had diffculty with obtaining was the "crescent moon key" but I associated this with poor directional control rather than defect or error.\n\nOverall this was a great experience and - if in novel form - I'd purchase it in a second. Keep up the good work. /wall of text over :)","January 22","true","1.4"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","42","53","4","0"

The city descriptions are seriously well written, giving a mysterious atmosphere that lends itself to curiosity.\n\nAs a piece of art, it is both beautiful and immersive. There is no save function, meaning you have to remember everything you do and retrace your steps if you need to stop. Perfect for a game about memories, really.\n\nIn short, play this game when you have time, when you can relax and take it in.

Yes, it's a game! No, it's not going to let you shoot things. Sort of.\n\nIf you've played Fallen London, this is pretty similar, though it's built on something like twine rather than storynexus. Lots of reading, lots of vivid descriptions of fictional places in historical settings (seriously the memories are some of my favorite things). I've only played it the once so far, but I'm pretty sure it's joining Anchorhead and basically anything by Emily Short in my replay bin.\n\nI think it's only got the one ending (it feels like it's got only the one ending, if that makes any sense), and since the plot is wandering around the ashes of a once-thriving city, learning about how it came to be ashes through the memories of the people who lived and fought in it, there isn't anything to change, any more than wandering Rome with a history book would let you change the past.\n\nBecause it's built on something twine-ish, it's a great introduction to IF as a genre, because it skips out on a lot of the frustrations more 'traditional' IF can run into (guess the verb and blocking yourself into a no win corner, in particular), and the writing, as I said, is astonishingly gorgeous. The whole game sort of sneaks up on you, where one moment you're exploring an opera house and the next you're crying because everything is beautiful and everything hurts.\n\nI didn't find any of the puzzles particularly tricky, but I have a background in the era it's set in (art history making itself useful, finally), which definitely helped. I'm 98% sure that a little googlefu could get you the answers, though, as there wasn't anything particularly obscure about the answers.\n\ntl;dr It's interactive fiction, read everything, pay attention, enjoy yourself.","February 2","true","4.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

There isn't a true plot; you'll follow with some difficulty the protagonist through a dead city, trying to rebuild someone else's story.\n\nPROs:\n- The shortness. The whole game takes one hour at most.\n- The atmosphere. Pretty melancholic, nicely built.\n- The descriptions. Very well done! One of its strong points: they were descriptive and clear, but with an added and not overdone touch of gothic, dark and elaborate.\n- The price. Better price ever - actually, it's free-to-play.\n\nCONs:\n- Graphics. Such a text-based game should be easily legible - and that wasn't. It was almost too dark.\n- Sounds and musics. There was just one hinted music during the whole game. It was the whole soundtrack - it would have been better to focus more on the music, I'd think. Nothing like a nice soundtrack creates a pervasive game experience.\n- Add a map. Add a map. Add a map. Like, can I repeat myself? Add a map. Add a compass. Add something, because it was too easy to slip into clicking loops while playing and finding oneself lost in the same place for whole minutes. I mean, yes, I know it's a text-based text; but lot of locations had similar names or similar feelings or a similar description and sometimes it was hard to find my way out. I'm all for passing hurdles and overcoming difficulties, but that wasn't the feeling I had here: I mostly felt like I was treacle-threading.\n- The ending. You get every object you'll need to end the story and then you find yourself lost and adrift. Like, what can I do for you, now? Is there more? Where the fluff I'm expected to go right now? Put a clue somewhere, please!\n\nStill a positive review, but I was hoping better.\n6/10.","March 3","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's an interactive, just not in the way where choices impact end results, but more in the way how a puzzle works.  You activate switches outlined by italicized text and build up an inventory of keys, lamps, records, compass, etc..  However, it is more of a book than a game as a number of negative reviews have pointed out.\n\nNow I will admit that within the first 7-10 areas, I didn't know what the hell was going on.  Still don't.  After being unable to understand what was going on, I did what most people would do when choosing not to put a game down due to achievements....click around hopelessly in hopes that something will happen.  (Something's gotta give if you hit it hard enough)\n\nThe story...Well, from my understanding of the ending (which is really the only thing I could understand), it has to deal with the Great War (World War I) and....stuff happens.  The "Guide" who indirectly guides you (by letting you explore the area and seeing memories/flashbacks) and leaves you with a cliffhanger as to what happened with her (at least I assume it's a her) afterwards.\n\nI suppose it is rather well-written, but I can't get into it.  As my warning suggests, the vocabulary is far beyond my own.  I would require constant use of a dictionary just to understand what's going on.  (Kinda' like the d*uchebags that use a new term when talking to you, but pull a d*ck move by saying "look it up" rather than explaining what it is.  Similar to that.)\n\nPROS:\nFree\nAchievements\nShort (Took me 100 minutes to click somewhat aimlessly to get to the end)\n\nCONS:\nBoring\nEasy to get lost (Difficult to understand what's going on)\nAdvanced English used  (Be sure to have that dictionary handy)\nNo visuals\nMusic only presented in flashbacks\n\nPersonally, this was an eyesore on my end.  I mean this dev no disrespect, but I would personally not enjoy booting up this headache again.  If you want achievements or want a long story, be my guest.  Otherwise, I advise you consider alternatives you would do with your time.  A headache for 3 achievements?  Well...at least it's another 100%.\n\n1/10  To burn in memory?  To burn in hell.","February 5","false","1.7"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","10","26","0","0"

Look at this as a message about these kind of games rather than a review.\nTo put it simply, if you want to write literature, make books, comics, or visual novels.\nIf something like this is really what you have in mind, there are far better ways to execute it, such as creating a well designed document where you can skip to pages based on your choices (I know this is at least possible with the portable document format) or create an HTML document.\nWhy? For one, because writing software is a lot of work, you need to ensure compatibility with different systems, and by that I do not only mean operating systems, but different hardware and software choices even within a single OS.\nThat brings forth the issue I noticed with this: that it won't even display anything on my screen. While that's not a big problem as I never intended to play it, it could be a problem for somebody who did and encountered the same issue.\nWhen you're writing a document instead of this you gain one big advantage: portability. PDF will virtually work on any system, and if HTML, CSS, JS, etc. doesn't work it's usually just a matter of using a different web browser.\nThis doesn't only give the writers more time to write and save them money/time on less development, but it also ensures a better experience for everyone who is actually interested in things like these.\nI also think it's a little misleading to call these pieces of literature games, just because somebody wasted their time producing a specific piece of software just to read it.","January 25","false","0.2"," 10 of 136 people (7%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","7","10","136","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tanzerdragoon/recommended/434120/","tanzerdragoon","Tanz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tanzerdragoon/","20 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI recommend this interactive story if you enjoy reading light novels. I don't recommend it to people who want to "play" a game because it's not really a game. There are elements of puzzles in here, but it's so easy to figure out, and it goes along with the story that helps you unlock more story. But this isn't the reason I'm not recommending it.\n\nThis game is pure text and clicking. There is no music, and its a 2 hour game. There is only reading. But I like that you can see the items you pick up on the right side. I don't mind the text being white on black, but I understand some people find it irritating. I feel like the black background is important just because the black helps us focus our mind more to reading what the author is trying to show us.\n\nBut here are some things I found that made it rather 'annoying,' and why I'm not recommending it: first off, my visual memory is way better than trying to "picture words," so a lot of the times I'm reclicking back and forth to the same 2 or 3 areas. I think this has a lot to do with visual memory and also UI. I understand its text based, but it's easier to see that you can go 'back' into an area if the words are on the left, or forward in an area if the next place to visit is on the 'right.' Instead of the words being on top of each other -- which is a little bit unintuitive if you're entering into a room's door, but there are words at the bottom you don't realize at first that when you click makes you go back to the previous room if that makes any sense...\n\nI'll be honest though, the story itself can be rather difficult to follow, and I have a hard grasp of actually understanding the ending... I feel like the elements and fancy wording detract from the story -- there were areas that I felt like the background was just kinda there and some stuff made no sense and didn't connect well with the overall story. It also seemed like its based on reality in the 1900s but with advanced technology and a group of people called, "Provost" but to be honest, I don't know what the provost is even after finishing because there wasn't a clear explanation on it. There wasn't any part of it where I was like, "Oh yeah! I totally see/didn't see that coming!" This story has drama, but there's no conflict -- you're just trying to find out what happened, but I find that I don't really care for it. The only thing that kept me going to the end was, I knew the ending was near and that I wanted all the Steam completions.... I hadn't tried a visual novel since Cartoon Network's Space Ghost Coast to Coast text best game, and it was soooo long ago. But I'm definitely game to see more that are imaginatively engaging and had a bit more time put into it.","May 23","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would be nice if it was mentioned somewhere\n\nPros:\n- non linear "gameplay"...or rather reading\n- story is well written without typing errors (what i mean by well written is that it nicely describes the place and is using, however the story itself is something else)\n- stylish background and font, looks nice and is good for reading\n- easy 100% achievements\n\nCons:\n- alot of bugs\n- this game needs voice over in background to help you with reading, and images/animations of few scenes\n- this is a well written story (it describes the place very well, you can almost feel that you are walking through it if you really commit yourself to reading), however it is boring, it just describes the place. I guess its just not my cup of tea.\n- there arent options, this game could use options for resolution, font size, brightness, etc...\n- there could be little "help" section which explains how to restart, exit the game, etc...\n- there is little gramophone button, i think its supposed to mute the music, however for some reason i heard music only for few sententences on beginning, and then it dissapeared completly, clicking on the button did absolutely nothing\n\n\nAfterall its single player "reading game" and would've been good if there weren't so many bugs and story was a little more interesting. Yes i understand it is free game, and developers dont profit from it, however it would've been better if they worked on cons, especialy doing voice over and made the game 5$ or something.\n\nAnd afterall, you are better trying the "game" yourself, it takes 1-2 hours to complete (depending on how fast you read and solve really easy puzzles) , or even less than 10 minutes if you want the achievements only. This review might take more of your time to read it, than achievements to finish in the game.","May 24","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
