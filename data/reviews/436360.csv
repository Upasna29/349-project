The bigger enemies are a very real threat.\n-Tight controls and game mechanics.  Jumping, dashing, shooting, punching; everything's responsive and quick to pick up and they're all used to their fullest throughout the game.\n-Having a game entirely about robots and mechanical stuff which not only avoids overdosing on the color grey, but has a decent amount of color to mix up the visuals, namely with the title character.\n-The sabotage system allowing parts of the ship to go down at once or later, which makes certain platforming sections or corridors easier by disabling certain things.\n\nCONS:\n-This is pretty clearly designed with a controler in mind.  Using a keyboard took lots of trial and error shifting the keys around to find something sort of comfortable.\n-It can be a bit frustrating to get through most of a room, die, then get sent back to the entrance and have to do it all over again.  I wouldn't change it, it's just frustrating is all.\n-Final sequence is a bit meh.\n\nOverall I do like this game and am currently going through new game plus mode.  And a tip for anyone speedrunning this: If you're on a conveyor belt and look up so the belt is offscreen, it behaves like a regular platform.","March 18","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Depending on the difficulty, you'll have different amount of hours and sabotage areas (on normal it's about 7 hours, you got time!), this makes you feel right into the action, as you slowly watch the fortress approaching the planet and killing the inhabitants, it's a touch of "realism", a real invasion must be stopped as soon as possible, to save as many people as possible.\nThe best part of the game is the platforming and robot fights, you'll need every bit of skill to rush in every section of the fortress while dealing with the robo guards. You can take a stealth approach, or just charge the enemies and give 'em a good ol' uppercut in the robochin :D\nThe map is huge and interconnected, it does the job well to recreate a spaceship and the feeling that is a whole "world", which is cool, although sometimes, and that's the only problem I had, it feels a bit confusing at first, there are many directions you can take and it'll require some time to understand properly the structure of the spaceship.\nThere are also hacking sections, which is the second kind of gameplay you'll face, that is navigating the fortress' net, unlocking doors and collecting data, that will weaken the enemies' AI for easier fights! (I like this feature, very meta!)\n\nOverall, if you like platform games with a touch of metroidvania, I highly recommend you this game. It's fun, runs fast and furious on the platforming and combat, and it is challenging nonetheless, it'll test your ability as a true savior of the galaxy!\nI'm making a whole playthrough of the game, a review copy sent to me by the developers:\nhttps://youtu.be/arBqf4-MuwI","March 17","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Love the retro platform style, and the sound to accompany it is fantastic. The adventure itself is open-ended, leading to all sorts of paths through the world as you progress towards the ship's core. I would definitely recommend picking this game up and seeing for yourself. Tons of fun!","March 10","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is what I define as a freaking nice game with much to offer. Polished and cohesive graphics, nice illustrations, great challenges, good music, easy to learn controls but hard to master, and in general good ol' fun. If you like action platformers, this is the game for you.","March 14","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're a fan of action platformers, this is right up your alley. Great visuals and it's a retro inspired game that hasn't gone with pixel art.

I have been trying to use a Playstation 4 controller and can't get it to connect. It works fine in all my other games, Does Robo's World have Ps controller support or just x-box and steam controller support? thanks!","March 25","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"
