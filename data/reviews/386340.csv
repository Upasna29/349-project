In MegaSphere you play as ATAI, a special ops combat unit that has been sent to investigate some strange goings on with a few nearby stars. You find yourself in a strange installation filled with deadly robots and strange references to something known as the Half-Dead god.\n\nFull disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nUp first I’m going to talk about my two biggest issues with the game (which will be addressed in the next update though it currently has no expected release time). These issues are the lack of a save system and the lack of any real direction in the game. The lack of a save system is pretty self-explanatory and it means that you have to start over again every time you quit. It can get pretty frustrating (even with the current amount of content) if you have to keep restarting the same area, plus the levels are randomly generated so if you were trying to do something in particular and you have to leave, you might as well give up on doing that since you may not see it the next time you load that area. As I said, my second problem is with the lack of direction in the game, hopefully this’ll be fixed by the addition of quests as well as a chunk of story in the upcoming update I mentioned. As it stands though, MegaSphere ends up feeling like an exploration game more than anything else. I enjoyed wandering through the six different areas currently in the game, killing enemies and crafting new weapons, but after looking around all of the different areas I feel like I’ve seen all there is to see, even with randomly generated levels and that’s a tad disappointing. Once these are addressed in the next update I’ll update my review and re-write or remove this paragraph.\n\nOn to what is undoubtedly the game’s greatest strength, its visuals. MegaSphere is incredibly good looking, it has some of the best pixel art I’ve seen in games and its design is consistent throughout. It’s definitely one of the best looking games that uses the Unity engine. The visual effects in the game are also awesome. There’s good variation between all the different weapons and there are some particularly cool effects for when you get close to dying, though with any luck you won’t be seeing much of them! The menus and UI are also pretty good but they’re being streamlined in the next update which should make them even better.\n\nNext to walking around, combat is what you’ll spend your time doing, thankfully it’s pretty good. There are a few different types of enemies each with very different ways of engaging you which makes combat with more than one type of enemy particularly interesting. A couple of the enemy types also have different variations, the different variations have different appearances as well as different attacks, further diversifying the game’s combat. It’s pretty challenging on normal difficulty (there is an easier difficulty if you do find it a little too hard) but once you figure out how all of the different enemies work it does become reasonably easy to predict how they’re going to attack which means you can try and avoid their attacks. Once you’ve figured this out you can also start using the environment to your advantage by standing/hiding out of range of an enemy and shooting at them from there.\n\nKilling enemies always drops health but sometimes you’ll also get weapons, upgrades and shields. You begin with three health segments on your health bar but when you collect health it just adds new segments if you have full health. I’ve only made it as far as six full segments before losing health so I’m not sure what the maximum amount is. A shield simply goes on top of your health bar and offers you more protection, they don’t recharge though so you’ll have to find a new one once yours is fully drained.\n\nThere are quite a few different weapons in the game, ranging from the burst rifle you start with to a grenade launcher and even a flaming bear gun! All of the weapons have advantages and disadvantages so they are mostly balanced though the flaming bear gun does seem to be considerably better than any of the other weapons. Sometimes the weapons come with upgrades (the flaming bear seems to always come with all three upgrade slots filled) but they can also come with no upgrades which means you’ll need to find upgrade tokens as well as upgrades to fully upgrade them.\n\nUpgrading weapons currently takes place in the game’s inventory menu. Each weapon (providing it doesn’t already have upgrades installed) has three slots for new upgrades, one of which can be attached ‘for free’ while the other two can only be attached using upgrade tokens which are sometimes dropped by enemies. There are quite a few different upgrades, including speed increases and upgrades that make your projectiles bounce off walls. However, not all of the upgrades are effective for all of the weapons and it does take a bit of experimentation to figure out what works best for which weapons. There are also different levels of upgrades (I’ve seen up to and including three so far) and as you’d expect, the higher the upgrade’s level is the more it improves your weapon.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are only six areas in the game. Two of them don’t have enemies, one is a boss fight area and the other three are just ‘regular’ areas filled with all the enemies. There are visual differences between all the different levels as well as some things you only find in certain areas. Every time you play an area the game randomly generates the level so you’ll never have exactly the same experience twice though the levels will look pretty familiar. The reason they aren’t completely random is because there is a story running between the different levels, I don’t want to spoil too much (and to be honest I don’t understand it enough to spoil it anyway) but the game’s story seems to revolve around strange gods worshipped by whatever created the installation you’ve found yourself on. There’s not a whole lot of story in there at the moment but what’s there is most certainly intriguing.\n\nLast but by no means least, controls. For combat and generally moving around they’re pretty good (I played with an Xbox One controller) but they did feel a tad bit clunky for platforming. There were several times in the game where I had to attempt jumps between platforms a few times before I actually made it. It’s not a huge problem (though it’s still pretty frustrating) during regular gameplay but you could quickly end up dead if you run into a particularly tricky platforming section during combat.\n\nVerdict\nMegaSphere is a beautiful game with good gameplay and a mysterious story behind it but the amount of content in the game at the moment, as well as the lack of direction, does, for me at least, let the game down a little bit. It’s still an enjoyable experience but I’d recommend that you wait for a sale or at least see how the upcoming update improves the game.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","May 1","true","2.3"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","2"

The game's atmosphere feels really great, the graphics are without a doubt one of the best out there in terms of pixel art, the dialouge is easy and somewhat fun to read, the soundtrack is fitting with the game's atmosphere, having an adventurous up-beat sci-fi theme to it, and lastly the gameplay with the controls, platforming and shooting are great.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z♥♥♥♥GVk-I\n\nExpanding on the gameplay a bit, the controls are as simple as it can be with great UI to deal with. The platforming parts aren't anything special but it does its job and it does it well. Engaging in combat with the variety of enemies you encounter are a lot of fun because of how they look, behave and how they attack as each enemy feel very unique and just interesting and a joy to find and engage in combat with. All the while being an intesne fight since their behaviour/movement is somewhat all over the place, like a bouncing ball but you know where it's headed.\n\nStill playing through it but I'm loving it so far, and I think for the current content and future content, the current asking price is worth it.","August 25, 2015","true","1.2"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","31","43","3","2"

Tight controls, frantic action, great atmosphere and amazing weapons. Megasphere is very clearly taking some lessons from that classic, and this is absolutely a great thing.\n\nBear in mind though this game is in early access so it's nowhere near as polished as Abuse was. It plays more or less the same, though a touch slower. At first this annoyed me but then I realised it's because with so much flying at you, you need time to strategise as well as react. Because the environments are partially destructable (yes you can actually tunnel through walls... within certain limitations which are fairly logical from a gameplay design standpoint, more on that later), and because there are hazards in the environment that can help or hinder you, you need the additional time to respond to be able to make proper use of them.\n\nThere's some great touches here and there, some fantastic spritework and animations, levels are dark and brooding but still clear enough to see what's going on, enemies are lit up rather nicely without glowing like beacons and cluttering up the gameworld, though it would be nice to see some kind of targeting reticule and if the aiming cursor could JUST stand out a little more...  Enemies drop life pickups when they die, but they don't stick around long and other enemies can pick them up too (which is pretty neat actually), so there's a bit of a risk-reward thing going on there, do you get right in the thick of it and risk tons of damage or do you hang back and obliterate them then pick up what remains if you're quick enough?\n\nGiven that the only two languages are russian and english, and the english is somewhat dodgily translated at points, I'm gathering the game devs are Russian, but they've done a pretty good job of the translation all things considered. It's certainly not the worst.\n\nIf I have any criticisms it's that the game realllly doesn't teach you anything about how to play, making some of the gameplay mechanics ridiculously obtuse, like how am I meant to kill the boss, and how do I upgrade my weapons... The latter point there I managed to work out through fumbling about, but killing Rosyanka-1 still eludes me. I assume it has something to do with those buttons that drop exploding fire...things... which you can grab and throw wiht one of the wepaons I picked up but... I'm still confused as to whether I'md oing any damage or not, could do with more feedback.\n\nOkay so, basic rundown of the destructable environments then. Basically if two rooms neighbour each other, you can tunnel through the walls into them. If there's no room nearby you can "dig" like three or four blocks out in any direction that doesn't neighbour a room before you hit unbreakable terrain. These blocks can occasionally fall down and make steps or block progress, there are cables which are phys-enabled hanging from the ceiling that you can shoot, and yes they will slow your fall, or block your jumping progress, or trap certain enemies to... There's exploding... things that you can shoot to make them pop into firey painful stuff, which I believe can damage enemies too, though not much. OOne gun I found can pick up and throw items like detatched blocks, enemies and explodythings too, which was neat.\n\nThe upgrade system is pretty fantastic, you can find modules which you can plug into existing gun-types that you pickup to grant them additional power. Granted once they're set, that's it, you can't pull them back out again so choose wisely.\n\n\nOKAY, so, pros and cons then:\nPros:\nGameplay is rocksolid, but then it basically plays much like ABUSE, so that's a given.\nNice variety of guns and a great weapon upgrade system keeps things interesting and fresh.\nDynamic soundtrack responds to threats.\nGreat visual effects when you take damage and are at critical levels of health lets you know when to bug out (if you can) to reassess your situation.\nDestructable terrain and phys-enabled objects\nGreat sprite-based visuals that don't clutter or get massively confusing in huge combats.\nNice wide field of view allows you to tell when combat's about to happen (something ABUSE Lacked, sadly)\nCutscenes are now skippable (hold Space!)\nNeat little (semi) hidden hint to give you a clue as to how to beat the first boss (check your map in the first actual level when you enter, should be easy to find).\nInvisible-immortal foes/foes in walls bug seems to be fixed!\nDevs respond rather quickly to issues!\nRelentlessly challenging! (though also could be a downside if you're easily frustrated)\nEvery run is different! Proceedurally generated levels!\n\nCons: (REMOVED UNTIL I CAN VERIFY EXISTENCE OF ANY BUGS OR ISSUES)\nOnly two languages to choose from, English and Russian (Translation to English now appears better!)\n(have not tried dying yet with a save point reached so don't know if that bug still happens)\nMouse cursor still kind of tiny.\nBrutally, brutally difficult. Though also a plus because it's nice to be challenged by a game, and this game certainly does not handhold you. It lets you make your own mistakes.\nStill could do with just something to run you through how to upgrade guns (not what combos are the best or what they do, just how to do it) and maybe something to let you know what level each upgrade module is before socketing it. (also slight b ug with weapon upgrades displaying wrong level and name when you hover over them)\nGame ends shortly after first boss, but that's to be expected, we are in Alpha :)\n\nEven at this stage of Early Access, the game is fantastic and well worth paying for and playing! Its difficulty is high enough to make you work real hard for your wins, but not so punishing that it'll drive you away. If nothing else, if you miss the game ABUSE, then absolutely pick this up because it scratches the same itch and then some, and actually is even better than it :D","September 3, 2015","true","12.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","5"

The combat system really felt bad to me, ennemies are so tough it's not even funny, you seemingly can't die as well.\nThe progression was erratic, i couldn't really go anywhere without returning to my starting point. If the ambiance was designed to be oppressive and labyrinthic it's a success.\n\nI was not prepared to this type of gameplay and thought it would be a dynamic game but it feels kinda crippled.\nFor the first time i asked for a refund and i'm not really keen on doing that.\nI'm aware it's an early access and i played it just after release with no updates whatsoever, if the game gets significantly better i might consider buying it again but until then i couldn't really feel good playing it.","September 8, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Literally 3 minutes after the buy button became available. (I was sitting there hitting refresh lol.)\n\nHere's my Gameplay/First look at MegaSphere in video form:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL81FOwBWps\n\nLong story short, this game is awesome and here's why:\n\n- True to it's description the beautiful atmosphere is cyber-punk, spacey-goodness (<- that's a string of words I infrequently use.. kinda sounds like a nice cookie).\n- Active environment, a lot of blocks may be destroyed leading to other paths, allowing more than one route.\n- A surprising "dark" feeling to the game, which I think flows quite nicely in this game, as you feel alone after being seperated from your AI counterpart.\n- A decent variety of upgrades to different weapons, including many mix and match options, and an expansive item called an upgrade token, which allows more upgrades slots for the same weapon (max of three).\n- Amazing combat feeling, when things start to explode, you know you're doing things right in this game. Time starts to slow down upon heavy impacts of near explosions giving a real bullet-time effect.\n- Great attention to detail in this game, including a really cool map that pops up like in real sci-fi movies.\n\nHere are a of couple things that I am sure the developer is working on, but are still needing to be fixed at the time of this review:\n\n- A little short in terms of storyline, but hey, it's alpha. There will obviously be more added to the game.\n- A few glitches with weapons and the R-1 boss is a little buggy. (If you get stuck in the alpha, you can skip portions of the story mode in the main menu by clicking new-game on another map. The progression is from left-right, top to bottom.)\n- Game is a little loud, so you may have to turn your volume down slightly when you get in-game. (I ran out of things to give as negatives, yes I am honest).\n\nIn conclusion, I really see great potential in this game. Can't wait for more development!","August 26, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Controls feel tight and the enemies respond in ways that make you think, for the most part. Each baddie can have different weapons so they do have some unexpected variety. Some may close in on you faster than others, so weapon choice can be crucial as splash damage from some of your own toys can injure you. For actual weapon choice, I came across several different kinds all being individual in their own way, from standard lasers to an RPG, grenade launcher and a personal fave, the nail gun! ( Can't remember it’s in game name, go find it yourselves! =p ) Each weapon will work and behave as expected, and can be used to help with different situations. They all also can be upgraded with small packs that can be found from defeated baddies, to name a few; speed upgrades, multishot, piercing and homing. A speedy, multishot, homing nail gun was niiiiice....\n\nAs this is in early access expect a bug or 2, I found one when pausing the intro video would cause the game to become unresponsive. The game does have singular objectives at the mo, mainly go here, do this, go there, beat that, go back here, very much following a Metroid style. I got lost quite often during my play through, as no real objective markers are placed, and it took me a while to figure out how to upgrade gear correctly as there are no notes in game on this, but it adds to the feeling of being alone in space without any hand-holding.\n\nWith amazing graphics and lighting that brings back so much nostalgia, along with this being another 'pixel' game, it generally appears to look different and go that extra mile to set its own style. The music is spot on to set the scene with the sound effects doing their part nicely.\n\nIf you fancy a Metroid style action/adventure platformer, with pretty solid controls and a super 80's nostalgia factor, then look no further!","August 27, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

A lack of solid story, or any sort of flaws in gameplay are moot, since alpha games are not even at a solid state. It's annoying when people try to judge games that aren't even close to being finished for broken gameplay.\n\nSo far, from what I've played, the game is quite solid. The visuals a beautiful, and the setting feels spot on. I was quite enamoured with the weapons, and the general difficulty of their use. It takes some time to become useful at some of them. Same with the enemies, quite imaginative, fit in the setting, and surprisingly challenging compared to enemies in other games.\n\nOverall I feel this game has Megapotential, and I look forward to seeing it develop further!","August 27, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Despite being early access, this game looks and plays really well. While there are some bugs, I haven't come across anything gamebreaking which is really surprizing considering it's an alpha. The cables get in the way quite a bit but they do the same to enemies so I can't complain too much about them. The weapon system is really well done and it keeps gameplay quite fresh everytime I die(which happens rather often) and restart. All around a very fun and challenging game. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the platformer-shooter genre.","August 28, 2015","true","8.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

So if you don't use a laptop, you may disregard this review!\n\n----\n\nI saw KY stream this on Vinesauce, and it seemed to control excellently (well, hard to tell when you're not the one playing), plus I really loved the visual style and concept of the game, so I decided to buy it.\nI regrettably can't say it was worth it, at least not yet. On the stream, wires could be cut by shooting at them, but for the 15 minutes I was able to play before getting stuck, I only found 2 wires that could be severed. One of the wires almost kept me from completing a tutorial stage as it was blocking a button I had to shoot, but after a dozen attempts I managed to clip through it while jumping and shoot the button. An enemy also spawned within a hanging wire which prevented me to hit it, while it could shoot past the wires just fine.\nWires also turn invisible when I shoot at them, but turn visible again after settling.\nThe thing that had me get stuck was actually the elevators. A strange bug kept some of them from going up all the way, and instantly switch to going down again just before it reached high enough for me to jump the rest of the way up, so I got stuck down in a pit and could not even shoot myself out through the walls.\nThe jumping is also highly unresponsive, and more often than not I tend to just fall off the platforms when I try to jump off them, though this may be due to the game just generally being laggy, which also could be the fault of my brand new gaming laptop, maybe. But let it be known that even when putting the graphics on minimal, all of my issues still persist.\nSo to me, at least, this game is complete and utterly unplayable at the moment, though I don't intend on refunding it as I think it has a lot of potential once thise bugs have been fixed. I still can't recommend it at its current state though.\n\nEDIT: I'm using Windows 10 by the way. Not sure it has anything to do with the issues though, but it might.","September 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","13"

From the moment you load the game, the attention to detail and overall style/polish is very apparent.
