It's so addicting and so much fun that this game would make a great center piece attraction for any party or get together!\n\nMuch like Pacman Championship Edition DX brilliantly took Pacman into the 21st century with it's high adrenaline and furious gameplay, Cubixx HD does the exact same thing for another 80s arcade classic called "Qix".  This is a brilliant and expertly designed and programmed remake of the popular 80's arcade classic "Qix" with more facets, more enemies, and more high octane fuse-burning action than Qix ever dreamed of!\n\nAwesome!  Even if this game was $25 USD, it would still be a bargain!  Highly recommended, scoring a 95% score from me in my video review, and getting one of my rare "MUST BUY!" suggestions!  My first personal candidate for "Game of the Year" on the PC in 2016!  ^5 to Laughing Jackal for brilliantly bringing one of my favorite old arcade games from the Commodore 64 to today's PC in style and modern, epic cool gaming flavor!","January 28","true","5.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","5"

The game is obviously designed to be used with a controller but keyboard support has been added with the PC release - Cubixx HD is so simple it would be pretty hard to mess up.\n\nI decided to welcome it to the PC community by testing it out with the Steam controller, a device that wasn't even a concept when this game was initially released on the PS3. It works outstandingly well, the joystick and button combo makes gameplay feel exactly how it did on the PlayStation. The left trackpad works pretty well too, though doesn't feel as natural and may take some getting used to. Finally the back paddles of the steam controller give an extra level of customisability, allowing you to get your play style exactly how you like it.\n\nThe game itself has a huge amount of content. For the Price, (currently less than £4) it’s an absolute bargain. It's obviously been priced low because it's an older game, but it's previous platform exclusivity probably means that it's a fresh game to a lot of people. (Released in 2011 for PS3 only, then ported to the PC in January 2016)\n\nThe game has a local multiplayer feature that allows up to 7 players to play at once in a split screen setup. I have no idea how well that would work, I guess you would need a decent USB hub and huge screen to get that working! It looks like there is no option for internet based multiplayer, which would have been a nice feature to add to the PC port.\n\nI hope you found this short review helpful!","January 31","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm a fan of the concept but as some other reviews say, it does get a bit repetitive after a while which is why I haven't played too much of it; a lot of potential though. :)\nYoutube Review[t.co]","January 28","true","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Hey, I'm not complaining, we could do with more games that you can just pick up and play that don't weigh you down with narrative or complex controles or gameplay mechanics.\n\nFor starters, what is it? It's an Action Arcade game where the main goal is to murder innocent cubes and expose there core to blow them up. Now how do you go about doing that? Simple, you cut each side of the cube with a giant laser until you've cut away a certain percentage to beat that level. I did say that it was fairly simple didn't I.\nThe gameplay consists of six sides of the cube where you - the small blue dot, are tasked with distroying the cube as previouosly mentioned above. There are 50 levels all with there own gimicks and variety of enemies which some intend to stop you but the others don't really care, but they all have the intent to kill you. If any of them (Apart from the black holes) touch you, you instantly lose a life, but that isn't the only way to lose a life. Letting any of the orange or purple sqaures touch the line that you are currently using to cut the cube, that can also make you lose a life. Basic, but challenging with more enemies appearing on the cube to hinder your progress. Controls are fairly simplistic, left analouge stick or D-pad to move, A button to fire your laser, that's about it really.\n\nThe difficulty is how you'd say...in the middle, fair but also not fair. It requires you to think carefully how you're gonna chip away at the cube while avoiding all the nasties but making sure you're making suficient progress at the same time. It doesn't want you to take your time as it encourages you to think on your feet. At the same time however, with the amount of enemies it throws at you with there own abilities that cause different problems can lead to a lot of frustrating moments where it becomes increasingly difficult for all the wrong reasons.\n\nArt style is basic, but it's as good as it needs to be. If they where to overcomplicate the art style with particle effects or flashing lighting, it could end up being very distracting and make you lose your concerntration making the game more frustrating.\n\nSoundtrack is quite good, very electronic with some dubstep, even though that may turn some people off, I think it goes very well with the game.\n\nConclusion. It is a fairly adictive game with challenge even though the challenge is kind of misplaced and used incorrectly, it can still make for some really tense moments that can make your butt clench so much you wouldn't be able to get a cactus needle up there. There are six game modes that centre around doing the same thing just with different requirements and goals. There is only local multiplayer so don't expect any online play, other then the leaderboards.","January 28","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
