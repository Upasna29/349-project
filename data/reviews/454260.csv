For this small price when it is on sale you should 100% try it. As far as i got all multiplayer  maps are boundless and multilevel. That means you could build anything you want - Indie Minecraft as its finest.\n\nSome more pros as well:\n1) You can build your own character, and it is exciting, because you can choose anything from your colour skin up to different clothes.\n2) Very simple and clear graphics. Some decisions like water for example, made me laugh.\n3) Since this is early alpha access, i am surprised to see not that much bugs at all. Sometimes i got stuck in sands textures, but is nothing, because it is easy to get out.\n\nCons:\nThe only annoying thing about this game is background music, but i hope they will fix it for the greater good!","May 30","true","2.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

But, there is some lack, and i know it's alpha.\nSo here are the bad points, Duty for the dev to correct them :\n- UI is all but easy to use. It's far better to use mousewheel to scroll between tools and weapons rather than open menu by clicking on it, select one weapon and go back to fight. During this time we are hit by mobs.\n- Dialogs : please pause game during dialog or allow us to use escape key to avoid and close it when mobs attack us (again...) rather than open main menu.\n- Music : ok we can stop it, but it's so... the same 3 tone again and again and again.\n- graphisms : try to have coherence in your world rather than mix of styles. simplified giant insects, cartoon animals, unidentified ugly dark bubble mob. And all of this explode in numerous big pieces that there are more than the original creature.\n- Windows : toooooo big. inventory or dialogs, these windows are too big and too many node\n\nHowever, i recommand This game because of its potential and because it is already well advanced :)","May 28","true","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The biggest reason I had with the game was the mobile like resolution. I WAS WRONG. It doesn't say so anywhere, but the game can be zoomed in and out with the mouse wheel.\n\nDespite the lack of real music, the not so well ported interface and the okay graphics...\n\nThe gameplay mostly works and it has some additions most other games of this genre don't have, it's price tag is definetly acceptable and the multiplayer focus with pvp in mind is new.\n\nI've changed my mind to recommend this game, considering it is not glitchy and it has some unique features and focus to the genre. Specially with this price tag.\n\nSo yes, I recommend it.","June 4","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
