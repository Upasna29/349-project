Most of them have a capable and dedicated development team behind them. We all know this, we are all playing their games. We know what to expect from Alphas, Betas, Early Access etc etc. And this isn't it. This game has changed very very little for more than a year now. And they are still taking peoples money for it.\n\nThe people that originally backed this game are for the most part gone - they check in every few months hoping that something has changed but it hasn't. At this stage the only people that are happy with this game are those that have recently bought it in the last couple of months and don't know that a patch isn't 'just around the corner', and those that are friends with the devs who jump on every negative review and defend it with the usual "Alpha", "Early Access", or "refactoring" excuses.\n\nWe aren't stupid. We have played plenty of Early Access games before. They all need to be refactored a couple of times during their development as the scope of the interest in the game increases. All the early access games we are playing are doing the same. Castle Story is NOT unique in this.\n\nThe devs just use refactoring as an excuse for having not produced anything notable for more than a year. This is rubbish. They have accumulated near enough to a million dollars to work on this project and all they do is stall.\n\nI know there are a lot of others out there that are just as fed up with this rubbish, and I hope it serves as a lesson to everyone to be very careful as to what they back with Early Access games. There a plenty of good ones out the with dedicated developers, but there are also a few rotten eggs.\n\nI'd like to hear from everyone that has been through the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥e and all those that were banned for speaking out about this, but I know they probably have given up on this game plus anyway it won't be long before this thread is locked down and removed anyway. I feel sorry for everyone that wasted their money - I had hoped for something special too.","January 10, 2014","false","6.0"," 1,802 of 1,934 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","802","1","0","104"

This game is nothing that was shown of the trailer, and hasn't even begun to show it either.\n\nI loved playing this when it was first in the prototype and to be honest it has only improved since, but that isn't saying much at all. I have lost COUNTLESS hours of this game to my bricktrons not working properly and it just keeps happening, the won't move, won't work, etc. Multiplayer is just out of the question because it's broken to all hell, so don't even bother going through the trouble. Not the mention the game was in prototype for OVER A YEAR. that's bad, Don't even bother with the game. The islands are boring and repetitive, it should be randomly generated, not the same old crappy map. It's simply boring, broken, and just flat out annoying.\n\nEDIT:\n\nCongratz, Sauropod Studio, It's been 2 years since you released the game to the public and It's still in Early Access. Really, I accomodate you and your hard work for this terribly optimized, bugged game. It seems improvement has obviously been made.

Yup, nothing has changed since last time.  Update done.\n\nOk, there are many patch notes, none of them actual content, all of them coincide with the winter sales event.  Dev's are still trying to grab cash while clumsily and incompetantly releasing trivial updates in time for a sale.  Game has actually regressed, which I didn't think was possible.  UI continues to get worse with every iteration, less intuitive, more complex, less functional, and bugs with AI grow ever more intrusive.  Avoid this "game*" at all costs.\n\n* A game is technically any sort of interactive entertainment where choices by a player lead to and change a possible outcome.  None of that happens here, there is no outcome other than you wasting time and money in anticipation of a crash or game breaking bug.\n\nUpdate 30AUG15:\n\nWell, summer is over.  Another round of shotgun blast Sauropod updates has passed.  Nothing of actual significance has been added to the game yet again.  Just making this update to point out that every sale season (WInter/Summer) Sauropod blasts out a ton of updates right before the sale, so potential new customers will walk in, say "Wow, those guys really turned it around and get making progress!".  When the reality is, they're using the update ticker as a daily news feed for stuff they've thought about, and haven't actually done.  They will also roll a minor trivial change in something out as 3 or 4 updates.  Don't be fooled, there has not been an update. It's a shameful and deceptive practice and really shows the developers for the dishonest incompetents they are.  If there was any doubt in your mind about whether to label them as "Just bad developers" or "Actual thieves", this is all you need to know to decide.\n\n\n\nUpdate 21DEC14:\n\nI figured I would update the review considering how much activity the dev's have had lately.  But it seems it was all just lip service.  Over the last few weeks they've been shotgunning loads of update announcements, but the reality of the situation is those were all just announcements for one single update.  That update itself was absolutely trivial, and seems to have added nothing of substance to the game.  The devs constantly give the excuse of "reworking" and "redeveloping" engine components of the game, but these changes never seem to result in any sort of actual impact to the game.  For all their bluster, a disapointingly little amount has changed, and all assumptions about them have been confirmed.  This is just shameless PR propaganda.\n\nThe sad fact is, if you're the lunk head that invented a square wheel, taking a year off to invent an octagonal wheel leaves you as still a lunk head.  I don't think I'll be revisiting this game until it's final release, whenever that may be.\n\nFinal thoughts for now:  Stay away.  With luck they'll go bankrupt and sell all IP to a competant developer.\n\n\n\n*Original*\n\nOverall, I do enjoy this game, and probably had more anticipation for this than any other early access I've followed.  So why do I not recommend this?  Bullets:\n\nCons:\n- No updates!  Years have passed and the game is still in a less functional state than their fictional tech demo.\n- Current state is playable, but quickly reveals how broken it is.  Terrible AI, limited functoinality of game mechanics, limited... game.\n- Devs hate the community.  Well probably not hate, but this is the crux of it.  There appears to be absolutely no effort being made to update the game in an actual and meaningful way.  When pressed for answers from the community as to when we can expect something new, the same canned response of 'we don't give deadlines' is the answer.  That's fine after a few months, but not after a few years.  The first major red light for me when nearly a years worth of dev updates were about how they spent a month and a half working on a new sound effect for an object that isn't even in the game, or here's a new soundtrack I've been listening to, or "Hey, we're going on vacation!".  While glaring issues remain untouched and unaddressed.  PR people are hired to quell criticism and silence community dissent.\n-Devs are in over their heads.  A lot of people will call them theives, or scammers, I don't see it as that.  They are still around.  They are still 'working'.  But it really seems like they've all retreated to their little comfort zones, and feverishly work on silly little things like a sound effect to the exclusion of actual game problems.  Why would they do this?  Well, it seems pretty clear that they have realized they cannot handle those bigger problems, and just seem to be hoping they'll fix themselves tomorrow.  Their production efforts are terribly misguided, and no one seems able to get the train back on the tracks.  This is the main reason I think the community has given up on them.  There are gracious ways out of this connundrum for them, but they seem completely unwilling to compromise, admit their shortcomings, and work with the community.  For that they have failed utterly at making a game.  A community college degree does not a game dev make.\n\nPros:\n- Build a big castle block by block, watch a nearly good physics engine crush it.\n- If you give them enough money to keep the lights on, you get a t-shirt or something, someday.","October 25, 2014","false","7.0"," 286 of 304 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","286","304","4","5"

They've been to PAX east, they've ordered in Castle Story T-shirts and Castle Story plushies, they've hired bearded men to make videos of people looking busy, they've deleted my posts on their youtube videos and they've deleted my posts on the community hub and banned me from posting there again, they've got new gaming rigs, they've painted the walls of their office with a cool Castle Story mural, they've been out in the woods making noises, they've played Magicite, once again what they HAVEN'T done is anything of note to the game itself.\n\nThe game in its current state is "OK" for a buggy unfinished alpha, not much content to speak of, certainly not worth £14.99. These developers sold everyone a pack of lies and hired people to censor out anyone that calls them out on their unethical, thieving and unprofessional behaviour. I can think of many games that have far more content and regular updates and better developers (in terms of listening to and communicating with the community) that cost far less. An example of their lying can be found in the trailer, you are led to believe that there are two types of enemies, it shows a larger corruptron throwing rocks at the castle. This is an outright lie, there is no such thing in the game. The only other game I can think of recently with this kind of unethical misrepresentation of the product is War Z with its crawling zombies in the trailer.\n\nThe future for Castle Story is bleak, most people who were going to buy it have already bought it long ago when it first came to steam, since then the developers have completely failed to deliver. Any criticism of their unprofessional behaviour by the community is ignored or censored. They have all the money they're going to get so there is simply no more reason to work on the game any further. Instead they are hiring more and more staff to sell it to people on the internet and make promises that will never be kept to create the illusion that they are still working on the game.\n\nI expect that in time they will change the name of the game as War Z did to squeeze out those last few sales before it is consigned to the dustbin of history as yet another kickstarter project that made the devs very rich but utterly failed to deliver on its promises.\n\nDo not give these unethical, thieving and unprofessional developers any of your money, to do so would encourage others to follow their lead.","September 4, 2014","false","21.0"," 272 of 295 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","272","295","2","5"

Sauropod studios are run by a very small group of inexperienced, unapologetic jerks. If you bought in to this game through kickstarter or early access, they will treat you like crap on the forums.\n\nThe only thing Castle Story had going for it was the amazing work the Community Manager: Box, was doing. Box would try to give information to you straight, without breaking any of the company rules, which was very difficult to do. Box would always try to break information down to the community and calm people down who were angry about any of the situations. In the end, the company would give Box misleading information and then blame him for giving out any information to the community.\n\nOne of the primary developers for Castle Story is a dev named Thierry. Thierry has a tendency to berate the community for asking questions. On multiple occasions I've read post by him calling out individuals and virtually yelling at them, or the community in general and blaming them for being impatient. The game has been in development for years now, and there has literally been no visual improvement in over a year.\n\nOriginally there were weekly updates on what was going on, with an occasional skipping of a week or two. Now there are monthly updates on what is going on. I take that back. There are monthly video blogs about things nobody cares about. These "monthly" video blogs have only made it up to the 3rd blog before they seem to have stopped posting them. It has been six weeks since the last video blog, which is probably a good thing, because they're useless information anyway.\n\nTL;DR, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. The devs will treat you like crap, and blame the community for asking too many questions, the game has been stagnant for over a year. The forums have started seeing posts deleted, and users are getting banned for giving out useful information, and asking real questions respectfully.","October 8, 2014","false","38.1"," 237 of 260 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","237","260","2","7"

Surely, right now the game is on sale and you're looking at the reviews to see if the game is worth $12.99-$14.99 because what kind of customer would you be if you didn't?\n\nYou see some good reviews--"Recommended! Yes! What a great game! Has some work to do, but worth it!" and so you continue to look, just in case.\n\nThen you'll see bad reviews--"Do not recommend! No! Horrible game! Has a ton of work to do, and not worth it!" You see a couple of these, but you decide you want to make your own decision on the matter.\n\nYou'll look back at the screen shots, review some videos, and see that the game is hella cute, has a good looking play style, and an interesting concept.\n\nYou'll ignore the bad reviews and buy the game anyways.\n\nYou install.\n\nThe game is beautiful, so it doesn't disappoint on that front.\n\nThe game is fairly easy to play, so ~30 minutes in, you'll have the controls down for the most part and basic strategies for castle building.\n\nAfter ~1h, you'll get bored of your first castle and start anew, with a different strategy in mind.\n\nYou'll be fairly successful with your second castle, and you'll have a lot of the mechanics behind the game worked out, making this new castle easier.\n\nNow this is where I don't know what you'll do. I, personally, got bored of the second castle. I realized the only thing I can do is expand on my castle with what little land I had (digging/terraforming isn't as easy as it should be, so I wouldn't consider that a feature.) On top of that, building is pretty slow, so that takes a while (gets pretty boring to me pretty fast.) On top of THAT, the AI is still pretty wonky, so the Bricktrons aren't as efficient as they could be.\n\nThis game has a ton of potential, don't get me wrong. When crafting, new game modes, and just more stuff is added, I'll revisit it. But for now, I wouldn't say this game isn't even worth $10 as it is.

Designed to be used with a gamepad, not keyboard+mouse.\n\nAI is still braindead; pathfinding is as broken as it can be. You still can't build a structure even as small as this without constantly micro maniging.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546014381\nNotice that he is standing right on top the blueprint he should be building. So he can reach it with the block but too dumb to do it.\n\nStarted new map, didn't build anything, didn't create any tasks, didn't give any orders, just selected all 5 bricktons and moved them in front of the pre-built castle; 3 of them made it, 2 got stuck on the way. Heh, so much for improved pathfinding.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546079762\n\nBig Island doesn't even load for me; stuck at "Loading %0".\n\nMultiplayer is still as broken as it can be.\n\nSome Halloween stuff again; lanterns and stuff.\n\nAnd to think they will release this in a few months. I really can't believe Sauropod.\n\nStill no real update, no real content, still the same old broken game.\n\nStay away!\n\n------------------\n\nEdit: 29/10/2014\nSo after 2 years, a new patch downloaded just now; it contains 2 new hats, one for archer and one for knight. And the floating soul thingies are now ghosts. No other visible additions so far. Will see if there will be patch notes or not.\nEdit: No patch notes; just some Halloween themed visual changes. Unbelievable.\n\nAfter 2 years we had a refactoring, a few bug fixes and a pause button.\nMap editor is gone.\nMultiplayer is as broken as it can be.\nStill no new content.\n\n----------\n\nOriginal review:\nI am a Kickstarter backer so I have been following the development of the game for about 1,5 years.\n\nThis ride started great, these guys had an awasome concept, gameplay movies to show and so I backed their project. They were supposed to deliver the beta in October 2012; now we are in Early Access and still in early prototype. But the real problem is the lack of information about the development process; dev. dairies are void of any solid info; they are just about bugfixes and trivial stuff; t-shirts, save/load game functions, technical mumbo jumbo.. We don't know where this game is going; no real direction or roadmap presented by devs. There is talk of a roadmap though; for many, many months if I remember correctly. I suspect they have not known what to do with their game since the beginning. I just can't explain the lack of any solid info about the game/roadmap/direction in any other way.\n\nSince the first prototype of the game, over a year ago, devs have added a really, really broken survival mode to the game, a multiplayer mode which doesn't work, a few bugfixes here and there; nothing else.\n\nGame has a lot of potential, a great concept but the execution is just plain bad; UI is horrible, there are no real updates, no content added in over a year since first release.\n\nI do not recommend the game at this point. At this rate devs working on the game; come back in a year or two and maybe, maybe you might be looking at a good game. Otherwise just stay away for now.\n\nAbout the game itself:\nIt's sandbox building game. You have minions doing various tasks like mining, cutting down trees and providing you with building materials on the map you choose; well you have just one map at the moment so no choosing. You issue orders to your minions to gather materials and then you go ahead and lay down blueprints for your minions and they build them.\n\nIn Survival mode; you have baddies on top of normal sandbox mode. But they have no AI so they just rush at you. Get an archer or two at a high place and you win. Baddies won't be able to climb more than 2 blocks high and it takes too much time to destroy the blocks; your archers will kill everyone while baddies are hacking away at the blocks.\n\nProblems;\nUI is horrible. unimaginative and clunky.\n\nCamera controls are plain bad.\n\nThere are still problems with laying down blueprints for constructions. Pathfinding is broken, AI is broken; blueprints for big buildings are very problematic; your minions just can't build them due to pathfinding errors.\nEspecially big blueprints will give you a headache; you will have to zoom in, out, rotate the camera this way and that just to be able to lay down a blueprint. Misclick? Tough luck; some blueprints blocks just don't wanna be removed so you will end up dropping that building and start another blueprint.\n\nMany times you will have to start a map over and over again to get minions to spawn at all; you will just start with no minions.\n\nThere is a catapult in the game with which you can hurl barrels filled with stones or explosive stones to baddies. Very clunky to use; you will end up not using it at all. You don't want to use explosive barrels too; you will just destroy your buildings with it.\n\nNo content added as of now. You just build aimlessly in the map. There aren't enough building blocks.\n\nThere aren't enough info about the game mechanics; how do you build that bridge for example? You will have to find some YouTube video by a fellow player to show you that.\nWhy can't you just put that block over there? Because you can't. And no one tells you why not.","March 26, 2014","false","37.4"," 248 of 279 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","248","279","0","5"

The good news was that once this was done, they were to start pumping out feature and content updates much more quickly, since they were including an improved asset pipeline.\nThat took much more time than their community liason had let on.  The community (other investors in the game) were getting pretty restless.\nFinally that refactoring was completed.  A patch was released!  Unfortunately, it had little to no impact on the gameplay.  There were some minor stability improvements but no real new features or content.  We were okay with that because of the promise of much more coming more quickly...\nWe were then informed that we were being too impatient, and that no new features or content could be done until they finished working on their internal tools (factories).\nWe were then informed that there would continue to be a suspension of any new features or content while they rewrite the AI engine and the Pathfinding.   No new content could be provided since "Why would we give you new content if the AI cant figure out what to do with that content"...\nOf course most users abandoned hope that this would ever be completed.   It had been month after month after month of broken promises.   They eventually ended their relationship with the community liason, citing that he never really spoke for the company, and his promises were unfounded.\nNow, FINALLY.. version 0.3 has been released!!  (coincidentally timed with a Steam promotion) With the new AI, the new Pathfinding, new lighting effects, a bigger island to work with.\nUnfortunately, there is still no new content, no new features.   Leading up to a sale on Steam, they put together a nice little video of the new features ..   New AI (Which is worse than the original).. New Lighting (Which is of zero impact on the gameplay).. a bigger island (which is probably among the bottom 2% of necessary changes)..\nThey then 'cleaned' out the user forums of most negative feedback..\nUnfortunately even after these years of waiting, the new 'version' was even more buggy and had less (YES LESS) features than the original.  The great new AI that was promised could only be 'tested' in a seperate environment, where the feature set was limited, and even that was far worse than the original, very buggy, AI.\nThey started releasing (Very minor) bug fixes almost daily, appeasing many, even though they really only addressed things like difficulty in loading the game, or glitchy graphic artifacts, etc ..  These fixes and patches (0.3.1,  0.3.2,  0.3.3,  0.3.4)  started giving some of us the impression that this past couple of years of unfulfilled and broken promises was at an end and the momentum would finally change.   Unfortunately, although those changes were welcome if only to see that there was actually some level of activity going on..   They were short lived.  4 patches in 5 days.  Then nothing.. again.\nThis game has great potential as a concept.  But if you are considering it.. You would be very well advised to wait until you can read the reviews of the finished game.\n","January 3, 2015","false","358.8"," 236 of 265 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","236","265","7","16"

There has been many delays since it originally released on the kickstart with many broken deadlines.

What they have done with this update is add a bigger map only for sandbox that is (no enemys or corrupttrons). They have as well done a HUGE update to the textures shadows and lighting. It's hard to say they have made any progress until now. They still have MAJOR bug issues that need to be adressed. For example they have said they "fixed" the AI but its still a huge problem.

No, but why not? A 2 year summary\n\nI'm watching the development since almost two years and played over 160 hours. Only survival mode because there are no other challanges. Sandbox mode didn't really interested me after all, you know minecraft?\n\nFollowing Bugs and missing game options bother me since the first time i played. There has been changes and improvments but nothing got really fixed to a point im happy with. I guess a lot of other people feel the same after reading reddit and other sources, pointing out there's no progress would be wrong, but the prioritisation is amiss. I understand the process of prototyping, alphas and early access. But there shut be a noticable progress in all directions after two years of development.\n\n- building menu - Castle Story uses some kind of nice circular menu, it has a nice appeal in the first place. But really nerves after using it, because its inconvenient. You need to do the following steps to choose one of your main building materials; 1x1 stone bricks: hold down the right mousebutton, the main menu appears, move the mouse to submenu button, release the right mouse button, the main menu disapperas. Press the right mouse button again, the submenu apperas, move to the 1x1 stone, release right the mouse button, now you can place your bricks. You know what!? Let me use the left mouse button to select the submenu and the 1x1 brick, this would make the following steps redundant and the selection would be; hold right mouse button, left click submenu, left click desired option, DONE!?\n\n- blue Crystals - the Ore you need to gather for spawning new npcs is now stuck on stockpiles by default (version 0.3.3). This would be one of the very few added game mechanics in two years that made me happy, if turned off by default OMG. Now you have to manually order your broken Worker AI to carry the blue crystals to the main crystal or deaktivate the option on every stockpile you build... really?\n\n- demolishing - you can't demolish stockpiles, lamps, barrels,... If it does work and i didn't realise how, why doesn't it work the same way it does with stones and wood. By the way, if it works with stones and wood, does it take why more than 2 years to implement this feature?\n\n- zooming - nice to be able to zoom with the mousewheel, but only to a certain and low point. If users complain about that, they are told to use the old method, the caps key and mousewheel, now the can zoom infinite. What every sence restricting the "mousewheel only zoom" and having two ways to zoom after all may have. Only one way to zoom, problem fixed.\n\n- Workers - still get stuck in many different tasks. I know theres a new AI and it's not implemented in survival mode yet. Currently (version 0.3.3) the AI is a killjoy.\n\n- Swordsmen - useless as long as not standing in front of a gate. Because Enemys are past over before the realize there existence. Currently (version 0.3.3) the AI is a killjoy.\n\n- Archers - commit suicide by shoting there bows and killed other player npcs, this didn't happen anymore since version 0.3.0 and i played to wave 25. Thats a plus!\n\ni'm ♥♥♥♥ed, somebody else complete the list... Don't buy the game until it's released!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strask/recommended/227860/","strask","strask","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strask/","94 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTHIS REVIEW IS IN PURGATORY: I'm working on writing a new one. On October 27, 2015 Sauropod Studios released Castle Story 0.5, which seems to be FULL OF CONTENT AND FEATURES. Time will tell if they will start releasing updates on a reasonable schedule, and it remains to be seen if the game will be finished. But read the review with an open mind; things are looking better than when I wrote it.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nThis game cost me $20 USD or so, and gave me 113 hours of enjoyment. That's over five hours of play per dollar -- certainly more than I've gotten out of some AAA titles that cost me three times that much. It was a fun little game.\n\nSo why the thumbs down? Well, because despite being a somewhat *fun* game, it's not a *complete* game. And at this point it is not clear to me that the game will EVER be complete.\n\nThe devs posted this disclaimer long ago: http://www.sauropodstudio.com/steam-early-access-disclaimer/ stating the features that work and those that are planned. The disclaimer is pretty accurate, it doesn't lie about what's working and what's not. The problem is that the "what's working" list has not grown by a single item since I bought the game -- litterally the ONLY feature of any note that has been added was a pause function -- which would have been greatly appreciated if I hadn't worn out the gameplay many months ago -- but they haven't made any visible progress towards that complete feature set they said they were planning.\n\nSome of this is understandable. It's a young studio, this is their first game and the developers are less experienced than those on a lot of other games. They made some early mistakes and had to refactor the code base, which took a long time. Normally, refactoring (while frustrating for end users because it consumes time with no new features) is useful because it reduces future bugs and makes implementing new features later much easier. But these things only matter if you RELEASE UPDATES after the refactoring.\n\nAs I said, this is the studio's first game, and as you can see it's not going super well. It's entirely possible that they are out of money and about to go bankrupt for all I know. So it's impossible to say when or even if this game will get another update, or if a hypothetical update would even contain any significant improvements.\n\nSo while it really boils down to the typical early access mantra of "Only pay for it if you are happy with the CURRENT state of the game", and while the current state of the game WAS worth the money I paid for it, I can't really recommend this game because I know that most people are less easy to please than I am, and want a finished product. This game may never be that.","November 25, 2014","false","117.9"," 133 of 163 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","133","163","0","0"

Sauropod studios are run by a very small group of inexperienced, unapologetic jerks. If you bought in to this game through kickstarter or early access, they will treat you like crap on the forums.\n\nThe only thing Castle Story had going for it was the amazing work the Community Manager: Box, was doing. Box would try to give information to you straight, without breaking any of the company rules, which was very difficult to do. Box would always try to break information down to the community and calm people down who were angry about any of the situations. In the end, the company would give Box misleading information and then blame him for giving out any information to the community.\n\nOne of the primary developers for Castle Story is a dev named Thierry. Thierry has a tendency to berate the community for asking questions. On multiple occasions I've read post by him calling out individuals and virtually yelling at them, or the community in general and blaming them for being impatient. The game has been in development for years now, and there has literally been no visual improvement in over a year.\n\nOriginally there were weekly updates on what was going on, with an occasional skipping of a week or two. Now there are monthly updates on what is going on. I take that back. There are monthly video blogs about things nobody cares about. These "monthly" video blogs have only made it up to the 3rd blog before they seem to have stopped posting them. It has been six weeks since the last video blog, which is probably a good thing, because they're useless information anyway.\n\nTL;DR, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. The devs will treat you like crap, and blame the community for asking too many questions, the game has been stagnant for over a year. The forums have started seeing posts deleted, and users are getting banned for giving out useful information, and asking real questions respectfully.","November 3, 2014","false","2.6"," 65 of 69 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","65","69","0","0"

But the developers seem to be incapable of getting the game running properly. Been following its development for years now, and while I'm aware I purchased an Early Access game,  it's at the point now where I don't see this game ever being finished.  It has the same bugs and lack of content it did a year ago, the units don't respond well (or sometimes not at all) to commands, there's still no solid multiplayer, and the game still lags tremendously after a certain amount of waves.. This game isn't going anywhere, sadly. Unplayable.\n\nI strongly urge you not to buy this game.\n\nSecond review, 19-02-2015:\n\nI stand by my statement that the game has not yet reached the point of "money's worth." However, it seems I was wrong about this game never going to be finished.\n\nThe latest patch still leaves a lot to be desired, but they did fix the general unit control. Units still "dumb down" every now and then, but at least this time around you get to give them new orders once you've moved them manually. Where I couldn't even get past wave 15 in the past, I am surprised to say the game managed to get me to wave 35 without any framedrop. I paused the game to have a little drinky and edit my review, games tend to take a while. It's actually quite fun without lagspikes. I've heard friends mention they've made it up to wave 50-or-so, and then it started lagging.\n\nI still don't recommend this game as it is now, because multiplayer is still barely functional. If you want to play with a friend, get ready to search forums for a while, 'cause it doesn't come with complete instructions. But it is starting to look like we might see this game in a finished state after all.\n\nWhat I would like to see before I start recommending this game:\n\n- Playable framerate up to at least wave 100.\n- An easier way of getting rid of rubble. Either by despawning it, or having the bricktrons clean up quicker, I've noticed the game now starts lagging due to the amount of rock chips lying around.\n- An enjoyable multiplayer mode. Let's face it, this game can be summed up as tower defense meets lego. Don't get me wrong, it's fun! But we could use a co-op mode against the AI instead of a vague deathmatch where nobody is quite sure what to do and when to do it.\n- Catapults to be useful for either blowing up terrain or killing the rockmen.","January 25, 2015","false","54.0"," 99 of 119 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","99","119","5","3"

The concept was creative and nostalgic so I decided to support the game's early development. As all the other reviewers have indicated, there has been almost no significant progress in gameplay in a year and a half. To add insult to injury, the devs at Sauropod act as if the "early access" disclaimer forfeits any right by the gamers supporting them, to expect progress or a timetable for completion. Indeed, the devs censor and berate the gamers which have supported them financially, who are rightfully frustrated by the glacial rate of progress. Are we supposed to maintain our excitement and support when we get superficial/cosmetic updates every few months?\n\nThe devs frequently complain that the increasingly negative reviews are hindering sales, and therefore development.

I was very disappointed in the development of new content prior to steam and for the past year I hadn't paid much attention to Castle Story until I happen to notice that 0.5 was released and appears to incorporate some new content.  I figured it had probably been a year or more since I last checked in so I'd give it another go.\n\nUpon booting up the game, I noticed there were some new maps which made me think perhaps maybe they had finally gotten their act together and started producing content.\n\nI started off chopping down some trees so I had a place to stockpile resources.  I had remembered from a year ago when I last played that they came up with a horrible horrible user interface.  News flash, it's still there and it's my opinion that they somehow managed to make it even more complicated.  I simply, without a doubt, absolutely hate the interface they've come up with.\n\nAfter creating a few dozen zones to allow my minions to place resources, I decided to start doing some mining to collect rock/stone as well.  I sent off four of the five minion to work on the side of a hill while my remaining unit cleaned up the rest of the trees and made some barrels for later.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, all my miners went stupid and were just standing there.  I moved them away from the hill, then assigned them to mining the hill again, which they happily did until 5 minutes later when they went stupid and forgot what they were supposed to be doing again.\n\nI instructed the minion away from the hill again, lets them regroup and sent them back to mining the hill again.  After 5 minutes, brain dead again.

In two years, there has been two mentionable updates, both of which brought either tiny features, (such as pillars) game breaking bugs (such as the assumed memory leak in the unstable build which forces you to reload the level every ten minutes) or both.\nI understand creating games is not easy, even through easy methods, such as game making or scripting programs, but this seriously makes me wonder if they are actually doing any development, or just making YouTube videos to say they are. I doubted Starbound, and they barely pulled through once, but this is far more problematic than slow development; this is avoidance.\n\nMy suggestion is to put it on your wishlist, wait about five years, and check again.

Using several different tactics I haven't been able to get past wave 4. The enemy is more powerful, spawns faster and has less chance of friendly-fire, and outnumbers you significantly.

If you want to waste $20 on something worthwhile go buy banished or heck even get stonehearth or Don't Starve. It's been almost 3 years since this game came out! They surpass the time it took dota 2 to come out of beta. There is no hope that they plan on finishing this and can be reassuringly be declared a dead game. Like by time they finish it half-life 3 will have came out already. That's really slow if valve time is faster than an indie game development... And when i say valve time is faster I mean the developers are extremely slow ,incompetent and aren't willing to communicate with the community go on and read the other reviews it's the same thing over and over but if you want to know about the game besides the opinion review up there go to the next paragraph.\n\nSo what they have done in the past 3 years: the AI can barely function correctly, they let out an update once in a blue moon and usually it is the most unhelpful thing, They rarely actually fix anything besides make the problem worse, it has so much potential but with staff like this the game will probably never finish and it probably won't go the correct direction. If you want more reasons:\n-multiplayer doesn't work\n-the maps themselves suck and only 1 type of map is a survival map\n-the other maps are buggy\n-the AI stop for long periods of time or just stop completely\n-the staff don't really solve any problems in the game\n-literally it has been 2 years and nothing has really changed besides adding a pillar...\n-the maps you can play and build are floating islands and your resources drop down there 50% of the time\n-after xx waves the energy you are supposed to get randomly goes off into the bottom of the map and you never get the energy from them\n-the developers probably stopped working on this game to pursue something else so it seems to give off the signal of an abandoned game.\n\nI can go on and on about it so buy this game at your own risk, I am not saying it won't ever get better but if they keep on going this way then it will be safe to say the developers just want your money for half-♥♥♥ work and will probably drag it out as long as they can.

There are thousands of better things to do with $20 than buying this game. Buying this game is the same as giving $20 to the begger on the street that leeches on working people and gets drunk every night. You gain nothing from giving them $20 and society gets nothing from giving them $20. Do not do it.\n\nThese guys don't work like you and I work for our boss. These guys are the kind that were making Duke Nukem Forever for 20years and still ended up with nothing.\nIt's very unlikely they are trying to make the game but are the most incompetent people ever. Very likely they are sitting around the office all day playing their Xbox and eating pizza. I don't know how they aren't disgusted with themselves but having millions of dollars from sales in your pocket probably helps a lot.\n\n- The developers are so bad at their job that the first alpha released worked better than the first alpha they brought to Steam. And the current version on Steam works even worse than the first. The game development is going backwards. I know how crazy this sounds yet I'm saying the words with truth.\n- All 3years of development so far have been a struggle with making the core of the game. Basic functions are still not completed and many features like remapping keys or full options screen or a working AI pathfinding are still not in the game.\nThey use Unity3D and all basic game features that you can imagine are nothing more than importing an asset store package and 15min configuration to build it into your own game. These guys fail at using a wizard that has 200 tutorial videos about on youtube. Literally!\nAnyone with the capacity to work in a game engine can rebuild to the current state of the game within a month. I know.\n- Their artist is working as hard as the rest of the team. All characters and props can be made in 2 weeks after viewing a few hours of Blender tutorials. Everything is modelled and textured extremely simple. You'd think after 3 years they would have more than 1 spruce tree, 1 yellow guy, 1 kind of grey rocks and 1 kind of wood beams/planks? You'd think there would be beaches and mountain ranges and dessert maps etc?\n- About a year ago they must have noticed buyers were catching on to their scam. So they hired some guy to full time censor the forums and delete any negative thread and ban any user that speaks any kind of bad about the game. Meanwhile all the new buyers who still genuinly think this game will ever be finished get smoothtalked how busy everyone is and how they have plans to fix and remake everything. After months when that deadline has come and gone, they invent a new deadline.\n\nTLDR: The people from Sauropod are scum.\n\nIf you don't believe me, just scroll down the reviews and you can see that nothing I am saying is a lie. These guys are scammers, will shut you up any way they can and Valve is so out of touch with their customers that they don't react to thousands of complaints.","March 28, 2015","false","2.8"," 85 of 110 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","85","110","9","0"

I think it still has the potential to become amazing.

I strongly recommend that others wait and see how future development proceeds.  One day if I see significant improvements I promise to revise my review and give it a thumbs up.

Now several months go by before I even bother, and yet, still then, there's nada. Nichts. Zilch.\n\nAnd my interest in the game, despite it's potential, despite the fact that it SHOULD be the kind of game I'd love, my interest is basically the same as the game's development pace, which is to say, next to non-existent. Actually, the very fact that it has inspired me to go out of my way to write what is for me a rare negative review should say it all. I have no idea what they do over there at Sauropod Studios, but it most certainly isn't anything remotely like what I'd call "work", I can only assume that they've happily taken the $700k they made off the Kickstarter and are laughing at us all the way.\n\nEDIT: The developers CLAIM the game will be "released" at the end of the year. IF that happens and we actually get what we were promised in the Kickstarter, I will revist this review at that time. Until then, I simply cannot recommend this game based on the progress we have seen in the 3 years since it was supposed to release in the first place.","September 2, 2015","false","69.7"," 55 of 69 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","55","69","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/afdjones/recommended/227860/","afdjones","Afdjones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/afdjones/","233 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMy complete thoughts on this title. Basically, castle story is a very unique game that has a ton of potential. Although people beleive its very similar to games like towns, its completely different. Altough the objective of castle story is to protect your base from ememys and buils structues, its thought on survival is really weak, There're no food or water meters for your little minions, and the whole idea of 'crafting' is completely useless. Despite this, the game is actually fun to play, but can only be played for short amount of hours at a time, as its very repetative. You will always find yourself either building, chopping tree's or mining. Thats pretty much it, untill you have to fight a small amount of enemys day-by-day. Its area of land is also very small and limited, but as i said, it can be fun to play, and its still in Early Access, so what can you expect? So, is this game worth $20? Probably not, if im honest. Although fanboys may disagree, and cliaming that 'its only in early development and more will come', we should really expect more from these types of games, expecially if people are laying down $20 for a game that could have been made by a college student. Overall, if you're on the wall with this game, save the cash, and wait till more has been added. Not much to do, and not much fun overall. Infact the only thing that will keep you playing is the graphics.","November 26, 2013","false","8.3"," 200 of 315 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","200","315","0","0"

I purchased this game shortly after being offered on SEA roughly 18 months ago. To date the ONLY things done has been refactoring the code and a large map added. The AI is atrocious, the devs constantly delete threads or posts with any negative criticism and generally have an attitude of suppression. All we want to see is progression and to this point I dont believe the studio has enough experience to deliver what they promised. I am beginning to compare this game to GODUS as being a failure. So purchase at your own risk. if its finished it may be years down the road and not in a general time frame of 3 to 5 years for a game such as this. Remember over 2 years have already been invested in the game and it may take another 4 or 5 years at the rate its going if they last that long.\n\nHere is a sample of them\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079381919/moderatormessages/65143/","February 11, 2015","false","2.0"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","45","58","0","14"

I decided to wait a few weeks for them to fix it — the one that froze the game with constant lag after about an hour and a half of playing the same map, and when you reach a certain number of people. Over a month later, there is still no fix.(As of the 26th of June, I have tested the latest patches... it's still going on)\n\nWhen I add that situation to how long this game has taken in the past, until now, to actually have updates implemented, I have to give this one a rather big no for my recommendation. This game has so much potential, and I mean a lot, but there is definitely an issue with the very slow development team, and the lack of progress made when an update is actually released — not much has actually been implemented long term, and important parts of the game are still disabled by the developers because they don't work properly (such as digging).\n\nI follow a lot of early access games and this is the poorest development cycle I am aware of at the moment.\n\nNegatives (As of June 2015 with 'bleeding edge' version)\n-The way the UI is set-up for building, placing items, etc, is atrocious. You have to drill down through so many selections to reach what you want to reach, then you have to get back out if you want to do something else.. it's a bit like torture.  (This is the worst thing about the game for me)\n-The Save/Load menu is bulky, and slow to use. This needs polishing. (small issue though)\n-Very slow progression with the development of the game\n-The radius with cutting down trees. You have to keep adding 'flags' every time you want to cut down a group of trees, and this is rather tedious.\n-Major performance issues when reaching a certain number of people on screen\n-The way blue crystal is put into crates by default (again, tedious to manually move it to the actual blue crystal)\n-The lack of maps on survival. There needs to be a variety here based on peoples play styles, such as a corner start, instead of in the middle. This would greatly improve the game for a lot of people.\n-The waves(enemies) come too fast. There needs to be an option to manage waves before beginning the game\n-The fact you have to place a clean up broom radius flag… they should just clean up automatically, or the stuff that needs cleaning up should disappear over time. (tedious to manage, and the little bits littering the ground slow the game down)\n\nPositives (As of June 2015 with 'bleeding edge' version)\n\n-Friendly fire, but this can get annoying (needs fine tuning)\n-Variety of enemies (needs fine tuning)\n-The types of structures you can build using stone or wood. This is rather fun and is really the main point of the game.\n-The cuteness of the game. The yellow guys and the grey guys are all very cute and make cute noises.\n-Having your archers take out the enemy is rather enjoyable once you have enough of them, and a system in place where you know exactly where to place them, and how to build your defences.\n-The quick response of the developers to forum posts is very supportive & commendable\n-The music is quite good, but there needs to be more variety.","May 28, 2015","false","44.6"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","36","44","4","0"

Well, 4 years down the line it still looks exactly like it did 4 years ago on that Kickstarter page.\n\nAs far as I see, there is no real 'gameplay' to it other than plan a castle, dig some quarry's or mines and then watch the little yellow dudes AI fail to get it them the build zone or even properly drop resources off.\n\nInstead, you'll spend your game time watching your workers swap resources around with one another rather than building anything. It almost seems like they tried to implement a bucket brigade AI... which would work great if they gave the poor little workers a little more logic so they didn't run the exact same path when on the same task - because they then spend more time swapping resources between themselves and 'finding paths to blueprint' instead of running over there.\n\nThe problems around building make it really hard to even attempt the 'wave survival' game modes - because its takes so long to get a simple wall around it and the damage enemies do (even on easy) wipes out your meagre combat units really quickly (I survived 60 kills ~8 waves before losing but still didn’t even have a simple wall up because the yellow dudes couldn't decide or work out how to get places)\n\nThe final straw for me was putting 6 workers on a large build task. They'd keep stopping at the build site, even though there were plenty of resources and lots of room for movement. They just all kept saying they were going to the same pile of resources which I can only assume meant all 6 of their poor little AI's were clashing and blocking one another... without anyone actually moving!\n\nSome bullet points of what bugged me the most (Version 0.5.1):\n\n- The UI is terrible. Every action in-game relies on a right click and hold - it's not intuitive, it’s not clear and it’s not even explained to you. I had to go find a video tutorial on basic camera movement and building because it was so annoyingly unclear. Actions should speak for themselves and not have to be searched for.\n\n- Speaking of UI, sorting what materials can be placed on a storage pad is ridiculous. If you want to make it specifically wood, it takes 5 right click, hold, and selects to set it so. You need a lot of storage, so multiply that by the number of space you want... it’s just plain silly.\n\n- For a game about building castles its surprising tedious to build anything in (let alone a castle), you need more workers to get things done faster but the more workers you have the slower the build goes because they spend time bumping into one another and sometimes they just decide to have a stop work meeting.\n\n- The game constantly lags and has miniature seizures for a few seconds every few seconds...\n\n- As outlined, the AI is just shoddy. There are a few simple things that would make it miles more efficient... the best being a complete overhaul of their path-finding algorithm and how they interact with one another (not swapping resources every damn time they bump into each other!)\n\n- The game could benefit from a 'speed up time' button... a lot.\n\nOverall: 3/10\n\nJust so much wasted potential.\n\nAvoid at all costs - don't be fooled! There are better games out there!","January 18","false","8.5"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","43","56","2","0"

Coming back to the game like I have, the only new thing I noticed is that the bricks look a bit more like stone instead of plastic.\n\nHad this game made progress or at least remained relatively smooth in gameplay, I could reccomend it as a fun little sandbox game.

Really kinda disgusted with this game since I found this out... heard about it in a review... didnt believe it... didnt even believe the kickstarter page, surely that comma is ment to be a period, added it all up myself...yes the really did make 700 grand on a beta glitchy ♥♥♥♥♥ game...\n\nyes and they did go from beta to prototype... so who knows what will come next... beta2, prealpha? whatever... ♥♥♥♥ this game, you can barely if ever build what you want... I havent even gone over all the broken AI, they castle ruining blueprint glitches, the sheer inability to build the most simple bridge but the ability to build an infinite unsupported staircase... the terrible combat...Last time I checked the multiplayer didnt even work... it has only 2 freaking SIMPLE ♥♥♥♥♥ maps... the map editor is disabled... it lags too, I run skyrim or dishonered full settings and this game give me more lag, for stupid reasons too, usually reasons critical to the gameplay... its just poor on all fronts.\n\nI'm actually angry about it now.","November 17, 2013","false","16.6"," 177 of 282 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","177","282","0","7"

I wasn't. There are about 4 lands and the option to play as either survival or sandbox mode within each land. I tried each of them but only one worked WITHOUT crashing. Yep. 3/4 lands and 7/8 modes crashed before I could even get past the loading screen. When I was finally able to get to that one land that DID work, it was so slow molasses would laugh at it.

Development is painfully slow, I think maybe the devs just get together once a month for a few hours.  They just keep redoing the same features over and over, never getting it right or even making any noticeable difference.\n\nAs it stands at the time of this review (and probably for several months to come) the game has very little to offer.  One playthrough of survival will probably be all you need to see everything there is.  As far as creative mode, there are much better sandbox games out there that are much less frustrating in ways a game should not be frustrating (pathing, glitches, etc).\n\nMaybe come back in a couple years and see if they've made any progress toward doing this idea justice, but don't bother buying it now.

At it's core, Castle Story is an experimental survival/sandbox RTS in which you tell little yellow guys called Bricktrons what to do. They can work or fight, but typically get confused while carrying out their assigned tasks and just stop doing anything. The bugs in this WiP game are just too much, considering the fact that it's been 'in beta' for four years now. The project is obviously too much for the 10-man, part-time, on-again-off-again development team, and it's gotten to the point that they've hired on a PR guy to try in vain to dispel the rumors that this game has crumbled to nothing. Updates are infrequent, and the ones that come every four to six months add no new content, and fix none of the bugs which make the game almost unplayable.

It looked absolutely nothing like in the trailers or demos that we were given a lot of previews of. I followed development really closely and I felt like the dev team at times were really ignorant of how the players felt about their 'progress' and 'attention' on certain aspects of the game.\n\nI made a thread on the forums with over 15 things that I could not find in the early access version of the game, vs all the demo videos they had shown. In the end I got the response I was expecting. Nothing.\nIn the beginning you were actually advised by the devs to enable the cheats console to even use the game properly.\nCertain sounds were bugged so badly like background 'crickets' that were looped really loudly and never stopped and couldn't be silenced without muting the whole game.\nEntire 'building bricks' that were in the demos were missing. These were small things that were missing for ages.\nThere were no enemies for close to a year.\nThe menu, even years after the early access was released, is still terrible and so unintuitive.\nFor 2 years after the game was available to play, there wasn't any multi-player at all.\nIt took a year just to get the choice to start off on a different map from that only single one the game shipped with.\nDevelopment blogs and transparency from the devs went from being something they would write about and share with their players weekly, to where you wouldn't hear from them for months despite people paying for early-access (funding them).\nAI was so bugged and 'bricktons' would just randomly stop what they were doing or get stuck so easily.\nPerformance on a good machine was absolutely terrible for over a year.\nAll in all, for the amount of money they raised on Kickstarter and the speed at which they went to early access, the game was one of the most disappointing in its early stages, that I had ever seen. In the end this game in particular taught me to never purchase an 'early-access' game because the sheer lack of development progress the game can be on, and still be allowed to be released on Steam is just ridiculous.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but I feel that development has shifted so many times due to the incompetent team. Also in mid 2015 almost no one plays this game. All Youtube videos are from 2-3 years ago when the game still had some 'hype' let alone some 'hope' surrounding it. Little has changed since then except that now the game has less bugs and could be considered something that doesn't need to be in 'early access'. This doesn't change the fact that the game simply isn't fun for me, and that the controls and UI and menus are still terrible. Basically the developers have totally missed their deadline in terms of it getting popular.\n\nIt's not remotely worth €25 and it probably won't be for another 2 years. It's a huge shame too because the graphics and potential this game has is absolutely through the roof. Hopefully in a few more years I will be able to recommend it, that is, if development is even on going and if people even play it.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoelTheMan/recommended/227860/","NoelTheMan","NoelTheMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoelTheMan/","56 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI was very excited for this game. I was actually convinced to buy this game a year ago because a friend had it and wanted to try the multiplayer. We tried forever to get the mutiplayer to work but it never did and the devs eventually locked it and now its been like that for a long time. I never wrote a review about the game because I hoped it would get better. It never did. The game is still plauged with problems and has been in early access for at least a year and a half. That seems like plenty of time to actually get something done, right? Nope. I noticed almost no difference in the game when I played today in comparason to the day I bought it (End of 2013) The only things that seemed different were that they had iron and annoying curruptions that took forever to kill. The game still feels like a buggy mess when I play. Constantly my workers glitch and stop working or listening to commands. Ive seen them complain that they cant reach blocks right in front of them. They bunch up in 2 block wide hallways and I constantly have my guys shot by archers. My warriors dont listen and attacking is annoying because its hard to click on the guy you want to kill. Sometimes guys stand there and die because they glitch out. Some glitches have to be fixed by reloading the save and gets annoying when you have to do it every 30-60 minutes. The game also suffers from screen tearing. My NVEDIA 880M and Intel I7 4710HQ@3.50GHz have trouble running this game because the game refuses to use them to their full power. The highest ive seen my GPU usage go in this game is 40% and the CPU 50%. Mostly the game uses around 10-20% of my GPU and 30-40% of my CPU and my ram hovers around 9GB (Out 0f 32) Since the game refuses to use my gpu or cpu the framrate is terrible. When I get into a game the framerate is great. But it quickly drops and then hits around 1-2 FPS with gpu usage at 1-10% and CPU at 10-20%. I know you have to click the delete key but even then the game hovers around 30-40FPS with 20-30% gpu usage and 30-40% cpu usage. I dont have a cap on frames either. In an attept to fix the screen tearing I lowered the graphics to fastest and went to NVEDIA control panel and turned on VSYNC. Frame rate was still the same even though my GPU was 1-10% and CPU was still 20-30%. On my old computer I had in 2013 (It had a NVEDIA 230M and an I7 cpu with 8GB of ram) the framrate never went below 120FPS and stayed near 200FPS when the game started and I had full GPU and CPU usage. It seems to me that this problem has come recently. The sreen tearing is ugly and basicallyis the final nail in the coffin for this game. Most of the graphical problems arrise when the GPU usage goes down to below 20%. Setting the game to High Priority does not even help. My GPU is not crap either. For some perspective I can run GTA 50FPS with everything at very high except water (High) and shadows (High) with MSAA on and tessalation off. My resolution is 2560X1440p tooso its quite impressive and the game looks great. When playing GTA gpu usage is at 98% and CPU is at 70-90%.\n\nIn short the graphical problems come when the GPU is used at its lowest and I could ignore the bugs if it wasent for the horrendus screen tearing and FPS that slowley drops over time. What sucks even more is that when you join a world at wave 10 the framrate starts at 60 and then drops to 10-20 over a period of 2 minutes and its not because there is stone everywhere.

And before anybody locks to this review for being negetive, let me explain. I don't dislike this game, but it's simply under-developed and shows very little ammounts of progress. The cons far out way the pros, but I will be more than happy to change this review once it finishes. (IF it finishes.)\n\nPros:\n-Voxel system\n-Cool graphical style\n-It's like if Minecraft was simplified and made into an RTS\n\nCons:\n-The AI is dreadfuly stupid\n-Path finding is about as bad as you could get without the bots standing completely still (which they will often do)\n-Optimization? This game, even on the lowest graphical settings, will at random, draw to a halt. Freezing and stuttering like your computer is a toaster\n-Lots of bugs, unresponsive AI, can't cut down a tree without it tumbling off the side of the map into oblivion, ect\n-It's like if Minecraft was simplified and made into an RTS\n\nI really do wanna see this game get further along, but such a slow development process is leaving me with little hope it'll ever get out of early access. (Although multiplayer was finally added in recently.) I won't hold my breath for this game.\n\nTL:DR early access at its finest. 4/10\n\n(PS: Could be a good 5-6 as is were the AI not so bad.)\n(PPS: To the developer: Please work on this.

Castle Story is a lackluster and at times needlessly frustrating experience that will just make you want to crave more with no hope of it ever delivering. First of all, the AI remains dirt stupid and at times unresponsive, making mutlitasking, an element crucial to games like these, more arduous than it should be. Sandbox mode will most likely not hold your attention for long, with there being a limited variety in building materials. Not only that, but getting said materials is time consuming and tedious, something you don't want said about a supposed sandbox mode.\n\nSurvival mode seemed promising at first, combining the freedom to build structures of many shapes and sizes with a tower defense play-style. Now, there is fun to had here if you're willing to look past the bad AI and hardly any strategy. Otherwise, the novelty won't save it from the mediocrities riddled throughout this gamemode. Accompanied with the aforementioned AI problems, the guards will ignore oncoming enemies, letting them slip by and wreak havok on your settlement. It's a shame because this gamemode has the potential to be something fufilling, if it were just executed better and had more options at your disposal (i.e, leveling up bricktrons and contraptions, stronger materials, depth in level design).\n\nWith no other gamemode to fall back on, you are almost guaranteed to lose interest long before this ever leaves early-access. You'd think that the developers would have found the time to encorporate more features and gamemodes in the last two years or so to keep us interested, much like many other open-alpha indie games out there. But alas, for whatever reason, updates have mainly consisted of bug fixes and graphical improvements. Unless by some miracle, this game gets finished and has a solid, replayable, and satisfying experience as a final product, I doubt I'll be concerning myself with this game anytime soon, and I suggest you do the same, to anyone thinking of buying this.","February 26, 2015","false","33.3"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","0"

I backed this game on Kickstarter because it looked awesome: like a strategy/city-builder with Minecraft elements. So far, the game remains unfinished and very difficult (pro-tip: get some archers and have your knights run in circles leading the big Corruptrons around town). The have delivered a framework on which the game can be built, even if the mechanics need some tweaking.\n\nThe developer emails kickstarter backers about once a month with updates. Around Halloween each year, they add "spooky" elements to the characters.\n\nIf you generally find yourself hating Early Access games, wait until it's published. Early Access means it's not quite done yet, so don't judge it based on the criteria you use on a completed game. The developers are probably too busy developing to answer your idiotic questions.

It's performance is appalling and my system is far better than the specs listed below, I can run CS:GO (On my other account) maxed out at 120 fps in a full on firefight. But this game I'm lucky to get more than 10 frames while the camera is standing still on "simple graphics".(Graphic settings; Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful, Fantastic.)Then its ridden with game breaking bugs. Before you say "It's in early access it's not supposed to be bug free." this game's alpha came out over a YEAR ago(Proof http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_rHg4mjhu8). And there's barely anything to even do in this game even tho its been in development for well over a year now.\n\nHeres a rundown of what you can do in the game currently. Play Hard or Normal survival or sandbox mode and a Multiplayer Arena mode. You only have the ability to do these three single player game modes on a single map(Arena mode has 4 tiny little islands apart from each other.). Once playing one of those game modes you have to get Stone from a mine in survival(By digging in sandbox) for building Blocks, half Blocks, stairs, and stone Arches. Then you have to get wood for Barrels, Columns, Platforms, Catapults, Stockpiles, Doors, Torches, and ladders. When in survival you have to fight off endless waves of (I’ve only gotten to wave 5 so don’t truly know if they stop a certain point past that.) Bricktons with your choice of archer or knight.(Can build as many of each as you want if you have the required resources) The way to spawn more is you have to collect blue crystals in the mine and them put them in a barrel near your “Home crystal”. And there you go thats everything you can build and basically do in this game so far.\n\nNOT worth 20$ in my opinion now if you're looking for a game to just build something simple and boring looking then get this, but if you want to build some amazingly extraordinary Castle this is not the game.\n","December 13, 2013","false","5.7"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

The bricktons were very unresponsive, at least for me, and I found it quite boring. There is no tutorial and you have to go into the menu to even find out that some of the most important features in the game even exist. For the first half of my time spent on this game I found myself restarting over and over gain because the building system is flawed, there is no way to undo specific bricks in walls if you make a mistake as far as I can discern and placing even one single brick in the wrong place while laying foundations means that you have to do the whole thing over again. At the moment there is only one map that you can play on and the world editor is disabled. If you do get this game you'll probably end up covering your entire floating island in stockpiles. The game has a lot of pottntial but is held back by some of its own mechanics. The fact that it is based on floating islands looks cool but the game would be much better if it was in a randomly generated non floating world.

If this were on a physical CD, we'd call it a coaster.\n\nI'm a KS backer and purchased this based on the concept and the movies. The game looked great, the art style was cute and the promised finished date was October 2012. It looked like a very cute sandbox building game with your minions running around mining, woodcutting and building a cute fortress to protect your guys with blueprints and such. It was, and is, a great concept. Execution has been a different issue...\n\nHere we are two years later and there's been little progress made and even less communication. While someone like Box may talk on the forums, they simply don't communicate. There is no roadmap which has been requested for the last year. Dev diaries are fluff pieces devoid of any real information. The refactoring process brought no apparent improvements because the promised content releases after it was done have not materialized. In short, the project is a disaster and borders on scammy.\n\nSo what has been delivered? A prototype with awful UI, stupid AI and hasn't had an appreciable update in a year. The survival and multiplayer modes that have been supposedly added don't work. The UI is beyond horrid - even simple tasks don't work well because the UI is so cumbersome. It's like the devs decided to throw out every decent UI convention in the last decade and come up with the most obtuse system they could. You'll spend hours just trying to learn how to issue simple commands to your guys and learning to control the camera. The AI is just plain broken and even the devs admit it. And again, there haven't been any real content updates in the last year either. I can't stress this enough - what has been delivered is so devoid of content it's not a game. It's a prototype demo with horrible UI, horrible AI and by a developer who seems entirely incapable of finishing their product.\n\nAs such, there is no way to recommend this game. Stay far, far away. I would normally say "check back later", but here we are two years after the promised release date and it's still virtually vaporware. At this point I've written this game off as a total loss, but hopefully by reading this you can save your money and buy something that may actually provide some entertainment and value because Castle Story won't.","September 3, 2014","false","0.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

If you wanst to build something that they will actually make, you've got walls. And thats it. Its mechanics are good, with the mining system, and it certainly has potential.

I have yet to find any servers, and I feel this is more a fault of the developers rather than the community with the huge negative feedback they have received.\n- Recently, the tutorial seems to be absent.\n\nQuick list of positives:\n+ The GUI is really beautiful - all so clean cut and accessible, with features within are organized wonderfully.\n+ A great concept, I think, especially for PvP or co-op multiplayer gameplay. Altough I've never seen PvP, or any multiplayer mode for that matter, the idea sounds wonderful.\n+ A great selection of different building pieces, opening a wide range of possible constructs to defend your 'Bricktrons'.\n\nThis game is something I think everyone that came here wanted to badly to love; I denied the numbers of negative reviews when I purchased the game, but honestly I don't believe it was a mistake.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Identityflux/recommended/227860/","Identityflux","Jazz Candy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Identityflux/","138 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI am truly saddened by what happened to this game.\nBefore I begin, allow me to state that I understand the risks of purchasing an Early Access game. I am able to excuse a ♥♥♥♥ load of bugs and issues and I'm able to accept that this is by no means a finished product. But there's a difference between a game in development and an absolute blatant scam.\n\nCastle Story is a game about constructing a base and defending from wave after wave of onslaughting enemy hordes. A fairly basic and enjoyable mechanic that has worked before and is enhanced by a unique artstyle, soundtrack, voxel system and physics engine. To be honest I really did enjoy Castle Story for a few hours until I found out that there's no variety in enemy units, no upgrading my own units and that there's really just not a whole lot to do. You build a castle and that's fine for a few hours, then you wander off and do Sandbox things for a few hours and then you realize that's about it. Again, I understand that it's early access and I shouldn't expect that much in the first place, and to be fair the game does deliver on its initial promises, but sadly it just sort of falls short. But that's not the fault in this game.\n\nThe developers of this game are a team known as "Sauropod Studios" a fitting name considering their contributions all but died out some time ago. Sauropod is the reason the game industry is failing. They are (or were) what I call a "Smash and Grab" Developer, similar to those of FUN Creators the Developers of the attrocity "Guise of the Wolf". They throw out some cool looking cinematics, tell you how great their game is and people fall for it while they get away with the profit. The difference is the idiots behind Guise of the Wolf actually had the balls to call their game complete. With Suaropod, however, these individuals use the "Early Access" visage as an excuse to continuously not release content, to ignore their community and to just not continue development on the game. I've owned this game for nearly a year now and what's the latest and largest update so far? A pause button. That's right, I not only waited a year for it, but that's actually the most game changing update that I can think of in the past year of development.\n\nThis game is a scam. And it really is a sad one at that. Castle Story is the type of game that had potential, and that had the funding for that sort of potential considerring they made well over 1 Million USD on their Kickstarter. But the developers would've rather just had their money and run away with it rather then actually create a game that had a strong foundation. The game is simple, and the first few horus are enjoyable. With just a few updates like making more units and blocks, or adding different enemies into the game, this game could have very easily been a classic. But, no. Suaropod couldn't see that. And they lied, and they cheated, and they scammed thousands of people out of their money and they'll get away with it. If there was ever a game to turn me away from early access games forever, it's this one.\n\nWell played, Suaropod.","July 25, 2014","false","20.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

As usual, you shouldn't expect too much - the game will be glitchy and buggy, and my opinion of the game takes that into account.\n\nCastle Story is basically another sandbox dwarf-fortress-ish game that appears to take a different approach by using much simpler game mechanics.  You don't have to worry about needs such as food and water, but rather just focus on building a functional castle that can defend against attacks.\n\nWhat I like\n\n- It looks cool!  It's got the puffy white clouds, the very simple-looking avatars (bricktrons), the lego-like castle building blocks, etc.,\n- The gameplay is very simple, it has a refined-looking design, something that appeals to me.\n\nWhat I don't like\n\n- Although being early-access, the game is barely playable.  I tried really hard to enjoy the game, but couldn't.  I fully expect to find bugs in a beta, but this title is mostly all looks, the gameplay itself is very bad.\n- There's not much to do in the game - when I say there's not much to do, I mean what you see in those screens is about it.  You can build some stone and wood blocks, and that's about it.\n\nThis game shouldn't be early access - it should've stayed out of Steam until it was much more ready than this.  The vibe I got after playing is that the developers - while they might mean well - are an inexperienced group desperately reaching for what funding they can get.\n\nHere's a good discussion thread for more info.  I came back to it recently to find it locked - which seemed quite unnecessary.  This is another bad sign imo:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/227860/discussions/0/648814844593898025/#p10","January 5, 2014","false","1.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The last one I saw was a pause funtion, the most simple of all things.\n\nThe multiplayer doesn't even connect more than one person, is laggy and completely unplayable. I sit here and looka the creations in the pictures and wonder how in the hell they fabricated those structures when my 'Brickton" gets confused by a log and doesn't move for a good 10 mins.\n\nTo put it in short, I've been considering making something similar seeing as this has gone nowhere. They always defend themselves with the 'refactoring' statement, and while that's fine, if the code is THAT BAD then they had it at a level that is not marketable in the slightest, like selling a car without wheels. The other excuse is the fact that there are only a few of them, only a few highly trained devs working on it. So what? You sold the product and should have the stones to support it. I've been waiting a long time for any hint of a decent update and just have been dissapointed. Give me a year and I could probably produce more.

And prior to my purchase the game had been in pre-release status for I don't know how long, but apparently a decent amount of time. For a game that has so little to offer in terms of complexity it would be expected that the developers would work on cleaning up the code that they have to avoid lag build up from poorly constructed AI pathing loops, intense overlapping light bloom effects, and poor enemy spawning management (massive instant spawn of 1+ incrementing enemies that increase for each wave, each with their own poorly constructed pathing AI in a big mess of how long does it take your processor to figure out which one moves first). The development team seems to focus on cleaning up minor bugs and slowing down the process by adding new members to the team before they've even come close to working out game breaking kinks.\n\nAs a warning by wave 100 or sooner this game will be nearly unplayable (due to FPS) for people without an average or above average computer, even on fastest graphics settings. Avoiding torches and lighting may help with some FPS drop.\n\nGranted the game is fun. Anyone that has no issues with repetitive gameplay and likes the concept of a kind of cross between RTS and Tower Defense games will probably enjoy this. Building a castle or structure that is tactical as you decide how you want to go about surviving increasing waves is pretty rewarding for people who would enjoy that, and the game offers a sandbox mode for players who don't want the interruptions that come with survival.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is good, but it almost feels like the development team doesn't intend to actually finish the game. Like people who run off with scholarship money, this is starting to feel like a scam to half make a game with lots of kinks, slowly update little stuff, and then run off after sales start falling. Not that it is, but this has to be the laziest studio I've ever waited for. It doesn't even have a game icon.\n\n\n\nEdit: RE: Developer comment and update.\n\nI have already, and that doesn't change the length of time that has and still is going into the project. Not to mention that the game is still poorly constructed. I just finished actually playing the update, it was cut short by me not being able to pause. By that I mean I had to save my game to go to the bathroom. Tried to load it and there's a fresh new bug that kills saves. Archers still friendly fire and destroy storage areas, the AI pathing is choppy and inefficient, and it seems like corners were cut by making workers able to move through storage instead of fixing the AI itself. Now I don't know if that was the intention because frankly I enjoy the playability of the change, it does boost player efficiency because the workers don't dogpile anymore. However, for many months and obviously before I bought the game all of the entities seem to suffer from intense short term memory loss and they just stand there day dreaming in a programming loop. This is persisting even after this new update and every update before it.\n\nMy comment was harsh because this legitimately is the longest I've ever waited for a developing team to work out game breaking kinks, and I am going to remain harsh because so far the most noticeable changes have been graphical goodies for the seasons, a sound update, and minor bug fixes. There is nothing to re-evaluate, I'm a programmer too. If this were my project I'd address the major issues before working on redoing the sounds and giving people some holiday textures.\n\nTo not be unfair in this I will say that the changes made the game a much better experience. Being able to store more orange crystal and not have the dogpiling issue is nice. It does free up time. The change to gatherers defaulting to the storage space with the most material already in it is noticeable.\n\nNow I have asked on the forums for some information about when certain issues are going to be fixed or if they are being taken into consideration. I didn't make this or my previous comment without giving a fair chance. I have been previously active on the main forum. I noticed a moderator that has a spider for a profile picture that gives people a hard time that aren't breaking any forum rules, and repetitive game complaints and suggestions that get little to no official response.\n\nFor more information read comments:","June 6, 2014","false","50.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","8"

Using systems similar to Towns, Gnomeria, and Dwarf Fortress, you command your little yellow dudes to build castles, brick by brick, to defend against random monsters as you try to conquire floating islands. It's pretty simplistic but if you enjoy the Dwarf Fortress game type combined with base defense mechanics, this game will scratch an itch. It's still early stages but it has a lot of potential.\n\nIt's rather unfortunate this game has so many negative reviews. It's in Early Access for a reason, the developers needed a lot of help to figure out in which direction the game should go to appeal to a bigger audience. As of the latest patch, the game is much better than it's ever been. I could actually understand most of the negative reviews for the earlier versions but, seriously, the game deserves a second chance.

Too bad my judgement was clouded by that excitement.  The worst part is this sandbox game has serious potential, but with the bugs and frustration from commands not working properly this game is an absolute flop.  Not to mention how virtually no updates have been seen since it came to early access on steam and the only activity from the devs is who is running their sounds or new indie games from "Friends."\n\nMy first few hours of gameplay sucked.

It seemed great. I even went so far as to become a part of the forum and write a couple wiki articles and get to know a lot of people there.\n\nWas it worth it? No.\n\nI was a firm believer in the game, and I still think it has the potential to become something but it hasn't. I kept checking and checking on the game to see if it got better and if the bugs (mostly the ♥♥♥♥ing camera) were fixed. No. Nothing was fixed. No tutorial, not a thing. I wasted my money and my time for something that wasn't accomplished. I had problems with the codes I recieved and it took a very long time to fix that problem that, and honestly, I don't even know if it got fixed because the person I bought the second code for doesn't even want the game anymore.\n\nI understand as a friend of game developers that these things take time. But 1 year and pre-alpha bugs are still not fixed but they're adding in new content? Focus on what is hurting your game. Focus on your community that you promised a great game to; instead of focusing on people that kept popping in and suggesting new content.\n\nA rename to flying island simulator 2014 might suit it well until saur fixes it to the CASTLE STORY kickstarter game it was hyped to be.

It LOOKS great, and it's only early access, so you're sure it's probably going to be great at some point. You've read negative reviews, and ignored them anyway. I did the exact same thing. I wish I had not.\n\nThis game is an awesome concept. It has the potentially be beautiful, fun, and worth the money that I just wasted. But right now, it's hardly even qualified to be a Beta game. It's a mess, and I'm highly discouraged by the rate at which it is being updated. This game is essentially unplayable as-is, as it becomes very boring very quickly.\nAs a game developer myself, I know how hard it is to create a working game, and how annoying it is when the audience does not understand all the work that must be put in to the final product. In this case, though, I feel like progress is practically inching along at the slowest pace possible, and a bug-ridden, unplayable, broken game was released to say 'Don't worry, we're doing something'.\n\nI cannot recommend purchasing this game right now. My advice is to keep an eye on it, because it's an awesome idea and it has so much potential (potential which it had better reach, given the 700k that was donated to it via Kickstarter), but you'll be disappointed if you blow your Steam budget on the current stage of this game (as of 1/2/2014)","January 2, 2014","false","0.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The developers really need to make fixing the horrible UI priority number one! Basically none of the standard UI paradigms used in this type of game are used in Castle Story, and it's impossible to figure out the UI without watching tutorial videos. I actually find Dwarf Fortress much easier to use. It seems like the devs are determined to push context menus and hidden (no UI cues) editing modes as the solution to everything. When all you have is a hammer, all probelms look like nails and all these devs have are context menus, causing them to think that everything can be solved with context menus.

The user interface somehow got considerably more obtuse and unintuitive, and the AI seems worse. I didn't encounter any of the performance issues many other people seem to have, but the game has become more difficult to play, and considering the time elapsed since my last playing, the lack of actual progress on the game is staggering.\n\n*Edit Jan '15*\nThe devs have slowly been releasing the odd patch here and there for a month or two now, though not a lot has changed in terms of major bug fixes or progression of the game mechanics. However, hope has been rekindled for this game's future. Keep your eyes peeled.\n\n---\n\nI cannot in good conscience recommend this game.\n\nI have played it for a considerable amount of time, and buggy as it is, I thoroughly enjoy what content exists so far.

I would be happy to change this to a positive review down the line when the game actually has some substantial content added or some semblance of an attempt at bug fixing.

All developers claim they are "offering" early access as a means to get the community involved in creative aspects of the game. Or for bug testing reasons. The fact of the matter is they are more than likely in a financial bind and have no other means of finishing the game. Thus, they decide to market their unfinished piece of crap under false pretenses. And once they realise that they have milked their target audience already by selling them an unfinished game. Finishing said game would be pointless in terms of financial gain. We see it time and time again. Its probably time we stop buying into ideas.

This review is for the 0.6 Update. Remembering that this game is still in an Early Release state you should expect bugs, glitches, incomplete functions, and less features than a full game. All disclaimers aside I played the game for about an hour tonight and for the first time in several years I finally feel like the game has progressed somewhere. This most recent patch added new gameplay modes and fixed the most gamebreaking bugs that have been around forever (the AI and AI pathing algorithms causing Bricktrons to become stuck doing nothing and unwilling to take any further commands). During the hour of play tonight I ran across no bugs and the longest it took any Bricktron to understand my commands and obey was about 2-3 seconds. Compared to the hours in the past where they would just stand around this is a HUGE improvement. Further, none of them decided to suicide themselves off the side of the island.\n\nIn it's current state I see many further updates will be needed to complete the game, yes, however it's finally at a point where I can start playing it and enjoy the game. I'm headed to bed now but I'm excited about waking up early to continue my save where I left off tonight. That's a first for me on this game.","February 22","true","12.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

But the developers abandoned it at the time. I frequently check back to see the updates for the game because I had high hopes for it. I know see the developers taking the game more seriosly and thought my old negetive review was no longer correct. The game itself is nice and relaxing the only problem was the AI and difficulty to do things, but through the constant new updates and the game finally getting attention from the developers I feel that they have done a pretty good job to fix that problem. I really liked to see the developers getting back to the game and not just leaving it abandoned even though there is not a large community for it, they really stepped up their game and cleaned up their mess. It used to be a game that I had regret buying and it made me sad when I saw it in my library, but now I like seeing it there, Its nice to get on the game a relax and play it when I get burnt on my other games. So when you see the games review as mostly negetive thats old news, the game has changed now and should totally be given a second shot and in my opinion is now  worthy to buy and enjoy.","March 2","true","13.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BundleRiff/recommended/227860/","BundleRiff","BundleRiff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BundleRiff/","141 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI bought this game in February of 2014, and it has come a long, long way since that time. I remember buying a copy, and buying another copy for a friend of mine, and we both were very impressed with the functionality and gameplay straight off the bat. Early on, it was a little rough around the edges, but seeing as the devs are keeping it updated and adding more and more as time goes on, I have no doubt it will keep getting better and better. The multiplayer is pretty cool, fairly functional with a few small bugs, but I'm going to chalk those up to be the fact that my friend was hosting the server in Michigan and I was connecting from Arizona. The bugs I mentioned were buildings popping in and out of existance, Bricktrons popping in and out of existance (both of these item popping into and out of existance bugs reset after a server restart. Nothing ingame was lost.), and crashes occationally when my friend would stop the server.\n\nAs of right now, 05,16,2016, the multiplayer gameplay is a little bland. There's not much to do other than try to make cool castles and watch as bricktrons dig their way into the ground, then eventually seal themselves in their own mines. There is no PVP combat yet with the warriors, but you can still lop arrows at your friend's worker bricktrons when he sends them over to your base to say hello. BUT, the devs Shatojon and Evax livestreamed a new work in progress update teaser with co-op corruptron combat and base building 3 days ago on 05,13,2016. I can't wait until they release it. I will update this review with my thoughts after I have explored the update, but my first impressions from seeing the livestream are very positive. A co-op bricktron combat alongside co-op base building is exactly what I wanted from this game.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with my $20 investment. Some people tend to say that every hour of playtime should considered to be about a dollar, and if you come up short on hours spent playing, then it's a bad investment. I personally don't think that's a very good idea of how you should look at the picture. I see it as this: if the game is fun, then it's a good investment, if the game is bad, it's a bad investment. You'll never know if it's good or bad until you invest. Don't take my opinion as the gospel, nor should you take anyone else's opinion as the gospel, since we all have different opinions. If the game looks fun to you, invest, if you don't want to, don't. Just don't whine and moan when the game isn't perfect even though it says right above the "Add to cart" button that the game isn't perfect and that it is still in early access. Don't ♥♥♥♥ on the developers who are making this game for a living for not completing the game quick enough. They're taking their time to make the game as perfect as they want it to be, updating it and keeping in contact with the customers. Hell, the developer Shatojon even added me and sent me a message asking my opinion on the game. Has any AAA game developer gone out of their way to actually talk one on one with a customer before? Did Ubisoft go out of their way to ask their consumers' opinions on Assassin's Creed Unity after it was released broken? Nope. The only thing Ubisoft's CEO has said was that ALL Steam users and all PC users are pirates, and that he doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ if the game is broken for us.  Would you, the consumer, really rather have a broken game on release and a CEO of the company you're buying the content from telling you to get bent because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, than a game functional in early access and a group of devs who really bust their asses with a game they want people to enjoy?

It's a game with a great idea behind it. I love the thought of building a castle and defending it. The issues I have are how this has been executed and the lack of care by the dev team. I've watched this played and I've played it. It doesn't take more than an hour or two to realize that it has some big flaws that need fixing.\n\nOnce of the biggest issues I've found is that archers, whom you want on towers to get the best shot angle, will randomly decide to run off your tower, killing themselves instantly. This is very frustrating as even the infrantry units will run up a ram to the top of a wall and dive off to their deaths.\n\nThere are lots of other issues like the controls menu not being properly completed, it still shows the control defined names in the code. The graphics options are bad, even for a Unity game, there can be so many more choices on how to change the graphics.\n\nIdeas on how to do basically anything is non-existant. There is a tutorial yes, extremely basic, but it works. It doesn't tell you how to do other tasks like removing blocks, removing tasks or the like.\n\nOverall, this is a great idea, just very very very poorly executed. You might get an hour or two of fun out of it. If you are willing to stick with it, deal with the stupid issues that should be fixed, and make it work, then you can get a few more hours out of it.\n\nBTW, Multiplayer is non-existant, so that's a big lie there.","August 21, 2015","false","2.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

This should be on version 3.0 by now, or at least a sequel in the works. Instead, it is still the same old junk that originally came out.

This could be forgiven if the archer AI at least was capable of selecting targets they could actually fire at, as opposed to trying to shoot through walls, friendlies, etc. And even if those issues are not at play, they will stand idle when the nearest enemy is standing below them at the wall, where, remarkably enough, actually dont attempt to shoot through the wall. Nor will they attempt to shoot at an enemy a little further away. They will simply stand and wait for their inevitable demise. Alas their fire cant even be micromanaged due to lag.\nSo at this point you figure, well what the hell, lets toss in the infantry to kill em. After 4-5 lag-killed attempts to drag a selection box around them, you resort to clicking the select all button. Send them in, by clicking at the enemy. The result natually being that most of them end up atop the wall, rather than go outside and kill the enemy. So, the next time round you click outside the wall and pray to god that their AI routine kicks in before they are slaughtered. They usually stare off a good 5 seconds in the distance before this happens, and a lot can go wrong in this time. And did I mention lag?\n\nIt's a shame, I really liked the concept, but there is just no way to make this game work - these sort of issues should have been filtered out a long long time ago in a 3 year development process as they really dont take long to fix.

It has so much potential but the pace of updates and the buggy gameplay have caused me to lose all interest I originally had when I bought the game a year or two ago. The biggest problem for me is the awful controls. It's incredibly unintuitive and getting the little yellow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to do what you want is really tricky. If you're considering buying this I would recommend holding out until the final release (supposedly early 2016), because in its current state it's really hard to recommend the game.

Buy only if you really believe that the developers vision of the outcome of the game matches your own and you you don't mind waiting for it to be worked out by there relatively small team.\n","May 6","true","33.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

After following the dev's website and waiting for a release I got my hands on it a couple years ago. I waited to post a proper review but after years of waiting I didn't see much improvements to the game. The game is gonna remain in early access for a while with bugs, frame-rate issues, and a completly boring multiplayer experience. Sandbox is probably the best mode for me as survival starts to lag after wave 7. Waves are really short being 4 minutes, I literally had to edit the config file to up that time to 12 minutes so I can at least build my castle. I'm not able to see my archers attack with some strange engine problems causing me to have 10 FPS. It gets insanely hard out of no where, especially with this recent update (10/27) or whichever update included a huge block monster that can 1-shot any warrior, any archer, or anything in it's way. The only way to win the game is to literally make archers. Warriors get 1-shotted. I understand this game is in early access but nothing has really improved since then. Expect updates to come every month being small changes to the GUIs and monsters, and probably some new blocks.","October 31, 2015","false","24.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

There is a great and fun concept behind "Castle Story", but it seems like it's never gonna go anywhere. Weeks upon weeks will pass by with minimal progress, if there is any. Since I've purchased this game, there have been no fundamental improvements.

When I got the alpha for this game, I thought I saw something that could be great. And for a while I was ok with the small gitchs, and annoying little bugs in the game.\n\nYOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. The devs will treat you like crap, and blame the community for asking too many questions, the game has been stagnant for over a year. The forums have started seeing posts deleted, and users are getting banned for giving out useful information, and asking real questions respectfully.\n\n-2015 review-\n\nUnfortunately, this game seems to be spinning out of control. The devs have banned anyone asking clear, concise questions regarding the progress. The game was actually more playable two years ago than it is now. They spent a great deal of time refactoring the game, telling us that once this was done, we would start seeing content updates, and real progress. Then, when they claimed the refactoring was done... nothing.. Eventually they abandoned the 'roadmap' and progress lists. They do have a 'bleeding edge' which was being updated fairly frequently for a time, but that too has stopped. Now we have an unplayable game. Instead of fixing the game they had with correct AI, useable UI, Multiplayer, and map editing, they began adding a slew of new 'features', almost none of which actually work.\nThe game was a great concept. It's simplicity was one of its greatest draws. Now it is an incoherent mess.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe devs constantly delete threads or posts with any negative criticism and the development pace is still ridiculous, their shady behaviours (vote manipulation, shills, bans, etc.) haven't stopped.","November 7, 2014","false","49.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Been waiting for 6 months for something solid to drop. Nada. The devs are on a huge break living off the crowdfunding and early access money. Im beginning to wonder if they are ever going to finish. Terrible UI, terrible AI, crap for building blocks, terrible management system. WTF. seriously. It had so much promise when i started last year 2013, now.... its just pathetic. So tired of waiting and checking for something new to come out, and i finally had to drop a bad review to them\n\nEdit: JAN2015\n\nOk so the devs have started to gain some steam, as in they are starting to push content again. Finally, this isnt to say they havent been working because its obvious if you go to their sauropod site that many dev blogs have been released, however.... i am a netsec engineer so i feel like i have alittle bit of insight (not tons) into what the major problem has been, the original system for the game was too clunky and not stream-line so when they needed to add content it took way too much effort to put it in, so they completely scrapped the old and revamped with a better plug n play system so that it didnt take a ton of time to keep introducing new content. Great news right? Well, kinda sorta yeah maybe.   I was so sick of waiting for content for these guys i actually pushed checking on Castle Story to once every 3 months.   WTF.\n\nIt looks like the devs are still working but until this game has more to offer that what was originally produced 18 months ago im not giving a reccommendation. I honestly dont care about what problems theyve overcome, when you load the game its still the same crappy 2 survival maps and who wants to just create castles that just sit there begging for the ramparts to be tested but never do?\n\nSo much promise in a game, just have to wait an see if they will ever deliver.\n\nJAN2016....\n\nLast update was Nov.2015.... This game had so much promise.... its dead. Just like the crappy studio that thought it would make its customers happy by uploading content on youtube of the staff playing another game that they arent involved with.. instead of finishing that damn game they started.

I wouldn't say it's worth buying yet though.\n\nUpdate Pros:\n- Things feel a little bit more smooth.  The AI didn't seem as bad as when I previously played.\n- The explainations and ingame notfications are getting better.\n- Seems to be less lag with some speed improvements overall.\n\nCons:\n- Islands are still too small.\n- AI needs work still.  Seems to be 1 out of 5 times you interact with a Brickton they will stop responding entirely. This leads to a bit of an issue considering some of your Bricktons are archers/warriors. I've lost my base a few times due to this bug.\n- Saving is hit or miss.  Sometimes saved games work perfectly... most times Bricktons go missing or it crashes on load.\n- Clicking on workers has become challenging. It isn't as nice to right click and drag to select multiple workers now.\n\nAll statements in previous review still apply.\n\n----\n6/28/2014\n\nI've had this game for quite a few months now and I'm still excited about what it could become.\n\nWith that said...  the game isn't close to being finished and there are quite a few baffling design decisions that have been made.\n\n- Why islands?\nThe small terrain causes incredible frustration while trying to do the most basic things. The islands themselves aren't necessarily the problem but it's how the game can't handle them. The AI is incredibly buggy and stops responding or gets confused on the narrow strips of land. Also, the majority of trees harvested end up flying off the map.\n\n- Additional Content\nWhy continue to add other content (multi-player?!? etc) on top of a not-solid base game?\n\nPlease don't continue to build ontop of a game that needs some serious overhauls in level design, AI design, general gameplay, and in-game priorities.\n\nWith all that being said, I hope they turn it around and figure it out.

Granted, some new maps and features have been added, like Iron, but now your brisktrons will randomly path themselves off the map, committing suicide in the name of hauling lumber. I've also encounterd an issue where the game freezes for seceral seconds, and then all of your bricktrons are all stuck falling, unable to move or do anything else, leabing you no ther option than to quit and star over, or reload from a save file. :END EDIT\n\n\nI purchased this game on EA about 6 months ago after seeing several videos of gameplay. It looked promising. I was excited for a more realistic base builder so to speak. I didnt expect the game to be too fleshed out yet, since that's what early access is. Having played several hours, and feeling like the game had great potential, I put the game down to come back after the devs had ahd a few months to work on it.\n\nQueue last week. I booted up the game, started a new game, and began building the exact same castle on the exact same map I had before. As the first wave of baddies approached, I noticed that they ran around willy-nilly, and just seemed to punch at anything. not particularly impressed, I continued.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, it became evident that some work had been done to the AI engine since last I played. Except it seems that the work had been to delete half the brains of all the entities in the game. The workers would regularly all attempt to place the same block, take the same narrow path when there were a multitude of options, and regularly block each other in to the point where 5 of them were all stuck in one spot, all trying to get past each other, but to no avail. I even noticed the knights swinging their swords the WRONG WAY when in combat.

While there is a ton of potential, and I'm really looking forward to what the game COULD be, right now it's sorely lacking in quite a few areas.\n\nThe first, and by far the biggest and worst, area is the controls. Less than half of the controls actually feel streamlined and as if they should work. All the rest are clunky, hard to remember, and completely out of left field. I mean, hold space and drag your middle mous click to move your camera? What? And the controls can't be changed individually according to task. You can just change what keystrokes/clicks the game recognizes. So, for example, you can't change the "turn blueprint" key, oh no. You have to change right click entirely, which messes with about 6 other keybinds at the same time. So, yeah, the ENTIRE control scheme needs reworked to something a human would use, not an alien.\n\nNext are your citizens, or "bricktons". Now, I know, there are probably a few bugs still, but it's really sad how bad it is right now. It takes around 5 seconds for them to realize you gave them an order, their pathing is atrocious because as soon as they find a path that works, they don't change it again, even if you make a shorter one, unless you force them to. They block each others' movement, forcing you to babysit them just in case they trap each other in somewhere doing the whole "East Going Zax, West Going Zax" routine. And sometimes they just refuse to listen at all when you tell them to do things, instead opting to stand about 3 times away from the job and staring. So they need to be able to occupy the same space, and the AI needs reworked big time.\n\nThen there's the digging. I hate the way the quarry works, because you can't make a custom size, only a custom depth, which leaves the land looking terrible with deep ♥♥♥ holes pock-marking your areas instead of one nice, large hole that encompasses all you needed to mine. TUNNELING IS THE WORST AND MOST TEDIOUS THING I HAVE EVER DONE IN A GAME, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW IT GOT SO BAD. You literally have to tunnel horizontally ONE BLOCK at a time, going back to reassign the job every time they finish it, having to reassign the workers, too, because you can't have multiple tunnel jobs on one order. So, basically, make the whole digging scene more customizable, and have it not be the single most tedious task you will ever do. Also, randomized maps wouldn't hurt. I don't like playing with the same map over and over.\n\nAnd as for the building? Other than the keybind madness that the alien that designed this game came up with, it's good. I enjoy the customizability and the different options and stuff that are in the game. That being said, though, it could do with some fine tuning, such as some keybinds to move your blueprint one space at a time, that way the horrific mouse detection isn't so infuriating.\n\nLastly, there's the UI. It's sweet, simple, to the point. A little boring, but good. One thing I would definitely change, though, is make it so you can toggle the task bar to stay open by just clicking the little star. Just one of those picky little things.\n\nNow, for the moment of truth. Despite the scores of flaws I see so far, the game has a ton of potential. It just needs some tender loving care from the devs and the community to bring it up from the depths of hell. So do I recommend this game. No. Not at all. At least, not YET. Because I don't want anyone's vision of this game tainted by the current build. But eventually, when it gets worked on some more? By all means, yes. Buy it. I did have some fun with it, after all.","June 27, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Its just not all what you could hope for. Multiplayer is so broken at this point its a miracle anyone has been able to use it and while many people complain about it so far they have done one small fix that to me made no difference at all.Instead they seem to devote most their time adding christmas and halloween season art. Patches are few and far between you would swear they have taken money and done a runner.\nSandbox mode is more or less pointless with no enemies, and last time I played challenge mode and created a catapult it crashed the game because it was glitchy.\nGames like this that get left at 80% done are one reason I have become very skeptical about buying Alpha's.

Granted, some new maps and features have been added, like Iron, but now your brisktrons will randomly path themselves off the map, committing suicide in the name of hauling lumber. I've also encounterd an issue where the game freezes for seceral seconds, and then all of your bricktrons are all stuck falling, unable to move or do anything else, leabing you no ther option than to quit and star over, or reload from a save file. :END EDIT\n\n\nI purchased this game on EA about 6 months ago after seeing several videos of gameplay. It looked promising. I was excited for a more realistic base builder so to speak. I didnt expect the game to be too fleshed out yet, since that's what early access is. Having played several hours, and feeling like the game had great potential, I put the game down to come back after the devs had ahd a few months to work on it.\n\nQueue last week. I booted up the game, started a new game, and began building the exact same castle on the exact same map I had before. As the first wave of baddies approached, I noticed that they ran around willy-nilly, and just seemed to punch at anything. not particularly impressed, I continued.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, it became evident that some work had been done to the AI engine since last I played. Except it seems that the work had been to delete half the brains of all the entities in the game. The workers would regularly all attempt to place the same block, take the same narrow path when there were a multitude of options, and regularly block each other in to the point where 5 of them were all stuck in one spot, all trying to get past each other, but to no avail. I even noticed the knights swinging their swords the WRONG WAY when in combat. I real flop if you ask me.\n\nAll in all, the game looks promising, but it appears that the dev studio is working by the old creedence "One step forward, two steps back"","July 13, 2014","false","34.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Did the people that wrote the seed leave/die, or is Sauropod simply out of their depth in taking on this sizable AI feat?  There's been no appreciable improvement in minion behavior-- which is crucial to this game -- for a year.  Even things that seem like obvious bug squashes loom.

So many bugs, and they keep adding up every update. Updates are supposed to fix things, not make them worst. I bought this around August 2012, not even joking when I say the two biggest things added since then where a new UI and a very silly game mode. They have their money, and are just doing small stuff to try to make it look like they are actually doing something. Before you buy this crap really do your research. And on top of that their forum moderators are very biased and try to "silence" people whenever they can, especially the one called Box. So before you even think of buying this google the kickstarter page and see how much progress they have done in all of this time, then go to their youtube channel and watch that one epic trailer they made and compare that to actual gameplay now, its not nearly as epic. There are better games out there you can spend your money on, dont waste your time on this travesty. And for you "this is early access" people, this was out way before Steams early access. Them adding it to Steam was just a shameless money grab to try to get more money, which Im still curious where it has gone to. I cant see the results game wise.","December 23, 2013","false","5.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minera/recommended/227860/","minera","Gravelfoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minera/","444 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI really want to like this game, but the most important thing standing in my way is the interface.\n\nI don't fancy playing in creative, so my view is from the survival aspect. In survival you have to quickly start building a castle and defend it against wave after wave of ever-increasing numbers of attackers. The key word here is quickly.\n\nThere is no pause, so you cannot stop and plan your castle out and then set your people to work, so you are instantly stressed. This could be fine if the interface otherwise supported speedy planning and building, but it does not.\n\nThe game seems very much built for consoles (or at least using a controller) because it just about only uses the mouse totally disregarding the keyboard for anything but camera navigation. In a game with so many things to build, getting even the simplest things made is a pain.\n\nIn order to build anything you have to first click the right mouse button and hold it for about 1 second. Then choose build mode. Then right click and hold for about a second again to get a radial menu where you then select the category of things you want to build and then you can finally select the specific item you want. So even building the simplest little storage box quickly takes 3-4 seconds. If you then want to switch items you want to build, you have to again hold the mouse and go through the waiting once more. In a game where you have 10 minutes before the first wave of attackers and ever less time before the next attacks spending 3-4 seconds per item you want to place into the world will make you frustrated beyond compare.\n\nAgain, I love the style and the idea, but the interface just kills it.\n\nIt seems like the designers like a sleek no on-screen menu interface so much they are willing to sacrifice a lot to get it. I urge them to reconsider seeing as any amount of waiting for menus in a no-pause survival game is infuriating and stressfull and is bad game design. Please, dear designers, consider adding a toolbar at the bottom and more use of the keyboard so the all the waiting for menus goes away, or at least add a pause function. A pause function would not remove the irritating wait time, but it would remove the infuriating stressfulness.","October 28, 2015","false","52.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Perfect to practice!!\n-Survival mode: try to survive as long as possible to the enemies waves. You'll have to smartly build your castle and defend it with your archers, knights, catapults and traps. (dificulties: easy, normal, hard)\n-Conquest mode: build multiple structure and try to expand your kingdom to capture enemie's base without being attacked in your main castle.

When i click play, 75% of the time nothing shows up yet it says im playing it. this has happens way too often.\nAlso, it crashes. It crashes a lot. So i need to save my game every five minutes so i dont lose progress when it crashes. But, after about four crashes in one setting, it gets better, but i still save a lot to be safe.\nLastly, the A.I is almost completely broken. At first they work well for about four waves besides when half of the bricktrons stand in place when i call them back to the castle when the corrupted are coming. After about wave four, the builders dont build, and when i click on them to move somewhere they stand still. Even the corrupted are buggy. half of the time, they go straight past the castle and stand on the edge of the island and i need to send my warriors after them to get the loud, but good, music to stop. And half the time the warriors just stand in place as thcorrupted raid my castle and kill all of my bricktrons.\nOk, that was a lot of hate. I do like this game when it works, but dont think you should buy it for the $20.00 price until its fixed.

These guys sold a lot of copies of an exercise turned tech demo.  If I were in their boots, I'd be done.  Why make a game when you cut your losses and run... and by losses, I mean a whole lot of cash up front with absolutely zero accountability to finish the game.\n\nYes, early access means it's not done... and that's the problem with early access; It never has to be done to be sold. NEVER!\n\nI wish I was back in school where I would make little "game" concepts.  A few exercised examples and you pass.  Never had to worry about making it a full functioning game... that would have taken the entire semester if not longer to finish. ...but if I polished it just enough to put on kickstarter... cha-ching!

Your bricktrons have made tremendous progress in their pathfinding - they now DO manage to go where you ask them. They might still be a bit... slow to accomplish what you order them to do, but eventually, they will succeed - if what you asked them is possible, of course, and you might need a few try & retry to understand their particular logic. But still, as a sandbox game, it manages to realize a good part of what it was supposed to realize - wich is good.\n\n"So why is your review still negative?", might you ask. Well, the answer is quite simple: right now, the game still isn't fun.\n\nFirst of all, the bricktrons are slow, and building anything takes a HUGE amount of time. The IA isn't exactly helping about that, and it is a shame that the devs still haven't thought about the first button you would think of in this game - a button to fast forward, that is.\n\nSecond, there are little options in the matter of building. A few stone bricks, a few woodlogs (very complicated to use, by the way), you should be building very little variations of the same model of towers and walls pretty quickly. After two or three hours, the game is already awfully repetitive.\n\nThat's were the "invasion" mode might get fun: testing the resistance of your citadel by repelling infinite waves of ennemies. Well, problem is: too few ennemies variations, too few units, and most of all, the IA is a mess and cannot hope to compete with any RTS' AI. Your archers might actually be more dangerous for you own troops, and the knights never do anything right; and of course, you have no real control about the attitude they should use. So, for now, the strategy is rather plain: build a tall tower, put all your achers on top of it, rince, repeat. And pray that the ennemies don't get at the base of the tower, for your bricktrons are too dumb to lean and shoot downward. And, to make matter worse, repairing any damaged structure is a real pain in the back, as your bricktron can't seem to fix anything beyond their reach, their reach being something around two yards high. Of course, that's precisely the height where the ennemies like to dig (sigh).\n\nSo it appears that I still was awfully optimistic when I told people to wait for two or three years: right now, I do believe that Castle Story will finally be a fun and fully working game around the year 2020.\n\n*** *** *** ***\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThis looks like a hit. This smells like a hit. Too bad, for months now it's been nothing but a buggy, twice-in-a-year-updated wreck of a game. Your builders are stupid, they can't do anything right. Nothing of what you see in the trailers is actually doable right now. So, my two cents: just forget about this game for the next two or three years, maybe it' ll become something that you might actually call "a game". Right now it's an expensive prank.","March 18, 2014","false","22.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not THAT much has changed, but there are noticeable differences. I abandoned this due to the AI at the time, but now the AI is actually competent and the game is playable now. The game might be slow paced as they have to mine rocks in order to build bricks, but it is quite fun building. There is quite a variety of blocks to choose from, from normal 2x1 to rounded ones and archways. Stairs too. 3 years ago the edit mode (mode to place blocks) was extremely difficult to use and it just wasnt fun to build. But now they've refined it and it is quick and easy to select and place blocks. No snapping in the wrong places anymore. There also are other modes where you get attacked by rock monsters and you have to defend yourself by placing down archers and catapults, which is fun. I mostly like sandbox though. There also is multiplayer, but i havent tried it yet. But from what i've heard, multiplayer is stable. So the end verdict? This game might not be perfect, but it sure is shaping up.\n\n7.8-10","May 16","true","8.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On that basis alone I feel that while this game has not progressed to a level of gameplay I feel it could attain I have gotten enough hours of entertainment out of it to make it worth it for me.

Seeing as this is an Early Access title, I was more than willing to endure the countless AI bugs that left my Bricktrons doing absolutely nothing and repeatedly ignoring my commands. I was determined to build and epic, sprawling citadel to defend against the oncoming waves of enemies. Sadly, it wasn't long before defending against the repetetive waves of identical, easily dispatched foes lost its charm. I could not fault Castle Story for its lack of content, it IS and Early Access game. So, I waited. A check of their website said they were "re-factoring" their code. This was indeed a lengthy process and five or so months later, they announced its completion and that regular updates would soon resume. I held out faith that after the "re-factoring" of their code, updates would come much more quickly. After all, this was what the developers told us. However, here we are now, several months later and they've wasted time and money to create a "Pause" feature and some Halloween content. The addition of Halloween content to this game was just adding insult to injury. I find it incredibly difficult to believe that after months and months of waiting, Suaropod has failed to create anything of substance which could be implemented, even it were in a buggy state.\n\nAbandon hope all ye who enter.

Tried it again today hoping to see that it had changed because I was always keen to see where this game would go, but alas. I was stuck in the same rut as previously. I went and wrote a review explaining the faults I saw and decided I'd be back in a few more months to see what has changed.\nWell, one of the Devs went saw the review, added me and offered to help, he politely explained step by step what I had missed and now finally I am able to play!\n\nThe tools (once you've figured them out) are simple and the options limitless as to what you can build.\nReally stoked to have been helped by the Devs and its made all the difference with my attitude towards the game, go sell some of your unused AWP skins and pick this game up, these fat little yellow men are way cuter than your 'worm god stat track' AWP anyway.","May 18","true","4.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Very poor execution.\n\nThe UI tries to be minimalistic and fresh, but comes off as clunky and unintuitive. Spending most of my time trying to remember how to get it to do what I want is usually a bad sign. Anything you want to do is buried below at least two or three levels of menus. That's a big no-no for anyone who knows how to do a UI.\n\nThe performance for a game like this minimal really shouldn't be bad, but it bogs down after only a few minutes. That makes it even more difficult to play.\n\nEven worse, the AI is frustratingly dumb. In a game like this, I would've fixed and polished that first, even if the UI wasn't ready. The little workers spend way too much time in a stupor when time is often of the essence. When they do work, it's often not very efficient. They can build themselves and others into a corner. Stockpiles can fill up with worthless junk while the vaulables sit untouched nearby. Often they fill up the nearest stockpile instead of the most full, giving you a bunch of half-full and unusable piles. One missed or misplaced block (or even one closed door) can render an entire castle useless.\n\nJust needs way more polish and actual listening to feedback. With the updates coming every few months and not really seeming to do much, I wouldn't hold out much hope.

Just listing the flaws would take several pages.\nBut here are some:\n- Worst interface ever. The interface is SO bad that it kinda remind of old Dos games. It is like the designers have never played a game in their life. For example, it takes 6 clicks to load a game.\n- Nonexistent AI. Workers will cross your city to pick up a material, while there was the same material right where he was.\n- Workers freeze regularly. It often takes up to 12 seconds for a worker to start executing an order.\n- I think it's the first time I turn my speakers off in a game. Not only is the music and FX bad, but the Options don't work (as most of the things in the game) so even set at 0% the music still plays.\n- Graphics are bad.\n- TONS of bugs.\n\nHowever, the worst thing is that the game has absolutely nothing good or slightly original to it. It's basically Warcraft I horribly executed by a talentless team.\n","February 6, 2015","false","0.0"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","15","28","2","1"

I was one of the 27,060 Kickstarter backers and had high hopes. These guys basically made $702,516 to make a cool promo video.  Now they just blog about playing other games and going to gaming conventions.  I hope that another developer takes some of the cool ideas these guys came up with and actually make a playable game.\n\nSauropod Studio came up with one of the coolest ideas for a game that I have ever seen.  It’s kind of a cross between building with Legos , Minecraft,  and an RTS game like Age of Empires.   This game was funded on Kickstarter in the summer of 2012 which is about a year and a half ago from when I’m posting this review.  The game is fun to play, but can actually be annoying and stressful.  You have to keep in mind that this is a prerelease so there is no guarantee that it will even run on your computer at all.  That being said here are some of the issues that you will run into if you end up purchasing version 0.1.2.20dc. You have to save the game all the time just in case something breaks and you need to revert to the previous save.  The pace of doing anything is extremely slow.  It has a lot of quarks that make everything difficult unless you want to spend the time to figure out workarounds for the bugs.  E.g. you have to Shift-Right Click to move the workers all the time so that they drop whatever they’re doing and do what you are trying to make them do. You have to Right Click on Barrels and add the types of materials they can take otherwise the workers stop mining. The little bricktron workers get stuck anytime anything gets in the way because the AI and path finding doesn’t work yet.  The Camera, UI, and the controls are also just really unintuitive and not user friendly.  I really wish the developers would listen to the fans and focus on making the sandbox fun and playable for everyone without spending development time on trying to implement new content and new features.  There is also no development time-line or expected finish date so it could be years before this is a full game.","January 16, 2014","false","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The idea was simple: I liked the game, and wanted to see it improve. The problem came when no improvements were made.\n\nIn two years they've fixed one or two major bugs, optimized the engine slightly, added the ability to save - but that's the extent of it. With the money they've collected, and the amount of people working on the game, this result (or lack thereof) is disasterous.\n\nThis kind of slow, $#@%ty work might be acceptable in the public sector, but in the private sector there's accountability, and there's backlash when you take people's money and don't make good on your end of the deal.

The very nature of kickstarter is like most other investments, where the backers are absorbing all the risk on a promise of some sort of return, be it financial or in this case, a game. Of the various things I've backed on Kickstarter, this is the only one I truly regret.\n\nWhy?\n\nAnything that I say has already been said in other reviews. The progress in development has been incredibly, painfully slow. Games that were pitched/came out after Castle Story have rapidly over taken it in every way. Commonly cited examples are Space Engineers and Prison Architect.\n\nEven if you could objectively state that development progress isn't slow, consumer psychology is a powerful thing. Why are goods sold for £0.99 instead of £1.00? We perceive it to be far cheaper, when the reality isn't such. If people believe development progress to be slow, then it's slow unless you definitively prove otherwise.\n\nSo if I agree with the other reviews, why am I coming out of the woodwork?\n\nIt's the antagonistic nature with which this studio engages with the player base. There will always be people who are unhappy, it's the very nature of exchanging money for goods/services. However, beneath all the anger and poorly chosen words are legitimate concerns and questions that go unanswered, or worse still, answered with equal levels of vitriol and abrasion. Think of the silent observers, like I used to be, quietly asking the same questions? Some of the exchanges between the community and the developers of this game are legitimately scary. Reading the castle story subreddit was an eye opener.\n\nIn conclusion, it wasn't a mistake to back this game originally. With the information I had and the strength of their pitch, I was happy to invest and I would do it again. However with all the information available to all of us today, my opinion is that investing would be a mistake. All I can hope is that it would stop them treating the people that invested in their ideas, which by extension means investing in them as people and their future, with such contempt.","August 10, 2014","false","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At this point the core game should be up and working, with a few minor bugs here and there. (i.e. No major game breaking bugs.)\n\nFirstly, I was constantly fighting with the pathfinding/AI of the bricktons (Workers).\nHalf the time they would either get clogged, run on the spot, refuse to be assigned to an objective, become unselectable, sometimes wait 5-10+ secconds to figure out a simple path from A to B, take the longest and most inefficient route and in general; they do not do what I want when I want it. Almost NEVER.\n\nYou have the choice between two combat units: Archer (Ranged) and Soldier (Melee)\nThe Soldier being useless, as 99% of the time will run past the enemy he's chasing.\nSo you have to basically rely on archers. Except they're prone to shooting each other in the back, and trying to shoot through your resource stashes, destroying them with a single arrow.\nThere are also catapaults, Which i couldn't figure out how to work (Couldn't seem to assign any tasks to them or drop stuff on them)\n\nThe level design looks cool, but functionally is an absolute pain to deal with.\nI lost countless resources (Trees and stone) into the abyss thanks to them (especially the trees) being next to the edge and 95% of the time, the physics would tip towards the edge instead of inwards. (And you have no control over how they fall.)\n\nThere is also no variety in the enemy's you face. Only the one zerg rush type.\n\nThe save system is also buggy, I saved my first game (After about 1-2 hours of play) and then immedietly reloaded it. (There was a builder looping a falling sound, who was stuck in a mine.) It wouldn't load, so I lost that save.\n\nIf the other reviews are anything to go by (And the release date of Sept 2013) It doesn't seem like any of these problems will be fixed anytime soon. There have been patches recently, but there are still an absolutly massive number of issues.\n\nThis is interesting concept, one that I liked the look of, but has been very poorly executed. A majority of it seems to be implemented with Unity's stock-standard features, And it suffers for it.\n\nI wouldn't buy it again.\n\nTL;DR: Cute but terribly broken game with the outlook of few to no useful updates in the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whofarted/recommended/227860/","whofarted","Commander Xillian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whofarted/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCastle Story is in a sentence, Minecraft Meets Stronghold. It is a game that gives you the tools and asks you "What Now?" Unfortunately for Castle Story, the answer is not as exciting as it would like.\n\nIn Castle Story, you play Omnipotent Spot On The Ground, that for some reason needs to... Change it's elevation with startling frequency. Intended as a feature, perhaps to allow in-depth inspection of your creations, instead it becomes a hindrence as you will have to weave up and down to bypass your own defenses. Maybe this was meant to be a callback to the success of From Dust, with its focus on a central point being the source of your attention AND power? This honestly seems to be moot point given the Generations of development in RTS games for computers. It's ironically a pioneer going to Europe in hopes of finding an exploitable Wilderness, only to discover that he was a little late to the party.\n\nDon't let the hindrance of the Camera dissuade you, though, for there's a lot more about Castle Story that has both potential to become truly exciting, and things you should weigh should you decide to buy this game. Chief, it is, would be resources. In any RTS, resource management is a major focus on a successful game. Failure to manage and gather funds appropriately will lead to defeat and worse, being called a Scrub. Castle Story succeeds in making resources fairly simple, with Wood and Rock being the bread and butter, and an elusive "Spirit" energy, being the third factor. You would expect that with such a basic, simple divide akin to Warcraft, this would mean a more streamlined time gathering resources to focus on the more important aspects, such as fielding an army or constructing infrastructure. This is sadly not the case due to the method of storing resources in preparation to building, which in itself hold similarities to an older and more well-known game, Stronghold.\n\nConstructing Stockpile pallets allows you to hold your resources and, in the case of Rocks, transmute fistful’s of gravel into Granite slabs. Unfortunately, you’re not only capped to four of a resource to a pallet, you’re also restricted to a single resource per pallet, meaning that if a single log is on a pallet, that pallet cannot store stone until such a time as no more Logs are present. This is equally true to Stone, which unfortunately has the ramification that you cannot place gathered stone on Pallets that have even a single slab present on them. The obvious solution, to create an abundance of Stockpiles to allow one to create a more capable industry, is completely shot due to the inability to access Stockpiles if there’s an obstruction that would result in no path, even if all surrounding Stockpiles are clear of resources, they will still count as blocking one of your little industrious teletubbies from accessing the resources on the interior. The other option, to create a line of pallets that runs on, is completely impractical due to both time constraints and build space.\n\nIn the sandbox mode, you are given a single map which is, in theory, a great canvas on which to explore your creativity. This is not the case. Restricted by both an overgrowth of cumbersome trees that require cutting down and your own limited storage abilities, you are given a shallow pool of potential build sites, that further restrict you by being pods on a massive floating island. While theoretically allowing you to pick a topography to build to, this sadly only gets in the way due to excess wasted space on “Sky”, which (thankfully?) will simply consume Logs from felled trees as they fall if they reside too close to the edge. Almost as if to acknowledge this there exist many cut-off Islands that temptingly sing “Build to me”, yet any will to do so is lost upon the aforementioned hiccups regarding tedious camera movement, troubles with managing resource allocation, and the actual gathering of the resources.\n\nWhile I’ve mentioned that you “Transmute” sacks of Gravel into full-blown slabs, it is actually closer to the gathering of an exact number of Rocks, that when combined will explode into exactly four slabs. While this isn’t an issue by any extension save to those obsessed with immersion (To them, I recommend Stronghold, not this) it is an issue when it will cause your entire workforce to immediately slam to a halt without warning if every pallet has one resource on it, and you lack the space to set up a new rock bin to toss gravelstuff into. If this happens, your Teletubbies will simply stop whatever they were doing, upon completing the task sufficiently to qualify as “Far enough”, and stand at attention, sometimes even while bent over with a log held behind their backs or a massive slab of Granite! While I cringe at the suffering they must experience in such a display of discipline, I find it equally aggravating that in such a slow-paced, Casual build-sim, that I must micromanage pallets to ensure the optimal spread of specific resources, when that worker could just as easily be picking away for Gravel, slapping up slabs into walls, or cutting down trees and sending their constituent logs tumbling down into the cloudy abyss, simply to ensure I can gather the raw components to allow me to build with something resembling a timely manner.\n\nFinally, and what truly saddens me, is that after you build your castle… Your Teletubbies don’t require feeding, don’t need iron for swords, or labor to manufacture arrows. You simply arm your little yellow Flubbers, man the parapets, and stare out at the unending Golem horde with something resembling annoyance. Your castle will be bare, sure it will have walls and towers, but it won’t have a dungeon, it won’t have a mill, or a well, or a Keep, or honestly anything to make it feel like it’s lived in. You might have your Blue-Crystal-Of-Yellow-Dude-Generation situated safely at the heart of your stronghold, but not due to any significant story-reason, or any interesting design, but due to practicality. And there-in lies the single largest issue that absolutely must be resolved with Castle Story:\n\nA good story isn’t nearly this practical.\n\nFor this story to be one worth retelling, it is my humble opinion for a few additions to make this game more appealing for both short-term and long-term enjoyment. The inclusion of some form of background to the meanings of the events that happen in the game, giving you an investment in your little yellow dorks. Flavor and effect-creating buildings would also be a very nice touch, such as being able to designate a room or structure as a “Blacksmith” or “Grannery”, or to be able to increase your Archers by having the right doo-dads present to denote that the structure attached to them is a “Fletcher”. To be honest, simply being able to place a Flag would add many things to the game even from such a simple feature, as it would turn a gray-and-brown structure, occasionally lit up by torches and Braziers, to something that feels owned, maybe with a splash of blue, red, green or yellow in the odd corner or atop every other Turret. What’s more, potentially adding the need to house your little yellow buddies might create a more populated feeling to a castle, prompting a more protective affection for both the structure itself and those who would call it home.\n\nCastle Story is chock-full of potential, so much so I am almost afraid to dissuade purchase, however in its current iteration, it has far too many hindrances and not enough realized to make this game a valid purchase. If the game should evolve past some of these issues, such as macro resource storage and an annoying camera, and implement more features to make the castle more complex and alive, then it will easily come to the fore of RTS and Sim games.\n\nI do not recommend buying Castle Story, but I caution against forgetting about it either. There is much potential in this game to be bright.","June 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Early Access is no excuse.  The interface is horrible, the AI for the bricktrons is atrocious.

The worst part was they would just straight up stop and do nothing, when this happens you have to try and figure out what part of your structure they don't like and fix it.

A couple months ago I rediscovered Castle Story and had a blast with the new features like Conquest Mode.\n\nWhile playing the game I didn't really encounter any bugs or glitches with the game.\n\nPros:\n-Allows Creativity\n-Interesting setting (on floating islands in a sort of isolated place)\n-Different features allow for more types of play style.\n-Challenging yet exciting\n\nCons (some might just be my computers fault):\n-while building castles I find it difficult to build or fix things on the inside of the structure\n-when I have been playing for a bit and the waves in Invasion Mode start to get more difficult I find that I need more        Bricktrons, but my gameplay gets a bit choppy when I get to around 7-8 Bricktrons. When I get to 10 or more Bricktrons my computer just can't handle it and will either crach or become very difficult to play.\n-when I put my archers up on the walls they will do fine unless I choose to fight with my swordsmen too. Then I have to micro-manage them to make sure they don't hit friendly troops.\n\nOverall: Castle Story is a good game and is worth the money. If I had to give it a rating it would be 8/10 (my rating will probably be higher when the game has been completed) still though if you have the creativity and a computer that can run the game well, then for you it could be way better than you might think.\n\n\n\nAs a little note for the end of my review I would like to be the selfish player who puts out a few ideas that I have no right to demand for but would still like to see.    :)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) It would interesting to see a way to play as the Corruptrons either in singleplayer or multiplayer.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) A way to save creations would save a lot of time as well as giving the players a way to hurry past the parts of the game  he/she may find tedious.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) In Sandbox mode it is super fun to just go nuts and build a bunch of stuff but it would be interesting to see how such creations would fair in Invasion Mode, but it can be boring to have to rebuild them block by block (especially if they are large creations). So a way to put Corruptrons in Sandbox Mode would be fun and allow players to test their creations before starting an Invasion Mode playthrough.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) It would be fun to be able to rename the Bricktrons to names that are more personal or funny.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThats my thoughts on Castle Story. I look forward to seeing how the game developes.\nI hope this review has been helpful.

The only thing bad things I have to say are the absurd amount of resources it takes to spawn in new guys compared to how long it takes to get blue crystals. And I'm assured that it could be just me, but I can only play this game for about 20 minutes at a time. I get relatively bored of it fast. But I do think the gameplay and challenge are interesting, but I also enjoy the sandbox factor.

The bricktrons are like your own army of minecraft steves.  Sandbox mode can give you hours of fun, especially if you like building elaborate castles.  Invasion and conquest allow you to test your structural designs against waves of enemies and really feel like you've build a castle and not a pointless block structure.\n\nThe game is still developing, and releases have made the game progressivly better.\n\nThe only downside is that playing multiplayer requires some networking knowledge.","May 10","true","32.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have taken over 2 year break from this game. After the break I have come back to islands (maps) that are 10x as big as the "first island", two new game modes conquest (capture the point) and invasion (wave survival), a normal camera control system and enemys that you have to defend against. To add on to all that devs are getting ready to launch a multiplayer update where we can share control with friends or battle against one another (but as thats not in yet I will keep that out of my mind for the rest of the review). The game mode conquest is not very injoyable to me but the invasion mode is very challenging but fun so I'm going to focus on invasion. In invasion you start out with a few workers, a knight, an archer and your crystal (homebase) so you stright away get to work setting jobs and delgating how many workers you want doing diffrent jobs such as chopping trees for wood, working the iron mines, working in your querry for stone to make bricks or building your stronghold. Now building is a little unique you have to build your structures one brick at a time (you can click and drag so its not tedious) which means you can end up with a stronghold that can take multiple hits of explosive barrels or one. You can make you stronghold tall or wide its up to you but you do have to make sure you put supports under your structures so that your building doesn't collapse on its self. So I would say that castle story is a game that has seen a lot of growth and is at a stat were its fun to play.\n\nSome pros and cons:\n\nPros:very good looking\neasy to build structures\nchallenging to balance jobs\nvarying sizes of maps\nterrain deformation/reformation\nyou can build any size or shape structure\nstress system\ncamera is not unusable like early releases\ndevs are always releasing updates\nCons:takes large amounts of time to complete structres\nbig map has some framerate issues\nnot all game modes on every map\nbugs where enemys dont charge your base\nwhen builting unless you have two wide paths there may be some pathing issues\nminor lighting bugs\nIf you have the money to spare I think castle story is a game you should pick up.","May 17","true","21.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblis/recommended/227860/","emblis","Emblis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblis/","152 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAnother wave of black clay men are quickly advancing towards the southern walls of my Castle. On the wall stands a group of my yellow clay men workers, having just finished a big renovation project after the wall was almost destroyed in a previous assault. They stand no chance of holding the wall so I scroll over to my group of warriors, currently mopping up the few remaining hostiles who just tried to destroy my western walls. I order most of my warriors and archer to rush to southern walls, If I am lucky they will make it there before the attackers and I will be able to hold my castle, if not they will swam into my courtyard, kill my workers and surround my warriors.\n\nI am confident that my warriors will be able to hold my newly completed and fortified walls so instead I have a look at my recently attacked western side. There is small gap in the wall caused by the now dead attackers that I need to get repaired before any additional hostiles decide to follow up on their friends previous assault so I have my workers evacuate the soon to be attacked southern walls and send them to fix the bretch. Neither the workers or the warriors arrive. The warriors and the workers run into each others, stopping for what looks like a long and pleasant chat as they try to path around one another failing horribly as the attacker make a huge hole in my new wall. All of my yellow clay men gets surrounded slaughtered.\n\nSUMMARY:\nCastle Story is a game with what sounds like a great concept but has horrible execution. The two biggest issues are the pathing and UI. The pathing causes your claymen to frequently bump into each others, stopping them in their tracks as they try to find a way around their new found friend despite it being plenty of space on both sides of them. The UI requires you to navigate multiple radial menus just to build a stockpile, it is very clunky and unnecessarily complicated. I would stay away from Castle Story, it has been almost 3 years since the initial early access release and not much has happened since then.","June 4","false","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I understand early access means in development, but that would actually require some development on the developers part.\n\nWhile the game is entertaining for the first few hours, it becomes boring quickly, lacking the ability to do more than just build a castle. The survival mode is moderately entertaining for awhile but in essence, its survive against waves that come at you in a straight line. Its predictable and therefor gets boring easily.\n\nThere are several pros and cons, the pros being a unique new type of gameplay compared to other sandbox games, however it has many shortcomings such as lack of building materials and lack of blocks, which severely limits creativity. Making this sandbox game, not worth the money.\n\nOverall I cant recommend a game that is boring and has not progressed in development for months.

Oh yeah forgot about crystals in barrels as well.\n\nI beleive it could have been a great game, with lots of potential - may still be, but given the way they have completely alienated their customer base with no information (and making us feel that we are in the wrong for wanting to know), and with one major sob story after another how, one they fix this one thing there will be a flood of updates, but yet no new content.  But hey they cleaned up the spagetti code (6 months), now they are working on AI (6 months ?)\n\nTherefore wait until this product is released... save your £15.\n\nOk - so its now 10 months since my review, has anything changed..... well i have played it for a couple more hours, kept up to date with the (very few) updates.  Still disapointing.  Oh well - still can't recommend BUT they do tell us it will be released  early 2016 (so early for me is first 3 months)","November 25, 2014","false","44.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Still, it has improved a lot since the past versions, devs actually listened to the community on what should be done to improve the game, and did it.\n\nThis mix of Defense, RTS and Sandbox can be found in very few other games i know of, and it's worth to give a try to anyone who likes building his own stuff and/or RTS in general.\n\nIt can really be fun to defend your own castle, underground fortress or whatever you want to build against increasingly difficult enemies, think of it as a Stronghold mixed with Minecraft, pretty epic isn't it?\n\nI will update this review when updates come out, stay tuned.\n\n===\n\nACTUAL RATING: 8/10\n","May 10","true","15.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I want a refund but since I live in the Corporate States of America comrade Ridah can have no refunds.\n\nSo let me spit down why this game is bad.\n\nThe UI/Controls are very poor  and consolized. Its almost painfull to try and play this on PC and as of 1/13/2014 there is only a very very basic game here. Its almost insulting they can get away with selling this on steam or many of these types of early access games. Valve dousn't care, they take the money and so does the dev. Beyond that, theres no one watching over this stuff.\n\nBut back to the game, basically the UI is so consolized its confusing and just really awful to use on PC. The AI also have issues where they will occasionally just stop responding, stop working, and nothing can make them go back to work. Even if you did get to build something theres not much to do, its just not fun.\n\nI gave it a chance, its just horrible. Theres only the basic guise of a fun game and beyond that...nothing. I think an EA game would be better honestly, atleast they have to release a full game to fool people to buying it. Its messed up when I can say comparatively to this, that EA games are "full" games when half of the content is cut for later DLC releases at a premium overprice.","January 13, 2014","false","1.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","4"

I became excited with the concept. On the outside it looks cute and intresting, the Developers promised a Castle building wonderland where you construct and defend you castles from strange night corrupt versions of your builders. This peaked my intrest because it was both simple, yet engaging, not over complicated like a lot of games have become.\nJust clean good fun. So when it was available for Early Access I of course bought it. Now it has a lot of work to do, most of the basic concepts are there but a lot still need to be included, and a hell of a lot of work needs to be done on the features that do exist to remove bugs and glitches and other nastys. I know what your thinking, it's Early Access, thats to be expected.\nWell... That was a year ago.\nNothing has changed, nothing has been added, sometimes a small bug fix will be released but nothing more. I don't even check for updates anymore. They game developers have taken at least a million dollers for this and yet nothing.\nI'm afraid like a lot of early Access games they have taken your money and ran.\nThis game, and a few others like it have ruined Early Access for me.

I understand this is an indie company but after all this time, they don't have a playable product.  Updates are infrequent and frivolous.  Dev logs consist of trivial nonsense.  Sauropod Studios is way over their head. Your combination of few employees and complete lack of knowledge pertaining to anything about making games has quite literally turned Castle Story into the biggest disappointment in indie gaming history. I don't expect Sauropod Studios to ever make another game, ever. You obviously do not have the proper team or experience.

It was like building in minecraft only you have a small army of AI units to tell what to build. On paper it sounded great but I have massive doubts about the developers ability to refine this game to a playable degree. The .3 patch reverted about a years worth of bug fixes and has nearly broke the game to an "unplayable" state. This game is plagued with bugs that will waste hours of your time trying to figure out how to work around it just for the sake of stacking blocks. Their video blogs are just annoying to watch as all they do is talk about what they would like to accomplish while never really hitting these goals. It sounds all great but little to none of it ever gets ironed out. I bought this game over a year ago and have seen little forward advance. The last big patch cranked down the texture quality in order to increase the map size but failed to fix the major problems that these smaller development teams seem to struggle the most with. Mainly the AI's pathing issues. They constantly hang up and get "confused". In the end I could spend the same amount of time on minecraft survival solo and build more then 20 bricktons could accomplish even after hours of fine tuning how to work around the many bugs castle story has. The grand goal of this game seems to be able to mass an army of AI builders to construct an elaborate fort to defend against the corrupted but in the end if you could seize control of just one of the bricktons and manually control them you would do much much better to achieving this goal. At that point I have to say just stick with minecraft. Until you see a tidal wave of reviews saying they have finally made the AS (artificial stupidity) actually resemble AI, then steer clear of this struggling under developed game. Good idea but an extreme failure to polish into a playable game.","December 23, 2014","false","76.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It's essentially a castle building/defence simulator that has potential in droves. However, the game faces problems in the AI and has not had any significant updates for ages. Castle Story's AI is servicable at best, but the 'bricktons' will constantly stop and admire the scenery. The AI is at it's worst when assigned to a building project. They will constantly build the closest block to them, meaning that quite regularly, they will completely freeze as their pathfinding spends time trying to redirect the brickton. This wastes precious time in survival mode when you are trying to set up defences before the next wave of enemies comes charging in.\n\nThe lack of updates makes it feel like the devs have almost abandoned the game, as in the past year there has been no significant update to the gameplay at all. The promise of world generator has been hovering around ever since I bought the game a year ago, but I have still to see any evidence of it being implemented into the game.\n\nTL;DR : Game has large amount of potential but falls flat with buggy AI and lazy dev team\n\n","October 13, 2014","false","9.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nearly a year after that Castle story became available on Steam. I was excited to check it out to see the prgress that was made. Instead I was shocked to discover that it was nearly identicle to the prototype released a year prior. Fastforward to July 2014,  over 1.5 years since the release of the prototype, and next to no progress has been made at all. You would think in that time, with the funding they have received, they would be able to make at least some significant progress.\nthe game itself is sub-par. The contros are awkward, clunky and unresponsive. The building, while it requires somethinking in order to contruct buildings correctly, is boring and everything ends up looking the same as the most common material you will use are the stone blocks. Bricktrons are incredibly stupid, sometimes becoming frozen in place not responding to anything.\nI regret kickstarting this game - I backed the kickstarter for ~$20. I can't recomend the game in its current state, which it looks set to be in for a long time in the future. Even if its on sale for 90% off it is still not worth it: there is no redeeming factors in it to make up for the monotony of the rest of the game. It's not so bad it's good, just plain boring. I hope that the game eventually becomes half decent, but I don't see that happening anytime soon if the development so far is anything to go by.\n","July 18, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In my personal opinion, it has some major problems that make me think it's not a beta yet, but an advanced alpha.\n\nThe development team is working slowly on this game so, if you want to try it, perhaps you can add it to your wishlist and wait for a discount. So far the content is not worth 20 USD, maybe 10.\n\nWhat do you can do right now?\n-Play in just two scenarios, one for the sandbox mode and the other for survival.\n-Develop your castle almost as you want to do it, with a few bugs that sometimes make your bricktrons do nothing but lay down until they are killed.\n-Collect resources (wood, stone and blue/yellow cristals) pretty easily, but sometimes the  trees explode when you are collecting wood, so you have to wait until they decide they lost it and chop another tree.\n-Kill the bad guys with archers and swordsmen to defend your fortress every few minutes. Sometimes they don't see  or they can't find the baddies, so if you don't notice them, they keep destroying your castle brick by brick until the guards decide to attack them.\n-If one of your workers get stuck in a corner (like on the middle of four barrels), you can do nothing.\nCreating more bricktrons is really slow, so when you loose some of them because of a bug, then each time is even harder to keep surviving and you can get bored.","June 13, 2014","false","5.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","6"

There hasn't been a single content patch since this released on steam (sep 23 2013). It's just been minor bug fixes and that's about it. I am not sure how many people work for Sauropod but it seems it's a one man team. It will take them 2-3 months to replease a patch to fix bugs including no content at all!\n\nI backed this game in 2012 and I've regreted ever since. They released the beta(?) almost a year after their expected released date which was just ♥♥♥♥ing insane.\n\nI go and check the updates done on the game every month or two and I am dispointed every, single, time.\n\nThe release to steam was a joke, it was pretty much the same game as the prototype with the tacted on broken survial and mulitplayer options. Well besides I think they rebuilt the whole engine because of their god damn incompetence. AND GUESS WHAT? THE ENGINE IS STILL ♥♥♥♥ING BUGGY. The Bricktons still go brain dead when they get stuck, just a ton of minor bugs that seem so obivous but haven't got fixed in "patches" that seem to only fix minor bugs.\n\nIt's stupid how LITTLE these devs have done in two years.\n\nAs you can see from the current ratio of thumbs up to down(6:94) This game is not worth 20 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars, hell it's not worth 10 dollars.\n\nStay away!\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nUpdate(6/8/14)\n\nThey are done rewriting their ♥♥♥♥ code for the second time and it only took them what a year? Oh yeah everything is the same. Maybe a few less bugs. But still zero new content. Still not worth getting.\n\nGet a better Indie game like Space engineers, they update EVERY WEEK. With quallity content. Castle story hasn't had a single content update since it hit steam. Sure some small fixes here and there but zero content.\n\n--\n\nUpdate(3/28/15)\n\nStill no signs of any devlopment","January 22, 2014","false","33.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","5"

I became excited with the concept. On the outside it looks cute and intresting, the Developers promised a Castle building wonderland where you construct and defend you castles from strange night corrupt versions of your builders. This peaked my intrest because it was both simple, yet engaging, not over complicated like a lot of games have become.\nJust clean good fun. So when it was available for Early Access I of course bought it. Now it has a lot of work to do, most of the basic concepts are there but a lot still need to be included, and a hell of a lot of work needs to be done on the features that do exist to remove bugs and glitches and other nastys. I know what your thinking, it's Early Access, thats to be expected.\nWell... That was a year ago.\nNothing has changed, nothing has been added, sometimes a small bug fix will be released but nothing more. I don't even check for updates anymore. They game developers have taken at least a million dollers for this and yet nothing.\nI'm afraid like a lot of early Access games they have taken your money and ran.\nThis game, and a few others like it have ruined Early Access for me.
