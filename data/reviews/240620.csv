"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spIit/recommended/240620/","spIit","Split","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spIit/","68 products in account","Dev(s) are dedicated to the game, and the soundtrack is awesome (the same artist who composed the music for Risk of Rain)\n\nIf you played Wanderlust: Rebirth and liked it, you should definitely pick up this game.\nMany core mechanics have been changed, however, have also been rebalanced. It may feel a bit different from Wanderlust: Rebirth, however, it still has the same basic controls which allows you to get used to it fast.\nIt's a more open-world feeling of Wanderlust: Rebirth, which gives the increased ability to explore.\nIt still has a storyline though, although it's not required (but highly recommended) to advance through the game.\n\n\nEdit 8/12:\n\nI figured I'd add a bit more depth to this review rather than just a straight up recommendation for players who enjoyed rebirth.\n\nI'd like to say, first off, that I thoroughly enjoyed Wanderlust: Adventures. It has what makes a game a game- it's enjoyable, but not for every audience. It has smooth gameplay, fitting music, engaging visuals and is balanced enough to get through the game while playing casually. There are multiple classes which can be picked, and each one is unique. Regarding playing through the game on normal difficulty for the first time, no gameplay walls were hit while progressing through normal-mode.\nAdventures delivers the retro aspect of gameplay that was promised. The storyline itself is straightforward and is not confusing, allowing the player to get through it even while playing solo. I enjoyed the storyline, as it had some humour and action, but overall, was a bit lackluster when compared to Rebirth. Most of the storyline characters were not memorable, and the ending was a bit dull.\nMultiplayer is where the game shines, allowing all players to bash their way through the game similar to Magicka (without the friendly fire). The game was meant to be played as a multiplayer adventure, and the different classes in the game work well together to create a party that can smoothly sail through the game.\n\nThe game still has some bugs, however, knowing that the developer had continued to fix bugs in Rebirth after it was released, I believe that he will do the same for Adventures.\n\nI've also noticed a lot of players skip the tutorial- you may want to play through the tutorial since the game doesn't focus on informing you after that. The tips won't help nearly as much as the tutorial quest will. This game doesn't have a lot of "hand-holding", and won't tell you exactly what to do. It's up to the player to figure out the best path of progression.\n\n\n\nNOTE: This rest of this review is mainly directed towards people who have played Rebirth, and its purpose is to compare the two games. My first comment in this edit concludes why I gave it a recommendation in the first place, and why I would recommend Wanderlust: Rebirth.\n\nThis game takes Rebirth, and changes it into a similar yet mostly different game.\n\nSimilarities:\nMovement\nGraphics & Sprites (A bit more polished, but still similar. Some were recycled.)\nBasic attacks\nSome old characters are again featured in the game (Since it's set in a time prior to Rebirth.)\nEnemy AI\nClasses have similar skills and serve the same role in a party\nSet in the same game world, different location.\n\nDifferences:\nMusic. With a different composer, comes a different music style. Straying away from the retro soundtrack of Rebirth, yet doesn't take away from the game.\nCombat is a bit more smooth\nUI changes, more organized in a sense.\nSkill tree is simplified, some skills have been improved and some have been completely removed.\nAll classes now have a heal ability of some sort.\nOpen world- in a sense. The game world consists of a combination of multiple different tilesets, each with their own chances of having randomly generated events and enemies.\nSome base combat mechanics have been changed- such as how damage is applied, stuns, etc.\nDifficulty curve is now steeper, progression is heavily impacted by gear.\nProgression of character skills are now done through leveling up- as opposed to completing the storyline in Rebirth.\nBlocking now recharges seperately instead of requiring/draining stamina.\nNo more gregin gambling :(\nIntroduction of more "grinding" quests, allowing the player to grind if needed, however, the main progression of the game doesn't have many grinding quests. These are mainly sidequests which are optional.\nIntroduction of minigames- mining, fishing, etc.\nNo hardmode, only Epic, which is a gamemode which requires level 15.\nSprites have been improved, and the game has customization of character clothing and colors.\nCompanions/pets\nRemoval of Soul Charge abilities, instead Soul Charges are used to interact with objects which trigger events or buffs.\nPvP was removed.\n\nAnd more, however these are just the main differences between Rebirth and Adventures.\n\nPersonally, I do think that Adventures is less engaging than Rebirth.\n\nThis is due to:\n-No more epic soul charge animations due to the skill being removed. I also don't agree with the skill being removed, it was something which rewarded having different classes in a party.\n\n-No more damage counter, instead replaced with the EXP gained. I thought this was a visually appealing part of the game, since who doesn't like to see big numbers rack up continually?\n\n-Arena (Crawl) was simplified, and now on a single map. Removal of the crawl slot machine and no resting room- resulting in little time to sit down and check your progress through the crawl, or take a break if you have been in the game mode for a long time. (Edit 8/13: You can take a break from the crawl by not opening the chest which spawns at the end of a level.)\n\n-Character progression heavily based on equipment. This is due to the extremely high difficulty of Epic, resulting in a huge gap in player character development, and the first actual game-progression wall that the player would meet in the game.\n\nWith a full party of max level players (not rebirthed), each knowing exactly what they are doing, wearing gear obtained by the end of their first playthrough on normal difficulty, they will still have a LOT of trouble advancing through Epic. This is due to enemies one/two shotting any class, making it difficult for healing abilities to be used effectively, and the cleric can't do much healing apart from reviving dead players, provided that the cleric didn't get one/two shot already in battle. Epic gear is very difficult to obtain- Grinding through an entire dungeon takes at least half an hour, and the drop rate of a blueprint from an end chest is fairly low in my experience.\n\nDespite these changes, I still enjoy Adventures. It's just that I was expecting a game more similar to Rebirth, and it changed in many ways, most of them for the better, but not all. These differences won't mean much to a player who is new to Adventures, but are very noticable for players who clocked in many hours for Rebirth.","August 10, 2015","true","146.9"," 147 of 202 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","147","202","8","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/240620/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","308 products in account","Wanderlust Adventures is the follow-up to Leth's 2011 game,  Wanderlust: Rebirth. It's an Action RPG with online multiplayer, and it plays like a pseudo-MMORPG. The game boasts a huge open world to explore with randomized dungeons to keep action fresh and entertaining. There are 4 character classes to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. I decided to give this game a try after Rebirth. Leth promised players that he'd listen to their suggestions and improve upon what was lacking in the first game. Unfortunately, Adventures still suffers from many of the same weaknesses.\n\nFirst, the gameplay is largely uninteresting. Most of combat is based on using an autoattack, followed by building upon different skills as your class. As a result, combat not only feels clunky, but it's really quite boring. There doesn't seem to be any weight to your actions; it's only spamming and repeating. None of it feels very satisfying to do as a player. Secondly, the loot and crafting systems don't add much to the game. Instead, they detract from the experience with tedious work that it doesn't need. Getting good drops seems incredibly unbalanced, and crafting doesn't seem to yield much better gear. Thirdly, although it can be enjoyed as a single-player experienced, it ultimately feels like it was meant to be played with others. Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't up to par with what other games in its genre can deliver.\n\nStill, Leth poured his heart and soul into this project. He is an extremely dedicated developer, with many fans that have been clamoring for this release. He is very responsive to questions and concerns, he streams development regularly, and is steady at releasing updates. The game's art and music are pretty good; the pixel art is easy on the eyes, and the soundtrack was done by Chris Christodoulou of Risk of Rain fame. If it looks interesting to you, by all means, try the game. It can be pretty fun if you have friends to play it with, and maybe you'll enjoy what it has to offer.","September 26, 2015","false","1.3"," 58 of 74 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","58","74","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119621171/recommended/240620/","76561198119621171","EDOC RQ","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119621171/","34 products in account","What’s Good:\n\n- A solid gameplay formula for loot hunting/exp grinders out there\n- Each class has a good variety of abilities to progress and choose from\n- Randomized maps make each session feel relatively fresh\n- Varied biomes for each area made them feel distinct. One area in particular was very bizarre and unexpected.\n- Various events on the map were nice and sometimes would feature more than just combat with puzzle gameplay\n- Day/Night cycle system that changes up the adventuring experience\n- Companion system that allows you to obtain nearly every enemy in the game as a combat pet and level them up\n- Crafting system\n- Good amount enemy types/bosses/minibosses\n- Main boss encounters were mostly unique with an interesting fight strategy and not just damage sponges.\n- I liked all the exp combos and awards you could earn from combat, it made each encounter feel rewarding.\n- Various mini-games were nice extras even if they weren't vital to the gameplay (Fishing, Mining, Slot Machines)\n- Hard mode available for those looking for more challenge and replay value\n- I've seen frequent patches with bugfixes and other small changes which is a great sign of active devs that care\n\nWhat’s Bad:\n\n- Would have been nice if the storage stash in town was shared between characters to allow you to transfer items between them.\n- Game completion progress is shared between your characters which some players may not like, quests are repeatable though.\n- Waypoints are nice, but I wish there was one in each major outpost. When playing early on I wasn't finding any so was making long treks through low level areas trying to get where I need to go.\n- The overall journey did feel kind of samey as you essentially go from outpost to outpost doing a handful of quests at each, if you just enjoy exploring and killing mobs this may not be an issue with you though as you are free to do this at any time.\n- While this may not bother some players, the game is very gear dependent as important stat values like HP mostly come from gear and gems which enhance your gear. Without the HP buffs from gear I found myself getting killed instantly quite often.\n- The dungeons while varied in appearance, seemed very similar layout wise and typically involved moving from room to room clearing enemies until you found the exit. I may have preferred the main dungeons to have been hand-crafted experiences and keeping the randomized ones for optional locations within the world.\n\nControls\nWhat’s Good:\n\n- Support for keyboard and controllers, however I solely played with a controller.\n- While it may take some getting used to, the controls and various options available for customizing them were acceptable.\n\nWhat’s Bad:\n\n- One of the only things that frustrated me with the controls at times was the auto target locking of ranged Sorcerer spells. It is possible I could have been able to turn in this off while I was on the simple aiming feature which felt the best to me, but I didn't see it.\n\nphics/Performance\nWhat’s Good:\n\n- A lot of great pixel art throughout the game, although still not as impressive as some other similar games. The larger enemies and bosses in particular stood out as the most impressive.\n- Lighting effects during night look neat.\n\nWhat’s Bad:\n\nWhile this may not bother everyone, the framerate is locked at 30FPS which did leave me wishing the game looked and felt more smooth.\n\nSound\nWhat’s Good:\n\n\n- The soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou was easily one of my favorite parts of the game. I initially became a fan through the Risk of Rain soundtrack with its tunes that perfectly fit the bizarre alien worlds of that game and once again these tracks seem to perfectly fit each biome and theme.\n- Sound effects are average, can't really say anything bad about them\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWanderlust Adventures is an excellent indie co-op 2D action RPG for any fans of looting hunting and grinding style games. While the main quest may quickly end for those that rush to finish it, there are still reasons to keep playing and progress your character further if you like by hunting for and crafting new loot. My favorite parts of the game were the boss encounters and the soundtrack, while on the negative side I was hoping to see more handcrafted locations for the main quest rather than pure randomization.\n\nVerdict: Buy\n\nThe content that Wanderlust Adventures offers easily fits the 15 dollar price tag and many may even get much more value out of this price if they decide to level up multiple characters and do a lot of loot grinding. Just make sure you come in knowing that this is a more combat-focused and character progression style RPG and does not feature very many puzzles or a strong story due to the focus on randomization. For those curious about length, it will likely take somewhere between 5 to 10 hours of gameplay on your first normal difficulty run-through of the game which may be much shorter or longer depending on if you rush or do a lot of optional content and exploring.","January 24","true","8.9"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","35","37","2","0"

If you have any love for the older title by Yeti Trunk, then you will absolutely get addicted to this retro RPG. What really shines here is the combat, which has been vastly improved over old mechanics.  It's been simplified into a skill tree and abilities seem much easier to pull off now.  Some things do carry over to other characters like companion unlocks, some of which are hard-earned.  This gives a lot of replay value because each class is so different and you don't just lose everything by starting a new class.  The biggest difference with WA vrs. WR is now you have an open world to explore, much of which is randomly generated content.  This leaves room for even those that put 100+ hours into this game to find something new each play-through.  My wife, who does not play a whole lot of video games, was getting really into this game.  We 4-player cooped for a couple hours, not even doing the main story missions.  We had a blast just running around the randomly generated content, killing all it had to offer.\n\nI recommend this game for any old-school RPG enthusiasts that played Secret of Mana or Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.  I will be playing many more hours of this game.

We had hoped there'd be some more world building/story within the game. It felt as if we were just thrown into a town, told how to play and immediately sent off on our way to do some very basic/monotonous quests. I can deal with quests like these when they're meant to give the option of more gameplay time to the player, but when this is pretty much all that’s offered I believe it’s a bit of a problem.\n\nThe claim of an open-world in this games description threw me off a bit once we got our hands on it. The world is made up of extremely small square areas in which you travel between. If you're familiar with the older Zelda games, its set up a bit like that. I would say it’s system isn’t as well executed as the older Zelda games though.\n\nJust about every square area we explored only contained a few seconds of fighting, and an occasional mini-boss fight which would last about 1-2 minutes. I felt like we did more waiting for one another to move on to the next area than anything else. You're forced to stand in a certain section of the square area and wait for the other players to stand there with you to move on to the next spot. It was a pain with two people; I can only imagine how it'd be with four.\n\n\nThis in of itself wouldn't have been much of a problem had there been more things going on in each square area or if the areas were just larger in general. It would have been nice if we could leave places without waiting for others.\n\nI feel there is no sense of openness or fluidity to this game. There are too many breaks between its content, which completely kept us from enjoying the game as much as we should have.\n\n\nThe combat felt extremely stiff, like there was too much weight to the characters and not enough animations happening. I felt the developers put priority on combat effects and the amount of enemies on screen to make things seem a bit more complex. It is extremely hard to see your character on screen when fighting because of this.\n\nI believe this game could have been a great one for us had these things been worked on more. The trailer and description made things seem so much more lively and fun than they turned out for us. We just took our purchase as a loss unfortunately.\n\nI'd suggest you look at more gameplay online if you think this game may be for you, and put some thought into whether any of the faults I wrote about here would bother you.","August 27, 2015","false","2.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sayned/recommended/240620/","Sayned","Sayned","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sayned/","88 products in account","TL;DRGame itself is good and worth attention and money, but, compared to Rebirth, there are some things I disliked in Adventures\n\nIn generalGame is pretty well made, devs did really good job avoiding mistakes done in Rebirth. I personally enjoyed the game, the plot, the gameplay, music and graphics, etc.\nI will mention some good things about the game later on in this review, but I actually will focus on things I disliked in the game (is that weird?).\nGame isn't as linear as WR is. I actually have finished helping 4th outpost before helping 3rd one and it didn't affect plot that much. That's a good thing\nGood graphics, good music, good plot\nExploring world is not boring!\nYet, there are some things that could be done better:\n(-)Dungeons are lame.\nIn game we can see like 10-15 possible layouts for a dungeon and we can always predict where exit is. This is not the only problem with dungeons. Another thing is that they're boring. First 2-3 dungeons will be quite interesting, you'd want to explore them to see... a couple of rooms with nothing inside or an altar that wants to consume your soul charge. But I have to admit, that exploring world is much more interesting than exploring a dungeon!\n\n(-)Grind.\nWe all know that grinding something in any game is just pain. A lot of achievements and materials shall be literally grinded in WA. In that case you'd have to spend hours just to get a single contract of this ultra rare omen scarab or to get this last orange blueprint that only drops in epic Arena.\nCompared to Wanderlust: Rebirth (WR)WR had a lot of issues, that Wanderlust Adventures(WA) doesn't have and vice versa. Some of the advantages of WA over WR are obvious so I didn't mention them\n(+)WA is balanced compared to WR\nCompared to WR, there's no way you could call certain class OP or a certain build stronger than other. At least because different builds offer different playstyle. For example, carrying Energy+Ice on mage gives you aoe, control, some protection and mobility, while Earth+Fire gives you a lot of aoe, dps and a lot of protection. And yea, you could combine any elements in WA, unlike in WR you had to stick to either Earth+Fire or Ice+Energy because of how crit mechanic worked then.\n\n(+) WA isn't as linear, as WR was\nThis one is self explainatory.\n\n(+) WA is less hardcore\nI have to admit, WR was quite hardcore. I don't remember if I have actually managed to complete game on medium difficulty, but I do remember that walking through easy difficulty, well, was hard. Wanderlust Adventures is much easier to play solo, and is fun to play co-op.\n\n(-) WA is way too causal\nYet as a WR fan I expected game to be much harder and challenging than it is. Yup, I know, epic difficulty makes it A LOT harder and that's a good thing, but I really do want to mention that easy difficulty is WAY too easy. What I mean is that I died to a cactus in first location when started the game, but as soon as I finished my first quest, whole easy mode was like way too easy. Every mob died to a single spell that I casted. Until I started Epic mode. Epic mode is love.\n\n(-) WA bosses are much more boring\nI don't mind bosses be less challenging, but I expected them to be much more interesting, have more interesting movesets and so on. What we've got:\n-a Barbuda without his rage stance, which is boring\n-Slurge is pretty much the same\n-Grizzly became really weak and boring. Basically a no-threat boss, unlike WR\n-Golem thing has REALLY predictable and boring pattern.\n-Blood golem is like M E H. Really boring. This one didn't even heal or become untargetable or something.\n-Cillus. Yes, I am comparing Cillus from WA to Cillus from WR even though this boss' appearance in WR was quite short and I'm sure not everyone will even remember Cillus from WR. Basically, Cillus in WA was really boring. This fight didn't FEEL like the final boss, unlike Zemn in WR. And in general this boss' pattern was similar to Cillus from WR, but you don't really even hit Cillus in WA. I mean, you kill his minions, but how on earth would it lead you towards defeating him? Another thing - Cillus didn't touch you either. Blah blah blah, GIVE ME ZEMN AS FINAL BOSS D:<\n-All the mini-bosses (optional ones), such as yellow slime from Ooze Cave or Grizzly from Smelly cave, or The Watcher from The Portal, etc. are basically nothing special. They all have similar and boring patterns. While in WR we had this jumping fishman lord thing, which was quite challenging\nJust one last thing about bosses: Bosses are not mobile and usually are no treat to you since they're really predictable and struggle vs block or any mobility spell/skill. Unlike, for example, N'veia who had ability to dash around and deal tons-o-damage to you. And if you even manage to block those spells, then she started using her magic powahs to punish you.\n\n(+)But there are 2 interesting bosses actually:\n+Crystallis became much more interesting and harder to play against. And is easier to find (DAMN YOU'D NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW TO SPAWN CRYSTALLIS IN WR YOURSELF. LITERALLY NEVER.)\n+Mind Blight was quite interesting boss to see in game. It's cool how devs combined bullet hell with a puzzle game in one boss!\n\n(-)The Crawl:\nIt's like my biggest complaint EVER.\nThe Crawl in WA is literally BORING. You keep killing always same mobs on same arena with NO EVENTS AT ALL!\nWhile in WR you were fighting at different locations with different mobs (which were stronger, I have to admit). And after you beat 5 rounds, you could start some random events like Epic Sax Guy Blood Golem, or Protect Marty. Even fight Kraken! D:<\nWhat you get in WA is like a "Grinding simulator" minigame. Which literally is IMPOSSIBLE to have fun at!\n\n(-)No secrets, no secret interactions, not that much of interactions in game in general:\nWe had a side quest in WR - lead Marty back home. And in case if we'd do that, we'd unlock another quest - to find Marty in sewers. I didn't know about second quest until I decided to play from chapter 1 to 10 in 1 game. Another thing - you can't find a red bARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRell, put it near a crack in a wall and enjoy a secret boss. You actually can't lift red barrels anymore. WA has like no interactions between player and world, aswell as no secrets (or maybe there are secrets, but I didn't find them yet! which is unlikely, since there are no hints anywhere that there would be a secret. for example - no suspicious achievements :P). AND NO MORE EPIC SAX GUY!\n\n(-)Escorts are way too easy\nEscrorts are like no challenge at all. Person that you're helping to is like never focused by enemies. Or if it gets focused, you will most likely oneshot enemies. Or die from one hit, because epic difficulty is hard :P\nOne really important note:Even though I've mentioned a lot of bad things about the game, I didn't do a mistake pressing "I recommend" button. Those things I mentioned, are things I PERSONALLY missed as a person who enjoyed previous Wanderlust game (Rebirth). Talking about real problems, the game has: there are only 3 things that are actually relevant and bring negative experience: The Crawl, Grinding, Dungeons. Other bad things I've mentioned are not that relevant compared to those 3 and actually is just something I personally wanted to whine about.\n\nWith all that being said, I recommend this game to everyone, except those players who loved The Crawl in Wanderlust Rebirth. Let's be honest, in Wanderlust Adventures The Crawl sucks. It really does.

One area in particular was very bizarre and unexpected.\n- Various events on the map were nice and sometimes would feature more than just combat with puzzle gameplay\n- Day/Night cycle system that changes up the adventuring experience\n- Companion system that allows you to obtain nearly every enemy in the game as a combat pet and level them up\n- Crafting system\n- Good amount enemy types/bosses/minibosses\n- Main boss encounters were mostly unique with an interesting fight strategy and not just damage sponges.\n- I liked all the exp combos and awards you could earn from combat, it made each encounter feel rewarding.\n- Various mini-games were nice extras even if they weren't vital to the gameplay (Fishing, Mining, Slot Machines)\n- Hard mode available for those looking for more challenge and replay value\n- I've seen frequent patches with bugfixes and other small changes which is a great sign of active devs that care\n\nWhat’s Bad:\n\n- Would have been nice if the storage stash in town was shared between characters to allow you to transfer items between them.\n- Game completion progress is shared between your characters which some players may not like, quests are repeatable though.\n- Waypoints are nice, but I wish there was one in each major outpost.  When playing early on I wasn't finding any so was making long treks through low level areas trying to get where I need to go.\n- The overall journey did feel kind of samey as you essentially go from outpost to outpost doing a handful of quests at each, if you just enjoy exploring and killing mobs this may not be an issue with you though as you are free to do this at any time.\n- While this may not bother some players, the game is very gear dependent as important stat values like HP mostly come from gear and gems which enhance your gear.  Without the HP buffs from gear I found myself getting killed instantly quite often.\n- The dungeons while varied in appearance, seemed very similar layout wise and typically involved moving from room to room clearing enemies until you found the exit.  I may have preferred the main dungeons to have been hand-crafted experiences and keeping the randomized ones for optional locations within the world.\n\nControls\n\nWhat’s Good:\n\n- Support for keyboard and controllers, however I solely played with a controller.\n- While it may take some getting used to, the controls and various options available for customizing them were acceptable.\n\nWhat’s Bad:\n\n- One of the only things that frustrated me with the controls at times was the auto target locking of ranged Sorcerer spells.  It is possible I could have been able to turn in this off while I was on the simple aiming feature which felt the best to me, but I didn't see it.\n\nGraphics/Performance\n\nWhat’s Good:\n\n- A lot of great pixel art throughout the game, although still not as impressive as some other similar games.  The larger enemies and bosses in particular stood out as the most impressive.\n- Lighting effects during night look neat\n\nWhat’s Bad:\n\n- While this may not bother everyone, the framerate is locked at 30FPS which did leave me wishing the game looked and felt more smooth.\n\nSound\n\nWhat’s Good:\n\n- The soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou was easily one of my favorite parts of the game.  I initially became a fan through the Risk of Rain soundtrack with its tunes that perfectly fit the bizarre alien worlds of that game and once again these tracks seem to perfectly fit each biome and theme.\n- Sound effects are average, can't really say anything bad about them\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWanderlust Adventures is an excellent indie co-op 2D action RPG for any fans of looting hunting and grinding style games.  While the main quest may quickly end for those that rush to finish it, there are still reasons to keep playing and progress your character further if you like by hunting for and crafting new loot.  My favorite parts of the game were the boss encounters and the soundtrack, while on the negative side I was hoping to see more handcrafted locations for the main quest rather than pure randomization.\n\nVerdict: Buy\n\nThe content that Wanderlust Adventures offers easily fits the 15 dollar price tag and many may even get much more value out of this price if they decide to level up multiple characters and do a lot of loot grinding.  Just make sure you come in knowing that this is a more combat-focused and character progression style RPG and does not feature very many puzzles or a strong story due to the focus on randomization.  For those curious about length, it will likely take somewhere between 5 to 10 hours of gameplay on your first normal difficulty run-through of the game which may be much shorter or longer depending on if you rush or do a lot of optional content and exploring.","August 25, 2015","true","6.9"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

That again may put someone of, as it can make for some slow game play, but can be a good mechanic when you are fighting a renowned mob, or group of tough enemies as  the game knows it can be difficult to new players, giving them that optional run away button when they are low on health. Of course in the dungeon boss fights this does not happen as the renowned mobs are optional and the dungeons are apart of the storyline. This reminds me of my next topic, the storyline, it is not very good however it doees not need one, like most old video games do, all you need to make the game good is its gameplay.","December 4, 2015","true","18.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Herilia/recommended/240620/","Herilia","Herilia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Herilia/","305 products in account","First of all, if you play with other people, I do recommend this game. This is a negative evaluation for a solo play, because anything is fun with friends. And I'll add to that that I did finish the game in solo.\n\nSo... Where to begin. I'll start by the story. You can ignore it, because it doesn't serve much point, wich is a bit sad for a rpg-ish type of game.\nNext we have this "randomized" system that says the world "always change each time you play"... yeah, that's not the case. What you get are kinda different spawn of ennemies from the same pool in each area. The map doesn't change, the location of quests and dungeons either... anyway there is nothing random about this game, and each playthrough is the same if you start over or if you join a "new world" (wich you will have to if you want to "continue" your game since only your quest progress is saved and your teleport points)\n\nOh. The teleport points, let's talk about them. Their placement is pretty bad, but the worst thing about them is that they are the only thing that are left for you to travel when you start the game again... So ok, that's maybe good? But the problem is, you cannot go back to the lich tower for instance directly. Wich raises one problem : you have to do the last "zone" plus the last dungeon in one go, because if you leave the area, you need to do the walk from the last (very far away) beacon you crossed. And you'll have to go back, because your inventory will fill up super quickly.\n\nThe events now... They are probably the highlight of the game, different elite mobs that spawn, as strong as some bosses or at least that represent a challenge... Except that some of them can one shot you (or close enough, in normal you cannot die in 1 hit, but you're left with 1hp).\n\nI was playing mage, so maybe that's why I take a HUGE amount of damage, and I'm fine with that, but I'm just giving advice for the people who want to play this solo.\n\nAnd talking about mage, let's talk about why this game is broken hm? Some bosses (a lot of them) are bugged at the end of dungeons, meaning by that, you can exploit them. The only ones that cannot be exploited are the ones who attack as soon as you come in the room (like the huge slime) or the ones that you have to walk to to activate (like the Mind Blight and the Lich). But other thant that, the Death like figure in the last secondary dungeon for exemple, or any other boss like that...? If you are a mage, you can enter the boss room... and not moving, and just shoot fireball. The boss will never react, and die. Quite a huge mistake to make in coding these hu? So mage is really easy to play alone, you blink against packs, and you do nothing but clicking against boss...\n\nI do not know if that works in harder difficulty, but I would guess it does.\n\nI did not play the harder difficulty yet, I'm waiting for friends to reach the level 15 (or play with them to that point) to do so. So I cannot comment that... But honestly, if you want a game like this without friends, I'd play the previous game of this series, or Secrets of grindea, wich are both really good in solo and multiplayer.\n\nThere are a lot more things to say about this game, like the fact that I never got any compagnon contract dropped, or any legendary crafting recepies wich I guess you get in Epic mode, or that all the loot is worthless compared to what you can craft... This game could be so much better than this.\n\nAs I said, it will be fun with friends, because you'll get epic mode, and fight in a crazy setup where you would die very quickly and will pose a challenge. But that's all this game has, the rest deserve to be fully remade.","August 20, 2015","false","6.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

As if I'm going to starve on this journey!\n\nBut with seriousness here,\nI've actually liked this since Wanderlust, but it lacked the exploring part. Don't disregard that the arcade stuff is good, but it was needed to feel open. And well, THIS game did it just fine! I did watch this once in a while, and I enjoyed this so far.\n\nCompanions? Check.\nCrafting items with mastery with it? Unexpechecked.\nSkill tree? It's there, and very selectable. Try being a spell caster (And use 1,2,3 to switch around styles quickly!)\nCharacter customization (colors) with 2 new and 2 original characters per class? You better bet it, mister.\nMultiplayer, that adds in more mechanics and harder mobs per player? Tried it, and I want to do more multiplayer.\n\nBut this is just me playing it so far, and the few quips so far is that you can kite enemies moving diagonally, avoiding most enemies/roaming bosses and their attacks (until you get mobbed, then you played it dumb!). And the lack of feature to either mass sell items in town (equiments mostly), or having item lock to prevent selling or ridding of them. (Haven't encountered that, but I bet people will sooner or later! Look before you sell too many!)\n\n\nAll in all, It's great to me. The music is there, the surprise elements makes it fun for me, and the multiplayer makes it so you can band with others (but so will the enemies!).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/240620/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","While not exactly ground-breaking or revolutionary, Wanderlust Adventures is still a worthwhile and arguably addictive gaming experience with plenty to offer.\n\nA 16-bit open world RPG, Wanderlust offers an impressively sized map, randomized areas and random events that offer a good replay value. You are given the choice between one of four classes to choose from before you embark on an adventure to save the land from evil and yadda yadda yadda. The story and setting are cliche and have honestly been done to death, but it if ain't broke, don't fix it. So the story don't matter for crap here.\n\nThe gameplay offers a lot more depth than I would have initially thought, instead of thoughtless controls like "swing sword, cast spell etc" you can block a certain amount of enemy attacks, and if you time the block just right you can counter-attack do dish out a steaming-hot serving of pain. Just my experience, since I played through as the warrior class.\nWhat really sells me on the gameplay are the skill trees. I found them to be diverse and thought-provoking, encouraging me to pick and choose which skills and perks best suit my playstyle, and my decisiveness was rewarded since the level cap is 25 and I didn't have a single wasted skill-point, covering all the bases I felt were necessary but also keeping an interesting challenge curve as the game progressed.\nAnother solid point on gameplay are the companions. Almost every enemy you fight in the game you can get as a follower to help you in your battles. This can be done by finding a "mercenary contract" item that you can turn in at town to buy a new companion. Companions are unfortunately little more than battlefield distractions, keeping the focus away from you while you slash away at enemies while they focus your buddy. Also despite what the banner image may suggest, you cannot get a giant scorpion as a companion (oh god WHY NOT?!?).\n\nExploring the map gives the player the opportunity to experience randomly generated events, ranging from run-of-the-mill ambushes where you are assaulted by a wave of the enemies native to that portion of the map or a tougher mini-boss. Or you can come across more interesting events like puzzles, traps or enchanted loot containers that trigger a stronger wave of enemies.\nThe enemies in the game are varied and each one having their own range of attacks to be mindful of. There can be standard RPG enemy archetypes like bandits and skeletons, or you can square-off with Sand Sharks, Snake Women or Giant Scorpions (WHY WONT YOU LET ME HAVE YOU AS A COMPANION?).\n\nThe bad points of the game are very noticeable. Most notably, the uninteresting loot system. Part of what makes a good RPG is loot, finding and collecting all the best items for your characters to help even the odds a little against your adversaries, in Wanderlust the items you find while adventuring are 99% useless. Items you can build with blueprints at the town's blacksmith offer stats miles higher than what you'd normally find, which is a pretty big letdown. Once you build these items, there is legitimately no point in searching for loot anymore, and in my playthrough I got the best possible loadout in little-under the halfway mark.\n\nSPOILER ALERT! Read ahead at your own risk\n\n\nThe biggest letdown in my opinion was the final boss.\nThe boss battle, to put it simply, sucked. This "Lich" dude was built up to be the baddest dude around, an unstoppable force of dark magic that could never be destroyed because any human who killed it would become the next Lich. How did the battle play out? You dodge a few spells, fight off some waves of dungeon enemies and the fight's over. While this in itself is pretty pathetic, it gets even better. Not only through the final battle but also through the final dungeon you have no choice but to be accompanied by an essential story NPC who is invulnerable and uses the most overpowered spells, making what could have been an epic final dungeon crawl leading up to a spearpoint final battle feel more like a hand-held daycare. I legitimately just let this NPC tank most of the boss minions and he killed them all without any contribution on my part. Severe letdown there.\n\nSo while Wanderlust Adventures isn't absolutely perfect, I still found myself enjoying the overall experience. Given the hours I've logged for what I payed, yeah, I'd say it was worthwhile. So pick it up if you're looking for some good old fashioned RPG.","September 4, 2015","true","20.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

It's pretty fun that it is coop, something that always makes a game more appealing to us, and the coop is well implemented too.  The rest of the game however, is just not very fun. Combat is okay, but the skills/spells get pretty boring after a while and there doesn't seem to be many "advanced moves" you can do with them. Skills have their basic usage, and that's it, not many interesting combinations. Neither is there a particularly large selection to choose from.\n\nThere is no mmorpg-style "required grind" to progress in the story, which is good, but the game still feels fairly grindy as you mostly just spend your time grinding monsters anyways. Quests aren't very engaging either, it's mostly "kill 10 of these things", "escort this guy" and "clear this dungeon". Atleast the dungeons has some kind of boss at the end, but that's about it.\n\ntl;dr: If you are a few people who really want to play just any RPG together, sure, I guess.

The biggest is the pathetically small area's that count as a tile on a map , Its 2015 , pc hardware can handle a lot more then what your giving us. On top of that you have to stand on a circle to even proceed to the next area on the map , who knows how long that will take if your playing with randoms. The whole game just seems rushed and does not have much content to explore , skill trees are pretty basic , ui and item management is pretty bad. More ambiant sound and sound effects would do this game a major improvement aswell. Its not the worst game ever , I just think it needs more time in development.","August 12, 2015","false","1.2"," 12 of 35 people (34%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","34","12","35","2","0"

All menus use this control scheme. At the very least, the main menu should be controllable with arrow keys by default.\n•When using an Xbox 1 controller and moving straight down or up with the dpad, unable to move diagonally and must change direction or stop moving to be able to move diagonally again.\n•No abilities until levelling up 3 times, making those first 3 levels insanely boring.\n•3 ability slots and 3 secondary ability slots, with 1 of those 6 being your standard attack. There is a million buttons on keyboards and standard every day controllers. You should be able to keybind all the abilities to whatever you want.","August 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 32 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","5","32","0","0"
