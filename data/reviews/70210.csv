I don't play poker or any other games similar to that in real life nor did i ever like the idea of playing. But:\n\n+This game is awesome! Firstly i got it on sale for 5euro (Premium Edition).\n+Easy to learn even for noobs like me. (Has a full tutorial about poker)\n+Its not JUST poker..its poker with Storyline!\n+Combines the storyline and buying stuff(hats for your character,houses for rent) with the thrill of playing a card game.\n+Has achievements which even for me are fun!\n+Time passes nicely\n\n-No multiplayer :(","December 16, 2013","true","25.7"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/70210/","strategikal","Strategikal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/","1935 products in account","Governor of Poker 2 is an enjoyable poker game set in the Wild West, that offers more than just poker. There's a long campaign where you travel to different cities, play in various tournaments, encounter a variety of different opponents (including notorious ones), purchase buildings, and best of all, you get to buy new hats!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/obuXfORI8v0\nA big feature of real poker is the tells on your opponents faces, but in this game you don't see faces, just hats! In spite of this, the game does a pretty good job of giving different personalities to the characters through their voices and actions, and there are tells in the form of comments they make and other information, such as getting steamy when they lose.\n\nA big part of the game is travelling to different cities and buying buildings, which provide you with passive income. At first you can only make money from playing poker, but once you own a reasonable number of buildings you have a steady income trickling in. The idea is to build up your reputation and take over different cities. You can borrow money from the bank if necessary, or sell buildings if you have any, and of course, you can buy new hats. New hats impart some personality to the players and allow you to enter new tournaments.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly fast paced, it's an ideal game for a quick poker fix, but I'm not sure whether the cards played are truly random and whether the AI cheats or not. Some reviews claim that it does. I'm not experienced at poker so I can't really tell, but as a casual player the gameplay seems decent to me, even though I find it pretty hard to win, even on the standard level. The Telltale poker games are a lot more fun if you want personality and banter, but for a simple poker fix, this does the job and is better than other poker games I've tried. There's no multiplayer, so look elsewhere if that's what you want, but it provides a good single player experience\n\nThe graphics are fairly basic, and low res too, but they're functional and pleasant to look at. There are free versions of this you can play on the internet but this version, the premium edition, provides more depth.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game for casual players, especially because of the extra interest that the campaign provides. Serious poker players may want to look elsewhere though.","May 3, 2015","true","3.5"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","31","33","0","8"

I am probably 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through.  The PC players are varied enough to keep it interesting as well (bluff a lot), occasionally make bad bets but it seems random enough to make it like playing a bunch of friends.    Fun casual game that is keeping my interest.\n\nEdit - 38 hours to finish the game and become "Governor of Texas".   Could play a bit more if I wanted to complete all the in-game achievements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamtheainar/recommended/70210/","iamtheainar","The A","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamtheainar/","78 products in account","One of the best casual poker games out there and for sure the best one on Steam, at the moment, in my opinion. It's important to note tho that this game is for casual players who are not very much into serious poker strategy. I do play online poker for real money at gambling sites versus real people and I can tell you for sure that strategies applied there, even on lowest stakes against dumbest of players, won't work very often on AI in this game.\n\nAI in this game is rather silly and most of the time plays nothing like real thinking player would. All tho you can certainly still learn how it "thinks" and use it for your advantage to predict it's behaviors. It's not like AI is completely random and doesn't make sense. But still, if you want a serious poker game where you could apply in-depth poker strategies this game is not for you. But it is excellent if you are newcomer to poker or just want to casually have fun time.\n\nGame has very attractive graphics and nice progression system where you buy houses and cities, what gives you profit every day once you own them. You gain fame and stars what allows you to challenge stronger and stronger opponents once you get more famous. You can walk around the city and talk to it's people, it's like a tiny poker RPG. The game also has a story which is told through newspapers what pops on your screen and NPCs what you can click to talk with. Not much of a story but it is there. And you can spend extra money you make on hats to customize your character. Obviously poker play is this game's main focus but it's nice that these RPG features are there.\n\nWould I recommend Premium Edition? Yes, for sure! Would I recommend it for 20$? Probably not. Wait till this game goes on sale and then get Premium Edition. In the end of a day it's very repetitive and AI is not smart enough to justify paying 20$ for a flash game, which is what this game essentially originated as. If it would have multiplayer, like Governor of Poker 3, then it would be worth 20$ in my opinion, but it does not.","June 30, 2015","true","14.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I find this game tedious and boring.  You travel city to city playing poker and buying properties, which isn't bad; but in many of the poker tournaments you are forced to play are against ~50 or so opponents (as other players lose, they get replaced with new players).  A single tournament can last 6-8+ hours.  Then you move to the next city and repeat.  The AI you play against is varied -- some players will bluff, some will fold unless they have a pair or better -- this makes for enjoyable and realistic play.\n\nOnly buy this game if you love this tournament style of poker playing.","August 3, 2014","false","11.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"

It looks at your cards and then bets accordingly.  Example I have a pair of cards in the hole. Computer will fold if even challenged. Another example computer gets a crap hand and then raises me when I have the better hold cards. Computer ends up with a flush. The computer knows in advance if its going to win or not and bets against that. So basically it doesnt matter if you show your cards at the end of the hand or not the computer knows exactly what you have. So instead of being a game of skill it becomes a random game that depends entirely on the computer allowing you to win. Just for the record I have played online and in real life poker. I suppose if you want to learn the basic rules of poker its good for that.

It mixes heads-up, cash, small (8 player), and large (80 player) tournament play well enough to help you procrastinate and (astonishingly) develop some useful poker skills.\n\nThe AI is decent - not impressively smart, but overtly stupid, either.  On the whole, I didn't really notice trends or styles particularly to AI opponents, but their play was varied enough to keep you on your toes and make the challenge feel relatively real.  They bluff, slow-play, etc.  Real tournament players would probably be a touch more conservative, but the AI was skilled enough to make winning the bigger tournaments genuinely difficult.\n\nI struggled a bit at first, but gradually became smarter about playing conservatively early in tournaments, then opening up the throttle once I'd secured a spot in the money.  I also became much better at learning how and when to effectively bully opponents with shorter stacks.  Let's be honest, a video game won't make you a pro, but this game does force you turn off any casual poker instincts you might have and learn to play competitively.\n\nWhether you want to put in the hours to fully beat the game or just take part in an occasional AI tourney, this game is worth picking up, particularly if you're patient enough to wait for it go on sale.  I played here and there initially, then more obsessively as the tournaments got bigger.  Definitely worth whatever beans I traded for the bundle it was in.","July 19, 2015","true","32.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gambling with meaningful stakes is tense and (to some) exhilirating.  Playing cards against a machine for imaginary money is neither.  To make up for that deficiency, a computer poker game needs to add a lot of bells and whistles.  Governor of Poker 2 tried to do that with an investment mechanic and hats to unlock and  a few other extra features.  For me, it still wasn't quite enough to counterbalance the tedium of slowly playing cards against a collection of uninteresting opponents represented primarily by oversized hats.","July 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
