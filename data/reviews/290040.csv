"http://steamcommunity.com/id/majordryest/recommended/290040/","majordryest","Pyrrhickong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majordryest/","253 products in account","Though I'm saying I don't recommend it, I will say that this title has interesting ideas and it executes some of them well. However, it has glaring issues that prevent it from being truly enjoyable. As of this writing, I've beaten three of the offered games, with one of the others being a card game which has no end and one being a hack and slash gauntlet-type deal that's based more on high-score than completion. The other two I have no intention of finishing.\n\nThere are seven games featured here, but each will last you only about an hour to an hour and a half from start to finish. Which is pretty cool, I'd pay 50 dollars for seven hours worth of quality content. However, this leads to the issue of none of the games really 'sticking' with you, with one solid exception. I'll give a brief overview of each of the games without spoiling any content, as best I can:\n\n-An open-world platformer where you grow into a stronger creature to get more powers to access new areas. This is a cute title, where progression is easy and a puzzle element is mixed in. However, in order to grow, you need to eat smaller enemies. These don't respawn until you have eaten every single enemy in the area, which is annoying. The open world is solid, but the game moves at a rather casual pace. Imagine a combination of Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV, only walking a bit slower and with flutter-jump mechanics as opposed to gravity or speed wall-hopping. Good intentions are here but they don't all come together, and the slower pace of the title really shoots it in the foot.\n\n-An action-puzzle game ala Adventures of Lolo, wherein you have to eliminate all enemies and then kill yourself. This is a nicely built game, kind of a Mega Man vibe to the graphics and soundtrack. The issue I find is that, simply, you can easily put yourself in an unwinnable scenario later on. The joy of puzzles is figuring out the next step, not repeating previous steps, which would require a minute or so to recreate. It's a good concept and if you like the Eggerland series, this one won't do you wrong, just not my cup of tea compared to good ol' Lolo.\n\n-An arcade action game where you beat things up. It feels good and responsive, hitboxes are fairly solid if strict. Not a lot of depth to it, I felt, but it's a fun distraction.\n\n-An open-world platformer that's pretty much 'hey we wanted to make a Metroid thing. Here's some Metroid for you'. Honestly it has a very clever concept, wherein there are three overworld maps and you warp between them as different 'time periods', making for a very well thought-out map system. The issue is that, unfortunately, the game is dull. There is no sense of danger, very few enemy types, only two boss battles (which are both very easy), and no real environmental hazards outside of a few rooms. This leaves for a very barren-feeling map, as opposed to a Metroid title, where lava, various terrain obstacles, and a variety of enemies kept the player engaged. It's... rather dull work, honestly. Which is a shame, as the core controls are very good.\n\n-An arcade platformer similar in vein to Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr, wherein you're a helpless creature who has to use the environment to get past obstacles. There's some clever concepts, but like the afformentioned DK games, the main character moves at a snail's pace and can't survive long jumps. This makes repeating segments unbearably slow. Unlike DK and Son, additionally, enemies follow set patterns, so there's no element of action or randomness to react to; it's just figuring out the puzzle and hoping you're fast enough to do it. It was fun through the start, and the graphics and style and undeniably charming, but it grates and I doubt many will finish this segment.\n\n-A card game. Frankly, it's just a unique concept that doesn't pan out due to being a single-player card game that you likely won't be asking a friend to play with you.\n\n-A vertical shooter set in feudal Japan. If there's a game that's worth your money, it's this one. Different enemies giving different types of shots, being able to reflect enemy fire with quick enough reflexes, an upgrade system, managing your special weapon types, and reasonable enemy placement. It's a bit on the easy side, but mechanics are well thought out and constantly engaging. Easily the best of the bunch.\n\nThe issue with Retro Game Crunch is that it's a game that doesn't quite live up to its potential. It's very solid, but for a fifteen dollar asking price and competition as stiff as VVVVVV, Meat Boy, and Eversion for 'simple concepts harkining to a retro time period', it really does not hold up. If this game goes to $5 on a sale, I'd say it's worth your time. Odds are one will appeal to you, and that one might even be really good. But I'd wait until then, and not jump on a 50% off - wait for the lower. I love retro games, the entire retro vibe, and I want to see more from this developer, they're smart people. This outing just leaves a poor taste in my mouth at the end, unfortunately.","September 10, 2014","false","5.1"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","49","60","0","2"

A splash screen for the collection would be nice.\n\nUsing a pad is great for the games themselves but the game never tells you what button does what. Tip- If a game ever tells you to press tab, it means left shoulder button.\n\nThere isn't an easy way to switch games, you have to take the game out of fullscreen and quit to bring up the selection menu and I feel there should be an easier way, such as pressing B.\n\nThe games themselves are fun, some are deeper than others. Gaia-ttack, the side scrolling brawler has local co-op, but the button config looks like a nightmare to play. I don't understand the card game properly but it will probably see the least play even if I did. Each game is crafted with care, but you may not like them all.\n\nAt the full price of $14, it makes each game $2, but it still feels pricey. Without wanting to devalue the hard work of the devs, the experience feels like something in the $10 range. Maybe steam spoils me and I'm a bad judge, but for the full steam price, I think more care should go into game pad support, switching games and giving the selection menu a splash screen title that fades into the menu wouldreally help tighten the experience and push the game firmly into the $10+ price point.\n\nIt's still fun.","May 20, 2014","true","2.1"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","33","35","0","0"

What Retro Game Crunch does well over Retro Game Challenge however is include a much more fun lineup of titles. This, much like Retro Game Challenge however I'm afriad will go unnoticed by most people.\n\nRetro Game Crunch is basically just a collection of individual retro inspired games that all have a sort of NES look and appeal to them. All are completely new and original though, drawing only inspiration from games of past. Most of the games have a nice learning curve from casual to intermediate, with only 1 really having a higher learning curve, that being the 1 non action game in the bunch. 6 of the games range from various action subgenres from platformers to shoot em ups, with a 7th game being a sort of number based card battle game. The stand out title for me is definitley Super Clew Land, a platformer where the main character evolves throughout the game as you eat different objects and play a color match game within the game. Evolving gives you new abilities, such as being able to swim, and break through blocks. Another standout is Shuten, in which you play a sword wielding guy who can steal his enemies moves to use against them. It is also a fun casual shoot em up.\n\nThe graphics are all nice and have good clean and chunky sprites, and the music is pleasant and fitting. There is also built in controller support, with preloaded mapping that makes sense for the individual games, as well as keyboard support.\n\nAll in all, a solid collection of games. My only gripe is that the UI does not allow you to exit a game to go back to the main menu, unless you minimize the window, and select quit from the file options. Small gripe, and nothing major. It just would make more sense to include the option to go back to the main menu within the game.","December 23, 2015","true","1.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

One game has you go around eating critters to evolve, another has you jump up platforms & defeat enemies/bosses, while another is a metroidvania type of game, one is a shmup, one is a classic arcade style puzzle platformer, one is a 2 player card game, then another has you trying to kill yourself.

This is the only real indie game from Chattanooga that has gotten any real press. That above all other reasons is why I bought this game.\nThe games:\nAs this is 6 game loosely connected I will review them all by\nSuper Clew Land: I first played this as the flash game version. That version was incomplete and lacks an ending. This version causes you to leave out of boredom. It looses steam quickly after the original flash version ends. Not really worth the time to finish.\nEnd of Line: Puzzle game about suicide. Shows the whole theme idea kind of bite them. Repetative and hard in pretty bad ways.\nGaia Attack: fun beat-em-up. Kind of like Super Crate Box, and well worth your time to play.\nParadox Lost: While I like Metroidvania games, this never really spoke to me.\nWub-Wub Rescue: The stand-out of the collection. A game as adorable as it is brutal and repetative (in the it's your fault kind of way). Here is how adorable it is, the pause menu says PAWS. If only this were polished into a full release.\nBrain and Hearts: Fine. Sort of a cute take on old windows pre-install games. Can be pretty hard, but unlike Solitare it is never unwinnable.\nShuten: Fine shoot-em-up. One of the better games. Fun Japan Samurai stylings, and some cool mechanics.\nThis collection is really lacking in coding polish. The only way to exit out is to press escape then close the window. There is no way to close out using a controller, which I think means it would break big picture mode. I have not tried this. This collection delivered exactly what the Kickstarter promised, as bunch of jam games made of the course of a year. Now the extra time gave the team time to make something better than jam games, but worse than full release games. This is by no means greenlight trailer bad, but I wished they had polished the interface more. The art, game design, and game feel are great, though. You might want to wait for a sale, but ten bucks for six games is pretty good, though. Many of these games are better then some full release games, though.

The collection, while not all perfect, is not only robust but fun to play. There's everything from a metroidvania to a shmup, a Flashback-like puzzle platformer and a rage platformer.\n\nSuper Clew Land is the first game and, honestly, I don't know if it should be- because it's easily the best. The game's mechanics are engaging and thoughtful and the scale is absolutely perfect. The level and character designs are fun and difficulty ramps up perfectly. It was the kind of old school magic of Shovel Knight in a 1-hour package (10/10)\n\nEnd of Line is a fun puzzle game with some unique mechanics. It's nothing to write home about but, coming from someone who doesnt particularly like top-down puzzle games it was fun enough to keep me playing for a half hour with a colorful pallete and a really solid pacing (7/10)\n\nGAIAttack is where things fall apart. Again, I really have to commend these guys for tackling so much and getting most things really right, better then some other indie developers who expert in these genres. But GAIAttack is just not good. The color pallette and designs are fantastic, as per every game, and the mechanics are even fun. GAIAttack is a gradually moving beat-em-up side scroller with a great combat system....that doesn't work. Movement is clunky and most attacks are unresponsive and are never satisfying when hit. It's a beautiful looking and designed fighter that works about half the time (4/10)\n\nParadox Lost was interesting. I like it, I like it a lot but it's first impressions were worrying. For about 10 minutes this game looked EXACTLY like Metroid down to character and map design and it played the same. That being said there is a fantastic time mechanic that keeps things interesting and fast-paced and begins to shape the game an identity of its own. It ends a bit uprubtly as the game has an overall objective that's mostly optional- a metroidvania with an optional completion bonus. It doesnt really tell you when it's about to end though. (8/10)\n\nWub Wub Rescue looked like a fun game but it's the kind of genre I can't stand so I skipped it\n\nBrains & Hearts is a really dense card game (that's right, a card game) that will finally click after two or three tries. It's somewhat intuitive but it has such a dense interworking system of mechanics that it never feels like you quite get it even though its fun to play. Think of it like trying to design an original, never before seen card game. Obviously you have to come up with something new but you also have to stray away from everything done before which makes for a complicated set of rules. It's hard to describe, obviously, but I had fun for the ten or twenty minutes I played (7/10)\n\nAnd finally there's Shuten which is a Chinese-legend, ninja toting, shuriken and monster filled shmup. It's really fun and I'm still sinking my teeth into it. It has a weapon-stealing mechanic and colorful boss fights. It's nothing mind blowing but it's certainly above-average and even has some RPG elements. Above all, it's just plain fun (8/10)\n\nSo, overall, Retro Game Crunch is certainly worth $10 and I picked it up for just $1. It has a view overall problems (no key-binding, launches multiple instances, even some lag in some games) but for the few hours I'll ned up sinking into it and just for Super Clew Land alone I'm really happy I bought this- Highly Recommended","December 28, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shuten's system allows you a choice of weaponry through the gameplay itself, rather than some sub-menu; then throws formations that are tuned to one type and not another - effectively letting the player choose their own 'easy part' and 'hard part' of each stage. The level design in Wub Wub Wescue and End of Line take very few elements and do a large variety of things with them which keep the game fresh and fun. The AI of Brains and Hearts is challenging and competent, and yet totally beatable - it's just a player with the understanding of the rules, after all. And GAIAttack is just a fun, brilliant balance between Smash Bros fighting and Kid Icarus-style vertical platforming (sans the screen-wrapping); it's tough as nails! You will Game Over plenty, and just resetting your score is the perfect punishment/compliment to infinite continues, and it's Souls-like bonfire continue points.\n\nThis package is a ridiculously awesome deal, but not because it's retro. It's because it's freaking brilliant. The only thing it leaves me hungry for is a top-down adventure game from them, since End of Line has the adequate framework for that already. But if all is good, this team will stick together, and continue to crank out the brightness.","May 24, 2014","true","11.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

I was greatly surprised by the quality titles within this package. There is a little bit of something for everyone here. Platformers, adventure, fighting, puzzles, shooters and even a card game! Each game controls incredibly well and looks fantastic. If I had these games when I was a kid playing the NES, they'd fit perfectly alongside any quality games of the late 1980's.\n\nWhile all the games here have merit, I would say that in my opinion, Super Clew Land is probably my favorite as I believe it is the most unique. The other games you could find similar games if you looked hard enough, but Clew Land has elements I've never seen in a platformer before. A Dr. Mario type mechanic within the game, an evolving protagonist and hidden treasures to find within one large map all make for an entertaing romp with this cute little blob...thing.\n\nHonestly if you are looking to regain a feeling of nostalgia while at the same time experiencing something new, Retro Game Crunch is a title I highly endorse. If its on sale, I would definitely pick it up. I hope they make a sequel!","April 3","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You know how a TON of indie games try to catch that retro feel of old NES/SNES/SEGA Genisis games? Well this game catches it, bottles it, and improves on it.\n\nPlaying Super Clew Land I felt a lot of nostalgia. There was something familiar and comforting about it. I'm still not completely convinced it ISN'T a classic game I played in my childhood. At the same time it's clearly modern. Whereas retro games had absolutely no concept or narrative (you're an italian plumber fighting turtles and a spiky turlte monster to save a princess), in Crew Land you're a young Earth creature. At first you can only walk. Eventually you evolve to jump. Then you can swim.\n\nThis aspect of evolving game mechanics continues and the levels are designed in such a way that you never feel that you've hit a barrier.\n\nBuy. This.

Evolve your little guy. BUt then it just becomes a sorta-annoying 'hunt for the hidden gems' thing, with some very memory-based puzzling (think Meat Boy-esque) that isn't really exciting, just endless trial and error.\n\nGame 2: End of Line - you are an inexplicably suicidal robot. Your only goal is to die. Move boxes, kill the heal-bots, and die. Just a pusher puzzler.\n\nGame 3: Gaia-Attack - Seems to be an endless upwards hi-score type game, punch the other little guys, move upwards. That's about it, it seems.\n\nGame 4: Paradox Lost - A small metroidvania.. Decent enough, but the graphics are a little 'too' retro, as in not super well done, just lots of empty space and some ugly levels, but the movement and all was pretty snappy, so there's that. Axiom Verge may be a better choice if you want that.\n\nGame 5: Wub-Wub Wescue - A very slow-moving puzzler with some timing based stuff. Think the old NES Burger Time or similar. Slowly move around, dodge stuff, get to the top after climbing ladders and stuff.\n\nGame 6: Brains & Hearts - A little Yahtzee/Uno-esque fusion card game. The rules are pretty poorly explained and they'll drop all kinds of funky cards on you before you get the hang of it by far. Has some slot-machine esque cards/mechanics seemingly (You have a three card row, your opponent has a three card row, you can match diagonally, etc.)\n\nGame 7: SomethingInJapanese Shuten - A top-down shooter with a little samurai guy. I felt this was kinda the best of the bunch. You have no default 'gun' besides a sword swipe, but you can 'steal' weapons of various enemies to get what is essentially a 'gun', with various attacks.\n\nIt's worth noting most all of them are one-hit-you-die type games with variable lives/save points/etc.\n\nI got this one for like $1 so.. eh.. worth it for that. I would get a refund, personally, if I had paid $5 or more, and no doubt would have requested a refund at $10.

Clew Land Complete\n-End of line\n-Gaia-ttack!\n-Paradox LOST\n-Wub-Wub Wescue\n-Brains & Hearts\n-Shuten\n\n\nLet me give them all a lile preview coz some are maybe good some are wweeeeellll and other maybe just "naa"...\n\n-Super! Clew Land Complete\nI didnt play this game very much but it remembers me on a game i played a bit on the SNES ("Evulotions"???). you start as a...slime(?) and cant do anything, not even jump. Its a nice plattformer but very retro like. I can say i will play it a bit more to say if it is really good OR bad but as much as i played its pretty funny.\n\n-End of line\nFirst i dont got it honestly, but after some tries i got this game. You play a Robot which mission (?) is it to destroy every heal bot - and kill/ destroy yourself at the end. Ok, coz there is no logic behind (...i guuueeeesss) its kinda wierd but a smooth game play. Still the idea is wierd and also there is not really any kind of help if you get stuck or you just dont know "what this could do" or "what do i HAVE to do". Its not bad but also not good...\n\n-Gaia-ttack!\nA retro beat-n-up. Its lovely made - also i guess with some more players it also makes even more fun. You play a Gaia(?) and smashes (3 button system: jump, smash, special) the way to the top of the stage where a boss battle waits. Not bad, honeslty but it could get quick boring coz its kinda the same after all BUT not bad.\n\n-Paradox LOST\nA Metroid-like (very...) Plattform shooter....where i got confused very quickly. I mean the first item you get is a "Paradox tear" which kills yourself so you can go back in time. Okeeeyy. But next to this is this "time changing" stuff. I mean, i got the gun (after the first fight which you also have to understand somehow coz you dont can fight and the enemy "shoots him(/her?) self with his(/her??) own gun if the crystals which are in the room bounces the bullets back at him(/her???)), runned a bit around, got a charge shoot and now i travelt like HELL into the past, present AND future. Its maybe a nice game also it plays very much like Metroid but its kinda confusing. Not bad but confusing. very...confusing...\n\n-Wub-Wub Wescue\nThis is i guess one of the golden games in the collection here. Wub-wub Wescue is a nice plattformer where you play a dog(? i guess its a dog yea coz it.....barks.) where you have to come to the finish (a guy captured by some other guys) in the right rythym. yea, the music in the game needs a lot attantion coz the game plays after it. You also learn sometimes own music which changes the speed, let snakes fall asleep or bats get friendly. This one makes a lot of fun coz its anyhow cute made and pretty funny.\n\n-Brains & Hearts\nI guess most people dont got this game. ACTUALLY, i like it. the rules of this game a pretty confusing but after some time I got them. Brains & Hearts are a card game in which you win this game by getting the cards from the enemy. The rules are like: get a chain of cards, 3 of the same or use the hole from the chain by get the middle of it from the enemy (i know it sounds confusing but in easy: if you have a 2 and a 3 you can get a 4 from the enemy, if you have a 3 on the field and the enemy has two other 3s OR if you have a 3 and a 5 and the enemy a 4). It actually let you play more than one round, mostly, its pretty adictive, Srs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78cl4yE5TYU\n\n-Shuten\nA shooter with a samurai which thiefes the enemy weapons to use them against them? Sounds nice also it plays nice. Its really a game you can play a bit longer also i guess, from all games in this collection, its the one with the best grafic (but i cant say really...).\n\n\nAfter i reviewed the games now to the -/+ part\n\n+7 retro games\n+8 bit style\n+Old Nostalgie fans will love this games\n\n-Missing manuals in some games\n-For "Grafic♥♥♥♥♥s" not a good collection\n-"old stoned" games, nothing(really) new\n\nFact:\nRetro Game crunch are a nice collection for retro and nostalgie players. Worth the price and you could have a lot fun with it. Some games are pretty confusing and you need to think how stuff works right by yoruself mostly. So Older player generations will maybe like, new generation players should MAAAAAYBE think twice about to buy it coz for them it could be get quick boring.\n\nOWN Fact (for review writer self):\nI really enjoy this collection and will now play a lot more rounds B&H.

You have no default 'gun' besides a sword swipe, but you can 'steal' weapons of various enemies to get what is essentially a 'gun', with various attacks.\n\nIt's worth noting most all of them are one-hit-you-die type games with variable lives/save points/etc.\n\nI got this one for like $1 so.. eh.. worth it for that. I would get a refund, personally, if I had paid $5 or more, and no doubt would have requested a refund at $10. These games are probably good to fart around with a bit but I wouldn't say the gameplay or anything is compelling enough to stick around for, maybe great for coffee breaks or just to unwind for a few.","December 14, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For example, in the game Super Clew Land, you eat things to evolve. It looks like a simple platformer, but when you eat something, you move blocks around in your stomach to form a simple pattern. It adds a puzzle element not unlike the Dr, Mario series. It keeps going.  In End of Line your goal is to kill you and everyone else around you, Wub Wub Wescue is a platformer with magic songs, Shuten is about using your enemies' projectiles against them, etc.\n\nThat being said, this game needs a lot of playtesting. The controls are very wonky and unintuitive. For example, in Wub Wub Wescue, you use ASD to move, and Z to jump.  It took me a while to figure out how the game worked. Unfortunately, most, if not all of the games are like this. To top it off, some of the level designs aren't fully refined. I got stuck in End of Line a few times and had to go back to the main menu to reset the entire game. It would have been a bit easier if there was an in-game menu to help you return to the title screen, or if the level had been playtested and fixed.\n\nDespite its flaws, Retro Game Crunch is a good set of games. Is it worth fifteen dollars? Maybe. I got my copy from Humble. Is it worth playing? Definitely. This is the game to play when you're looking for a bit of nostlgia and don't want to play your typical Zelda/Mario clone. Its interesting mechanics make it a must-play for game developers and anyone who appreciates that sort of thing. If you're not into innovation, then don't play this.","July 23, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
