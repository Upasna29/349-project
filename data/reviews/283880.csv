Or have a mixture to your liking.\nThe game contains superb music and dialogues, mostly voice acted along with nicely done character portraits.\nThere is also another feature I quite like in the game, was the realism feel to when your character gets cold or hungry. How it effects her during the game, giving you more of a challenge whilst playing. But there is a choice to to turn down the difficulty if you didn't prefer it.\n\nThis does bring me back memories when I use to play Kings Quest.\n\nThank you to all the developers for this amazing free game!","March 21, 2014","true","11.0"," 156 of 166 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","156","166","0","2"

In many ways this game is better than any of the originals. The combat is better and the addition of extra quests gives more reason to explore the world. It's challenging and charming with great writing and luscious scenery.

The title is set in a fantasy realm and tasks your character, a burgeoning young adventurer, with saving the world from an ancient evil bent on bringing about Ragnarok and thus ending the world as we know it. As with most classic R.P.G.'s you choose your character class, there are three to pick from in this title, and as your character levels up you gain experience points for whichever abilities you use frequently like the old saying "the more you do something the better you get at it".\n\nThe story in this game is quite entertaining and chock full of viking lore and mythology. The gameplay and combat while simple are both quite fun and highly addictive. You'll die time and time again and scream to the heavens that you'll never play this @#$%& game again only to boot it up two hours later. There are many types of unique adversaries to battle and puzzling puzzles to solve. The dialog and voice acting is top notch. You'll converse with people and creatures which could terrify you or make you laugh your pants off with the strange and sometimes hilarious things that they say or do. The title has a great immersive feel to as it applies a timescale of morning, afternoon and evening to the questing. Your character also must feed herself, can suffer from exposure due to the harsh climate and needs sleep or rest to remain healthy just like in real life. The sound and music in this title are terrific and definitely capture the feel of the game perfectly.\n\nIf you're perceptive enough you will also get a kick out of the many pop-culture references and game developement jokes humorously sprinkled about the title...some of which will make you laugh out loud. The developers certainly aren't afraid to laugh at themselves or anyone else. This game is just fantastic and I am having so much fun playing it and one really great thing is that it is free which is shocking because I would have gladly paid for this amount of entertainment. If you're a fan of old-school roleplaying games, retro-games or just crave a great adventure title then you will not be dissapointed with this wonderful independent gem. One more thing to add, many people say that this title plays like the old "Quest For Glory" series of games which I myself am not familiar with but I think this game plays like Skyrim...if Skyrim had come out in 1991.","March 8, 2015","true","27.4"," 84 of 89 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","84","89","5","7"

Is it a promo? Perhaps a conspiracy? Maybe Valve is buggy? Absolutely not! I have played the game far before it hit Steam, and I'll say it is a real deal.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this game is a geniune point&click adventure game in the spirit of old Quest for Glory Series. The inspiration and some mechanics will be familiar to the people who played those games...but you will see it is actually far better then those old games. Let us see what we have in the pot.\n\nFirst of all, you are playing a Heroine who was travelling to city of Fornsigtuna gets ambushed by an ettin (two-headed giant). But thanks to luck, they are unable to eliminate their target. And from there, your story of heroine-ism starts (of course, your first task is to find some food, naturally)! I should say, playing the game from Heroine perspective adds quite a spice to the game, signifying that the game will be quite different then Quest for Glory games we know.\n\nYou can choose from three different kinds of classes with their own unique approach to both main quest and side quests. As well as by buying some cross-class skills you can spice up your game even further...but do not rely on that too much. Three classes are Fighter, Mage and Thief. I would suggest you to take a glance at the manual for the explanation of skills&such which may come in handy.\n\nThe dialogues are fully voiced and there is no shortage of interesting characters...where I'd like to refrain mentioning them for the time being. But one major thing you will notice is this: When a character is at the presence of another, the dialogue lines may differ or other character can add a comment of his own...which makes the dialogue system even richer then it already is. Aside that, several minigames (wizard challenges, gambling with Fornsigtuna locals etc) add to the charm of this game.\n\nOne major point is the survival. Yes, you have to eat food to survive and on top of that you have to find a way to keep yourself warm...since it is Fimbulwinter...it is more crucial then ever. Since there are several ways to skin a cat, there are several ways to survive. By the way, as you might see the game features a solid inspiration by Norse Mythology...so prepare to meet several characters and events which has a part over there.\n\nYou will not regret playing this game. Ragnarok awaits you!","March 20, 2014","true","0.2"," 110 of 135 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","110","135","0","2"

It's hard not to recommend since it's FREE.\n\nEDIT 2: Just finished the game. Took me 28 hours! And I didn't do everything I could since my score was only 455 out of 500.\n\nEDIT: I've played some more so I can give a bit more indepth comments. I'm going to talk mostly about the RPG aspects since the adventure (ie: point & click) genre is pretty well known. Just think of Monkey Island or any other adventure game and add this:\n\nThere are 3 classes you can choose: Warrior, Sorceress and Rogue. Each class starts with different stats (Strength, agility e.t.c.) but also different starting skills such as Sorceress starts with Herbalism and Rogue with Sneaking. By spending 25 skill points (you start with 50) you can learn a new skill at the beginning of the game or you can increase your stats. So the warrior class can start with the magic skill which enables her to cast spells. As far as I know you can only get new skills when you start the game so if you don't know herbalism when you've started you will never know it. Which adds replayability.\n\nSpeaking of replayability. Different classes have different solutions to puzzles and side-quests. So while a Sorceress can save someone that is freezing to death in the middle of the forest by casting Flame aura on him a warrior or rogue have to find some other way to save him. I also believe you cannot do everything (side-quests, areas, puzzles) with just 1 playthrough. But each class can get a maximum of 500 points, you know those you get by solving puzzles in adventure games. Nothing to do with leveling up stats. So every class can do equally much although different things.\n\nThe leveling up mechanics work similar to Morrowind and similar games. By using a skill or attribute you have a chance of increasing it. So if you're carrying a lot or using a melee weapon in combat you have a high chance of increasing your strength.\n\nThe combat in the game is quite unique. You use the qweaf keys to attack, I am a Sorceress which means w = staff attack, e = Magic Missile, d = Flame Aura. zxc is used for dodging, z = dodge left, x = duck (uses a lot of stamina), c = dodge right. 1234 keys is used for special attacks but I don't currently have any.\n\nThe actual combat is real time and while you can't move around you have to know when to dodge and when to attack. Different enemies have different attacks obviously and they can dodge your attacks as well. While you can find a couple of silver coins or mead on a bandit don't expect them on a varg (basically a evil wolf). But if you know Animal Ken (I think) and have daggers you can skin them.\n\nUnlike other RPGs / adventure games you can freeze to death, starve e.t.c. in this game. Yes, you actually have to eat and sleep! Depending on what skills you know how you get your food will be different. Don't expect to succeed at fishing if you don't know Animal Ken, likewise don't expect to find edible roots if you don't know herbalism.\n\nThe game also has a day / night cycle which affects where characters are, if a shop is open or not, enemies, for instance trolls get turned to stone by sunlight so if you want to find one then wait until nightfall.\n\nFinally this is a truly free to play game. There is no microtransactions of any kind. So if this sounds like a game you would enjoy there is no reasons not to try it.","March 21, 2014","true","29.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

When I finally looked at the clock, it was 5:00AM in the morning, and I was still reluctant to power down the computer and go off to bed. I finally gave in and did so with a smile on my face, and with thoughts of old school gaming dancing in my head.\n\nThis game reminded me of the kind of games that I first started out playing as a kid... The kind that made me feel like I was stepping into the pages of an adventure and/or fantasy book, where the journey itself was everything! Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok, is an ode and a love letter to that idea. Mind you, I haven't finished playing the full game yet, but so far I am enjoying the hell out of it.\n\nIt is wonderful and honestly I cannot believe that it is presented on Stream to us as free! I've paid for a few games that were no where near as good as this one is...\n\nIt is strong on having a unique cast of characters with good, steady character development, intriguing storylines, and subtle dialogue in spots, that if missed may have you wondering what to do next... The map is rather large, and allows you to roam within in interesting ways. There's no porting when traveling so be prepared to walk everywhere. The combat system is straight forward. You have to use the left side of your keyboard and mouse as the default settings. However, it does allow you to alter those setting and bind to other keys if you wish. The vocal talents in my opinion should be celebrated! They bring a sense of realism and depth to a cast of characters, ranging from the serious too the down right silly. The graphics pop with fun colors, without giving you a head ache, and the music and sounds are done in such a way as not to drive you nuts. I found myself humming the melodies several times, as most of the musical score is quite lovely. Settings for these can also be adjusted to your liking should the defaults bother you. I remind you check the difficulty setting in the control panel and go through the tutorial at the start of the game. Again, all of which is pretty straight forward. And finally, without sounding sexist I hope, it is very nice to see a main character in this genre be a woman. It is a rare thing. However, don't think of this as a "chic" gamer's game. I think men will enjoy this one too.\n\nSo in closing, read everything, click on everything (the puzzles range from simple to hard, so again take your time....), explore and roam, and listening to every character's tale... The game is rich with things to do and how to do them is up to you. It is fun but can be challenging at times so be patient.\n\nTake your love of books, reading (Norse Mythology is featured heavily here and done quite well...), and gaming, and now weave them together and you've got Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok!","March 23, 2014","true","17.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

However, if you're a fan of the old-school point-and-click games of yore, and pine for the days of Sierra like I sometimes do, this will be right up your ally.  You do need patience, as it's slow going traversing the map, but that's the nature of the beast.  Battle vargs, troll, brigands and more as either a warrior, rogue or spellcaster, and save the world from Ragnarok.\n\nThe only thing I don't care for is how they've made the need for sleep and shelter function.  You can turn it off (good! I don't like bothering with those types of things), but that also puts the game in the easiest mode for all battles, too (bad, so far the fights I've encountered have been too easy on this setting.)  The solution is to play fast and loose with the difficulty setting; I have it on a more difficult setting until the game indicates I'm going to die of exposure (for crying out loud, put on more than a cloak! what is with people underdressing for the weather in games?!) or hunger, and then I turn it down and continue on with that setting until I eat, sleep or find somewhere warm to recover.\n\nDon't let that put you off, though.  It's a terrific little game and honestly, I feel like they're doing themselves a disservice by giving it away; I'd have paid for it.  In any case, give it a try.

Taking heavy inspiration from the Quest for Glory Series (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Glory) that was released throughout the 90s the game doesn't fail to live up to it's high standards.\n\nThe story is pretty straight forward and once again pays homage to the Quest for Glory series. Like in the older title you are a hero(ine) who is suddenly stranded in a foreign land and then forced to deal with impending doom. The story takes many twists and turns along the way and is intricately crafted to keep you on your toes.\n\nThe gameplay is equally inspired. You have a choice of three character classes to chose from when you start. Each class has their own unique traits and skills. The enjoyable part is, much like the classics, each obstacle you face can usually be solved in different ways. Magic, brute strength, or sleight of hand can be used to accomplish each task differently.  Conversational options can also change the required task. This creates the chance for a varied play through and replayability.\n\nThe combat is the Quest for Glory series was never it's strong point and it's not the strongest point of this game either. It does get the job done though and isn't a turn off.\n\nThe music and sound effects and crisp and enjoyable and fits the atmosphere of the current screen well. The voice acting is excellent if somewhat varied in it's quality.\n\nThe artwork is amazing. It represents the 90s game style perfectly. Backgrounds that look like they could have been hand painted fit together well and make the world feel well put together. The sprite work is clean and well executed. The portrait pictures for the characters are interesting and give a face to what would otherwise be a handful of pixels.\n\nAll together the game is simply amazing, especially  for something that is offered for free on Steam. If you're the person who feels adventure gaming hit it's peak in the 90s and misses the feeling those games give you this one will be exactly what you want. It feels like a game that was made by Sierra in that era and simply unearthed later.\n\nIf you've never played the classics then I still recommend you give this one a shot. Then after you complete this one I recommend you check out some of classics that inspired it and run through the entire Quest for Glory series.","June 23, 2015","true","8.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","3"

Imagine King's Quest but with the ability to fight foes in actual combat instead of dying every five seconds to the environment. Heroine's Quest takes much of its inspiration from these series of games and adds a few mechanics of its own.\n\nRight away you'll notice the generous use of norse mythology, even hinted in the game's subtitle. The decision to have this set so directly in norse mythology feels somewhat odd to me. Rather than creating its own mythology that's inspired by real life mythology, this one references it directly and loosely retells those stories. It's not a bad thing - Disney does that all the time. But this one feels a tad out of place.\n\nThere's some good humor here and there. The squirrel is great. I enjoyed the Tetris game over. I feel it could use a few more laughs though. Roughly 80% of the characters are intensely serious, and they don't quite gel in a world that has silly characters like Aurvandel.\n\nThe art and music is fantastic. The game world feels somewhat barren, but this is more a fault of the genre, as many adventure games tend to include many screens with little interactivity. I would have liked more items sprinkled on the ground that you could pick up.\n\nThe hunger/survival mechanic is strange at best. Adventure games generally reward you for exploring. Heroine's Quest instead punishes you for straying too far, or taking your time. Because of the survival gimmick, the puzzle-solving seems to take a backseat because you're always pressed for food and warmth. Thankfully you can shut this feature off, but I did try to play it as intended and did not find it increased the fun factor at all.\n\nThe combat system is pretty simplistic. It's one-on-one real time combat with menu inputs, much like the QFG1-3. Nothing special, and not irritating. It's just there.\n\nMost of the game is voice acted, which is rare for indie adventure games. Huge thumbs up for that! Most voices are good, though Hervor sounds curiously tired and disinterested. I get that there's a deadly winter, and everyone is at their wits end, but I would have liked a more likeable character to wake up to first thing than her.\n\nThe map is greatly appreciated! This also gets a huge thumbs up. That is definitely something missing from just about every adventure game.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of this game is the fact that it is free! Try it out. You've got absolutely nothing to lose but time. The sheer amount of work that must have gone into it cannot be understated. I enjoyed it enough that I believe it deserves a donation. I give this game a 8/10\n\nEDIT: Fixed card info thanks to TrickZZter","August 24, 2015","true","16.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

Oh, it's also an RPG.\nI'm going to be honest here: I never played the original games that were an inspiration for Heroine's Quest - the Quest for Glory saga, which had 5 titles, the first one released on 1989 via Sierra Entertainment. They were just amazing in every aspect - great graphics, mechanics, gameplay overall, but what they made stand out from other adventure games was the immense amount of work done to make every puzzle solvable with several solutions. And of course the RPG~ish implementation of stats.\nNormally, what you see in adventure games is a very linear path that barely has something new to tell each time. They're mostly interactive novels, in a sense. That's why I liked Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis so much, when I was a kid - it was because you have paths: Fists, Wits, and Team, and every path featured different puzzles. Quest for Glory took that idea but exploded in so many ways, you don't have 3 paths, you have 3 ways of solving every puzzle in the game.\n\nSo when I found out this game, I though "wow, this is incredible. There's so much amount of work and love put onto this game, I can't believe it's free". So that's another strong point. This game is free. It was done by the developers in their free time, and took them 4 years to get it done.\n\nReally, there are no words to describe why Heroine's Quest is such a huge milestone in the adventure genre, because everything fits. The tutorial is great, the combat (while cumbersome) works, the plot is completely taken from the Norse mythology which is fantastic, and lately, the setting overall just does it. Great humor, also, that wizard and his way of talking is something I'll always remember, and I love any medium that tries to do new things breaking the fourth wall.\n\nWhile anyone can complain about tons of small details and bugs of this game, it's just so small when you take into account the amount of work it needed to be done.\n\nI can honestly say that this is one of the best free games ever made, and it completely raised the bar on what can be achieved for the genre. I think that developers should excuse the linear path less, when we can get things like Heroine's Quest. Also, I think that Dropsy (currently being developed) will be another step into the right direction.\n\nAs a side note, I'd like to mention that in 2014 we got the release of Quest for Infamy, another game with the same style of Quest for Glory. That one might also be worth a recommendation, but Heroine's Quest is still the best contender for the throne's legacy.","December 26, 2014","true","38.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

I have no idea. Why is it free? Still clueless.\n\nWhat I do know is that whoever made this game was very passionate. Nearly every single object in this game can be talked to, interacted with, and looked at all with humrous consequence; the game chiding your every stupid move. Not to say that this makes it a good game, but it's one of the many clear indications that the developer put a lot of time into the title and didn't want to make any action you could possibly do feel simple or redundant.\n\nNot just an adventure game, it's also a straight up Western RPG. The NPCs are deep and the fighting mechanics are simple yet refined. Given that I haven't played any other point and click rpgs in my life, (such as the Hero's quest series that the game is based off of) I don't know how it compares; but I've enjoyed what I've seen so far.","March 21, 2014","true","3.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

It's not a demo. There are no F2P gimmicks either. It's truly a labor of love.\n\nSo now that we got that out of the way, this is a great game. The gameplay, setting, and characters are deeply nostalgic for Quest for Glory, King's Quest, and old-school Sierra adventure game fans. The gameplay has actually taken a few modern design sensibilities to heart, adding more combat complexity and skill improvement notifications. The rich Norse setting is brought to life with colorful, interactive 2D backgrounds. While this game has a bit more text to pour through than the old Sierra games, I feel that most of the fully voice-acted characters have interesting personalities, and more conversation options are unlocked as you discover more of the world. The only thing I miss is QFG4's sardonic narrator making fun of you for trying to use a shovel on a tree--the text is there, but a voice would be more enjoyable.\n\nI would have easily paid $20-30 bucks for this well-polished game, even though I am a miserly Steam-sale-only buyer. It must be the nostalgia factor. Rest assured, however, that if you liked Skyrim or Fallout, and you too Want To Be a Hero, there is also something mysterious and playful here to discover.

I was an old member of the Hero6 scene back in the day and remember the first screenshots of this game. Wonderful to see it finally released years later.\n\nGreat things:\n+ Old Norse setting really adds to the game, with appearances by Loki, the valkyries, Sigurd, frost giants and tons of lore that will make you want to read up on viking mythology.\n+ RPG stats really do matter, much more so than they did in the Quest for Glory games.\n+ Combat system is fairly deep in the spirit of Quest for Glory 2; true, eventually you get strong enough to just click your way through most battles but each enemy has certain "tells" that you need to watch out for and dodging attacks takes practice. There are also many more enemies than I expected.\n+ TONS of sidequests, and many are optional. Rogues, since they can steal stuff, actually have the option to bypass what feels like 80% of the side stuff in this game, making the replay value really substantial.\n+ For a free AGS game, Heroine's Quest feels remarkably "alive", more so than some commercial releases. All of the characters have their own schedules and say different things when they're in the presence of different people. Some might find this annoying, since it can be hard to find a character during a certain time of day unless you know their schedule down to the hour, but I felt it added a lot of life to the adventuring experience.\n\nNot as great things:\n+ Main character is bland. I realize she's a blank slate like the hero in Quest for Glory (who was also bland but at least silent), but since the devs made the decision to make her talk, I felt they could have added more spice to her dialogue. She could have been as memorable as Roehm from Quest for Infamy.\n+ I know quest logs aren't a traditional feature of adventure games, but this game could have benefitted from one since there are just so many side quests to keep track of.\n+ Sometimes things veer into infamous "adventure game logic". Occasionally items that can be picked up are not obvious on screen and certain puzzle solutions seem illogical. I used the official walkthrough more than I would've liked and certainly would not have guessed that Rogues need to escape the blizzard with Heime by combining a certain two items.\n+ Speaking of Rogues, it's REALLY easy to get caught by guards when thieving in this game. A few warning messages like "That was a close call! You really shouldn't try robbing that house again." or "Do you REALLY want to pick his pocket?" might have been appreciated.\n\nNeutral:\n+ The food/rest/freezing mechanic definitely won't be liked by all! At the start of the game it's so hard to pass out from the cold...this really makes the first few in-game days tough since you're constantly retreating back to town for warmth and worrying about food. I didn't mind this, since it really makes you feel like a badass at the end when you're just running through the forest with your stamina barely dropping. But I also "cheated" a few times by dropping the difficulty to zero when I was in danger of freezing/starving, lol...\n\nAnyway, nitpicks aside - a lovely game! This came out the same time as Quest for Infamy, so I know a lot of people are wondering which of the two are better. Well, this one's FREE, and you can't beat that, but they're both good. In the end, Quest for Infamy is funnier and has a slightly more epic scope, but Heroine's Quest provides a tighter experience with better RPG mechanics and lore. Play both if you're an old school QFG fan.","October 3, 2015","true","20.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracohandsome/recommended/283880/","dracohandsome","DracoHandsome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracohandsome/","206 products in account","Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok is a classic graphical adventure game themed on Norse mythology with extensive combat and RPG mechanics in the vein of Quest for Glory. It is effectively an affectionate parody of classics such as King's Quest.\n\nPlease keep in mind that although the game designers are clearly FAMILIAR with Norse mythology, this game does not simply faithfully copy it - the mythical Norse characters are noticeably different in story and/or basic design from their namesakes, which to be honest is entirely consistent with classic adventure games. For instance, it is the Heroine who goes after Fafnir at Regin's request, as opposed to Sigurd who just sits around cooking great food all day. That said, savvy players may still pick up on details ahead of time, such as with Hervor.\n\nAs the dialogue in the game is fully voice-acted, you play as the nameless Heroine who must be female and who is never referred to by name. You may select one of three classes: Warrior, Mage, or Thief. Of these three, Warrior is considered easy, Mage is medium, and Thief is hard; the game will adjust the solutions to its puzzles according to which of these classes were selected. Warrior basically just muscles and fights her way through everything, you see, and is suitable for a first play until you're familiar with the general flow of the game.\n\nAfter picking a class, you are given points to boost your starting stats or add new skills - after this point, you are more or less unable to learn skills you don't already have, such as the ability to cast magic or gather herbs. I strongly advise that your first run through the game be with a vanilla Warrior with all points dumped into Agility (in my experience the slowest stat to raise).\n\nThe game is divided into several chapters, each of which makes clear a basic story goal for the Heroine to complete such as "save the guy you just saw fall down half-dead in the snow". As a fair bit of warning, you may permanently miss out on sidequests if you proceed to the next chapter without doing them, so be sure that you've done all that you can do before moving on - the game has no time limit beyond keeping the Heroine from dying to starvation / sleeplessness / freezing, so you're free to grind your skills and farm silver from the various enemies.\n\nHeroine's Quest features a rudimentary real time combat system - the reason I said to spam Agility is because you will go faster and the other guy will go slower. If an enemy catches up to you, then you have to fight it. The Heroine may not only attack from several directions, but she can also change her weapon outside of combat (presuming she has more than one) - some enemies are much easier to fight with specific weapons. She can also block (Warrior) and dodge in three directions (everyone), and may learn additional special attacks over the course of the game. Mage can use some of her spells in combat, as well.\n\nThe game's most frustrating feature by far has to be the hidden point values. Your Score itself will announce when you've accumulated a point, but your hero score and morality don't; the only indicator of those values to my knowledge is in an optional (but extremely useful!) bonus in the Warrior's endgame. Fortunately, the other two classes don't have access to that content anyway and therefore don't have to worry about their hidden values, but it's very frustrating for those of you who want a "perfect" run, especially since the game frequently updates to change what affects your hidden values.\n\nAll in all, Heroine's Quest is a wonderful game, especially considering that it is entirely payment-optional. Consider chucking a few bucks their way to help ensure they produce another game of this quality!","January 16, 2015","true","53.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The female that is a hero can be named anything you like, even some names not appropriate as names. You can chose this because it is a choise and games that are about chosing and making your own adventure often contain choises for players to make as to allow for different choises to happen.\nAn evil giant, so called because of his height and general disposition, is trying to freeze a part of the world with a freezing blizzard winter made of cold snow that freeze everything cold. This is evil and because of the evilness of his evil plan a heroine that is heroic and good and therefore opposed to evil travels from one place to the other to reach the land the giant is freezing to stop the freezing because that would be good and heroes do good things.\nBut there are complications becoause the evil giant sends his evil troll that is almost as evil as the giant but not as large or powerfull because that would make the troll a giant troll and not just a troll compared to the giant giant to stop the heroine with an avanlance that stopps her and will freeze her too if she is not saved, just as the land will freeze if not saved.\nThe heroine is saved however and can thus continue to save the land. She starts the game in the land she is trying to save in the largest of the two cities there. Or rather; the player starts the game playing the heroine in the land she is trying to save in the largest of the two cities there. The heroine being proficient in heroics can play as the class of her choise but the player must chose this class for her. The player can chose the classes warrior and rogue and wizard for the heroine, but not all at the same time because they are very different and change the game. And one heroine can only be one class because they are both one and need to be chosen separately. A heroine named in a certain way can however be a different class, even when the names are the same.\nThe game is as i wrote before fun and will in a fun way give the player and the heroine the challenge of traveling the land they try to save to travel the land and save it. it must be saved through the use of magical items and using them so there will be items in the world that must be used, but they need to be found so tht they can be used. Some items need to be used to get other items to use in a similair way, but no items are used in the same way so many items are needed to win the game and saving the land from the blizzard.\nIt is a game that looks a lot like another game, not just because both games are games but because they have very like names and have heroes that are alike those names. The game that is similar to  this game is called hero's quest and as you can see both the word hero and the word quest is similar to the words heroine's  but the word quest from this game "heroine's quest", the difference being that in this game the first word is heroine's and in hero's quest the first word is not heroine's but hero's.\n\nThis game is very good. Not Hero's quest, that also is good, but the game I am refering to now Heroine's quest. That is the game that is being reviewed and it is quite good. It is good because it is a good point and click game with good point and click elements while also in addition to the point and click elements also having elements from another genre called "RPG" from which certain RPG-element are added to this game, making it good.\n\nIf i would be asked to reccomend this game I would reccomend it. I would reccomend the game to both people who like the point and click genre, because there are elements of that genre in this game that would make the game enjoyable to the people who like such elements in their games. I would also in addition to reccomending the game to people who like games that contain point anc click elements reccomend it to people who enjoy good rpgs, because this game is both good and have rpg elements in it that is also quite good. Some people may also have played the aforementioned game i mentioned earlier called Hero's quest. If people that like that game is reading this and wondering if i think they would like this game as well in addition to the games they already like then my answer would be yes, they would like heroine's quest as well as the games they like because the game they want to know if they like contain elements of the game they already know they like and as such can be expected to like the game of heroine's quest as well.\n\nThis has been a review of a game where I have reviewed the game Heroine's quest. In my review I can be said to review the game to be both good and fun since it has good gameplay to play and fun gameplay as a result of it being good.\n\nSincerely\nThe Jarls Wizard Aurvandel, the wizard of the Jarl.\n\n\n","December 25, 2014","true","8.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","5","6","4","0"

Even with so much content in a free2play game (kickstarted), the overall quality of the content is quite high. The layout is mostly non-linear so you can literally go on adventures and explore new stuff as you like. There are not only multiple ways to solve a situation/quest, but the results can vary quite a bit too.\n-RPG elements: using a skill (any skill, not just combat-related) has a high chance to increase every time you use it. Even walking around aimlessly in the snow will boost your endurance and strength over time. There is also a hidden 'honour' value that is revealed at the end of the game.\n-Three playable classes which can be customized even further by picking up to 2 additional starting skills. Since it's an adventure, there are obviously big similarities on what you do overall, but how you do it can be completely different. Some optional content is also genuinely reserved for certain classes / skills.\n-All character dialogue is supported by voice acting.\n-The music in this game is great.\n-The setting (nordic mythology: odin, thor, loki, brunhild, fenrir, valkyries etc.) seems to have been taken quite seriously without diminishing the gameplay for the sake of it. The further you get into the game, the more fantasy elements you will come across.\n-Day & Night cycle without any global time limit (as far as I know) so you can explore the game at your own pace. Still, the daytime can have a significant role in certain situations.\n\nDepending on your taste:\n-Trivia to other games and minor pop-culture humor (as is tradition with similar games back then I guess). However, this does not really influence the feel of the game overall (e.g. there are no 'joke' characters that belong to the actualy story etc.). Think of it as having tons of little not very meaningful eastereggs. In my oppinion, the humor is not as good as in some of the great classics, but it's nice to see how much effort they put into so many little details as well.\n-Female protagonist who is not objectified (as in: the gender doesn't really influence the story, it just so happens that your character is a woman). I consider this a positive thing (I don't need huge boobies on my screen 24/7 as is the case with some other games) but you have no option to play a different (e.g. male) character, even when chosing a different class. Considering the vast amount of necessary art and voice-acting, this is quite understandable though.\n-The game is quite challenging, especially at the very beginning. There are many ways to die or otherwise screw things up (even permanently!). Thankfully you can easily save and load in 50 different slots and there is also a difficulty slider. Personally, I like starting out in a creepy, hostile world and then growing more powerful in knowledge, skill and equipment. It feels like genuine accomplishments that have to be earned. Reaching a maximum score is also very difficult (there is sooo much optional content, you will not find it all on your first playthrough) so that's another motivation to try the game over with a different class.\n\nOverall: 9/10","November 10, 2014","true","33.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are plenty of tongue-in-cheek references to Monty Python and QfG and lots of interesting Norse mythology to be a part of, as well as three different classes to play as.\n\nThe warmth and hunger mechanics lend some interesting new dangers to the game, making a focus on warmer clothing and hunting for food a priority as well as earning money to buy new weapons or tools.\n\nAs with any game of this style, I highly recommend saving with multiple save files. There is a single autosave slot, but that won't help you if it autosaves a mile from town with 1 health and you're freezing.\n\nCan't wait to buy the sequels and see where we're taken next!

It's suprisingly challenging so be patient and enjoy it slowly because games like this are rare.","March 25, 2014","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well for starters, i actually assumed this game was made in the 90s because of its retro feel. It was made fairly recently, in 2013.That's actually one of my favorite aspects of the game. It's simple, easy to follow and contains an excellent soundtrack! The story's compelling enough to make you want to play this game again.  The game offers plenty of variety in terms of customization! Another plus to the game is that there is a female protagonist in the game (hense the name Heroines Quest) and the character does not look promiscuous! Voice acting is excellent and it shows the developers dedicated themselves to making such a wonderfully simple RPG. The game also contains a wonderful soundtrack! The only dislike I have is that is there is not an opportunity to explore the other worlds/realms in this game. in chapter 2 where the norns ask of your destination(which is Svartelfeim), if you select any other world besides Svartelfeim (along with answering questions about what you seek and who told you to do so), your character gets sent to the void and you lose the  game. Also, in the begining of the game there is a quest which involves another realm, but you do not get a chance to also do that quest. Overall a wonderful game to play, and I would definately recommend it! =)","July 3, 2015","true","91.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It also took me a while to figure out that you are supposed to hold he dodge buttons down, and even then the timing is a little hard to do, especially if you want to turn the speed up to make traveling quicker. It also don't pause in most menus, making the timing of actions on the field rather annoying with having to messaround with a lot of options and menus.\n\nIt makes up for it for having pretty good writing, a slightly more expancive and interesting RPG system then Quest for Glory, and NPCs with schedules who interact with things a bit more.

It's not perfect but what is?\n\nAt first I was rather put off by the sort of flat voice acting, and the constent need to keep warm limiting your exploration. It also took me a while to figure out that you are supposed to hold he dodge buttons down, and even then the timing is a little hard to do, especially if you want to turn the speed up to make traveling quicker. It also don't pause in most menus, making the timing of actions on the field rather annoying with having to messaround with a lot of options and menus.\n\nIt makes up for it for having pretty good writing, a slightly more expancive and interesting RPG system then Quest for Glory, and NPCs with schedules who interact with things a bit more. The graphics and world design are, at the very least, on par with the vga Quest for Glory games that it emulates, even if they are at a lower res then modren gamers may be used to.\n\nAnd yeah, it's free.

It could even be argued that HQ improves upon the Quest for Glory games that clearly inspired it in a couple of aspects:  For one, it’s insanely long (in a satisfying way).  It’s got to be at least twice the length of any of the QFG’s.  Two, it seems to me there’s an even greater difference in puzzle variation depending on whether you choose to play as a thief, magic user or fighter.\n\nThe first thing people note about Heroine’s Quest is how “retro” it is.  You point and click, the character sprites roam about on fixed background "rooms," and the graphics are very simple.  Rather than being detriments, I think these elements are key to why this game is just so darn enjoyable.  I find such stylized characters and settings to be transporting—like that teddy bear you had as a child that you projected your own imagination onto.  There’s something in these sprites that tickles the fancy and takes you to that “cozy” place much more effectively than any uncanny-valley cutting age game could.  It’s also just cute watching these sprite-figures with their beady eyes conveying emotions; it's that same cute you get from playing LEGO games.\n\nThe old-school interface is also a plus.  This is the kind of gaming in which you’re encouraged to simply click where you want the character to go, and then observe things unfold.  It becomes this relaxing, contemplative experience in a way that your run-of-the-mill direct-control game couldn't provoke.  [In this day and age, that feels like a renegade concept.  Imagine a leisure activity that actually feels leisurely!]  In Heroine’s Quest, the sense that you’re basically just kicking back and reading a book is so strong that there were times when I was stuck on a puzzle, and frankly, I didn’t mind.  I was enjoying being stuck and simply wondering about the possibilities of what I could try next.\n\nMINOR CONS:  I don’t have any big complaints about this game.  If you know what you’re getting into—i.e. you aren’t expecting Half-Life 3—then you'll probably enjoy it.  (And yes, it does seem necessary to add this caveat.  When you read the negative reviews, many seem to share a commonality--they're written by those whose gaming experience seems too limited to even know what subgenre Heroine's Quest harkens back to, and who seem to think that if something doesn't have the latest graphics, then it's automatically bad.)\n\nAdmittedly, Heroine’s Quest DOES have a bit of a steep learning curve.  By this I mean, when you first being playing, simply getting the Heroine to survive outside the town gates is a real challenge.  (The game takes place during an eternal winter.)  Crystal Shard perhaps should've made it clearer to the player right off the bat that finding food and staying warm would (at least initially) be a top priority--perhaps this would've minimized the number of folks who seemed to have quit HQ awfully fast before giving it a fair shake.\n\nWell, don’t let yourself get frustrated.  Just think of it as one of the game’s “puzzles.”  In fact, I think for the first several game days you’re not even *supposed* to be able to survive for long traipsing around the woods.  (You’re going to see the, “You’re the coolest Heroine around” death pun a lot.)  It’s a challenge you have to gradually overcome.  (There are inventory items and methods you’ll discover as you progress which make standing up to the elements much easier.)\n\nIn other words, folks, please don't boot up the game for the first time and ignore all conversation and exploration, run immediately into the wilderness looking for some awesome videogame action, and then complain about why your character died so fast.\n\nAnother possible negative for some: the tongue-twisting Norse/Scandinavian sounding names with 4 consonants in a row are a bit confusing at first.  But you get used to it.  (I do recommend you keep a little notebook handy—just like we used to do with the classic adventure games.  It helps you keep the characters straight, and remember whatever “missions” you’re currently on.)\n\nA STEAL:  Did I mention this game is, insanely, free?  If that isn’t the very definition of “bang for your buck,” I don’t know what is.  I do hope that there is a sequel to Heroine’s Quest in the future.  I would gladly pay for a second go-round.  (As it is, I made sure to make a reasonable “donation” to the Crystal Shard site when I realized how much I was enjoying the game.)  And if these guys ever want to start a Kickstarter to fund one, I can promise I'll be first in the backer line.","February 9","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How long you take exploring the depths of the game is up to you. 100% recommend it, this game took me back to my childhood with its style and impressed me with its immersion.","March 31, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

Right down to the use of skills, combat, and puzzle solving that made those games great. Using the Norse tale of Ragnarok as a basis but making it their own, Crystal Shard proves that you don't need flashy graphics and cutting-edge controls to make a gripping game. The fact that this game is free to play and has hours of fun, not to mention replay value utilizing three vastly different classes, you can't go wrong with this one. Add to it a female protagonist that's not purely eye candy and can hold her own and has a personality that you can relate to, you've got the making of a classic title here.","July 25, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Along with more side quests, different classes to vary gameplay difficulty and puzzle-solving, appears the unique surivial feature. Making sure your herione remains warm and fed while out in the harsh winter adds not just realism, but a depth to gameplay, forcing the player to be at wit's end as they must explore, fight, and talk their ways out of danger within a time limit. For those who wish to play more casually however, the developers have been kind enough to allow an option to either lessen this difficulty (need for food and warmth), as well as increase it. Such loving detail has been put into each pixel of this game, from mechanics, to the art, to the music, and to the voice acting. The voice acting alone had me sold on these characters being alive, and the writing is clever and chalk full of humor to keep me amused and wanting to speak to each villager and monster throughly. Even at points, struggling and dying quite a few times, having to repeat conversations sometimes changed- much to my delight. One life I'll have a conversation in the tavern one on one, and then on a new life, another person appears for a card game, and more is added onto the conversation than before. The layers prove almost as deep as the Norse lore that the game is based around to impressive amounts.\n\nTo all of my friends I have stressed that this is a game that is worthy to play and to sink effort into. It's one not to miss and already in my top favorites of this year.","July 4, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As a self standing heroine (and game) HQ features a bundle of nifty ideas. One which does appeal to me is Viking saga setting. Another good idea is introduce of winter survival - one tends to get frozen out there. The game is indeed fairytale-like, lightly written and full of good humour. As far as parents are concerned the game wouldn’t rate far in age ratings. I heartfeltly recommend this game for geekgirls and -boys alike. The staying problem has been that few games provide good role models for girls. Hence the game that actually fills the Bechedel and Two XChromosomes-tests is indeed something that everyone should be aware of. I hope this game gets a sequel - the only downside is that this might not get as much attention as it deserves.","March 23, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have played about 5 hours into it and don't know if I'll continue.  It's not a bad game at all, but it definitly doesn't live up to it's namesake.  Where Quest for Glory games basically let you roam free and figure the world out for yourself, this game constantly holds your hand and tells you what to do "next".  There is even a mechanic to actively discourage you from exploration.  Where Quest for Glory was your story, this game is set on telling its own story and forces you to take part in it.  That's not the Heros Quest I remember.\n\nAfter reading so many reviews raving about this game, I can't help but be a little annoyed.  The voice acting is ok, but the dialog feels like it's never going to end at times.  The music is not horrible, but I've actually read reviews saying it was as fitting as QFG music.  That is especially ridiculous and painful to read.\n\nI just felt I had to say something as even though this may be a nicely made game, it is a pale shadow of the Quest for Glory series and does not deserve the loftly praise of being on par with it.","April 3, 2014","false","5.2"," 43 of 93 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","43","93","0","3"

I mean, I got bored of it, and I got TOO ANNOYED, with this; I can't even SELL any items, because the game is too complicated!\nWould I reccomend this, to gamers wanting deep gameplay? No; this is too complicated, even for gamers like myself. Especially when the puzzles are TOO ANNOYING! Not to mention that the controls for combat are terrible, and the time-based puzzles SUCK!\nI myself, would rather play ANY of these games that are more underrated, than THIS:\n----\n\n= Sonic Heroes (Not the best game in the world, but 2-player mode DEFINITELY gave it better replay value. And at LEAST it's better than those terrible "Sonic Boom" video games.)\n= Mega Man 7 (The gameplay makes a bit more sense than this, the graphics are very good for it's time, and it was a good concept! Though it just could've been better, in my respectful opinion.)\\n= Fracture (A game for the Xbox 360; a Halo-like game that features the main character; a bad-as-heck hero with a terrible name that's so funny, "Jet Brody"! XD)\n= Phantasy Star Universe (DOES ANYBODY PLAY THIS GAME?!? It's available, for the Xbox 360, you know!)\n= Golden Axe: the Duel (It appears to be a bit underrated, and at least it's better than "Golden Axe: Beast Rider"; who needs mere over-the-top combos, when you've got simple well-balanced strategy fighting?!?)\n= Klonoa (THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE; has anyone forgot about this great childhood memory?!? The designs were great, the gameplay was simple yet great, and also, it's DEFINITELY worth playing! I sure hope that if they make "Klonoa 3", they'll make it a game that supports multiplayer co-op gameplay!)\n----\nAs you can see, a lot of these "free-to-play" games on Steam, are overrated...I myself, plan on GETTING A JOB. I would only recommend this, because it's FREE...and if you like to play this kind of garbage, feel free. But I must warn you; THIS GAME SUCKS!\nIf you like free-to-play games, I would reccomend playing "Team Fortress 2", instead!

Heroine's Quest is like a brand new Quest for Glory game, with the same style of writing, humor, the same kind of dialogue interactions and quest dynamics, the same kind of RPG mechanics worked in and overall it has the same kind of feel, yet has improvements made thanks to the advances of time. It doesn't feel as dated as it might have if they hadn't made any of the tweaks they did.\n\nHaving it be a Heroine just adds substantially to my enjoyment of this game. It's not often I get to actually play as my gender in a game that acknowledges it freely in its dialogue.\n\nThe voice acting is ridiculously good. Quest for Glory IV, back in 1994, had some of the very best voice acting you will ever hear in a video game, and this game is right up there with it. Compared to the wooden, monotone voice acting you get in so many other video games, it's such a treat.\n\nThis is a blast from my past and yet brand new to me, and it's all I ever wanted in a game. I only wish two things of it: that you could have romanced a female character (because yay girl love!) and that there was a sequel available I could play too.","December 30, 2014","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How often do you find one of these?! SERIOUSLY??!?!?!?!\n- Combat system feels great and adequate to this game;\n- Elaborated dialogues;\n- Immersive environments;\n- Features a culture rich world (mostly Nordic);\n- Memorable characters;\n- Fully voiced;\n- Re-playability through the different classes your character may assume;\n- Challenging.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics may not please all audiences;\n- Walking through the map takes a lot of time (although you can speed up the game in the options menu);\n- The menus could be a little easier to access (but you can have hot-keys in your keyboard in order);\n- The initial quest in the game (where you must gather food) may be a little hard for people not used to this type of game;\n\nLong description:\n\nI must say that this game surprised me.\n\nAt first, I was reluctant to play it, because it seemed to resolve around a combat system, and I just wanted a good-old-fashioned point'n click adventure.\n\nHowever, this game won me in the first few minutes, when the first dialogue came up fully voiced, presenting a memorable character (Thrivaldi, you arr awesome!).\n\nAs for my concerns with the combat system, well... I was wrong. The game heavily resolves around pointing and clicking on the environment, and the combat system is actually FUN. It is not rare to find myself wandering the woods, looking for random encounters, so that I can play the combat mini game once more.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging and fair. You will feel accomplished by completing them without relying to online sources.\n\nAlthough not all dialogue lines are interesting, they help to add this sense of immersion to the game.\n\nThe game has it's flaws, though...\n\nWalking through the forest may be a pain... Without a warp system, you will spend a lot of time travelling from point A to B, sometimes, only to TRY to gather an item. Repeating this journey will prove to be very time consuming.\n\nThe auto save feature is nice; but it would be even nicer if they added a "before dying" or "before entering a dangerous area" save, since it is something that will be happening a lot to your character.\n\nThe menus try to be simple, but having sub-menus consumes more time in order to do a task. The game offers hot-keys to these actions though, so I recommend learning and using them.\n\nFinal words:\n\nSo, all in all, this game proved to be a great gaming experience for me. I highly recommend it!","December 5, 2014","true","41.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played Quest for Glory back in the day and this is very much an homage to the form, with modern production values--it's got voiced dialogue, for one thing. Gameplay is a mix of adventure, RPG, there's a few survival elements (you have to eat occasionally and stay too long in the frozen woods and you'll freeze to death), and combat is fairly action-game--you have to dodge the right way to avoid certain enemy attacks, and recognize their tells to hit them when it's safe. The setting's extremely Norse, and while it doesn't deal -directly- with a lot of mythology, people who know their Norse will spot all sorts of little clues and call-outs.\n\nThis is the best free game on Steam, only on Steam to get a wider audience. There's no pay-to-win, no currency, it's just a game made because a group felt it should be made. It costs nothing but the space it takes to fill it, and it's rewarding to play and rewarding to beat.

There is not a better value on Steam.  If you grew up on the old Sierra adventure games like Quest for Glory, King's Quest, Police Quest, Conquests of the Longbow, or Space Quest, then you can easily spend 30+ hours playing this game.  I've not even completed the game once, yet, and I'm having a blast.  This is truly a spiritual successor to the Quest for Glory series, unlike Quest for Glory V.  Think of this game as the Quest for Glory V that should have been.  I'll give an explanation as to what I mean.\n\nIf you played QFG3 and QFG4 (or the VGA remakes of QFG1 and QFG2), then you're familiar with the QFG format.  It's a point and click adventure game with an RPG style of character development.  You get a character sheet in the beginning and spend some "free points" in different skills and attributes.  Then, you're dropped in the world to quest.  As you use skills, they level up.  All of the QFG games followed this format, but QFG5 changed the interface in a major way.  It was the first "3D" QFG game.  The character could be controlled with a turret-style control scheme, and combat wasn't compartmentalized the way it had been before.  So, the game felt very clumsy overall and didn't have the same feeling as the previous four titles.  This game brings everything about the QFG style of game right back where it belongs.\n\nThe game starts by having you select one of three classes, just like QFG.  The classes are essentially the same as the Fighter, Magic User, and Thief from QFG.  There isn't a Paladin class in this series, but there is an honor mechanic which could possibly imply a Paladin class in a sequel (PRETTY PLEASE LET THERE BE A SEQUEL!!!).  You then are able to distribute 50 points across your character sheet.  Your character will solve in-game problems in different ways based on your skills.  A Warrior might ram a door down.  A Rogue may pick the lock.  A Wizard may blast it or cast an Open spell.  And, these might not be the only options depending on the exact situation.  Maybe you just knock and trick the guy on the other side to open it so you can club him on the head.  There are skills for all of these actions, so you need to pay attention to your skill set when you make your character.\n\nOnce the game starts, you find yourself in a harsh, winter environment.  You're broke.  You have 15 coins, and a decent meal at another nearby town costs 8 coins.  You can't stay outside too long without freezing to death, and the weather is constantly sapping your stamina.  Along the way, you'll find ways to secure food and battle the cold, but life is hard at first.  You also don't have your equipment.  You have your weapon and some basic items, but you will be missing your gear pack due to the opening events of the game.  You'll meet the townsfolk, find ways to feed yourself, pick up quests, and get some leads on where to find your gear.  From there, it's up to you, really.  You could choose to immediately start doing quests to get some income and items.  You could opt to hunt monsters and train up your skills for a few days.  You could try and explore the map first.  The game world is yours.\n\nPart of the beauty of the this game, just like the QFG games, is the humor embedded in every environment.  Something as simple as looking at a tree reveals a pun or some quirky quip.  Character dialogues are laced with references to your favorite Sierra games, phrases like "So, you want to be a Hero?"  Too many jokes to count exist in this game, and part of the replay value is finding them all.  I'm not even to the second map, yet, and I'm still uncovering things to chuckle at just around the two towns.  Occasionally, I smack my forehead, like when I found the gravestone that said, "Here lies Cedric Diggery.  Entered a graveyard alive.  Left dead."\n\nThis is truly a gem.  You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't have it in your library.  Download it and play it.  If you're new to the genre, be patient with it for an hour or so.  Not many games follow the same sort of RPG development as these games did, and most aren't as unforgiving.  When games like this one tell you you're tired, you'd better find someplace safe to sleep!  Fail to do so and you'll collapse and die where you're standing and be devoured by the creatures of the night.  Climb a tree without a sufficient enough climb skill and you may just fall out and break your neck.  Take some time to figure it out, and you'll be in for one the most treasured types of gaming experiences in gaming history.  There's a green button up there.  Press it.","September 3, 2014","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is never an issue with the game except for only a couple of situations. This is pretty darned amazing considering the size of the game.\n\nWriting, voice-acting, dialogues & humour are all 1st class. There is clearly a lot of research behind the study of norse folkfore to bolster the story's setting & it really shows. Characters fall into the usual tropes yet the story & story-telling is rich & vibrant with just the right amount of comical references\n\nThe puzzles & combat are rewarding & the music feels just right. The game gives you just the right amount of hints without removing the challenge. For the most part the thoughtful game design goes a long way toward making specific problems more easily resolved whilst still offering the possibility for multiple solutions (usually via the class specific's unique skill sets)\n\nThe pixel graphics are a nice touch with each sprite, backdrop & portrait boasting talent in abundance. There was never an instance where a small item or set piece had me confused as to what it represented, I only mention this because this used to be an issue with these types of games but I can gladly state that every piece is self-evident & well representative of what it portrays itself to be.\n\nAll in all I have played a lot of point n'click adventure games but this one manages to take the best aspects from the genre to make a more open experience that is sure to give the SCUMMy retro fans a fresh experience. I can easily recommend this game to fans of the genre but other gamers may get alienated by the referential humour & frustrated by the graphical throwback nature","August 2, 2014","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But as soon as you spend some time with it you discover that it is so much more. It is an early 90s RPG if it were made today. And from that you get all the great things from those sort of games: great story that is also funny at times, complex and interesting quests that have different ways to approach and solve them, amazing atmosphere and great dialogue. All of this in exchange for some pixel graphics, which I am not a fan of, but it is evident they spent a lot of time creating the environments and characters in the game and then even animating all of them, which is not easy to do with pixel art.\n\nThe weak side of the game is the combat which is quite simplistic and basically just pushing one button most of the time, at least at the lower difficulties. It is interesting the way combat is done in this game and it is much more involved than I expected before starting to play the game, however as I said it is lacking in complexity and would've been more fun with more combat skills.

Simplified class system that's easy for beginners to classic fantasy RPG class systems. That does not hurt the game in any way and in this games case is better I think because the game is simple to learn to play, the difficulty is in the puzzles not stats. Full of Easter eggs to find and enjoy! Witty fully voiced dialogue with some fun hamming it up voice acting. Non-gratuitous nudity bathing scene that made me laugh is an example of funny things that come up when you click on something. Music is fun and doesn't get really old really fast like some games but is still repetitive. Different areas has different music and there's the combat music that comes up so it does get varied a bit. The games aesthetics are pleasing but I think could be more varied in the wilderness, but don't let the 16 bit design fool you into thinking the devs just are not really good at first, the game is top quality and in many ways better polished than AAA titles being shoveled out the door today.\n\nCons?

It's free.\n\nMy single gripe was that I did not like the harsh 'warmth' meter, but if you look around, you can find things that keep you warm.  Boots, scarves, cloaks, fur pelts, or even a bottle of warm water are all things that slow the meter to a very bearable level.  Also common sense can dictate whether it's a good day to go out or not.  Snowing outside means you lose warmth faster, night makes you lose warmth as well.  If you really want, you can turn the game to easy and I believe it stops the warmth meter.  If you're curious what happens when the warmth meter runs out, you start to lose stamina.  When your stamina runs out, you start to lose health (just like Quest for Glory).  Once all meters run out, you die.  So it actually takes quite a while, and it takes longer and longer as you gain more hp and stamina.\n\nSo, at first glance, the warmth meter was annoying.  But, it's really not that bad when you progress through the game and acquire things that make it trivial.  Other than that, it is a great modern Quest for Glory homage.  There's nothing else I could say was a turn-off for me.","December 1, 2015","true","53.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is a mix of adventure, RPG, there's a few survival elements (you have to eat occasionally and stay too long in the frozen woods and you'll freeze to death), and combat is fairly action-game--you have to dodge the right way to avoid certain enemy attacks, and recognize their tells to hit them when it's safe. The setting's extremely Norse, and while it doesn't deal -directly- with a lot of mythology, people who know their Norse will spot all sorts of little clues and call-outs.\n\nThis is the best free game on Steam, only on Steam to get a wider audience. There's no pay-to-win, no currency, it's just a game made because a group felt it should be made. It costs nothing but the space it takes to fill it, and it's rewarding to play and rewarding to beat.

It has a strong female protagonist, good gameplay, and a good story line filled with Norse mythology.\n\nYou choose between  3 classes, warrior/fighter (easiest to start with), mage or thief which will influence certain aspects of the game (for example how some puzzles are solved)\n\nVoice acting is mostly well done too as is the musical score. There are optional side quests and mini games, and many puzzles have more than one solution. I also like the realism, not only do you need to make sure your character eats and sleeps sufficiently and doesn't freeze to death, but characters will react differently depending on who else is in the room.  For example if you talk to Lithrasir about Hervor  while Hervor  is in the room, what she says will be different than if he isn't, if they are present the character being talked about may react to what is being said as well\n\nAll in all this is a really fun adventure/rpg game that is well worth checking out, and it's free!!","February 16, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It helps if you have some lore about Thor, Loki, Odin(Wotan) and the other northern gods, but you'll find a lot of ingame info about them.\n\nThis game plays like a revisited version of old Quest for Glory series. Of course, that series being released in early 90's, this game has a lot of space to improve over those oldies. An example of those improvements is the use of voices for the NPCs of this game.\n\nGraphics are similar to the ones you got at the QfG games. You even have the same initial option of character selection, with the possibility of learning some extra skills to personalize your character. You'll improve your skills through the game by using them. The more you use them the higher they get.\n\nCombat is in real time, so you'll need to learn which key does what to really best your enemies.\n\nYou are going to find several quests and puzzles through the game. Some of them can be impossible to solve without being the right character class and having the right skill or spell, so don't worry too much if you can't complete all the sidequests you find.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game. It can be seen as a game to nostalgic people like myself, but I think the story it develops can be appreciated even for new players to this old kind of gaming.","June 28, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far it's interesting and sometimes funny but also annoying at times. Exploring the town I suddenly drop dead from starvation. I had no food in inventory and could not get anyone in town to give me any so was not a fun way to start the game, especially having 30 minutes of exploring and dialogue wasted for nothing and having to do it again.\n\nNPC wander randomly and go to places that it makes no sense for them to be. For example, I go upstairs in castle and see a barrier, blocking me from entering the wizard's room. The bartender from tavern suddenly appears, walks through the barrier, then sits in the wizard's chair. When speaking to her she has the same dialogue as if we're still in the tavern.\n\nTalking to the wizard is a major annoyance and it's puzzling why the devs thought it would be amusing to have an npc repeat everything he says all the time. Thankfully just clicking on dialogue box allows skipping it.\n\nOn the plus side, there's alot of history and there's some attention to detail when learning about the characters. The heroine is blonde, beautiful, and brave, which is standard fare for someone out to save the world(though I suppose if she were bald, ugly, and scared of her own shadow it wouldn't work quite as well). Hopefully, once leaving town will give a better impression.","May 23, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MUST! The magic map and notepad are nice touches - while pencil crayoning your own map as a kid was fun, having a magic map is better.\n\nPro tip: For those not used to these games, save often. It's like a choose your own adventure where you can die for silly reasons. To me that adds charm, to someone that hasn't saved the game in awhile, that can be frustrating.\n\nNote:\n* There are some people giving negative reviews because the frostbite is hard... turns out if you don't like that, you can turn it off in the settings. It reminded me of QFG2 (?) in the dessert. Good times imo.\n\n* Some negative reviews mention bad graphics... which makes me laugh because they are done on purpose that way.

It's free.\n\nMy single gripe was that I did not like the harsh 'warmth' meter, but if you look around, you can find things that keep you warm.  Boots, scarves, cloaks, fur pelts, or even a bottle of warm water are all things that slow the meter to a very bearable level.  Also common sense can dictate whether it's a good day to go out or not.  Snowing outside means you lose warmth faster, night makes you lose warmth as well.  If you really want, you can turn the game to easy and I believe it stops the warmth meter.  If you're curious what happens when the warmth meter runs out, you start to lose stamina.  When your stamina runs out, you start to lose health (just like Quest for Glory).  Once all meters run out, you die.  So it actually takes quite a while, and it takes longer and longer as you gain more hp and stamina.\n\nSo, at first glance, the warmth meter was annoying.  But, it's really not that bad when you progress through the game and acquire things that make it trivial.  Other than that, it is a great modern Quest for Glory homage.  There's nothing else I could say was a turn-off for me.","December 1, 2015","true","53.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If this relates to you - you HAVE to play this.  Has been ages since I've enjoyed a new, fresh adventure game like this.  Great puzzles (though not too hard) with all the elements (and more) that quest for glory 3 & 4 had.  AND ITS FREE!!

I have to say the first day in game is absolutely BRUTAL as you will constantly die trying to survive for food and warmth. Then the game opens up and you have to save the kingdom from an ice giant and an evil troll. It is mostly a mixture of adventure game puzzles and wasd attacks on enemies. A bunch of the puzzles suffer from 80s-90s style complexity and you will need a guide. But the game itself was fun. 7/10","March 29","true","66.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very oldschool-merciless in the sense that the player can die outside of combat without actually making any mistakes, just by opening a door and being railroaded into a death scene. I'm talking about the one where as soon as entering the thieves lair they stab me to death without a chance to fight back. My latest ragequit <3 Another time I died of starvation despite the game repeatedly telling me that I can't die of starvation on the easiest difficulty. It's also frustrating that I feel I can't play the game in my own pace, the plot keeps advancing every night without me having enough time to do all the side-quests and properly explore the area - in this sense it feels more like an adventure game than an rpg. I still recommend it, because the world is interesting and I like the ambience, but be prepared for the above-mentioned annoying things.","July 13, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
