"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonkeyShadow/recommended/219150/","MonkeyShadow","MonkeyShadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonkeyShadow/","672 products in account","An indie masterpiece made by only two dudes who had a lot of talent. Hotline Miami is a top-down action video game mixed with a lot of ecstasy. Mostly influenced by the excellent movie "Drive" (by Nicolas Winding Refn in 2011), Dennis Wedin and Jonatan Söderström have crafted a clever mix of extreme violence and an awesome 80's atmosphere. The gameplay is demanding but fair, one bullet, you're dead. It's a sort of die & retry game considering the fact that you have to know the spot where the enemies are and how to kill'em. The great twist about it is the system of masks, each mask has an effect on the character's abilities. Artistically, the 16 bits style is not beautiful but it fits perfectly the overall atmosphere and the environment will be covered in blood most of the time. The plot is mysterious and offers a lot of questions but is averagely good enough to keep you interested. But what is really special about Hotline Miami is its soundtrack, it's absolute perfection. Composed by various artists, this electronic hyperactivity is a gigantic asset to an already great mix. To conclude, Hotline miami is a hard drug that will be hard for you to let go.","November 25, 2013","true","21.6"," 565 of 618 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","565","618","0","0"

Everything from the characters you meet, the decor of buildings, the white 80's suits of the enemies to your car are all extremely well done and all add to the 80's Miami feel.       Audio    9    Game music and effects are outstanding, you can hear the pounding beat of the music increase  in intensity as the levels progress and the game becomes ever more frantic. Although the music is looped it isn't repetitive and I found, even after dying for the tenth time in a row, it still felt fresh and exciting helping to throw you back into the fight.      Gameplay    9    Hotline Miami is full of fast packed action, even best laid plans go astray in a moment forcing you to improvise, think on your feet and when all else fails rely on quick button pressing. As the levels progress the game becomes more challenging, but by this point your hooked and need to see the story through to the bitter end.        Story    9    Dark & suspenseful, the story is surprising deep and engaging (for what on the surface appears to be a fairly simple game). Sometimes the game will leave you wondering exactly what is happening to you, sometimes small details will change between levels (who's that person in my apartment? who is ringing my phone?...) but they all help to weave they story of the characters decent into a world of crime, murder and madness        Replayability    5    There isn't much to say here, the story is linear so it mostly depends on how much you enjoyed playing the first time round. There are lots of masks to collect which give you certain bonuses that might appeal to completionists.        Overall    9    A true gaming classic, retro 80's, ultra-violent, stylish, solid challenging game play with awesome music and a great story. lots of fun to play, highly recommended.\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/219150/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Hotline Miami made me feel like a monster.\n\nAs the music drove me forward and the hypnotic neon visuals swelled around the edges of a stage, I lost track of the number of people I had so brutally and ruthlessly murdered. The first kill was shocking, fast, and pointless. I felt sick and angry at the person who’d forced me into it. Then they gave me a pipe, and then a gun, and I kept killing. For as disturbing as the mutilated corpses and pools of blood around me were, the feedback I was being given was intoxicating, and the thrill of barely avoiding death only heightening the sensation.\n\nHotline Miami doesn’t revel in violence, but it never attempts to shy away or filter it. It knows it’s depraved, but also that there’s some twisted part inside of us that enjoys, even craves violence. It fills our entertainment and history, but rarely asks us to recognize the horror of hurting someone. There’s always a justification, a clear line drawn between the “good” and “bad” people or those who “deserve it”. It’s what allows us to explore violence in media without becoming psychotic or repulsed, but it also seems to grant a lot of leeway for what is considered acceptable, a gap that only widens the more we consume and the less it registers.\n\nI’ve played a lot of violent games, many far more graphic and realistically rendered than Hotline Miami, but I don’t know that I’ve ever played one that made me more disturbed of myself. Hotline Miami does this not by any narrative reason or even because it’s violence is so grotesque, but because of how fun it makes killing someone, and how it constantly pushes you to do it better, faster, more interestingly. It’s mechanics are tight and focused, reworking its top-down shooter framework into some more puzzle-like and melee focused. It rewards you for every action but always dangles the carrot slightly beyond your reach, challenging do it again, this time with style.\n\nThe more I played, the better I became at thinking like the sociopathic machine my character had become. I forgot about people I was killing or the reason I was doing so (if there ever was one); they were just pieces in an elaborate, deadly puzzle which I needed to clear as efficiently as possible.\n\nIt’s the tiny things that make Hotline Miami so mesmerizing. The way points explode after every kill, or that the music never stops when you die, leaving you no chance to back out. Everything is so tightly knit and ferociously intense, you aren’t afforded the space to think before acting. You just move and let your instincts take over.\n\nBut all of this wouldn’t mean anything if the game was nothing but violent, strategic rooms for you to exploit. It’s the moments that come later that remind you that you’re human and exist in a world not of exploding meat bags, but living people, that make Hotline Miami’s violence mean something. Picking up a pizza or talking to the video store clerk, there’s the haunting feeling of desperately trying to pretend you’re still sane; that you have some connection to the world you seem only capable of destroying. When you’re finally pushed out of the world, it’s disorienting and frightening, and left me with only more people to kill as every remaining aspect of my sanity evaporated.\n\nIf Hotline Miami has any major faults, it’s that it’s often as fragile as its protagonist, and by the end has similarly fallen to pieces. Enemy AI is barely present, somewhat intentionally to give you time to react but usually because it’s broken or suddenly hyper aware of your position. Hit detection is wonky and unpredictable, and the game crashed more than a few times before I was through. It level designs are also exceedingly front-loaded, with many of the later missions stripping you of any freedom and pitting you against tedious death loops. A handful of truly horrendous scripted sequences also caused me more deaths than the entire rest of the game combined, and ruined the excellent pacing up to that point.\n\nPart of me thinks those flaws are almost worth having though, as they were a reminder that at the end of the day Hotline Miami is still a game. With how overwhelming its audio and visuals are, I often became intensely absorbed in what I was doing, so being broken out of it by a bad level or glitch was almost welcomed. Because Hotline Miami is dark, twisted, perverse, and I had an astounding amount of fun with it, which is what really scares me.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 12, 2015","true","6.1"," 315 of 336 people (94%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","94","315","336","31","8"

A lot.\n\nDon't make the assumption that this is a run-and-gun game. This is a thinking mans psychedelic 80's murder simulator. You will die learning a map layout. You will die figuring out when enemies will respond to gunfire. You will die due to glitchy doors. There is a lot of you dying in this game. But guess what there's also a lot of?\n\nHeart-pumping Adrenaline-gorged violence. No other game evokes the same sense of crazed desperateness as you pummel some poor Russian mobsters face into the dance floor, only to get up a split second later, grab his shotgun, and blow away the other Russian Mobsters who've been unfortunate to be in the same building as you.\n\nWhile the action is split second and fast-paced, the game rewards tactical planning and thinking more than twitch reactions. You will not succeed trying to run through a building swinging a baseball bat like a madman. You're going to have to bait enemies, burst into a room when no one's looking, and die several times perfecting ways to murder people.\n\nMy only complaint is how vague the boss fights are. While I've only encountered two thus far, both of them have been pretty vague on how you actually win them. How the hell was a I supposed to figure out that I could only damage biker once he's throw his weapon when that isn't how the gameplay mechanics works at any other point previously?. The boss battles are inconsistent with the rest of the game.\n\nIt can get frustrating, but it is intensely satisfying when you've cleared four separate floors after countless deaths trying. 8/10, would recommend.\n\n-Jingle","June 8, 2014","true","4.8"," 277 of 291 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","277","291","0","8"

Hotline Miami wants you to kill a lot and to die a lot, violence and blood are the leitmotif of this 8-bit world. The game is both action and strategy, it even reminds Manhunt (transformed into indie retro). Bizarre sountrack and brutal gameplay fit together perfectly, and the story...wow! I didn't even think that the game had one. But it did! Surrealistic, strong, intense, romantic (Blondie, I love you baby). There are so many questions, some of them rhetorical, some won't be ever answered - Do you like hurting people? Who are you, red guy, and why do you keep giving me free pizza (btw I want to have you in real life), do you see dead people?!\n\nJust one warning, don't play it more than 3 hours in a row - or you can get your worst headache and forget about sanity.

Using gameplay and visual queues as a way to tell this strange tale. It can be looked at as a good thing or bad as it's not an easy story to follow, and unless your play the second game you'll never see the entire picture. But it is interesting and enjoyable.\n\nGameplay The game offers a verity of playstyles and you can play how you choose depending on the mask you pick. Want to go fast? Want to use guns? Want to have reversed controls? Me neither.\n\nBut you won't find any control rebinds here, which is not a good thing.\nIn terms of options there aren't many. You are greeted with Windowed/Fullscreen and Resolution settings, along with V-Sync and an Alienware lighting FX option, as you start up the game.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, it's hard. You will be dying a lot... but all it takes is a simple press of R and you're back in.\n\nIf you have slow reflexes or you simply can't grasp the concept of it you will not have a good time as this leaves room for you too improve skill, but the difficulty curve is still apparent.\n\n\nAudio and Visual  Retro graphics mixed with fast paced synthwave and outrun music helps set the tone and atmosphere.\nThe soundtrack is superb. The music is very well selected for this game.\nA calming slower paced and relaxing sound before the blood shed.\nA fast drum beat with a heavy sound while you're in the level scoring combos.\nAn eerie almost silent ambient track as you walk through the halls of corpses.\nAnd a remorseful tone as you drive away thinking about what you've done... All to do it again tomorrow.\n\n\nSummary   PROS\nSoundtrack\nTight controls\nWell designed gameplay\nFun to replay\n\nCONS\nNo way to rebind controls\nDifficulty can be frustrating at times\nExtremely buggy\n\n\nSIDE NOTES\nThis game is not for everyone.\nDepending on how much you like the gameplay and story will determine replayablity.\n\n\nVerdict  Would I recommend you this game?\nIf you enjoy\nArcade-y and twitch-control type games\nConvoluted and pretentious story and messages\nDifficult games\nand\nGood ol' violence...\n\nThanks for reading.","September 23, 2015","true","21.1"," 102 of 108 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","102","108","6","4"

I'm adding a real review because those damn puns/quips/oneliners aren't funny any more. Seriously, stop writing them. They weren't ever funny really.]\n\nHotline Miami is a fast paced action game with a bizarre plot and style.\n\nPretty much every chapter has a similar format. Wake up in your bed, go into a building, kill everyone in it, maybe fight a boss, and then go pick up a pizza or maybe rent a VHS tape.\n\nThe format takes several interesting twists as it goes on, though pretty much the whole games story line can be interpreted in any way you like.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun as hell. There are weapons lying around such as knives, shotguns, automatic rifles, katanas, and more. The guns can kill an enemy in a single shot from a distance, but will make noise attracting more enemies. Most melee weapons will only knock enemies down, but this isn't universally true, they aren't loud enough to ruin your stealth run. Also, all weapons can be thrown to knock enemies down.\n\nAs for replayablity, the game has two collecting side quests, which I won't spoil.\n\nAlso, the game has one of the best sound tracks I have heard in awhile. Seriously, the sound track is pretty damn good. Just for the sound track alone.\n\nSound track out of 10.","January 15, 2014","true","7.4"," 335 of 443 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","335","443","0","11"

This game is one of my all time favorite indie games and it will stay that way for a long time. The mechanics for the game are interesting, the  dark story is hard to follow the first time playing through the game but later you'll really enjoy it. The sort of 80s retro soundtrack is really really fun, it gives the game feel a lot more of an atmospheric feel.\n\nPersonally after beating the game 3 times, every once in a while I just jump in and have a bit of fun finishing some of my old favorite levels. The combat feels smooth, there is a wide variety of guns, melee and throwable weapons. Mechanics in the game are very awesome, you have different masks that each have their own powers, some are more useful than others and some just add extra challenge to experienced players. There are really only a few bad things I can say about this game, and those are listed below.\n\nPositives:\n+Super fun.\n+Fast paced combat.\n+Crazy gunplay.\n+Bloody and gory.\n+Lots of weapons.\n+Different masks each with their own skills.\n+Amazing pixel art graphics.\n+Good story.\n+Great sound effects and really nice retro soundtrack.\n+Each level has it's own sort of way, none of the levels are linear but there is always one objective, kill everyone.\n+Satisfying kills.\n+For some people (like me) replayability is very good.\n\nNegatives:\n-Game is pretty short, you can beat the game in around 5 hours.\n-Some major bugs which people use as exploits in levels, allowing you to beat the levels with ease.\n-Only 2 boss fights in the game, both quiet boring and easy, each take around 3 mins to beat.\n-Some really overpowered masks.\n-As much as the story is good, it's quiet linear, no backstory or anything on any of the character, we barley get any names.\n\nBoth:\n-&+ AI is usually alright, but can sometimes be really broken and stupid.\n-&+ Some levels use a different character that has different mechanics, some people like him but I don't really like him.\n-&+ Some masks that are funny, but are annoying to get and don't serve any really purpose other than a small joke.  The fish mask that is a reference to Phil Fish, the maker of FEZ for example, all it does is turn all the text in the game into horribly butchered French.\n\nOverall I rate this game an  8.5/10  it does have it's flaws but it's still 100% worth picking up if you want a nice addition to your library and enjoy a challenge.","June 21, 2015","true","53.9"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","36","37","0","2"

And damn right I did that. I have heard a little about it and did not take much notice, but when I started playing, that was it! What a game!\n\nThe big idea behind the game is to complete the levels fast, while you are accompanied by great music and massive killings. Planning your game is essential, kills are easy but you are no different. You die all the same as any other character. Bosses a bit tough and take some time to kill, which I actually dont like in such a fast phased games. Then you add masks to boost your abilities and if you cant do the round with one, maybe you should pick another one and it will be easy.\n\nI am not sure if the game was originally made for consoles or not, but the controls on PC are rather good. Easy 6 buttons to use + mouse. The game is quite fast so you will have to move a lot.\nFor some games music adds some atmosphere and just a bit of story, but in this case the music adds 50% of your joy while playing the game. It just makes you want to move and... kill. Just the soundtrack is already enough to purchase Hotline Miami.\nThe visuals are amazing! So much blood. Everything is detailed, maps are not dull and boring. Characters animations are done very well too.\n\nAnd now, the bad things that I have encountered. 1st and most annoying is when the dogs are running of the map. Just cant kill them to finish the round. Bosses are way too hard, and they break the fast phase of the game. Fallen enemies are the most dangerous ones.\nReplayability is low. Now you can play 2nd game. Plus ones the story is finished, I dont see why would anyone want to play more of this.\n\nSo to sum up, I would recommend this game to everybody. It does not take long to finish, but you get a very good experience of being a psychopath. Its so much worth it!\n","March 11, 2015","true","5.4"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","37","42","4","2"

Read no further - go buy the game. Don't even wait for a sale.\n\nIf you have slow reflexes, or bad coordination however; or if you simply dislike difficult games - this game is really not for you. In my own case despite having terrible coordination over all, I managed to grind my way to level 10 before giving up. This is not the games fault, but merely a lack of the required ability to finish it. The game has thousands of reviews into the Overwhelmingly positive category - so I think it's safe to add a thumbs down for casuals and the slower reflexed among us to be wary about spending your money. I would recommend checking out a gameplay video or trying it on someone's family account before buying it yourself. The difficulty is pretty steady from level 3 on so you can get a good taste for it pretty quickly.\n\nEdit* Just a little FYI - If you ♥♥♥♥ing comment with 'Git Gud' here, it is just going to be deleted.

(TL;DR at the bottom of the review)\n\nHotline Miami was released back in 2012 and I gave absolutely zero attention to it (2012 was one of the best years for gaming imo and I had other games to focus my eye sockets on).\n\nWelp, if I can confirm after 13 hours of beating the game twice AND getting all the achievements, Hotline Miami made 2012 even better than I first thought it was. Granted, I did play this like 2 years ago, only to revisit it to 100% it and get my body ready for Hotline Miami 2 (which I will adress in its own review).\n\nAnyway, as you can tell from my late (but better than never) review and the rest of the HM reviews and discussions all over this wasteland filled with vicious  keyboard  warriors  known as "The Internet", HM is a good game. And in my opinion, it IS a good game.\n\n...\n\nYou can scratch that ♥♥♥♥!\n\n- It's a VERY good game!\n\nThe reasons are mostly 2 and 2 only (you'll think there should be a 3rd one, but that 3rd part I won't praise as much as the rest of the community does): the gameplay and the story.\n\nGameplay\nSimple in the concept and content, but hard in the execution. You can attack (applies to melee (which matters a lot in the game) and firearms), throw your weapon (if you hit an enemy, he will be knocked down for a second or 2; unless you are throwing a knife or a brick (yes, bricks exist in the game), which results in an insta-kill)), move (duh) and execute when an enemy in downed. Simple enough, 4 basic keys to use (WASD, LMB, RMB and Spacebar). However:\n\nYou die in (most of the time) one shot, just like your enemies...\n\nThis makes Hotline Miami be a "Outnumbered, but never outskilled" type of game, as your reaction times, aiming skills, reflexes and strategic thinking come into place.\n\nAnd that's kinda it for the gameplay. You play as "Jacket", you pick a mask (there are lots of them (some are even hidden in secret areas), about 18 or 20, each with it's own skill/perk, except the starting mask, which apparently has nothing to benefit the player) and you go to town, killing anything in your path that remotely looks russian.\n\nI guess Jacket has been playing a lot of CSGO and Dota 2 ^^\n\nAnyway, the gameplay is fun, there is a lot of fluidity in the gameplay, the pacing is excellent and the level design is varied and creative, never feeling repetitive, like most people expected it too.\n\nOh and there's a ranking system based on your score (which you get by killing, getting combos, etc.).\n\nGraphics\nI believe it uses a variant of the Gamemaker engine and all that. Basically, it's a retro-style 8 bit pixellated graphic style; not much I can say about that.\n\nAudio\nThe guns sound good, smacking an enemy with a baseball bat or a crowbar (heh) or any melee in general feels responsive and powerful thanks to a well put "thump" sound.\n\nThe soundtrack, however, isn't as great as people put it. Yes, there are some cool ones and I'll admit all of them will get your blood pumping. But...it isn't that remarkable. I played it not long ago, and yet... I forgot all of it already. I can only remember the theme song and the song that plays while you're in Jacket's apartment before going into the actual mission (which works as a sort of a "hub" for the game world, and no, it's not ♥♥♥♥ing open-world ^^, this isn't RAGE, people!). This makes me conclude that the soundtrack is fun at the moment, but it's not something you'll remember and say "dude, you gotta listen to this!", at least for me anyway.  HM2 review spoiler: HM2's soundtrack is MUCH better than anything put into this one.\n\nStory\nIn my opinion, alongside gameplay, the story is one of Hotline Miami's strong points. It's filled with mystery, intrigue and, while the game is short (should take you about 2-3 hours to beat) despite the difficulty, the story starts and ends strong, without giving too much away to the player, leading to the very in-depth looks you see in the community hub about the game and trying to piece the whole story together, trying to explain motivations, reasons, the "why's and the how's", which gives a good read, I admit. It's more fun, however, to play it and try to piece it together yourself first, and then get to the reading part (If you aren't one of those that reads around forums and all that, then... probably you aren't even reading this... ).\n\nOverall/TL;DR\nNothing else to say about Hotline Miami, really. It's a simple game, that will get you killed a lot. Rage will fill your guts and veins, but you'll keep going, because it's fun, it's rewarding and the story and varied level design will MAKE you want to keep going and do that "one more try" scheme :P\n\nI have to say some collision the detection felt off on the enemies when you're on top of each other, waving your melee weapon and not hitting anything, when YOU SHOULD BE HITTING HIM!\n\nThe soundtrack was decent, but underwhelming, considering all the praise it got O_o\n\nAnd finally, the "Trauma" level REALLY felt out of place.\n\nThe rest, I frankly loved...\n\nAnd since no modern review can survive without a ♥♥♥♥ing score, Hotline Miami deserves an abstract numerical value of 8 on a pointlessly stupid scale of 0 to 10.","June 25, 2015","true","13.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","21","22","4","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stopstealingsubscribers/recommended/219150/","stopstealingsubscribers","https://youtu.be/rXe75Mp_NYU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stopstealingsubscribers/","7 products in account","Okay, out of pure boredom, I decided to write a full review about every specific thing in the game.\n\nIf you just came here to know everything about the game before you buy it, I would highly recommend you to buy it, but I think I should head over to the cons before anything.\nIf you can relate to these things being bad, or unenjoyable, then you may need to reconsider buying this game.\n- 8-bit (or 16-bit, whatever, OR 24-BIT, WHATEVER) graphics. If you dislike those kind of graphics, remember that the whole game is pixelated.\n- Very difficult. If you’re a person who is overall bad at games, or like specific game styles, remember that everything in the game is very, very, VERY difficult, unforgiving, and did I mentioned that it’s difficult? You will die all the time and I mean it.\n- Very fast-pasted. If you’re a casual gamer who enjoys gameplay that involves no stress at all, you should definitely reconsider buying this game.\n- No multiplayer.\nIf none of the things I just mentioned don’t bother you, I would REALLY recommend you to play this game.\nOkay, now when that is out of the way, let’s talk about specific aspects.\n1. Gameplay\nIt has a top-down perspective. (Look at the screenshots if you don’t understand.) Where you kill people with melees and guns. You can throw them, too, which is unique compared to most games that feature guns. Throwing the guns at a person resorts in knocking them down, and you execute them by pressing the space bar. If you have no melee equipped, you will need to left-click a few times before you kill the enemy. But if you wait a short while, the enemy will get up, equip the nearest weapon he can see, and will try to attack you again. There are enemies that require weapons, such as dogs, fat guys, and dodgers.\nAlso, a very significant thing about the gameplay is that you get to choose a mask with different abilities. Want dogs not to attack you? Choose Ted. Want to make the enemies not hear the gunshots, and just kill them one-by-one? Choose Peter. Want to kill enemies just by throwing the guns? Choose Jake. You get the point.\n2. Visuals\nThey’re 24-bit, but they’re very detailed for a pixelated game (especially the faces that appear whilst dialogue). And if you’re a fan of gore in videogames, then you will definitely enjoy this game, considering that this is one of the goriest games that I’ve ever played. Okay, I’m not too much of a gamer, but my point is that the game is gory, especially in the second game.\n3. Story\nSorry, I can’t summarise the story chronologically in a few sentences, but it’s interesting, dark, mysterious, and confusing. Google search it if you want to. It won’t spoil anything, it’s hard to put the puzzle pieces together when playing the game. The first game has barely any story comparing to the sequel, and it constantly takes different roles and time periods.\n4. Music\nIf you would ask anyone who has played Hotline Miami what stands out about this game, one of the first answers would be the music. It really gives you the atmosphere that the game takes place. In my opinion, Hotline Miami 2’s soundtrack is much better, but a lot of the songs used in the first game are very iconic and popular.\n\nThank you if you actually read this.","December 15, 2015","true","128.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","2"

He encounters 3 unknown individuals time to time, (I've come to think they're his split personality.) they wear animal masks: An owl, a rooster and a horse. He can be considered a vigilante. I will not go any further than that.\n\nThis game is tough, and I mean tough. You will keep on dying and dying until you know how to beat the mission. Missions are usually split into segments, later in the game you'll end up doing 3+ segments in a mission. There are multiple enemies in this game, and soon enough you'll be finding people that are only killed with shotguns. That enemy is the first boss in the game, and then you'll encounter them commonly for the rest of the game. The other three I know of (excluding boss battles.) are the Mobster, waiter and dog. But when you're not dying, it's ridicously fun, I have never had so much fun smashing some guys brains in, taking his baseball bat, and killing his friends.\n\nJacket can wear multiple animal masks, all having a special trait to them, one of my favourites is the horse one, as you can kill people with doors. The default one is the Rooster, having nothing special attached to it.\n\nThe soundtrack is probably one of the best I've heard in a while.\n\nI'm not going to lie, this game is perfect. 10/10.","June 15, 2014","true","14.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","3"

This is a must have for shooter fans. Hotline miami bought me nothing but fun solid gameplay. With a clever story and intense gameplay you will drool as you see all your victims lie on the ground dead. Objective? KILL EVERYONE\n\nStory: Game as a very clever plot if you dig in. I will tell you a bit of the story, you play as an unnamed protagonist (dubbed "Jacket") who starts getting unknown phone calls that are basically telling him to go to locations and kill Russian mobsters/mafia. As you continue to kill you start losing insanity trying to make out what is real or not. This is as much info as I will tell you. But the backstory and secrets will shock you to the core.\n\nGameplay: This is a fast paced game. If you can't react fast or think fast then this isn't a game for you. In this game you wear masks to aid you when killing people, they can either boost your speed, assist you with guns or even gain you more points. The executions are brutal where you smash heads and stab people, this game is not for the faint hearted! The enemies react and attempt to kill you on sight but they aren't smart. Melee enemies are easy to take out since your fists are enough to get the dropped weapon and enemies with gun are a challenge but I think you can manage that. Overall fast and fun gameplay\n\nArt: The art is nice and decent. The art is simple and not to pretty. The sprites for main characters are nicely made and simple, the russian mobsters sprites have one same look (they are all bald). The level design are simple design but there are some good designs and colours. But the face portrait for when the characters are talking are well done! And lets not forget about the blood. This game has a habit of being really messy and bloody and I really like that. YOU CAN SEE HUMAN BRAINS THEY ARE SO REAL 76/10! But the design alright its not good looking but I like it that way!\n\nMusic: Has to be one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a video game. The music fits in well with each level I play and I can really feel the rush. Some are intense, some a good to dance to and some a great for relaxing after slaughting your enemies. There isn't any rock or pop its club or DJ music. I really enjoyed listening to the music and you will too.\n\nNegative: One thing that I will say this... what you are doing is so evil and bad that its not funny. And I am saying that for people who are thinking of getting this game cause I love bloody games with blood and gore.\n\nConclusion: This wasn't a long review but decent review. For two developers this is really impressive. But if you are really thinking of getting this game then you should buy this without thinking. This game deserves $10! MIAMI FOREVER\n\n\nNote: Sadly for you aussie gamers... hotline miami will not be coming to Australia due to ONE ♥♥♥♥ SCENE! You could skip that scene, it was pretty much the only one and it was poorly made. The developers said you should just pirate the game which is a shame cause I really want to be it with my own money.\n\n","April 24","true","39.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","14","15","4","0"

You get phone calls to do things. Thinks like there is a power outrage and you need to fix it. I need a baby sitter. There is a party at this address. When the address is given, that's all you need to visit a location and murder everyone inside. This is a very bloody game. Painting the floors sort of bloody, but its all done in an 8-bit style.\n\nThe controls are complex and very deep. I can't honestly say its very pick up and play, even after I've completed it four different times on PSN and Steam. While there are keyboard controls, right trigger is to lock onto an enemy, left trigger and thumb stick is to look, left stick itself moves, right  bumper is to shoot a gun or swing a blunt object. Left bumper is to throw it. The right thumb stick aims, but unless you want to waist precious ammunition, you better lock on and you better lock on quick, there are three men running to your position right now, because you fired a gun and they'll hear that. Everyone in the building heard it!\n\nBecause you can look ahead, you have the ability to form a strategy. Go over there, take out the guy with the pipe, get the pipe, burst into that room, hit one guy with the pipe then throw the pipe at the gunman. Plans go out the window though if someone opens a door. Looking ahead also means you can shoot enemies off screen, just as they can shoot you from off screen as well. If you're lucky, you can use someone as a human shield, but I haven't seen it often.\n\nYou need to think of tactics like luring the room out and killing them one by one, but sometimes they're too smart for that. Going in guns blazing might kill everyone or it might get you killed. Its not a game where you have a clear cut strategy. Even location to location, this try versus that try can change what strategy you can use.\n\nYou can stealth the entire way, but that means taking out three or five people in a single room. Use melee weapons or press the grapple button to coldly murder your prey. You can fling doors into your foes to knock them down, but that only stuns them. You need to mount them and well sadistically beat their heads into the ground until they don't live anymore. The doors flail open wildly on a double hinge and it feels very video game in a good way. Very satisfying even if there's a certain logic missing that goons will walk by a doorway with three dead bodies and not care.\n\nYou need to be fast, efficient and effective. Its them or you. You are just as fragile as they are. Sometimes you can get lucky, but 99% of the time you're dead from a bullet or a melee. In fact sneaking up on the same enemy nine times out of ten might mean they'll turn around and bash you before you get them.\n\nAs you progress through this brutal and unforgiving game, you'll unlock masks to wear. Before you enter a location, you chose a mask. Each mask gives you a different ability, such as the pig mask means everyone will have more guns. The donkey will have the ability to murder people with doors. There's something in here for every play style and situation. Start with a knife. Take an extra bullet without dying. Run faster. See further. Its all up to you.\n\nYou'll also unlock new weapons which really keeps the game interesting. By unlock weapons that means your enemies have the chance to carry them. Fire axes, katanas, machine guns, shotguns pistols and so on. There's a wide variety. Everything from blunt and painful to swift and effective. Guns have ammo, but you don't refill a gun, you just pick up a new one off the floor.\n\nThere's a sort of randomness to the game. Enemies pace rooms, but they can randomly take a chance to look outside the room and come down the hall. Sometimes their weapons will be different, it seems like different masks make for different weapons too. Its a beautiful array of variety that makes every time you play so fun, interesting and engaging.\n\nYou enter each location weaponless, unless a mask has given you one. Nothing like a challenge. An entire building full of goons with guns and you go in unarmed. Each location usually consists of two floors, others have more. After you've cleared the location, you need to get back to your car. Its not just "level finished!" This results in things like more goons showing up.\n\nWhen you die, you immediately restart the floor you're at. Some might see restarting the floor as a difficult process, but the game is just so fun and fast paced that it keeps you in the action. A game with this many deaths shouldn't have a long wait time.\n\nBetween the carnage, you've got a life going on. Its a life different from anything else in gaming or the real world and it gives Hotline Miami its own sort of tone. The fantastic music also helps set a strange sort of vibe. Like you're always in a dream and you don't know what's real. As the game progresses, your normal life of going to a convenience store after a location or going to a record store after a hit will begin to change. The horrible things you're doing start to sink into your characters mind. He will start to go crazy in one of the grandest and captivating stories that I've ever played.\n\nThere's a beauty to the subtlety of the story. Its not in your face, but its there before and after your missions. You'll see things and go places that make your character feel like a real person. Its also a nice break from being a house painter.\n\nIts not just straight up carnage on your missions. There are other deviations and twists. Things like the cops will show up in after you're done or a boss wearing a helmet makes things difficult. Even a cop wearing a bulletproof vest keeps things interesting. There's even a near fatal shuffle through a hospital. It keeps the game interesting and progresses the story. The enemies start to ramp up after the first few missions. It goes from deadly common thugs to dogs that will race after you. The catch with dogs is you can't fight them off hand to hand like goons.\n\nA lot of minor details went into the game. Thugs will be sitting, or in a bathroom doing their thing. You don't just knock enemies to the floor, they'll fall against walls or even begin to crawl away. Random body parts fall off and sometimes roll by.  The 8-bit gore really adds to how gruesome this game is. Enemies can see you through glass and you both can shoot through it of course.\n\nThe art style really stands out, not just old and retro, but it has its own unique feel. Things like landscape outside the location isn't an issue, everything is just a hypnotic color radiant. The entire game is beautiful and mesmerizing, just like the 1980s. All of the thugs have blue shirts and white suits, which really makes the blood stand out. The text and menus are very shifty going from one tilt to the other all with a trippy sort of shadowy echo to them. Even when you're playing the screen will shift and rebalance itself ever so slightly. When I'm engaged in the action, I never really notice it until after.\n\nHotline Miami can be a painfully difficult game if it wasn't for how enjoyable and fun it is. Every try feels 90% different and unique. The masks give it replay value and the whole fun factor gives it replay value. I've gotta take this call now...","November 4, 2013","true","6.9"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","4"

That game you've idled 2 hours to collect said cards? Well, seemingly it's a really good game!\n\nIn essence it's a top-down 2D hack'n'slash, but it's so much more than that. Even though it's not. Perhaps it's me, perhaps I'm going through a phase of heightened appreciation for games that remind me of how basic games on the NES and SNES would entertain me for hours. How gameplay and soundtracks could merge together to really sell the game to you. How simple ideas and concepts just let you play and get on with the game.\n\nHotline Miami is one of those games where every thing comes together to make a really enjoyable game, despite it looking 'lo-fi', having a strange story and 'basic' gameplay. It's addictive, fast-paced and a great nod to some classic gameplay mechanics you probably enjoyed when you were younger. There's even one of the best soundtracks around to help propel all of that madness along. I'm honestly finding it hard to express in words how everything just comes together to make a great psedo-80's mindwarping murderspree simulator, which draws nods from various degrees of pop culture and leaves you wish 'Drive' was on Netflix again.\n\nYou'll be looking at ~5 hours of gameplay from start to finish, which is the perfect length for the game as it really leaves you wanting more. The basic concept is - kill every single last M-Fer in the room before they kill you. It's like Smash TV x Drive.\nHow do you kill everyone in the room? Guns, melee weapons & doors. Yes. Doors! There's a huge range of weapons and melee weapons to use and unlock, which I found nice but never really felt the need to do so as essentially they're all the same - instruments of death!\n\nThere are various masks which you can collect along the way that give you small 'perks', such as thrown objects are lethal, doors are lethal. Nothing amazing when you initially read the description, but when you find the mask that works for your play style, you'll fall in love.\nI had far too much fun throwing guns off people for the kills.\n\nIn short, and I now this has been a short write up already, Hotline Miami is just a fun game to play. Scarily fun. You'll come away from this game thinking 2 things - 'Man that was fun - does that make insane?', 'Man that was fun - where can I get more?'. It's gameplay crack.","March 11, 2014","true","7.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

I myself didn't seem to enjoy it nearly as much as many others, including several friends, perhaps due to the original hype surrounding the game setting my expectations to high resulting in being slightly underwhelmed. Hotline Miami's gameplay is a solid fast-paced top-down action shooter with tactical stealth attributes, with plenty of violence and difficulty to boot. Storywise it is set in an alternative 1989 which you'll journey through an interesting, drug fueled, and twisted tale. As far as graphics go Hotline Miami is extremely stylized with retro, bright/colourful and bloody themes. Music-wise however, I am completely indifferent with nothing really getting my attention but it fits the game surely enough. Overall I'd recommend buying Hotline Miami if you're interested in it.","January 12","true","13.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

An addictively enjoyable psycho-murder simulator. I think without the music this would still be a great game, but with it it's hypnotically captivating when playing and inevitably replaying stages over and over, while you absolutely, positively, gotta kill every motherf*cker in the room (accept no substitutes) without dying.\n\nFor the most part if you get hit once you die, so reflexes and timing are essential in making it through alive. Occasionally if a guy shoots you who is far away you might survive if he hits you in the arm, later on you get a mask that allows you  to take a hit before you die. In fact there are a ton of masks which you unlock that grant you special abilities, like being able to kill people with one punch, or that make the enemies unable to hear your gunshots if they are in another room (really useful).\n\nLater on the levels have 2 or 3 areas to clear, but if you die after clearing the first area you will restart at the beginning of the second area so you don’t have to restart the whole level over again, which could have become really tedious to the player.\n\nA few things that are annoying are  sometimes the enemies get stuck in doors or bug out and start spinning around in one spot. Also all the boss fights are really annoying, you will die (a lot).\n\nThe story is interesting while also being kinda pretentious and ambiguous. The second game fixes some of this with more backstory and details into what may be going on. I don’t imagine that many people are playing through for the story though.\n\nIf you enjoy good music or killing a metric f*ckton of bad guy pixels in increasingly gory ways,  then you should hit this up and imagine you’re Ryan Gosling in a chicken mask.","June 2","true","7.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","2"

I've played it on the PC but never could quite get into the control scheme the way I could for the Vita. I enjoyed the heck out of this bloody puzzle/action/homicidal maniac/mind screw simulator. Although I have to say in honesty that I believe that it makes a better small platform/mobile type game than a sit down pc game. I would play it on any platform if I could if I hadn't had access to the Vita version.  That could be just the thousands of bats, crowbars, knives, swords, and bullets to the head talking.\n\nIf you aren't turned off by the suprisingly gory graphics for such a retro? style (are these retro graphics or just highly stylized?) its a game that is both simplistic and highly sophisticated. It is CRAZY the amount of violence that is conveyed through what are relatively simple graphics.\n\nHell, it kept me up for "one more level" until 2:30 when I had to be up for work at 5:30.

It has a 2D 8-bit graphic and crazy colours that make it feel like you're on drugs the entire time. The music makes you feel like being in trance... But when I finally bought the game, I really enjoyed it!\nYou play as some guy who lives in Miami in 1989 and constantly gets wierd phone calls, which tell him to go to various places and do... things. You put on your creepy animal mask, bust through a door and start brutally murdering EVERYONE you meet!! That's basically what you do throughout the entire game and, suprisingly, it never gets boring! The gameplay is never the same, since the enemies always behave in different ways, sometimes even kinda unfair. :( The game can be pretty frustrating at times, because you die after a single hit, but not just you, also your enemies!

Maybe it's the ugly pig mask or the 80s style frat boy holding a nearly naked woman in one arm with a bloody axe in the other.\n\nThe grainy graphics combined with the high speed of game play can offend a first-time player too. It takes a little while to get over it. The constant screen movement is also likely to make some players nausious, and there is no way to disable it.\n\nWhile relatively short, Hotline Miami has great music, entertaining game play, lots of grainy pixalated blood splattering gore, secrets to find, and an interesting background story.\n\nThe story itself can be difficult to figure out, because the game is initially played from the perspective of a man with some serious mental issues, along with some apparent gunshot induced brain damage. But a story is there, and it is interesting. But without the puzzle password, you won't be able to see it.\n\nThe USA in the later 1980s was a time of leadded gas, black monday, crack cocaine, irrational fear of AIDs, homophobia, the cold war, russian invasion, star wars, mohawks, the satanic panic, child sex-abuse hysteria, and an offensive overuse of neon colors.  This game is pratically a time travel machine.\n\nIt was all really quite tramatic.  No wonder the 90s are remembered fondly, given the backdrop of the 60s-70s hangover period that was the 80s.\n\nYou too can relive the late 1980s in the US, along with smashing people's heads with an iron pipe, by simply playing this game.\n\nIf you are born after 1996 and wonder why everyone older than you seems brain damaged, just remember: tetraethyl lead.\n\nI mentioned that the music was good, right?","October 1, 2014","true","10.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AtomicAstro/recommended/219150/","AtomicAstro","Astro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AtomicAstro/","55 products in account","This game is one of my favorites, but it's not for everyone. If you enjoy games that are fast paced, brutally hard, and have tons of epic ultraviolence, you'll love this game. If any of those things sound like a turnoff, this game isn't for you. It's also not for people who really like games with a very clear and coherent story, because the story of this game isn't really made clear at all. But you don't really need to know the story to be able to play the game. The gameplay is rather simple, you go around shooting everyone in sight until you've killed everything/done all of the objectives, not a whole lot of depth. However, to make things a lot more interesting, this game is very reliant on careful planning/strategy and even stealth. You really don't want to just go in and just try to mow everything down without thinking, or you'll get yourself killed in no time. The very strategy-oriented level design allows for more interesting gameplay while keeping the simplicity intact. As a little added bonus, to have an advantage you pick a mask before entering each stage, all of which resemble animal faces, and you unlock more as you go. The masks each give a unique advantage to the player, such as dogs not attacking you, silent gunshots,etc. You also unlock more weapons, but unfortunately they will only really appear on places in levels that have random items on the ground, which isn't that often. Not all of your time is spent going around killing, before you do any of that, you are in your house, and you'll usually have a new message in your answering machine. The messages are all obviously trying to be very cryptic in terms of what they are actually intending to say, to avoid being traced I assume, they all roughly translate to "Go to [insert location here] and kill everyone" Other times, you'll find yourself in a sort of group therapy session talking to a bunch of people wearing some of the aforementioned animal masks. They sort of serve to drive the story along, and they generally tend to feel uncomfortable, which I actually like. Now, one thing that you don't have to like the game to enjoy is the soundtrack. God damn this game has an incredibly catchy soundtrack! Although some of the tracks are too repetitive to listen to on their own, they still go well with the game, and make it have a really cool feel to it. The compliment to the game's music contributing to the game feel especially applies to the group therapy sessions, the song has a really dark and uncomfortable feel to it, which makes the group therapy sessions have that uncomfortable feeling I mentioned earlier.\n\nCONCLUSION: This game is great, but only if you like games that are brutally difficult, violent and fast paced. This game has very enjoyable elements, and overall I'd say I really enjoyed it, and recommend it to people who enjoy games with the qualities previously mentioned.","December 27, 2015","true","8.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I found my self shouting obseneties constantly while playing. People rave about the soundtrack from Hotline Miami but I didn't see what all the fuss was about.\n\nWhat really kept me coming back for more was the addictive game play, you will die, ALOT. What makes this all the more bareable is the quick restart times, you don't have to sit through masses of text just to continue playing, you are just thrown back in at the last check-point, which usually is the start of the floor you are on.\n\nLevels can last anywhere between two minutes, right up to fiften minutes due to trial and error runs until you pretty much get the perfect run. Your aim is to take out the bad guys while also remaining alive, you die instantly as soon as you are hit and depending on how you hit a bad guy, can sometimes take a few hits.\n\nI would highly recommend this gam as one you play a couple of minutes of every now and again, I can't imagine it being the sort of game where you blast through it in a few sessions, but I really enjoyed my time on Hotline.","January 25, 2015","true","15.0"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","26","41","3","0"

Hotline Miami is a great game. The story is told in an interesting manner and the gameplay is suprisingly full of strategy. Sure, I have played these levels before, but a game like this rewards you for playing in different styles, going for bonuses, and trying to be quick. There is a massive amount of replay value. The soundtrack ties in pretty well too.  If you are more of a completionist, you will put a lot of time into this to get those A+ scores. So if you enjoy games like Super Meat Boy, Braid, or even Super Hexagon, I'd reccomend you give this game a try.","April 13, 2013","true","29.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This game is so addictive it will devour most of your time, not to mention that it will (in a way) help you save some cash by locking you inside your room. I salute both Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin, and I thank them for bringing such a game to life. Yes, the MAIN "quest" of the game is to thump some Russian mafia boys so hard their ancestors can feel it, and yes each scene you stumble upon is to be left only after you cause a massive bloodbath... But uhh, what's not to love about that?! The game might seem a bit repetitive... Just kidding, you have more than a dozen of masks to choose from, each mask delivers a special ability that allows you to approach the same scene in a different way. Not to mention the score.... Who the hell does not LOVE to beat his friend's score and shove it in his face the next day. Moreover, there's a list of weapons and multi-kickass ground hits ( Depending on the melee you're slaughtering with.). By the way, the soundtrack of the game > your favorite band.\n\nIn short words, you will not repent buying this game my friend... Instead, you will be in my place, writing a review of how great you found Hotline Miami, and will be telling others how much you also recommend it!\nOh wait, before buying this game ask yourself this...

Sort of.\n\nIt is a top-down run and gun styled game, where one hit will kill you. So you don't really want to play it like a run and gun game, or you'll die much more, the game awards you for being reckless and making up plans as you go.\n\nThe story can be rather confusing if you don't play the sequel, but it does not detract from the game, if anything, it makes it even more interesting and intriguing.\n\nBut the best thing about this game is the feeling of being a murderer. Not even kidding.\nThey do this so perfectly, I don't know how they managed. The game has a pixel art style, and the violence is amazingly brutal, but the violence isn't as bad since it is in pixels.\n\nI feel like this represents being a killer in the best way, the art style represents being desensitized to the violence around you, you care less about murdering these people in the brutal and horrific ways.\n\nThis, pared with the music, fills you will adrenaline and gets you wanting to kill a building full of people.\n\nThat one thing made me so happy to buy this game, it affectively made me connect with a character that is nowhere near related to me. This character doesn't even talk, and I got attached.\n\nSo, I believe if you like fast-paced brutal action, Hotline Miami is the game for you.","June 13, 2015","true","5.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

You make a mistake and the game will punish you.

It's more like trial and erRESTART TRY AGAIN - Zero Punctuation, Hotline Miaimi review\n\nTHE GOOD\nAs the quote above suggests, Hotline Miami is very fast paced. Hotline uses insta-kill, similar to Super Meat Boy! Basically, one shot and you/your enemies/those little pain in the ♥♥♥ dogs are dead. While it does mean that your little lead pipe can beat the brains out of an unsuspecting enemy with a shotgun, it also means that you can die instantly from a small knife whilst hauling around pool sticks, M16's, coach guns and so on. The music in this game has been done by several people, ranging from the band M.O.O.N to the maker of the game Lone Survivor, Jasper Byrne. This would be great if not for the fact that it's very repetetive and won't always be played on loop for long sessions.\n\nTHE GREAT\nHotline is a top down shooter with retro graphics and lots of violence. Top down shooters mean that you have some time to plan your attack, although the best way of winning this game is to run'n'gun (Apart from a few levels) and any methodical planning will be wasted when that guard dog you didn't see bites your ♥♥♥ from behind, thus providing the sense that this game IS a madhouse, and should be treated as such. Wailing on the controls sometimes saves your life, which is surprising the first time that is discovered. The violence in this game is brutal, VERY brutal. This is NOT for children, as there are disgusting and disturbing ways in which you and others can die. Thankfully, the top down retro style makes it a little less graphic, but still is worse than your average shooter like CoD.\n\nTHE UGLY\nI cannot play this game for more than 20 minutes at a time. Any more and I get a headache from the electronic music going through my headphones, the shaky screen and vibrant colours. Or should I say, I USED to get headaches from the music. Several versions of this game have no sound whatsoever in the updated version, and playing the original version just to get the sound also gives you glitches with Steam overlay, achievements and many other things. Most of these problem have been isolated to Windows XP, so if you have an XP and no sound, don't panic! Hopefully there'll be a fix soon. One mission changes the idea of spamming the controls in favour of timed attacks. This goes against what the game expects from you and was no doubt the least enjoyable part of the game so far (For me at least).\n\nTHE VERDICT\nThere are two types of people in the world (Who love this gameplay style). Those who prefer Super Meat Boy! and how you need to time everything correctly (Except for one boss fight...) and those who prefer Hotline Miami with it's crazy fast paced action. Granted I haven't finished Hotline Miami yet, but from what I've seen so far, it's quite good. Several thing work for it while mostly visual and audio effects can be offputting. I'd play this game, just not when I'm feeling less than 100% healthy.\n\nSIMILAR GAMES\n-Super Meat Boy! in many aspects, but differs greatly with the way of playing\n\nFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview","December 17, 2013","true","6.0"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/219150/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","Hotline Miami is a classic example that you shouldn’t judge a game by its cover.  First impressions from screenshots and videos may leave you thinking of it as a run of the mill, top-down shooter where you blast baddies with guns (with some ultra-violence mixed in); end of story.  But if you aren’t familiar with what it actually is, as I was not, then the reality is that Hotline Miami is something much more thrilling, intricate, and insightful than what your initial impression probably suggests.  Not only is the action unique and fast paced, it is all accented with an outstanding soundtrack and surprisingly smart narrative in this stellar game by Devolver Digital.\n\nHotline Miami has you playing in late 1980's Miami, controlling a character who receives phone calls from a mysterious antagonist of sorts.  Each phone call provides you with a target to assassinate, who is usually tucked away in a building behind all manner of bodyguards and thugs. Typically you start the level with no more than your fists, but you can steal melee weapons and guns from bad guys to unleash carnage more efficiently.  As more missions are completed, newer masks (which can grant you passive buffs) are unlocked, as well as new weapons.\n\nThe brilliant twist in Hotline Miami is that enemies move and react at a breakneck pace, and your character dies in a single shot or melee hit.  The result is that many levels will have you dying dozens of times if you want to run the level efficiently and with a good score -- thankfully Hotline Miami spends virtually zero time between your death and the start of your next run.  Clearing a level feels like a perfectly orchestrated heist of brutality and cunning.  It’s very similar to something like Super Meat Boy in that regard, but the gameplay itself is different in a very refreshing and unique way.\n\nIn most top-down shooters, you wouldn't expect much in the way of narrative.  Hotline Miami doesn't have a stand-out narrative and it’s certainly not the focus here, but I was impressed with the way Devolver Digital used small environmental changes to make large implications to the player.  These small breadcrumbs build up to a pretty compelling plot; I found myself attached to a character who speaks virtually no dialogue.  It helps that the mood is set so perfectly in Hotline Miami; the music is absolutely perfect for every scene (and amazing on its own as well), and the gritty, colorful graphics create a very realized setting for the action taking place.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that Hotline Miami is an insanely brutal and violent game.   It’s intentionally over the top and discomforting, and frequently your hand will be forced to perform some gratuitous acts against questionably innocent people without reason.  What’s unexpected is that HM makes some extraordinary comments on violence in games for those who follow the relatively abstract story.  For those interested who have beat the game (or don’t mind some spoilers), I would highly recommend reading Rami Ismail’s excellent article on Gamasutra entitled “Why Hotline Miami is an Important Game.”\n\nThat said, you don’t really need to care about the underlying message to enjoy Hotline Miami.  It is a rollercoaster of high-octane, violence fueled fun, with some commentary if you care enough about it.  The length and difficulty are just right, and it’s hard not to have a smile on your face as you slowly put together your perfect, bloody infiltration to the fantastic soundtrack.  Truly, Hotline Miami is one of the most complete and enjoyable games you can play on PC today -- check it out.","December 29, 2014","true","5.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Fast paced gameplay about ♥♥♥♥ing everyone up with melees or guns. It's one of the only game where I don't rage at all when I die over and over and over again. It's like being in a trance. The only thing that matters is to get the job done, killing all those russians mobsters or whoever they are by making it the most violent way, by scoring the much out of it. It's greatly helped by an awesome kickass soundtrack, and a really rewarding and satisfying gameplay.\n\nAny shot, any melee swing has an awesome impact and feeling of power, roughness. The only thing I don't like in this game are the Fatties, those ennemies that die few seconds after being hit by a gun, same goes with the dogs that I can't punch to death, such a shame. The fatties also don't die by any kind of melee. I also don't like those Chuck Norris ennemies that spot you and kill faster than you can say Hey! Finally, picking up weapons and throwing weapons are on the same key binding and not changeable, which can be kind of an issue.\n\nOther than that, awesome gameplay, tons of replayability for whoever likes scoring, very cheap price.

After all, what can I say that hasn't already been said?\n\nWell, let me give it a shot.\n\nThe gameplay itself is challenging, but not overly frustrating. The story is surreal to the point of being nonsensical, but in a very good way. It's as if David Lynch wrote a script that Nicolas Winding Refn directed. It's that bizarre, that wonderful. But despite these comparisons, it never feels like a rip-off or the work of an inferior copycat. It's very original and has a wonderful feel to it.\n\nAs stated before, the gameplay is very challenging, but never feels overly so. Any situation, no matter how impossible it may seem, can be worked through with the proper strategy. Trial and error is key to this game.\n\nANYWAY, I highly recommend this game.

The idea is simple: you are a criminal and you need to do a number of missions which invariably consist in killing everybody in a building. You can use a wide range of weapons to do that, and even your bare hands.\n\nLet's be clear: the plot is not a strength of the game. You will die several times (the easiest achievement to get for me was the "Die 1000 times" one!), and in the process you will learn how to beat the levels. Basically, you need to learn how to ambush the enemies and kill them before they kill you.\n\nSounds boring, right? It's not! You will enjoy a fantastic soundtrack, you will try many ways to ambush your enemies, you will wear different masks which grant you different powers (such as more ammo, killing fists...), you will see a lot of blood (a lot!), and you will also have the chance to beat a few bosses. It took me roughly 7 hours to finish the game, and then there is a bit of replay value if you want to unlock all guns and masks to see everything that the game has to offer.\n\nAs far as I can tell, you cannot change the difficulty level and as I said, the game is hard (the number of deaths proves it) but fair.

So lets begin shall we ? Hotline Miami is a top down shooter set in an alternative timeline Miami. The city is overrun by russian mafia men who deal crime all over the city and that's where you come in. We play as Jacket a mysterious man who lives alone in an aparment and gets mysterious phone calls which give out an adress. Filled with rage we go there and massacre anyone that is inside. After a while we start to doubt whats real and whats not because the game starts to mess with you. So how is Hotline Miami ? It's one of the best games i have played in my entire life and if you haven't played this game by now what the hell are you doing reading this review ? Go get the game right away and expierence this masterpiece. Hotline Miami is a top down fast paced shooter where a single mistake will cost you your life. One hit kill deaths and you have to repeat the same floor again. The game is never not unfair because every time you die is because of a single mistake you make. The game is rather fast paced so you definetly need to move fast if you want to survive. The game also looks amazing. The neon colors look great and the level desing is also fantastic. The game is a blast to play and after a while you start to feel great after the kills. You could say this game unleashes the psycho inside you. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks in video game history. Overall theres nothing bad to say about Hotline Miami there are some minor bugs but nothing major. You need to play this without a doubt cause this is one of the best games ever made. I give Hotline Miami a 10/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 1, 2015","true","36.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/219150/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","There are plenty of pieces of art out there that people "don't get". Some are less important than others (I'm ok without the pseudo folk and Bieber in my life), while others should be experienced (I could list all kinds of examples here). Hotline Miami is something you will either "get" and love or just enjoy on a surface level.  Either way, it is a great game and should be picked up when the price suits you.\n\nFor those of you who haven't seen Refn's recent Drive, you should. It is a great movie and it has two special qualities : it divide's peoples opinions and it is the spiritual companion of this game (the game's creators are openly influenced by the movie). By explaining Drive, I almost explaining the game. Drive is meant to be an arthouse film spliced with an action one (or vice-versa); essentially you get a mix of lingering scenes filled with silence as well scenes of gratitious violence and gunplay. It is an odd mashup that is exectued well. Because it is odd though, not everyone can get into it.\n\nOn the surface Hotline Miami is a very interesting mix of stealth and action. The game starts by your character "Jacket" selecting a mask that house various abilities, and then using your fist or various weapons you will lay waste to hundreds of goons in very violent fashion. As you do this the superb soundtrack, infused with 80s and hypnotic magic, and the score counter push you forward. If you managed to kill a few guys in a row you will start a chain, doing certain things will net you bonus points. These points add up to unlock new masks and weapons. All of these things give Hotline Miami an arcade feel. It is fast paced and exciting: it ties together the thrill of stealth and action games in a satisfying package. This is the surface level that probably anyone can enjoy about the game.\n\nDiving deeper into the game, there are some very interesting things to analyze. Following your first mission Jacket  will throw up after a murder. In between missions Jacket will be questioned by three people wearing animal masks, each one changing the color of the lighting and treating Jacket in different ways. In a later level, Jacket will continously  stop against your will. After every message you visit a friend at various locations who is always giving you something for free and validating your friendship. There are many layers that the game is working on, and they are there to analyze if you wish. These little details and scenes might break the pace for some, or it might fit perfectly for others.\n\nHotline Miami is not without its flaws though. I feel like the bonus storyline and secret endings paled in comparison to the main game in terms of story (however the action and gameplay are still ripe). The style and soundtrack are done very well, but some people will not be in love with it. Even though I found the challenge evenly balanced, others have complained that it can be too difficult. The pacing and length are both excellent, but some people insist on bloated and neverending games. Most importantly, arthouse and surrealism aren't for everyone.\n\nHotline Miami is a terrific game. It can work perfectly as an arcade action game, or a complex game that makes you think. How much you get out of the game depends on you.","August 5, 2013","true","15.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Does it matter? No as you show up to the location ready to make your screen red.\n\nThe game play is addictive. I found though that this game was a hit for a few of my friends while others found it repetitive very quickly and boring as there wasn't anything major progressing. As you go through the missions, you unlock weapons as well as masks which give you special features (such as seeing further or being able to take a bullet). You may use a keyboard or a controller to play the game. Either way, the controls are made nice and feel really smooth. Once you get the hang of it, setting targets up and hitting the right guy (usually the guy with the gun) becomes natural. LT also let's the player see a little further ahead of themselves. Guns can be used, people can be knocked out, knives can be used, people can be choked out on the ground, people can be knocked out for a bit with doors, and you can be seen through windows and quickly get shot by a guy you neglected to see.\n\nThe graphics are as you see. They are decent and are fitting for the game. Again though, some of my friends thought the graphics sucked and walked away from the game without trying it.\n\nI would recommend the game on sale.\n\nThe indie rating would get 7.6/10 as it has a good story, decently good game play, and suitable graphics. It would have got 8 with more progressions, maybe some more RPG additions (to inventory or some sort of skill), and some new weapons that have different functions would have been nice. Local co-op would have bumped it easily up to 8.5.\n\nTrue rating as a standalone game : 6.9/10","March 31, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

You play a drug addled psycho, who is saddled up on cocaine, but that is not entirely his bane just his main payment. You get mysterious phone calls, that often result in a quite disastrous hour but simultaneously is really stour.\n\nSuch as the musical score I very much adore, being high beat rhythm in each level, it always revived me before any dishevel occurred. The beat kept on repeat, it revives you for your strives when being forced to go for a lot of angry dives.\n\nThere is a combo system, with each bigger mambo you gain every point, but there is more that isn't disjoint. You can smash someone’s head in wall when they fall. Or run in the open, if your balls are golden. There are hidden weapons to be achieved, though with the difficulty you can get a little peeved. But with each fake B+ you want to get the bleach and make it an A+.\n\nLike was brought up, the challenge is not a huge drought. The huge hoard of enemies readying to beat you with a board are plentiful. Elaborately laid out awaiting to be forced to atrophy. Boy though with each death that got swept by a broom, I would always have an odd joy, knowing I could re-equip for the room.\n\nChallenge aside the story is something that is a huge stride. But before anyone’s anger boils, there are no spoils. The low price is like a relapse to an old vice. You refused to allow your wallet to be abused. But gave in like a cave support, and paid a small fort for the game.\n\nIf you don't like fast pace, or are some kind of slug disgrace. Than it won't be that good for ya hood.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CappnRob/recommended/219150/","CappnRob","Casino Cowboy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CappnRob/","99 products in account","Hotline Miami is one of those fantastic little games which come with a simple design and use that design to deliver a wonderfully complex and engaging experience. The year is 1989, the season is late spring, and the setting is Miami, Florida, during the infamous Cocaine Wars. You are "Jacket", a no-name-given murderer who takes out hits for a mysterious caller on gang members while wearing an animal mask to hide his identity. It is a violent, brutal, and honestly somewhat unsettling and disturbing experience, and the game relishes in all of it. Not relying on just ultraviolent gameplay, Hotline Miami also makes good use of a minimalist, surreal narrative; bright, gaudy, flashing neon colors; and a synthpop soundtrack that ranges from eeriely relaxing, bood pumping exciting, and nauseatingly strange all at once to express its unsettling message with excellent results. Each level is like a high, mixing excitement and violence followed by a down time in the form of the end-mission silence and tranquil, relaxing score screen. Tension is then built up again in the introduction of the next level with its unnerving music and telephone call delivering the next hit.\n\nGameplay is simple but effective: its presented from a top down perspective and you both strafe and rotate. At first you're only equipped with your bare hands, but taking down enemies allows you to pick up their weapons for your own use: cricket bats, golf clubs, knives, guns and more, as well as special unlockable weapons that are rewarded for high scores can randomly spawn throughout the level. Action is fast paced and furious: both "Jacket" and most of his enemies are one hit wonders, so gameplay isn't just braindead fighting. No, you must think ahead to plan your moves to account for the various enemy positions and their strengths and weaknesses (are they behind a door? Do they patrol? Do they have a gun or a melee weapon? What kind of gun? And so forth...) to plot your actions. However, the AI is simplistic in design and therefore a good bit random, so even the most methodical plan won't always go according to plan. This is the greatness in Hotline Miami's design: you'll never have the same experience twice, even if you were the most skilled player alive, there's enough random chance that you'll be quick on your wits at any moment's notice and adjust your plan accordingly. It isn't perfect, though: you can't drop a weapon next to another weapon without picking the other up (frustrating when you need to switch to your fists to knock someone over for an execution), and the AI is sometimes can be moronic beyond belief, or downright prophetic. I can't count how many times I was running behind someone to knock them over just for them to superhumanly turn completely around and club my face in, or shoot me with a shotgun point blank. The layout of a few areas in the game encourage this AI weirdness as well: anywhere with a lot of windows and open space, expect to get plastered by a shotgun from beyond visible range. These are only minor hitches in an otherwise solid experience, though.\n\nThe story is very minimalist, with a lot left open to interpertation (unless you play Hotline 2, which explains a few things). "Jacket" never speaks, and the narrative takes on an increasingly surreal and bizzare character as the game progresses: certain masks speak to "Jacket" at the start of each act, his only seeming friend somehow appears at every job in the local area, and eventually bodies of people he has killed start appearing in his daily routine. This combined with the psychadelic music and flashy neon visuals leaves you to wonder what, if anything, is "real" in this narrative - and unfortunately the game never really touches on it at the end, either. There is some conclusion to the story, but its an honestly unsatisfying exposition dump for the motives behind the mysterious individuals leaving messages on "Jacket"'s phone for why they're giving him hits to take out, and the surrealist story is left hanging. However, the story in this game is not the focus but rather an enjoyable aside and so the conclusion does not hurt the game much.\n\nAll in all, Hotline Miami is a star of an indie game, and a great example of how various elements of a game work together for a greater whole, even if there are problems. The music is some of the best made retro-style synthpop I've heard, and each track suits the mood and sets the stage for the action. Its fast paced, brutally violent, unforgiving and addicting game that I couldn't reccommend any higher.

The brutal executions and kills provides most of the satisfaction, and retro-soundtrack-fueled bloodlust compels you to hit that Reset key just one...more...time.\n\nWith a short and slightly hard-to-follow 'storyline', H:M doesn't take long to beat, but offers lots of replayability and the fierce challenge so absent from most modern games.

My dreams changed.. I remember running down a hallway, being chased by a guy in a motorcycle helmet, trowing a cleaver after me, my only chance was to get that hammer, and BASH his helmet in! all this while 80's like synth music is blasting! I woke up in a pool of sweat, shaking. It was...amazing! it wasnt a dream, it was to realistic, but crazy enought that it could be. I told my wife i couldnt sleep, went back into my office, looking at Hotline: Miami in my game library, and i pressed "PLAY". "Play?"  i tought to myself.  "You think this is a game?" I cant sleep because of a "GAME"??? No! This is not a game. This is a curse. This is the devil in the makings\nThe dark scenery, the psychotic behaviors. Hotline: Miami made me a tougher person.

In all those agonizing deaths, I never once raged, instead I stood content as I learned more about the level and enemy placenents of  each level. This allowed me to form a better strategy of how to beat that level and it seemed the more I die, the more that the level became easier, I no longer needed to see more of the level to know exactly where to strike - I was no longer shooting blind.\n\nAlthough the game is linear, the game is very well made. The enemy placement and patrols are perfect and will force you to memorize the layout of each level. That's what this game calls for really... good memorization, that and razor-sharp reflexes. It's very rewarding when you finish a level and unlock new masks and weapons. I, myself, still have a ton of stuff to unlock.\n\nThe music only adds to the dark and gritty feel of the game with heavy bass and fuzz guitar in the story parts and demonized acid-techno in the gameplay. It's almost like playing through a Rob Zombie movie, at least that's how I felt. If you haven't played it, and you like unique atmospheric, dark, violent and retro games then give this a shot. I'll be playing this again soon because it's that addicting and there's plenty of unlockables.\n\nPros  Original story with abstract characters\nStrategic run and gun gameplay\nGreat soundtrack\nUnlockable masks for abilities\nReplayability\nFull controller support\nCons  Alot of holes in the story\nSmall glitches may occur\nPlayers may rage at difficulty\nFinal Thoughts:\nA highly addictive top-down shooter with relentless violence and killer tunes to keep you entertained while you lay waste to the crime lords and gangsters within the world of Hotline Miami.\n\nRating (9.1 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","January 11","true","6.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you do, please keep it to the game (・ω・)b . I really enjoyed this game for the soundtrack, gameplay, and pure fun haha. Who knew a top-down shooter could be so fun?\n\nGameplay: Top-Down Shooter that takes place in 1989. Pixelated too makes it kinda cool. You play as Jacket, who kills the Russian mobsters. You can either eliminate them one by one, or go shoot everything up, which is faster-paced and chances of dying are much more.\nIn Hotline Miami, It's more about surprising your enemies and stuff. The gameplay is fun, yet challenging. It took me about 6 hours to beat the game, yet after I beat it, it's still a fun game to replay.\n\nSoundtrack: OMG the music is addicting. The style gives the game more feel when you play it. What I like is that when you die, the music never gets interrupted. The only time it gets interrupted is when you face a boss (which goes to another soundtrack), get to a cutscene, or complete a map.\n\nDifficulty: The game can be pretty difficult at sometimes, You will die with one swing or a gunshot. However, there are different masks in the games that give you abilities. I challenge you complete it with the standard Richard mask tho haha. Once you get used to the game, you can beat it easier with strategy.\n\nReplay Value: I've played it over again a few times now and then when I run outta games to play. The good thing is you can jump around chapters after you beat teh game. I just pick a random chapter and continue the massacre. ;3\n\nWhat I liked:\nGameplay,\nReplay Value,\nThe action can keep you on your feet.\nDifficulty makes you want to keep trying to beat the game.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nSometimes I didn't spot enemies and a random gunshot comes out of nowhere and gives me a jumpscare.\nDifficulty can make me frustrated sometimes.\nBosses can be frustrating.\nStory can be a bit confusing.\n\nMy final thoughts:\nHotline Miami is a really fun game that keeps you on your feet when you do missions. Soundtrack is amazing, Gameplay can be either fast pace shoot up, or eliminate one by one. Ultimately, I think this game has great replay value, although it can be frustrating at times. I would give the game a 9.5/10.\n\nAlso, I got it for $2.50 USD on sale, which is 75% off! I recommend waiting for the sale.

Several friends playing it and it being recommended by one of them eventually made me play it regardless.\nSince I am not really the best when it comes to games that require fast reaction time or reacting to enemies from different angles without simply shooting the wall instead, I didn't think it would be the right game for me.\n\nHowever, playing it made me think otherwise: It has a unique gameplay and some kind of flair as well as a great story which I didn't even expect to exist in the first place. The game was challenging for me, yes. Heck, it even got frustrating at some parts where I seriously got stuck for one or once even two hours on a single stage. But at least it feels like a game that requires serious skill for once. And finally making it to the end of a level after you have struggled for hours feels extremely satisfying (unless you oversee the last person and get shot in the face, lol rip).\n\nIn conclusion, if you are into Arcade Shooters, it is a must buy. If you are the average Joe that looks for a unique and catchy gameplay, buy it. If you are an incompetent idiot like me, don't even think about not getting it, just buy it anyway. :P\nYes, I did enjoy the game fairly much. I first didn't even want to play it and now I am seriously considering to buy the 2nd part.

Only if you hurry up can you rack up points. But beware, you die as easily as the NPCs. One hit and you’re down. The game will punish you a lot and leave you raging. But you will try and try and try again until you figured out how to kill every standing person in the fastest time possible without biting the dust.\n\nThe game is a highly stylized orgy of brutality and violence. It’s the kind of game your granny has heard of as “one of them violent games” on the news. It’s the kind of game that doesn’t care about human dignity, it only wants to suck you in its blood shedding action and it wants you to like every single second of it and gets you pumped with it’s fantastic soundtrack. Hotline Miami is disgusting, it’s repulsive and an overall horrifying experience – and I loved every single moment of it.\n","March 6, 2015","true","7.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Several friends playing it and it being recommended by one of them eventually made me play it regardless.\nSince I am not really the best when it comes to games that require fast reaction time or reacting to enemies from different angles without simply shooting the wall instead, I didn't think it would be the right game for me.\n\nHowever, playing it made me think otherwise: It has a unique gameplay and some kind of flair as well as a great story which I didn't even expect to exist in the first place. The game was challenging for me, yes. Heck, it even got frustrating at some parts where I seriously got stuck for one or once even two hours on a single stage. But at least it feels like a game that requires serious skill for once. And finally making it to the end of a level after you have struggled for hours feels extremely satisfying (unless you oversee the last person and get shot in the face, lol rip).\n\nIn conclusion, if you are into Arcade Shooters, it is a must buy. If you are the average Joe that looks for a unique and catchy gameplay, buy it. If you are an incompetent idiot like me, don't even think about not getting it, just buy it anyway. :P\nYes, I did enjoy the game fairly much. I first didn't even want to play it and now I am seriously considering to buy the 2nd part.

If you do, please keep it to the game (・ω・)b . I really enjoyed this game for the soundtrack, gameplay, and pure fun haha. Who knew a top-down shooter could be so fun?\n\nGameplay: Top-Down Shooter that takes place in 1989. Pixelated too makes it kinda cool. You play as Jacket, who kills the Russian mobsters. You can either eliminate them one by one, or go shoot everything up, which is faster-paced and chances of dying are much more.\nIn Hotline Miami, It's more about surprising your enemies and stuff. The gameplay is fun, yet challenging. It took me about 6 hours to beat the game, yet after I beat it, it's still a fun game to replay.\n\nSoundtrack: OMG the music is addicting. The style gives the game more feel when you play it. What I like is that when you die, the music never gets interrupted. The only time it gets interrupted is when you face a boss (which goes to another soundtrack), get to a cutscene, or complete a map.\n\nDifficulty: The game can be pretty difficult at sometimes, You will die with one swing or a gunshot. However, there are different masks in the games that give you abilities. I challenge you complete it with the standard Richard mask tho haha. Once you get used to the game, you can beat it easier with strategy.\n\nReplay Value: I've played it over again a few times now and then when I run outta games to play. The good thing is you can jump around chapters after you beat teh game. I just pick a random chapter and continue the massacre. ;3\n\nWhat I liked:\nGameplay,\nReplay Value,\nThe action can keep you on your feet.\nDifficulty makes you want to keep trying to beat the game.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nSometimes I didn't spot enemies and a random gunshot comes out of nowhere and gives me a jumpscare.\nDifficulty can make me frustrated sometimes.\nBosses can be frustrating.\nStory can be a bit confusing.\n\nMy final thoughts:\nHotline Miami is a really fun game that keeps you on your feet when you do missions. Soundtrack is amazing, Gameplay can be either fast pace shoot up, or eliminate one by one. Ultimately, I think this game has great replay value, although it can be frustrating at times. I would give the game a 9.5/10.\n\nAlso, I got it for $2.50 USD on sale, which is 75% off! I recommend waiting for the sale.

That brutally satisfying crunch of ripping some goon's head off at the beat of some psychedelic tune that plays throughout gives the game something greater in absence of voice-acting. Less is more.\n\nAt times Hotline becomes a surreal experience. As you keep restarting a level you fall into this kind trance. The only way to break it is to kill everyone in the building. Wait, no.

Mann setting up the intense soundtrack and gritty locales with over the top violence. Lynch setting up a story that is only intended to mess with out heads and leaving us saying "WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?" as we go further down the rabbit hole. Nothing is what it seems after all. What seems like a standard game where you play hitman to a faceless voice on a phone, quickly turns into something else, albeit, cryptic along the way. I won't say anything else on that. Just know that this game has all of the right elements going for it.\n\nHotline Miami is a top down game that mixes melee, shooting, and stealth mechanics, with 1 hit kill or be killed gameplay, to make one hell of a tense game. It is hard. Very hard. You will die a LOT. I have not had this much fun dying since I played Dark Souls. This may unfortunately turn off those looking for an easier type of game.\n\nThroughout the game, you will come across many thugs, and in each section, the goal is simple. Kill everyone. You will use pretty much everything around you to do so. Play enemies into the environment by doing some rope a dopes. Use stealth tactics, to silently kill enemies. Or go balls to the wall guns blazing on a room full of baddies. There is no pre-determined way to reach your goal in each section. And each time you die, you may have to re-strategize completely.\n\nThe game can be overly frustrating for some people for 2 main reasons. the difficulty being the main issue for some people. If you get shot, or melee hit just 1 time, you're done. And the action is so fast and frentic you will have little time to dodge hits. Enemies are quick, and they do not hesitate. There is no real adaptive AI in them. If they hear a gunshot, the come running. If they see you, they shoot (and they are almost 100% accurate on the spot you are (or hopefully were) standing in. So while the enemies may not be adaptive, you will need to be instead. And that is the key to getting through unscathed. And it will take being unscathed to achieve that. The other issue that may tick people off is one flaw in the otherwise decent lock on system. It locks on to the closest enemy (unless you manually move the cursor). Why is this bad? Because it will lock onto enemies in other rooms! If a guy is coming down a corridor that you in, and you want to lock onto him, and there is another guy in a room next to you with the doors closed, and he happens to be closer, well, you guessed it. the guy who is not a current threat will be auto targeted. Kind of annoying. But not game breaking. With the manual cursor movement for camera panning, this is easily fixed.\n\nVisually Hotline Miami is pretty damn nice for a heavily pixeled retro style top down shooter. The action takes place primarily inside buildings ranging from seedy motels, night clubs, to office buildings and more. When enemies die (or you do), the blood splatter and gore is super satisfying. You'll see severed limbs, exploded heads, decapitations, brain matter, and more all over the place as you leave a trail of bodies in your wake on your missions.\n\nAs for the music, the reason I bought the game, well, just listen for yourself:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKD-MVfC9Ag\n\nBuy this game now!","February 20, 2013","true","8.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game is a fantastic blend of skill, chance, and violence.\n\nIf you like difficult, skill-based gameplay, heavy amounts of violence, and an awesome soundtrack, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are great - the artstyle is a nice throwback to the 80's, and gratuitous amounts of blood and gore are provided. You will die a lot, and kill a lot, and the death animations are plentiful. The soundtrack is awesome, supplementing the retro vibe immensely. It is probably one of my favorite soundtracks that I've encountered in a while, and many times I will just wait/replay a level to hear a particular track (pretty sure the tracks are level-specific). There are also a lot of different tracks, as I've encountered new ones even post-main game completion. There are a variety of weapons and masks, each with new models. The different level layouts force you to adopt different techniques, and slowly add new mechanics at a reasonable rate. The story is a bit basic, but there are some twists and events that will surprise you, and the execution is really well-done. The overall themes fit the gameplay and add to the experience.\n\nThe controls are not too difficult to familiarize yourself with, however, I strongly suggest using a controller if possible. I have tried playing with the keyboard+mouse, and personally find a controller to be more responsive (even thought I have my mouse set to an insane sensitivity). There is a quick, painless tutorial that really helps you prepare for the rest of the game. The learning curve is moderate to challenging, the difficulty based on your skill (and determination) at aiming in top-down action games. You can use a variety of different techniques in the main game, further emphasized by the large variety of masks and weapons. Some of the masks even make the game more difficult - like one that gives you "night vision," impairing your vision (but not the enemy's).\n\nGameplay is full of intense violence, and your goal is to eliminate all enemies in a floor - most levels consisting of at least 2 floors. You (and most enemies) die in one hit, making the game very difficult if you do not plan in advance. You will most likely use A LOT of trial and error, and I think this makes the game extremely fun - also adding a lot of re-playability when you unlock more masks and weapons. Speed runs are definitely a great part of the game if you are into that.\n\nAs you complete levels, you will gain experience, which unlocks new masks and weapons for you to use. When you begin a stage, you can select a mask - granting you a buff (or debuff). Weapons are mostly random, so most enemies will have different weapons, and there will be fixed pickups littering the floor (again, randomized). The secondary campaign, however, seems to be mostly fixed, and I will explain that later. Masks can grant you abilities like "lethal doors" (opening a door when someone is behind it normally knocks them down, but this mask will cause them to die), more firearms spawning, starting with weapons, or moving faster. This is really well-done, and adds to the type of strategies you can use. Personally, my two favorite masks were the horse and dog ones ("lethal doors" and "dog's don't attack you"). Dogs in this game are brutal since they require a weapon to kill. A common technique I employed was to "bait" enemies out by moving into their line-of-site and running away, only to hit them with a melee weapon or a closed door when they came around the corner. Bottlenecking enemies into a straight line when you have a firearm also helps considerably. You can also throw your weapon, which usually knocks people down (unless it is a pointed item, which will kill them).\n\nIn the later levels, you will have to deal with progressively more and more difficult mechanics added, like multiple armed enemies in a room looking at multiple angles - especially the door. I would address this by shooting my gun to draw them out, killing them one-by-one. Another annoying (but good) mechanic is glass windows, which enemies can and will shoot through if they see you. Line-of-site is a big element in this game, and a mask even increases your range. This is important because some enemies may be standing at the end of a hallway - beyond your line-of-site - and will shoot you across the entire distance when you come through. The game has a nice feedback system of flashing red whenever you kill an enemy. Since enemies are in fixed locations with (mostly) fixed (intial, until you force them to break) movement patterns, trial and error will help you develop the more efficient strategies for completing each stage.\n\nWhen you beat the game, you will  unlock a secondary campaign, which will have your character start off with a cleaver and 3 throwing knives. You will be unable to select a mask or pick up new weapons. If you throw your knife and miss, you can pick it up, however, a knife will be used up if you kill an enemy. I noticed that this campaign emphasizes skill heavily, as I have been stuck on numerous levels for quite a while. Skillshots (knife throwing) are essential to success, since many enemies will be armed and away from your melee range. My "baiting" technique was rendered almost useless in the secondary campaign. Still, it is definitely a lot of fun, and I was happy that there was more content after the main story.\n\nOverall, if you like challenging, violent gameplay, then you should definitely give this game a try.\n\nStrongly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","January 7, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

No matter how many times you get beaten and beaten by it, you just keep coming back  because you love it.\nWith that being said, this game is highly unforgiving. From personal experience (so far), I'd say this is almost as unforgiving as any of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. titles. With that also being said, this is probably one of the few indie games that is actually  worth  buying.  WOW!  It's also got quite a bit of replay value as well.\n\nYou get yourself a nice, fast-paced, top-down, fun, bloody beat/shoot-'em-up with a killer soundtrack. Which I also recommend picking up.

Despite I'm not a fan of excessive violence , I absolutely loved that game , for various reasons .\n\nFirst thing first , the gameplay . The most important part of anygame . Here it's simple : View from above , mouse to aim and shoot , key to move . Simple ? Not really , because the game is EXTREMELY difficult - even a bit Try'n'die at some moments (at my third hour of playing , I had 901 deaths . Duh .) It's up to you to choose wether to go full melee and try not to be spotted or to go loud - which is ultra dangerous , though rewarding in term of combos if you manage to kill many ennemies quickly . Note that the weapons have extremely limited ammo - 6 shotgun bursts and you have to drop it , for exemple . There are also various element that might surprise you : windows through you can shoot -and mostly get shot- , events , etc . Any stage has it difficulties , but to make the thing more diversified , there are a lot of mask with different effects on the gameplay : One will make door stomping fatal to ennemies , one will give you more ammo ... It's up to you to discover .\n\nSecond thing , the scenario and ambiance . It's like a psychological thriller happening in Miami , covered in shadows from the very begining , and staying obscure even though it brightens over the time . The more the game progress and the more ... Well , I'm not gonna spoil , but it's worth a try . This kind of scenery in a place like 80's Miami feels quite disturbing - though unique in a certain way .\n\nThird thing that diserves to be noted is the amazing OST . No less than 9 artists composed the tracks of the game , mostly 80's techno and some few tracks of psychedelic music . And it's just a pleasure for the ears that manages to fit with the bloodbathes you're going to generate .\n\nThere's a lot of secrets to unlock , different ways to finish the mission depending the mask you take , and the score system will might you try even harder to do the perfect run . So in term of replayability , the game is good .\n\nTo make short : Don't hesitate , buy it .","December 19, 2014","true","29.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, it was frustrating at times but that was just because of my inaptitude to be good at it at the time. Top down fast paced shooter that almost feels like killing puzzle. Question is: How do you kill all of them and not take a single hit? Single hit in this game means death which means restarting the level you're on. Quick decisions, quick execution and a little thinking is required but like with most things practice.. makes things more manageable. Game works very smoothly, controls work like a charm, absolutely wicked soundtrack and the fact that I have very little negative to say about the game might not tell you much... but it actually means I'm recommending this game. Whole heartedly. Buy it!\n\nIf you're not completely sure, go check a gameplay video or a little bit of let's play to see if it hits your alley. That's what I would suggest with any game you're not completely sold on already. And maybe check a review.

Where to start? This game is wonderful. It is a fast paced, top-down retro shooter.  With kickin' music and a ♥♥♥♥♥in' art style it is a joy to play. The story is also really cool too, you never really have the full picture, so it keeps you guessing. The masks are all unique and the finishers are just brutal.\n\nAs I said before, this game is NOT for everyone. This will make you angry, make you rage. There are two levels that I recall that made me almost quit the game. An insta-fail 'stealth' segment and the ending of one level in particular that involves snipers.\n\nI use a mouse and keyboard, but a controller works just as fine. The lock-on is a bit iffy, but it gets the job done. The soundtrack is memorable and fast paced, always heightening the action. While I don't understand the grading that often, it is pretty cool to unlock a new weapon(even if most melee weapons function the same, just with different visuals)\n\nThis game is a wonderful piece of indie cake. It will last you about 6 hours on an initial play, and if you want to get full completion, about 8-9. The game is work it's asking price, but it is on sale pretty often, so get it then if you are not to sure about it.\n\n9/10, a great, great game.

The tale told will (hopefully) challenge the player how  storytelling in video games matters and even whether it matters at all.\n\nAll of this is accompanied by deliciously abominable music that will remind you of a very bad drugtrip.

Where to start? This game is wonderful. It is a fast paced, top-down retro shooter.  With kickin' music and a ♥♥♥♥♥in' art style it is a joy to play. The story is also really cool too, you never really have the full picture, so it keeps you guessing. The masks are all unique and the finishers are just brutal.\n\nAs I said before, this game is NOT for everyone. This will make you angry, make you rage. There are two levels that I recall that made me almost quit the game. An insta-fail 'stealth' segment and the ending of one level in particular that involves snipers.\n\nI use a mouse and keyboard, but a controller works just as fine. The lock-on is a bit iffy, but it gets the job done. The soundtrack is memorable and fast paced, always heightening the action. While I don't understand the grading that often, it is pretty cool to unlock a new weapon(even if most melee weapons function the same, just with different visuals)\n\nThis game is a wonderful piece of indie cake. It will last you about 6 hours on an initial play, and if you want to get full completion, about 8-9. The game is work it's asking price, but it is on sale pretty often, so get it then if you are not to sure about it.\n\n9/10, a great, great game. I don't like rage-y twitch games but this one is the exception. Like the mongols.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofFCb2modMk","May 13, 2015","true","12.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Pretty much every enemy in this game will die if you hit them, but so will you. This makes the levels in this game often extremely difficult and liable to make people frustrated.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055814197/recommended/219150/","76561198055814197","Krauvando","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055814197/","375 products in account","Hotline Miami is a crime game where the main, unknown character (usually referred as "Jacket") seems to follow some order via telephone where he has to infiltrate russian bases and execute all mafia members inside. However, both killings purpose and character's roots are a mystery and may develop during the storyline.\n\nGraphics: 7/10 - Despite it looks like a dirty-bit-made game, Hotline Miami appears to be quite beautiful in the sense it was meant to be. It certainly combines that retro essence (for instance, the camera sight is hellicopter-based, like the old GTA games) with more sophisticated technology, together with many color contrasts, which makes this game quite enjoyable to look. And following the game's logic, blood and gore are also impressively explicit. So in the end, graphics are decent and beautiful, especially if you're fond of this retro style.\n\nSountrack: 9.5/10 - Holy ♥♥♥♥, the soundtrack is freakin' flawless. It even might be the most remarkable part from this game since all tracks are perfectly chosen and amazingly performed. Prepare yourself to listen some of that sort of music that will absolutely bring you to the old years where the game's storyline is taking part.\n\nControls: 6.5/10 - Despite I haven't tried this game with a gamepad, it can't be trickier than with WASD + Mouse. The controls are actually nice and logic but I just felt the game's physics made it hard to get a nice control of the character, and during some tough battles they can be your worst enemy. Even once you get used to them, you might feel not reliable enough with them. Nevetheless, there's no doubt that the controls at least allow you to show some skills and pretty much do anything you need to do. I blame on physics.\n\nDuration: 7.5/10 - For less than 2 bucks (during Steam sales of course) this game will provide you with 15 chapters with progressive difficulty, and considering you're new at this and that you need to gain experience with these games, Hotline Miami might take from 4 hours to 6 with a story that will keep you from knowing more. Why the killings? Why the calls? Do you like hurting other people?\n\nDifficulty: 7.5/10 - It is already well-known that Hotline Miami is a pretty mercyless game even for those players who have already beaten it. This game will combine skills with luck, and may become frustrating at several parts, even from the very beginning. However, once you get the idea, this frustration will turn into determination and failures prevent you from comitting the same mistake twice, making your skills evolve fastly, and therefore make this game even more awesome. But things will come in time, firsty expect to die hundreds of times before achieving success. Don't hesitate!\n\nOVERALL: 8/10 - Hotline Miami is one of those little games you'll be proud to have paid for, and even it's a really well-made and completed game, you'll ask for more. Critics from this title are constantly positive and they are for a reason, so pick this jewel ASAP and give it a chance even if it doesn't look like "your type of games", trust me, it might surprise you.","January 4, 2014","true","13.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

So yes, this is a short game, considering I played it for the lenght of a normal game's campaign, except I did EVERYTHING you could possibly achieve.\n\nThe good\nThe gunplay and melee combat is amazing, you need tactics and fast reflexes to brutally murder your way through each level.\nEven though you might consider the gameplay repetitive, it doesn't feel like that, because each room, each floor is a new challenge on its own. Gunshots attract enemies, so you have to decide whether or not you want to alert the whole floor, all because you want to shoot some idiot, who has his back turned on you anyway.\nThis game is gameplay-focused, and barely has a story, but this isn't a bad thing, because the gameplay is just so ridiculously fun.\nThere is an alternate ending, which explains a 'story' behind it, but by the time you've found the way to unlock it, you don't care about the story anyways.\nThe music makes the gameplay much more fun, It makes you not give up when you've been killed by that same damn dog for the 60th time.\n\n\nThe bad\nThere isn't much bad things about this game, you might say the graphics, but I never found the pixel graphics bothering. It looked good, and I can't imagine anyone really being bothered by it.\nThere's one thing that bothered me a bit, which is the lenght of the game, you can knock this one out in one afternoon. It's easy to learn, yet surprisingly hard to master. It took me quite a few tries to get an A+ score on 'Decadence'.\nBut if you don't care about high scores and just want to shoot b!tches up, the game will be over before you know it.\n\nThe verdict\nHotline Miami is a nice game you can play in between AAA games. In a way it's relaxing to keep on killing baddies without purpose. And that's the goal of the game, entertain you, without really doing anything, just give you a weapon and a level. You figure it out. The mask bonusses are nice, but you'll find yourself using one or two masks all the time, depending on your play style.\n\nI'd give it an 8/10.","May 25, 2014","true","30.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Hotline Miami is a fun game. The game is simple: kill everything that moves before they kill you. Everything dies on a single hit including yourself so you better play carefully and take out a singel enemy at the time Or move fast and finsh the enemy before they can even see you. However when you die you can with a singel button restart the level.\nJust remember that this game is very violant, even if the grafic of the game is something you can find in a Atari game.\nThe game has also a great soundtrack for each level (with the exception of bonus levels) which makes each level feel diffrent and adds to the game itself.\nSo what is Hotline Miami?\nA game I would recomend to those who like a good challange along with some great music.\nBut if you dont like violance in games and are also looking for a grafical impressive game then you should look for something else.\nLets see now what the sequal has to offer...","September 19, 2014","true","15.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

When it first came out, I wasn't really hyped about it, that was a very very big mistake - but after three years I have bought this game.\nNo words - it's a masterpiece and it's quite how old games worked - they can be hard, but they are sure rewarding. Also, it's in the 1989 - like two years before "Sonic The Hedgehog".\n\nMask system and soundtrack This game features a unique mechanysm called "mask system", winch just bases on having animal mask that give You benefits like Good Shot (Rick), An Eye for Secrets (Rasmus), Start with drill (Carl). Game has a cool, oldschool vibe, packed with pixels, neon lights, and...THE AMAZING SOUNDTRACK. It just goes perfect with the killing spree You are on, winch is a good thing if You're angry - discharge Your energy while killing..pixels. Yes. Love the music? Proably love the game, since..beats, but well, some people I saw can't really beat it.\n\nWhy Hotline Miami? The game IS about dying alot, so don't think it'll be a painful thing, You don't need to wait, just press R to restart. Don't worry also about people saying that "game is too hard". It's their fault they can't really beat it. Some Hotline Miami R button victims didn't make it. Anyway, You have a very big variety of strategies to choose, this is why the fun never ends!\n\nDifficulty This game will make many people rage, but the thing is I didn't rage, it wasn't too hard for a medicore player, but softcore players like my friends got real mad on it.\n\nThe real problem Problem is: The game is too short. 2 days and beaten it (no joke, thought it was longer/harder so it would take me a week, but well). Hotline Miami also features a very nice, smooth lore and two (maybe three..? :D) endings, but they don't base really on Your decisions, just has two perspectives including the puzzle, but won't spoil You people anymore.\n\nPros:\n- Great theme;\n- Mask system;\n- Perfect soundtrack;\n- Lore;\n- Brutality;\n- Variety of killing options, strategies.\n\nOne medium thing:\n- Can be hard for some people, but I honestly think it's their fault they can't play the game; either it's that it's not their type of game, or, they get tired after trying alot so they don't want to continue.\n\nCons:\n- Very short (2 days to beat in my playthrough).\n\nOverall: 10/10 - Just buy it!\n\nThanks for reading!\nKanoxP\n\nEDIT: I made this review bigger, so people can find this more useful (maybe).","October 4, 2015","true","25.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

It has this 80s themed electronica sound to it which matches perfectly to the artstyle of the game.\n\nMy only gripe with Hotline Miami is that the story is rather confusing.

Curiousity killed me, so I bought the game, and now I know why this game gets lots of love. The gameplay, which is my favorite thing, is awesome. You can choose the way you want to kill. Slam the door in their face and slit their throat, or maybe you'd prefer going in a room guns blazing and throwing anything you'd find. It's fast paced with some stealth elements, which I honestly never thought I'd see. I'm also at the point where I'm about to break this computer because of the difficulty. Well, that's a good thing, because I rarely ever get the thought of doing that, no matter how hard the difficulty. At a close second, the soundtrack takes that spot. It goes well with the game and makes it even more hectic than it already is. I really have no say on the graphics, other than they did a pretty nice job. This goes the same with the story, because who needs a story when you're busy beating people up with an animal mask on? The one issue with the game is that it is somewhat buggy, and you have to download something once you get the game. I don't know if it works with earlier Windows computers if you do need to download anything, but I know you do with Win8. It can be a bit buggy and sometimes the AI acts like they're superhumans and come kill you from the other side of the building when you do a silent kill with no one around and then begin to snipe you with a shotgun. Other than those problems, I do really enjoy this game.\n\nGraphics- 7.5/10\nGameplay- 9/10\nStory- 6.5/10\nAudio- 10/10\nReplayability- 2/10\n\n.:7.0/10:.\n+Fast gameplay\n+Awesome soundtrack\n+Neat graphics\n-Buggy-ish","April 20, 2014","true","2.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I could go on and on, but really Hotline Miami is a treat to play in just about every way imaginable.\n\nBasically you have a mission in each level to kill everyone else there, each mission is really only minutes long, but you might find yourself playing for hours as you die with one or two bullets or one hit from a baseball bat (or crowbar, knife, etc). But your foes are just as weak, and you have the advantage of being the instigator, move quickly from foe to foe crushing heads with out alerting adjoining rooms with melee weapons or throw just about any weapon to knock a man down and ground pound him into hamburger Fire off a gun and the noise will draw a crowd... into a door way or around a bend and right into your loving embrace. There's never a right mask or right weapon for the right time, its all up to your choices on the fly, arguably the best is when your plans go awry and you need to think fast, swapping weapons and facing several baddies in the blink of an eye.\n\nThat might make it sound easy but, you will die, probably hundreds of times, over and over, quickly mashing the R key to begin the 30 - 60 second segment again, you'll quickly learn a lot of ins and outs of combat and soon feel like a rampaging powerhouse of destruction, despite always being one mistake from death. There is no bad finish to a level, because if you've made it through a level, it was by the skin of your teeth. The story, achievements high scores or just trying out different tactics and different weapons will keep you playing the levels again and again.\n\nThe graphics are a super old school retro look, and maybe could be a little more defined in spots but mostly will have you very easily identifying who is what and what is what and where to go with ease. There are some particularly good psychological effects that the game uses at times and for me it really does a great job embracing the madness The animations are fantastic as there's often a different "ground attack" for each melee weapon, as well as different swinging speeds and animations depending on which of the several weapons you've grabbed.\n\nPerfectly matching look and feel of the game is the bouncing rapid paced crazy electronic sound track to keep your blood pumping fast and furious I find myself with random songs from the game in my head all the time, and do occasionally listen to the soundtrack outside of the game.\n\nIf any one part of the game was lacking, the sound, the graphics, the controls, the story, it would really break apart very quickly, however none of that happens, its a perfect storm and it will rock you and keep you playing well past the end of the game and beyond.","November 30, 2013","true","15.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","5"

It was on sale, and I felt like growing my steam game collection at the time. I figured "meh, i'll give it a try." So I traded someone a few TF2 items, and in return he gave me this. I generally did not get around to playing it until this March.(way to put off something..yikes.)\n\nAnyway, I did hear a little about the game in the past. And it reminded me of GTA2 for some reason.(most likely due to the overhead view.) and originally thought this was an open world game like GTA2. Well, at the time I had grown tired of open world games. So I did not give it any more though. But just recently, I started it up.\n\nI did not know what to make of it at first. My initial thought was "Wow this game is weird...and kinda trippy too." but as I started to play more and more, I started to fall in love with this game. The soundtrack, the uniqe gameplay, ect, iv'e never seen anything like this before.\n\nAnd before you know it, I had beaten the game. And WOW. I was very impressed. The story was somewhat confusing for me. But I kinda liked that...confusion? in a way? I think it's because there's a lot of context in the story you kinda need to figure out yourself.  Even though the main character, Jacket.(That's his name.) does not speak, you can see how he feels and acts throughout the game, just through his violent actions.\n\nAs I played more and more, things got more confusing, made less sense, and I loved every second of it. As I started to realize that the game was attempting to satire violent video games instead of embrace them; it really made me think about we really do honestly become desensitized to violence.\n\nBut I should try and explain what you actually do in the game. Well, the game is a 2D top down perspective. You go through each level attempting to kill the Russian mobsters that are swarming all over each level. You can also accumulate points for things such as doing fast kills, getting multiple kills in a row, ect, all which unlock different masks you can wear with different abilities. And different weapons. I thought the masks were a really neat idea, and it keeps the gameplay from getting too boring.\n\nThe music is absolutely fantastic. If you can afford it, I would highly reccomend buying the soundtrack, and supporting those who made it.  The soundtrack really does have that 1980's Miami feel to it.(obviously) and I found myself just starting up the game just to listen to the awesome soundtrack.\n\nThis has to easily be one of my favorite games iv'e got off steam so far. I highly highly reccomend it.","March 16, 2014","true","76.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

Do you hear bullets raining down from the heavens in a angelic chorus of White-jacketed Russian Mobsters screaming and gushing blood from their now-rotten maws?\nYes. Yes I do.\nThe game mixes a very beautiful, pixelated atmosphere with the colorful memories of the 80's, and of course, gives a Miami-like environment and no one would shake their head at Miami being referenced with an 80's setting. Just look at Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. If I had to guess on a certain influence or alikeness for this game, it would be that, NO QUESTIONS asked.\nIt gives off artistic points of views through rubber mask personas, and is very story-driven, which is a GREAT thing to me at the very least.\nThe music is, not only absolutely amazing, but holds the feeling of a very tenseful setting and mood for which your character is put into. Listen to it for yourself. It puts you straight into the action and makes you feel what it's like to be in an intense firefight.\nAnother thing is with every hit you give and every step you make with your character, the developers made sure that you FELT like you were actully hitting something, and got a sense of reward for hitting something. Not many games do that. (Some do, however, this game punishes you so much, that it almost feels fun.)\n\nI honestly would LOVE to play Hotline Miami 2 if I could right now.","December 24, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hotline Miami is this generation’s Postal, but without the tongue-in-cheek preface, and even more indefensible in terms of its content. But that’s the point, really. Oddly reminiscent of Dreamweb (1994), if only for its top-down perspective and dark violence, Hotline Miami is a moment-to-moment heart-pounding pixel-perfect murder simulator.\n\nA strange phone call with instructions in code sends you to a location: a house, a club, an apartment building. You choose which mask to wear (each one with special attributes), and try to kill everyone inside. Every shot is deadly, for both you and the mobster-types you decimate. Death is instant, often so fast only the “PRESS R TO RESTART” giving you a clue that you’re dead. Controls are simple, left click to attack (punch, shoot, stab), contextual to what weapon you have in your hands. Right click to pick up what’s on the floor, or to throw what you’re carrying.\n\nThe more creative you are in your spree, the higher the grade and score at the end of a mission. Score unlocks new masks, and new weapons that may drop from enemies (kinda like Super Crate Box). But why are you killing, and who is on the other end of the phone call?","September 22, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you hear bullets raining down from the heavens in a angelic chorus of White-jacketed Russian Mobsters screaming and gushing blood from their now-rotten maws?\nYes. Yes I do.\nThe game mixes a very beautiful, pixelated atmosphere with the colorful memories of the 80's, and of course, gives a Miami-like environment and no one would shake their head at Miami being referenced with an 80's setting. Just look at Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. If I had to guess on a certain influence or alikeness for this game, it would be that, NO QUESTIONS asked.\nIt gives off artistic points of views through rubber mask personas, and is very story-driven, which is a GREAT thing to me at the very least.\nThe music is, not only absolutely amazing, but holds the feeling of a very tenseful setting and mood for which your character is put into. Listen to it for yourself. It puts you straight into the action and makes you feel what it's like to be in an intense firefight.\nAnother thing is with every hit you give and every step you make with your character, the developers made sure that you FELT like you were actully hitting something, and got a sense of reward for hitting something. Not many games do that. (Some do, however, this game punishes you so much, that it almost feels fun.)\n\nI honestly would LOVE to play Hotline Miami 2 if I could right now.","December 24, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as a unnamed man but as the fans call him "Jacket" every night you get strange cryptic phone calls from an unknown person telling you insturctions. Then you head into your car and go into a night of killing...\n\nHotline Miami is a fantastic game since it combines puzzle and action since guards hear gunshots and that melee weapons are silent. Be warned you will die quite a lot in this game cause it's pretty hard but fair at the same time. The enemy's are predicatable with linear patterns that you can use to your advantage  but sometimes a guard might stray of his usual path throwing you off. Also there are many ways to deal with each level which makes the replay value quite high since you can either go stealth or go in guns blazing. The graphics fit the style of this game since it's drug induced and is set is the late 80's with lots of color and detail.\n\nCons: Framerate sometimes drops randomly when playing\nEarl (Walrus) is glitched and you can't survive 2 bullets\n\nIn conclusion Hotline Miami is a great title to pick up on the Summer Sale and is worth the asking price 9/10","June 19, 2014","true","68.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElhalfawiClarke/recommended/219150/","ElhalfawiClarke","Reserved for 3rd Strike.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElhalfawiClarke/","349 products in account","Took me a while to finally remember its existence (due to a number of reasons namely I HAVE SO MANY GAMES ON ME. LITERALLY). But I digress. I wanted to give it a go due to another fact that a lot of people held praises for this game and I wanted to know what the fuss was about. Downloaded the game and started playing it.4 hours have passed like nothing when I first played through this addicting game. The game is challenging, one hit and you're out. Typical old-school style. Unlimited checkpoints though which kinda evens out the challenge. You get all kinds of weapons from simple knives to ♥♥♥♥ing double barrel rifles to even throwing objects like shurikens, darts and even scissors. The gore level is cranked way high in this game, regardless of the fact that its art style is an 8-bit style orgy-fest with neon filled aesthetics that act as a throwback to the 80s as the game takes place in '89 Miami, Florida. You start off bare-handed and you have to choose through a number of animal masks, each can give you a certain power that can enhance your play or even hamper it. Your default mask 'Richard' or the 'Rooster' mask doesn't give you any power and is the first mask you star off with. The objective of the game is simple. You go into a house/mansion/apartment or what have you where you start killing off the enemies one by one to clear the stage, and by doing so you get points as rewards for your killings and of course like any game with great design, the game encourages you- the player to be diverse in your killings and not stick to just one style. You can shoot your way out of a level sure, but don't expect a rank higher than a C or even a C-. The more enemies you kill without a break is called a combo, and as the combo meter racks up so do the points. You can strangle, mutilate, break, mash, bash, cut the living ♥♥♥♥ out of your enemies. No remorse. No mercy. You will die a lot in this game. And by a lot, I mean A WHOLE ♥♥♥♥ING LOT. There's even an achievements called 'Karma' that's got when you die 1000 times. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing developers know how ruthless this game can get. Nevertheless, the game IS addictive and IS fun and keep in mind always that every time you die, you learn. Unless you have a brain capacity of a I.R Baboon 'http://imgur.com/edswIPX'. You do whatever it'll take to survive. This game requires concentration, patience as well as quick feet. Waiting too much decreases the number of points you'll gain at the end of each level, so be on your toes the whole time you're playing this. The more points you gain, the more weapons you unlock after racking up a certain number of points as well as new masks to discover and use to your advantage. Enemies come in different shapes and sizes from regular ones that carry all different kinds of weapons, to dogs that can't be put out by your bare fists to huge black enemies that need to be taken out by guns- and only guns. A game like this is probably not that story driven, but think again. You play as a character that goes by the name of Jacket 'that was picked by the fans oddly enough' as he keeps getting weird phone calls spewing out riddle-fest sentences that translate out to orders that orders Jacket to go to a designated place and kill off its residents one by one. In addition, Jacket keeps getting weird visions as he's visited by three anonymous figures; one wearing the Rooster mask keeps plaguing Jacket with weird portends and questions, whilst the one wearing the horse 'Don Juan' mask shows sympathy and concern over Jacket. The last one wearing the Owl or 'Rasmus mask keeps scolding Jacket and expresses utter abhorrence towards him. And in later stages in the game, he keeps seeing those that he has killed before in places like a bar or outside of a pizza store with a guy that 'surprisingly' has an omnipresence during the whole game that says to him afterwards that all of what he's been seeing is an illusion.What's rather interesting here that the game gives no explanation to the identity of those 3 who keep visiting jacket, not even giving a subtle hint to who or what they are. It doesn't even explain those illusions he'd seen. It's up to the player himself to interpret the identities of the three masked dudes and the weird illusions and what they're saying or mean to Jacket. The game keeps you on the edge of your seat as the story progresses, and what I really loved about the presentation of this game that, besides Jacket not having any voice nor dialogue and has only his surroundings and actions flesh out his character -SPOILER ALERT- 'For example in chapter 3 when he saved the Hooker instead of killing her even though he has proven to be a psychopathic cold-hearted killer where he could have just killed or at least left her in her state and let her die.' -END OF SPOILER- Or the fact that Jacket has an NES in his living room which probably shows that the guy is a gamer. Of course, this review cannot conclude without the mentioning of the game's soundtrack, which is excellent and immersive and just ♥♥♥♥ing epic beyond measure and deserves the prize for one of THE best soundtrack for a video game- ever. I recommend every damn track in this game for a listen, but my favorite has to be 'It's safe now' by Scattle. It feels like your watching an 80s porno with this track in the background.\n\nI recommend this game on PC, due to the fact that the mouse controls are way merciful that the analog sticks found on consoles (especially for the shooting of course). Regardless that about 99 % of those I know that will try it on PC will pretty much pirate the game, I say this to you; Buy this game. The developers deserve every single penny paid for this game and they've brought out a really, REALLY solid title that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. This game will frustrate the living ♥♥♥♥ out of the player, but is in turn addicting and most important of all: FUN. Nowadays it takes a miracle for a game to be fun under all the pretty, mindbogglingly sophisticated graphics and lightening and pretentious storytelling and characters.","January 10, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With it's fast, reaction based gameplay and interesting story, you'll be wanting to play this game for hours on end.\n\nwith its pixel based graphics, many people wouldn't acknowledge just how pretty this game actually is. They use a full blend of neon colours that really make the game pop, along with satisying character animations. You'll always feel good when you bash in your enemies skulls with a baseball bat or gouge out their eyes with your hands.\n\nThe level design in this game brings variety to the table, with each level having its own neat little challenges that you have to overcome in order to progress through to your objective. Each mission feels fresh and that gives you all the more reason to play more, wondering what you're going to be doing next.\n\nThe game mechanics in this game are simple, but hard to master. Each weapon will one shot most enemies, however, all enemies can one shot you. This makes you think about your decisions before entering each room and makes you feel extremely vulnerable, especially in the later stages. Some situations in the game are kind of unfair however, slinging you into situations where you can't avoid death, due to the extremely fast reaction times you have to have. You have to die in order to figure out what to do, which slows down gameplay. Respawning doesn't take much time however, so the time wastage isn't a huge deal but it's a little problem never the less.\n\nThe music.... oh my god, the music! Created by M|O|O|N, Sun Araw, Perturbator, Elliott Berlin, Jasper Byrne, Scattle, Eirik Suhrke, CoConuts and El Huervo. Each song in the Hotline Miami soundtrack has its own unique feel, adding to the atmosphere in the game. The music always fits to the situation that you'll be in and sets the tone perfectly for the stages. This has got to be my favourite chiptune soundtrack in a video game to date.\n\nThere is plenty of replayability in this game, due to various achievements, secrets and masks that you have to unlock if you want to 100% complete this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you like old school style games that are challenging, yet rewarding.","September 23, 2014","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The downside here is that it might get a little repetitive for some.\n\nMore importantly, it has the hands down best soundtrack I've heard in a video game in the last year or two! I still listen to it multiple times a week, even months after playing the game.\n\nThe music really fits the whole drug-hazed murder spree style really well too!\n\nAlthough it might seem like an arcade-like mindless action game, there actually is a complicated story behind the game too. It's open to interpretation in some ways and it's definitely weird, but it really fits the overall style.\n\n\nThe only downside I can think of is the camera swaying effects - they might give some people motion sickness.\n","January 15, 2014","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Excellent music that could have been straight from Miami Vice, eye candy visuals and crisp gameplay pack for one solid, top-down shooter. An abstract story that left me thinking hours after I finished. Fun challenging gameplay that feels very tactical. You can go down with one shot, making the game all about planning your moves before executing them, and it is difficult, but the completion feels ever so satisfying. Its perfect at what it does leaving the only demand being more. Thankfully it has highscores, a large variety unlockables and achievements to deliver just that. Though there is enough variety in the weapons, there could have been more weapon types aside from just melee and ranged. Perhaps weapons that could be setup, like mines or tripwires. It would mix up the pace of the game a little. Aside from that it is one of my favourite top down shooters ever. 8/10","November 25, 2013","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combo system provides a pleasing extra level of depth to combat.\n\nOne of the most striking parts of the game is the music, which suits the gameplay perfectly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaredthegreat13/recommended/219150/","Jaredthegreat13","Patroclus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaredthegreat13/","140 products in account","Hotline Miami is a top down shooter that is unforgivingly dificult and just as brutally violent. It's pixelated art style takes refrence from old action movies, as well as the neon athmosphere of Miami, Florida circa the late 1980s. One of the main gameplay mechanics is that while enemies will go down with a single swing of a melee weapon, or a single bullet, you don't gain any sort of health bar or armor or anything. One shot, one kill. It's a double edged sword. This thought will be pounding through your mind as you find yourself hiding behind a door, waiting for the perfect opportunity to kill the guard when his back is turned, knowing full well that your knife could easily fail you, and his shotgun pellets could easily make mince meat of you, and you'll have to do the whole floor again.\n\nHowever, the game encourages fast paced, somewhat wreckless decision making, and it is extremely satisfying to go on a killing spree, running from enemy to enemy, leaving carnage in every step of your wake. The music in this game is absolutely delicious. Taking music from artists such as Sun Araw and M.O.O.N. , Hotline Miami sets the mood and atmosphere perfectly. Fast paced, sexy techno music pulses and your mind does, trying to quickly make your next decision to keep your combo going and your character's feet moving without getting a 9 iron to the face.\n\nThe story is somewhat unrewarding, but not as much as some titles. While the ending, which I won't spoil, isn't exactly the most rewarding, it feels a lot more like effort and time was put into the journey rather than the destination itself. There are a series of puzzle pieces scattered across each level, in which you can find more details about the story if you painstakingly collect them all. However, this doesn't change the ending at all. I'll say it again; the journey is much more rewarding than the destination.\n\nAll in all, I would strongly recommend Hotline Miami, and I would recommend that players take some things with a grain of salt; the story isn't meant to be taken completely seriously, and completionism isn't nessesary. Enjoy the game to it's full potential, and don't take the whole thing too seriously. I currently wait in heavy anticipation for the sequel.","November 20, 2014","true","46.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElhalfawiClarke/recommended/219150/","ElhalfawiClarke","Reserved for 3rd Strike.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElhalfawiClarke/","349 products in account","Took me a while to finally remember its existence (due to a number of reasons namely I HAVE SO MANY GAMES ON ME. LITERALLY). But I digress. I wanted to give it a go due to another fact that a lot of people held praises for this game and I wanted to know what the fuss was about. Downloaded the game and started playing it.4 hours have passed like nothing when I first played through this addicting game. The game is challenging, one hit and you're out. Typical old-school style. Unlimited checkpoints though which kinda evens out the challenge. You get all kinds of weapons from simple knives to ♥♥♥♥ing double barrel rifles to even throwing objects like shurikens, darts and even scissors. The gore level is cranked way high in this game, regardless of the fact that its art style is an 8-bit style orgy-fest with neon filled aesthetics that act as a throwback to the 80s as the game takes place in '89 Miami, Florida. You start off bare-handed and you have to choose through a number of animal masks, each can give you a certain power that can enhance your play or even hamper it. Your default mask 'Richard' or the 'Rooster' mask doesn't give you any power and is the first mask you star off with. The objective of the game is simple. You go into a house/mansion/apartment or what have you where you start killing off the enemies one by one to clear the stage, and by doing so you get points as rewards for your killings and of course like any game with great design, the game encourages you- the player to be diverse in your killings and not stick to just one style. You can shoot your way out of a level sure, but don't expect a rank higher than a C or even a C-. The more enemies you kill without a break is called a combo, and as the combo meter racks up so do the points. You can strangle, mutilate, break, mash, bash, cut the living ♥♥♥♥ out of your enemies. No remorse. No mercy. You will die a lot in this game. And by a lot, I mean A WHOLE ♥♥♥♥ING LOT. There's even an achievements called 'Karma' that's got when you die 1000 times. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing developers know how ruthless this game can get. Nevertheless, the game IS addictive and IS fun and keep in mind always that every time you die, you learn. Unless you have a brain capacity of a I.R Baboon 'http://imgur.com/edswIPX'. You do whatever it'll take to survive. This game requires concentration, patience as well as quick feet. Waiting too much decreases the number of points you'll gain at the end of each level, so be on your toes the whole time you're playing this. The more points you gain, the more weapons you unlock after racking up a certain number of points as well as new masks to discover and use to your advantage. Enemies come in different shapes and sizes from regular ones that carry all different kinds of weapons, to dogs that can't be put out by your bare fists to huge black enemies that need to be taken out by guns- and only guns. A game like this is probably not that story driven, but think again. You play as a character that goes by the name of Jacket 'that was picked by the fans oddly enough' as he keeps getting weird phone calls spewing out riddle-fest sentences that translate out to orders that orders Jacket to go to a designated place and kill off its residents one by one. In addition, Jacket keeps getting weird visions as he's visited by three anonymous figures; one wearing the Rooster mask keeps plaguing Jacket with weird portends and questions, whilst the one wearing the horse 'Don Juan' mask shows sympathy and concern over Jacket. The last one wearing the Owl or 'Rasmus mask keeps scolding Jacket and expresses utter abhorrence towards him. And in later stages in the game, he keeps seeing those that he has killed before in places like a bar or outside of a pizza store with a guy that 'surprisingly' has an omnipresence during the whole game that says to him afterwards that all of what he's been seeing is an illusion.What's rather interesting here that the game gives no explanation to the identity of those 3 who keep visiting jacket, not even giving a subtle hint to who or what they are. It doesn't even explain those illusions he'd seen. It's up to the player himself to interpret the identities of the three masked dudes and the weird illusions and what they're saying or mean to Jacket. The game keeps you on the edge of your seat as the story progresses, and what I really loved about the presentation of this game that, besides Jacket not having any voice nor dialogue and has only his surroundings and actions flesh out his character -SPOILER ALERT- 'For example in chapter 3 when he saved the Hooker instead of killing her even though he has proven to be a psychopathic cold-hearted killer where he could have just killed or at least left her in her state and let her die.' -END OF SPOILER- Or the fact that Jacket has an NES in his living room which probably shows that the guy is a gamer. Of course, this review cannot conclude without the mentioning of the game's soundtrack, which is excellent and immersive and just ♥♥♥♥ing epic beyond measure and deserves the prize for one of THE best soundtrack for a video game- ever. I recommend every damn track in this game for a listen, but my favorite has to be 'It's safe now' by Scattle. It feels like your watching an 80s porno with this track in the background.\n\nI recommend this game on PC, due to the fact that the mouse controls are way merciful that the analog sticks found on consoles (especially for the shooting of course). Regardless that about 99 % of those I know that will try it on PC will pretty much pirate the game, I say this to you; Buy this game. The developers deserve every single penny paid for this game and they've brought out a really, REALLY solid title that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. This game will frustrate the living ♥♥♥♥ out of the player, but is in turn addicting and most important of all: FUN. Nowadays it takes a miracle for a game to be fun under all the pretty, mindbogglingly sophisticated graphics and lightening and pretentious storytelling and characters.","January 10, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hotline Miami is the kind of game that knocks me off my high horse about saying that excessive video game violence isn't necessary and says "SOMETIMES IT IS?" loudly but uncertainly so that you're not quite sure what the message is but you decide to smile and nod anyway. Hotline Miami is one of those "guilty pleasure" sort of games; you know it's very bad, but that's what makes it just so good. Well, that's part of it anyway. The rest of what is making this game good is the nicely stylised retro graphics, the very fitting music, the awesome gameplay, and not so much the story - but who's really going to notice the plot holes in amongst all that action? The way this game handles is hard to describe; you need quick reflexes and you need to make sure someone isn't covering the guy you want to kill because you die in one hit, making the game feel frantic like a twin stick shooter, yet tactical like a very bloody game of chess. It's definitely something you need to play to understand, and I'm pretty sure I'll be playing it through again for the secrets, unlocks, and achievements... Just don't sit little Timmy down in front of this one.","August 4, 2013","true","23.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you hear bullets raining down from the heavens in a angelic chorus of White-jacketed Russian Mobsters screaming and gushing blood from their now-rotten maws?\nYes. Yes I do.\nThe game mixes a very beautiful, pixelated atmosphere with the colorful memories of the 80's, and of course, gives a Miami-like environment and no one would shake their head at Miami being referenced with an 80's setting. Just look at Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. If I had to guess on a certain influence or alikeness for this game, it would be that, NO QUESTIONS asked.\nIt gives off artistic points of views through rubber mask personas, and is very story-driven, which is a GREAT thing to me at the very least.\nThe music is, not only absolutely amazing, but holds the feeling of a very tenseful setting and mood for which your character is put into. Listen to it for yourself. It puts you straight into the action and makes you feel what it's like to be in an intense firefight.\nAnother thing is with every hit you give and every step you make with your character, the developers made sure that you FELT like you were actully hitting something, and got a sense of reward for hitting something. Not many games do that. (Some do, however, this game punishes you so much, that it almost feels fun.)\n\nI honestly would LOVE to play Hotline Miami 2 if I could right now.","December 24, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With projectiles and furious mobsters all around you, you're going to want ot get used to dying before you can enjoy this great game.\n\nThe music is intense and electro-punky, giving you an adrenaline rush the whole time you're playing, making every repetitive and gory death all the more GORious.\n\nThe player has the ability to pick a mask of his liking at the beginning of each round, each mask represents an animal, each with it's own abilities such as speed, marksmenship, durability, etc.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great soundtrack\n-Interesting masks and abilities\n-Wide variety of murder tools\n-Vague but intriguing story\n-Nice level Design\n-Simple and easy to use controls\n\n---\n\nCons:\n\n-Bright colours and hectic action onscreen might disorient more sensitive players.","November 1, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of the goriest 2D games I have ever played, Hotline Miami never leaves you with a dull moment. With fast paced action, interesting mechanics, numerous weapons, and a deep underlying story, this is easily one of the best titles out there.\n\nMUSIC: 10/10\nThe music is somewhat strange at times, yet this all adds to the feel of the game. The first time I played the game, a combination of the music and visuals left me with a headache that lasted 2 days. However, once you get used to it, you will be dying to listen to the soundtrack again.\n\nART: 10/10\nWhilst simplistic, the art style doesn't fail to attract your attention, and they have really captured the feel of a retro game. On top of this, they added a chromatic film over the game itself, causing an effect similar to that of LSD.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 9/10\nThe gameplay is fast paced and unforgiving, a very fun feature allowing for perfection. The weapons you can find each time are randomised, allowing for a different experience each time through. Many mechanics are a learning experience, but once you get used to them they don't pose much of a problem. The only actual problem I have with the game is that occasionally the AI does game breaking things, such as leave a room that 99/100 times they wouldn't have done, or not chase you out of a room no matter how many times you try to bait them. Therefore, the gameplay regrettably only gets a 9/10.\n\nOVERALL: 10/10\nDespite the unpredictable AI, this game is the best of its kind, providing a fun, fast paced and unique experience that will enthrall and excite you. I would definitely reccomend this game, and it is a must have for any steam library.","March 14, 2015","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not out of rage at the game, but due to the sheer murderous mind the game implants into your head.\n\nAs you play this game, you will become a murderer. On the first level, the gore may creep you out a bit, but after that you wont pity any more Russian mobsters. This game will have you panicking desperately, making split second descisions and planning out your paths after the 1000th time you die. You'll feel like you're fighting for your life, but at the same time, you'll happily accept the call and go to the designated place and split open a few heads with a crowbar.\n\nAnd what makes this game so intense is the extremely fast pace of it... and the music. If you walk in front on a man with a gun, you have about 0.2 seconds to kill him or you're done. All of this transforms you into a psycho for the time you are in the game. Trust me, if you are impressionable or get all pumped after watching a movie or something, please don't play this game for the safety of the people around you, because it will turn you into a murderer.\n\nBut the one thing, the main thing that is most murderous about you is the creepy as ♥♥♥♥ rubber masks. Put one on and you're a psychotic, homocidal freak.\n\n\nGreat game, if you're over 18, at least over 15, then you must buy it.","July 1, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hotline Miami is the kind of game that knocks me off my high horse about saying that excessive video game violence isn't necessary and says "SOMETIMES IT IS?" loudly but uncertainly so that you're not quite sure what the message is but you decide to smile and nod anyway. Hotline Miami is one of those "guilty pleasure" sort of games; you know it's very bad, but that's what makes it just so good. Well, that's part of it anyway. The rest of what is making this game good is the nicely stylised retro graphics, the very fitting music, the awesome gameplay, and not so much the story - but who's really going to notice the plot holes in amongst all that action? The way this game handles is hard to describe; you need quick reflexes and you need to make sure someone isn't covering the guy you want to kill because you die in one hit, making the game feel frantic like a twin stick shooter, yet tactical like a very bloody game of chess. It's definitely something you need to play to understand, and I'm pretty sure I'll be playing it through again for the secrets, unlocks, and achievements...

After all the high amount of pixeled violence with a spanking soundtrack it takes that away and all you’re left with is a low verberation, almost as if the game is blaming you for all the red pixels on the screen.\n\nIt even keeps up the mind games in the story of who you are, how did this all start and the donnie darko turn I will say is the best. Without spoiling anything that is.\nEverything in the game is nostalgic era of 1989 and it lathered strongly into every space of the game.\n\nEvery moment of this game is pure enjoyment, however there are a few things in here that might not be for every gamer.\nIf you’re highly prone to motion sickness this might set some of that off, if anything try playing it further away from the monitor, this isn’t a game well suited for large television screens.\nThe very nature of this game is snap-twitch gameplay, there are patterns but for the most part if you’re unable to move the mouse quickly and accurately later in the game this might really get your teeth grinding (Middle mouse lock on only goes so far).Extra bonus: The entire soundtrack is in the game install directory!","April 5, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do not let the 8-bit graphics decieve you. Gameplay is INTESNSE and the storyline is unique. The retro style was pulled off flawlessly including video filters to give it that old CRT television scanline effect. Aside from the game the soundtrack is hands down the best in a video game I've ever listened to, but the tracks included are from some of my favorite genres, so opinions by other players may not be as positive. Tracks were created by established artists and has sent me on a journey to discover TONS of new music I wouldn't have discovered otherwise. So between the gameplay and music the ammount of entertainment I've gotten out of a $5 purchase (steam sale) is unprecedented. BE WARNED THIS GAME IS HARD!!!!

Not really any story behind it, just murder. And that is how I would describe it to you if you asked me. So why, then, is a game about smashing peoples faces in and making their intestines fly out in a hundred different ways so popular, or at least so well known? Well it's all because of a great soundtrack, unique style and settings, and gore, oh so much gore... but before all that I must adress its weaker points:\n\nIf you are looking for a good story with a satisfying resolution and no questions left unanswered, look another way. This game's story makes little, scratch that, no sense. So you wake up covered in blood in some house and are taught how to kill people, meet three masked "allies" who seem to just pile one question on top of another for you to hope to find an answer to, you have no idea who you are or why people are calling you at your home for you go out and kill people, and all you know of your identity is that you are wearing a letterman jacket. With background and story like this, I think the game would just be better without one. However there is something intriguing about the people in the masks and all the questions left that just makes sense with this game. Though this will not be as easily overlooked by other gamers as it was by me, and some might even toss the game because of it, I think that it is a       minor flaw, also considering Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number wil answer all of those questions directly.\n\nNext is gameplay. It WILL take some getting used to. however, once you get a hang of it, this games controls actually work quite well with level design and will be easy to get a hng of. They consist of the MOUSE/TRACKBALL (aim), SHIFT (look farther) WASD (move), SPACEBAR (finisher), MOUSEWHEEL (only for lock-on which isn't really necessary), RMBUTTON (pick up weapon/ throw weapon) and LMBUTTON (attack). Simple, yet at times so complex. But like I said, easy to learn and easy to use.\n\nNow on to better things... like combat, and in Hotline Miami, the defenition of combat is that split second decision making that will either make or break your success in the game. But oh Lord, will this game give you such a feeling of success and accomplishment when you rush in that room, puch that guy in the face, take his gun, and commense to blow his brains across the room, only for his friends to follow along and end up in his place, and believe me when I say, you will feel like a stone cold bad-butt after doing so. And melee weapons? ...fantastic. Whoever the crap said "Don't bring a knife to a gun fight" is a total and complete idiot. Need to get into a room with four gunmen inside armed with double barrels and uzis? Well you could distract them one at a time, or just grab that pipe and bash all of their heads in while they attempt to shoot you before they are brutally murdered. And that is basically the combat. Now, that example does not always work considering one shot or hit from anything kills you, but good Gosh does it feel good when it does work. Oh and also, you can bash people's heads in with your fists and kick their heads into walls. So yeah.\n\nNext is settings. Sure there is a general setting that tends to be repeated, but that is just texture's. Each level design is unique, a mansion, a disco, an apartment complex, a hospital... each level is different. But what really sells the "sexy 80's feel" promised by the games developers is the colors and objects in those settings. For example, the disco is a darker level with bright, vivid dance floors and large rooms filled with electronics and computer's controlling those dance floors and discos. The hospital is a realistic enviornment where you must use your surroundings to your advantage to hide from the patrolling officers and doctors preventing you from escaping. A police department with glass walls that you must avoid in order to not be shot, and metal detectors that prevent you from taking weapons with you without setting of an alarm. Like I said, each level is unique, and each one requires a different strategy to be developed.\n\nFinally... soundtrack, the area where this game EXCELLS. No soundtrack EVER has pumped me up so much and made me feel so prepared to just rush in and kill dozens of mobsters. A variety of different types of techno music that will get you so hyped, it's really the whole reason you should buy the game. There is many talented artists, like Pertubetor and M.O.O.N., who used their best and only their best for this game. It is not really explainable in words, so if you want to know what it is like, buy the game and help these talented developers in their future goals for even bigger and better ones in the future (or go look it up on youtube if you don't have the money to spend). In fact, when you buy the game, buy the Soundtrack. It may be another ten dollars, but trust me... just do it.\n\nSo that sums up my review for Hotline Miami. Overall, I will rate this game a 8.75 out of 10 because of a fall in story and it's length (it is not a very long game, I have just played through multiple times). However, it is definitley a game worth buying and replaying, so i reccomend it to all top-down fans or anyone interested in something a little different.\n\n... and also your ride is a DeLorian. It doesn't get much cooler than that.","April 25, 2014","true","47.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I mean, stealth-acton indie game. At first glance, and the very reason why, I, myself, and I'm sure many of you catch an interest  to this game. because, you like hurting people, don't you? (well, at least in a video game). it turns out that Hotline Miami is a game that offers much more than this ultra violent, over the top goriness. Its surprisingly addicting gameplay, awesome soundtrack, intirguing story, and the well executed 80's vibe exceed my initial expectation about this game and leave me in unspeakable awe.\n\nStory (9.2/10)\nHotline Miami is far from a game that offer up an emotional, heartbreaking, bitter, or.  overall 'epic' storyline. Yet, I stil give it a high score. A "9" worthy score would probably a game like Metal Gear Solid, Walking Dead series, BioShock or any other game that has storytelling and narrative akin to those mentioned game. But, I'll give Hotline Miami a 9 because of tis thoughtful, full of theory and interpretation kind of story. Well, if you're not an (over) analytical person like me, you'll find Hotline Miami's story to be shallow, random, and overall weird, both in a satisfying or unsatisfying way. But, for me, Hotline Miami is one of the most clevery written game recently, in the course of the game, and of course at the end, you'll find yourself making your own theory and interpretation of its story, this disturbing and surreal encounter, bizzare incident, etc. You'll try to find the most rational version possible.\n\nGraphic (8.5/10)\nHotline Miami is a top down 2D indie game, pretty usual for an indie game. Buuut.. the 80's vibe, ultra-violent effects, and its overall stylish art is more than  enough to distinguish itself from its peers.\n\nGameplay (9.6/10)\nAddictive and tactically demanding game, covered up by its over the top gory-ness in the outside. A pretty amazing mix isn't it? The guilty-pleasure feeling you'll get from this game is balanced by its surprisingly  clever gameplay, you'll find yourself pushing your brain even much more than you expected you'll be. Great and varied level design, cool and diverse set of masks, and an awesome array of weapons will keep you attached with this game and of course coming back for more. What I mean more, is.. more challenge through the grades/rank after every level and of course the achievements.\n\nSound (10/10)\nOh the sound of the those mafia's head getting splat out, slammed by doors, getting sliced by katana, or shot by a shotgun. The sound effect is just impressive in every way possible, it makes your murdering experience get even better. Oh yeah, the OST is AMAZING, the 80's disco music is just addicting and always get me pumped up.\n\nConclusion/Enjoyment (9.6/10)\nA unique. tactically demanding. and addicting game. It's surprisngly more challenging, thoughtful, and clever than it looks. Hotline Miami doesn't offer a mindless and cheap game focused on its gritty violence alone, it offers much more than its violence, its the overall gameplay, story, music, and execution make Hotsline Miami a stylish and "elegant" piece of guilty-pleasure, adrenaline-rushing, and brain-teasing (both in gameplay and story)  entertainment.","November 19, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a topdown super-violent action game where you control one man stuck in a crazy 16-bit world. On its head the gameplay is simple- you receive missions from a strange caller on your home phone, and head to different locations to kill everyone inside. The missions steadily grow in complexity, though, sometimes necessitating a thoughtful approach to the violence. It's super fast and visceral, with both you and enemies dying in a single hit, and with movement speeds very high, it tests your reflexes and your mettle. You get a large variety of weapons and environmental objects to kill enemies with, as well as being able to execute them with large sprays of pixelated blood. The story is your standard descent-into-madness faire, but that seems popular these days. Also of note is the game's excellent soundtrack!

Do you hear bullets raining down from the heavens in a angelic chorus of White-jacketed Russian Mobsters screaming and gushing blood from their now-rotten maws?\nYes. Yes I do.\nThe game mixes a very beautiful, pixelated atmosphere with the colorful memories of the 80's, and of course, gives a Miami-like environment and no one would shake their head at Miami being referenced with an 80's setting. Just look at Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. If I had to guess on a certain influence or alikeness for this game, it would be that, NO QUESTIONS asked.\nIt gives off artistic points of views through rubber mask personas, and is very story-driven, which is a GREAT thing to me at the very least.\nThe music is, not only absolutely amazing, but holds the feeling of a very tenseful setting and mood for which your character is put into. Listen to it for yourself. It puts you straight into the action and makes you feel what it's like to be in an intense firefight.\nAnother thing is with every hit you give and every step you make with your character, the developers made sure that you FELT like you were actully hitting something, and got a sense of reward for hitting something. Not many games do that. (Some do, however, this game punishes you so much, that it almost feels fun.)\n\nI honestly would LOVE to play Hotline Miami 2 if I could right now.","December 24, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Kidding, positive review here just needed a bad joke for a future fact of the game.\n\nWelcome to the 1980's Mr/Ms [Redacted]! This "game" that you're considering buying is without a doubt the best example of our history 27 years ago, what with Russian Mobsters owning bunches of apartment buildings and the 50 Blessings Briefcase being a thing, we left a pre-recoded message for you on this message recorder in hopes that you could "Come to work" and "Show the new guys around", thanks!\n\nWell if you don't like that big ♥♥♥ joke you don't belong in Hotline Miami, this game puts you in the shoes of "Jacket" the mysterious man who likes to wear a mask of a co.. Chicken, and believe it or not he goes to his Recorder every day and his bosses call him up with more work, what work you may ask? Well it varies from killing people with Briefcases, to kicking doors open and knocking a russian down only to curbstomping his head open while wearing a horse mask, the combat is simple and easy to learn : If you get stabbed/beaten/bludgeoned/shot/burned then you die and restart from the last checkpoint, anything you Stab/Chop/Beat down/shoot/burn/etc dies as quickly as you do, making it an intense action game to kill these mobsters and serve the mysterious bosses, only problems you may have with the game : Points unlock system for droppable items, Masks and other goodies. The story is downright confusing and darker than Donnie Darko, and finally...

Hotline Miami is a 2D top-down action game that has a lot of the good old ultraviolence, you just need to polish your R button because you are gonna' use it a lot.\nThe only way to get through a level is to come up with a plan in advance, arm the protagonist, and kill everyone before he exposes himself fatally, a plan flexible enough to deal with the variables of enemy movement and hearing. The main character generally starts with only his fists and a mask.

But the only way you can find out is if you play this game.\n\nSo in this top down shooter you step into the blood spattered boots of two “hero’s” as they carve a bloody streak through Miami’s underworld. Now to say that this game is gory is an understatement, but due to its amazing retro art style the copious amounts of blood, guts and death seem little more than a fever dream, as does this game as a whole. The aesthetic is one that I found very like a comic book, I know it’s done in 16 bit but it’s so stylised, bright and vibrant that I was enthralled immediately.\n\nThe way the story draws you in is the same way a mad man scrawls his name in blood on the walls of his padded cell, that is to say both are fruit loops crazy but in my analogy at least the crazy guy is using his own blood and not hundreds of other peoples whom have the audacity to want to keep it all inside themselves and not share.\n\nNow back to the story, you start off knowing nothing, you go on knowing a little more of nothing, until the game ends and you know a tiny bit more than if you hadn’t bothered starting. There’s a shadowy organisation using you to further their bloody campaign on crime but that’s about it. This is not to say the game isn’t compelling I found myself face stomping my way through goons at a rate Usain Bolt would be proud of just to see what would happen next and the endings, yes plural, two “hero’s” two endings do wrap the everything up quite well.\n\nNow the game itself is for a lack of a better word, bloody fantastic. You can approach each stage in a huge number of different ways using a very large arsenal masks, one of your characters loves those and each one gives you different weapons or abilities. And whilst you may be content to just kill everything in sight and march all the way to the finale this game is actually a pretty well done score attack adventure and you would have missed most of the pleasure… and misery.\n\nTo get the best scores you have to complete every stage faster than lightning with as many different executions and combo kills under your belt as you can manage. This is where the challenge lies, the game itself is hard but to do it perfectly is insanely difficult but so rewarding that it’s crazy and you would be nuts to try. But since we are all psycho’s who love masochism have at it.\n\nThe sound track is great, but as is the standard for all games sent in the 80’s, I think it’s a law or something. The gameplay is phenomenal, you will fail a lot but every single time it is your fault, the game is punishing but not a cheater. I cannot recommend this enough for people who love a challenge. I had hours of fun and frustration in equal measure.\n\nHave fun ^_^\n","January 29","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When games were just about violence?  Postal, Doom, etc.  Where it was just to murder everything in your path regardless of who it was or what it has done etc.  Well those days are gone! Now we have a game that is nothing but that! Quite litterally.\n\nPROS:\n\nFun Gameplay: This game is nothing but murdering everything from the dandelions on upwards in any household that some random dude on the phone tells you to do regardless of if you want to but I guess that's because it's half the fun.  Running into some random person's building and just bashing everyones skulls in or shooting them up with a gun till all of their guts spill out or their head gets blown off.\n\nMasks: Each mask has a different ability, which I thought was a neat little mechanic for the game since each level can be played a little differently each time with it's own abilities.  Like Dennis starts with a free knife, Peter has silent bullets but somehow some people aren't fully def or something, Ted means dogs won't even care that you're there or murdering their owners, etc.\n\nStory: As far as the story goes it's neat I suppose, where random things happen like you get put into some room talking to 3 people wearing a horse, rooster, and owl mask which I'm STILL convinced this is basically your subconcious or something.  And later when it's hard to tell what's real and what's fake since everything seems the same with the 80's vibe around the game with the colors and areas you go to.\n\nSoundtrack: This is one of the few things that got me into this game was the really catchy soundtrack, one of my friends showed the "Knock" song to me and I instantly got hooked onto the rest of the soundtrack.  Granted some I don't really like but the large majority of them I do.  I keep hearing the 2nd game has a hit and miss soundtrack which I kind of agree on since some of the songs are great where others just sound weird and boring, or way too pumped instead of being the mellow music this game has.\n\nRight back in the action: Instead of going through a REALLY long loading time when you die it's a instant reload into the area with no waiting, making sure you get right back into the action without you having to get too bored and lose the tension too quickly if at all.\n\nSatisfying after levels: I was trying to be strategic in most of the levels, like when to charge in, when to shoot, throw weapons etc.  But one level got on my nerves so badly I litterally just charged into a room with a pipe with 4 dudes inside, massacred all of them, and when they pulled off a shot the rest came and I just charged out beating the living s*%t out of the rest while they all lined up, it's like I was on ice skates.  Then afterwards I felt so rewarded and then thought "What the f%*k is wrong with me?!"\n\nCONS:\n\nAiming in general: I might be a bit biased with this.  You see, when I was growing up and playing top down shooters like this, I was used to the character moving AROUND the pointer on the screen, not the character moving WITH said pointer.  And in all honesty this ends up getting me killed quite a lot in this game which can get pretty frustrating.\n\nThrowing weapons: Don't get me wrong I like this idea, but the aiming with it is so freakin atrocious and finicky.  I threw a pipe at a dude when I was about 20 feet from him (Imagine Jacket is 6 feet tall for a reference) and half of the pipe went through him and it said I missed the throw.  Missed the throw? You've gotta be s*%#$ing me half of that pipe was lodged into his cranium and I MISSED?!  It starts to get annoying too since when Jacket throws the object it's not spot on accurate which just adds to the fire, kind of wish this would've been worked out a little more or something.\n\nWeapons: Weapons unlocks are a kind of Miss for me as far as the weapon system goes, yeah some things like the sledgehammer and machete are awesome to use but things like the Magnum or Skorpion seem pointless when I end up getting M4's with 24 rounds that can clear out most of a building.  Plus most melee weapons are identical to the last since you don't really seem to care what it is you're using as long as it kills, I wish they would've redone this system too, or at least added different weapons.\n\nMasks: Some of the masks feel utterly useless, I never used Rufus or Wilhelm or anything because if you get shot you can only survive like 1 M4 shot or pistol shot and since it's usually ending up being rapid fire and having pinpoint accuracy with every guard you may as well just put paper over you.  I wish they would've redid some of the masks so they seem a lot more useful.  I only ended up using Peter, Ted, and Don Juan since they were the most useful throughout the whole bloody game.\n\nStory: I was really interested in the story at first, but after around 3/4's of the way through it went right down the drain.  I won't really spoil much but I do have to say, going from the Insane and questioning life you get in the beginning, trying to figure out what's real or fake, and then going to that? It just kind of killed it for me, and the ending was a bit dissapointing but I found the normal one, so I'm going through to get the good one still, so that might be better.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe game is fun, a bit ludicrous, but fun none the less and even after playing all of the levels I still really enjoyed going through the missions again so it does have some replayability.  In the end I'll give it a 8/10, it's really fun but some of the things I hate about it do get in the way at times but other than that I don't regret my purchase, and I hope you guys buy it as well.  Not the 2nd one though I honestly heard it was dog s*%t compared to this one, so save your money for this instead.","June 21, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Whatever I mean by that, Hotline Miami captures it in every way. With the sickly bright visuals, the unflinching and brutal violence, the hypnotizing soundtrack, and the surreal plot, it sets itself apart as one of the most distinct experiences in indie gaming. It's comparable to drugs, getting under your skin and becoming a game you play by feel more than sight. You'll get into a flow and completely lose yourself in the violence, only for the last enemy to die. Then the music cuts abruptly, a dull buzzing plays, and you slowly walk back to your car through the trail of maimed bodies.\n\nEverything moves so fast, you don't even have time to think, you just have to react instinctively. The feel of the action very much compliments what's going on in the protagonist's head. No time to stop and think, only to act, and react, as fast as possible, no matter the consequences. The best games don't just have you play as a character, they make you feel like you *are* the character, and the gradually deteriorating mental state of a brutal killer wouldn't look like anything else than what you see in this game. The violence, intensity, and difficulty aren't going to be for everyone, but this is among my most loved of indie titles on the market.","September 18, 2015","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The art style, coupled with the amazing soundtrack, completely captures the 1980's setting and mood. The graphics are beautiful and the game runs as smooth as butter (and I can't believe it's NOT butter! It's Hotline Miami). The gameplay fully envelops your attention and is extremely difficult. The levels are designed perfectly and allow you to plan your next moves strategically. And even though most of the game's levels will take you at least ten tries minimum, you probably won't even be mad simply because of the game's perfect execution of a fast-paced hardcore bloody top-down shooter.

HOTLINE MIAMI is certainly not a game for those who cannot handle pressure! The game will work you to your limits, forcing you to either master abilities in timing, memorization, combat, or all three! However, as frustrating as the game gets, every success feels very much like a success that YOU provided. There is no feeling of rubberbanding, or that the game is going "easy" on you. You will be tested, but you will succeed. And when you do, there will no greater feeling that the bliss of success and raging bloodlust. Among other things, the concept is fresh, the music is great, and the storyline will always keep you guessing.\n\nThis is a game that is very important to me, and I would highly recommend it! This is why you'll need to pick it up from 1337 Steam Avenue.

First and foremost, the menu music almost made me shut off the game as soon as it started. Most of the early game just has painful "music" at the start but it gets much better in the firefights. Second is that god forsaken "stealth" level where you have to purely trial and error against hospital staff that would make the Metal Gear Solid guards out of a job and if THAT wasn't annoying enough, your character is a bumbling drunkard in it. It just feels sloppy and not befitting of the game. Finally, I dislike the "side storyline" where you play as the biker guy. Yeah, it's a cute gimmick but it seems they went out of their way to make them easy just to play a guy with throwing knives. All this and I wish it were longer (but I got it for a buck. Not complaining about that in the slightest).\n\nNow, onto why I enjoyed the game: it's a very fast paced shooter, It's very fair in its difficulty where there were few times I could blame the game for my deaths (there is the occurance where an enemy shoots you from off screen since windows seem to magnify their vision but I digress). It's a little trial and error based but you really want to rack up the combo count and do it in as stylish of a manner as possible and the game rewards you for doing just that. Like someone mentioned in the comments before me, this game is a very good game if you just wanna kill people... a lot of people for that matter.\n\nTo sum this review up, if you can get this game for cheap, as I did, jump at the chance to get it. I just bought it because it has exclusive DLC for Payday 2 but I thoroughly enjoyed the game by itself.","December 31, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a blast from start to finish, and I'd say it's safe to assume it left some...\n\nLASTING IMPRESSIONS\nHotline Miami\n\nGENRE\nTop Down Shooter-Slasher/Action\n\nSTORY\nIn Hotline Miami you play as the fan-named delusional psychopath Jacket. His name is Jacket due to his distinctive letterman jacket that he wears. [Glasses, jacket, shirt, call me glasses-jacket-shirt man.] When the game begins, you find yourself in a dark, dirty room with a door directly in front of you. As you step through the door, you're greeted by three figures wearing different animal masks. The woman in the horse mask seems concerned for your mental health; saying it might be better if you didn't remember your actions or identity. The man in the owl mask, dressed like a Russian mobster,  begins to yell at you; disgusted at your behavior and presence.  However, the man in the rooster mask, dressed in the same clothes you are, says he knows you. He asks if the date 'April 3rd, 1989' means anything to you. You then wake up in your rundown apartment room to the sound of a phone ringing...\n\nGAMEPLAY\nHotline Miami is a game about pulse-pounding, high adrenaline combat. When you play you have to be on gaurd, on point, and on your toes; lest ye suffer a swift death. Everyone in this game dies in one hit; that includes you. Levels are set up by floors, with the next floor becoming accessible when you're the only person remaining with your brains firmly inside your cranium. You'll start out with your fists as weapons, but your fist can only knock enemies down onto the floor or up against walls. If you hit an enemy they'll drop their weapon; which you can promptly pick up and use to re-arrange their facial structure. Weapons range from close range objects such as bats, pipes, or knives; to long range weapons such as guns, throwing stars, or maybe even a plain old brick. [Brick too OP please nerf.] Hotline Miami is also a game about getting a good highscore; like back in the arcade ages. Each kill, maneuver, door-knockdown, execution, and combo will net you some points. It's a good idea to try and rack up a good combo and vary up your playstyle, as highscores unlock masks and points from the aforementioned scores will unlock new weapons. Masks by the way, are a central mechanic in the game; as they supply you with your...\n\nABILITIES\nThe game is centralized around an array of animal masks; each with different names so you don't have to feel guilty for killing over a dozen people in under 30 seconds. [Yeah, it wasn't you, it was Tony. Tony the tiger.] Each mask provides a different ability that will dictate your playstyle. If you wear the Aubrey mask, for example, more guns will appear scattered around the area; whilst if you wear the Charlie mask the opposite will happen. The mask's usefulness varies quite largely; with most being practically useless and some being OP beyond belief. [All hail Tony, god of tigers and punching people into mush.] Some are also just jokes; like Phil the fish. A personal favorite of mine would have to be Brandon the panther; who might as well be Sonic the hedgehog for how fast he runs. However, if you want to get an A+ on every level, use Carl; he starts with a drill that basically doubles the points you get for ground execution. Whatever way you prefer to play, there's probably a mask for it.\n\nVISUALS\nI love me some arcade aesthetics. Hotline borrows greatly from games of old with lovingly crafted pixelated graphics that are drawn [?] pretty damn well. The bloodbath that ensues as you step into a room is gruesomely depicted as pixelated grey matter and blood are strewn about the room. Characters look very interesting, a quirk I like, as it makes all the nameless personalities you encounter easily recognizable; you'll never find yourself thinking 'is that this character or this one?' while playing. I'm a fan of the art style to say the least, and I'd like to note that this game could easily run on a toaster.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nAmazing. A. M. A. Z. I. N. G. The soundtrack is full of many psychedelic, intense, and sometimes unnerving tracks. There couldn't be a better beat to accompany the trippy beat down that is this game. As you're constantly dying over and over again, the soundtrack is always there to give that sensation that makes you say 'I can do this!’ However, it's not all Fun & Games. As the red mist fades and you trek your way back through the bloodshed, there's a static, droning tone playing that makes it known that you've done a gruesome; terrible thing. [You psycho.]\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nHotline Miami is probably one of my favorite games that's come out in recent years. It's been a while since I've experienced a game that just lets you go wild and give in to brute instinct. If I had to compare it to another game; I'd say it reminds me a bit of Dark Souls in a few ways. The gameplay is gruesome and unforgiving, though there are a few odd quirks here and there. [Enemies are blind as bats if I'm being honest.] The story is very cryptic, and doesn't provide much in the way of answers. However, a simplistic story seems to fit this type of game very well; as sometimes there just isn't a method to madness. The masks are very nice, but as I've said; half of them are useless. The ones that do change gameplay are greatly appreciated though; and can entirely change how you play. I'd rate the soundtrack alone to be honest; it's that damn good. [I'd give it a 'pudgy Italian chef kissing his fingers and muttering soemthing in Italian after he makes a dish'/10.] All in all, It's safe to say that Hotline Miami has indeed left a lasting impression; depth begins with simplistic design.\n\nSimply put,'Should I buy this game?' has the same answer as 'Do you like hurting other people?'. So yes, you should buy this game,","April 3, 2015","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/recommended/219150/","LeSharkeh","Schlechte ᖘlumm 🐝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/","375 products in account","Remember these days people? When games were just about violence?  Postal, Doom, etc.  Where it was just to murder everything in your path regardless of who it was or what it has done etc.  Well those days are gone! Now we have a game that is nothing but that! Quite litterally.\n\nPROS:\n\nFun Gameplay: This game is nothing but murdering everything from the dandelions on upwards in any household that some random dude on the phone tells you to do regardless of if you want to but I guess that's because it's half the fun.  Running into some random person's building and just bashing everyones skulls in or shooting them up with a gun till all of their guts spill out or their head gets blown off.\n\nMasks: Each mask has a different ability, which I thought was a neat little mechanic for the game since each level can be played a little differently each time with it's own abilities.  Like Dennis starts with a free knife, Peter has silent bullets but somehow some people aren't fully def or something, Ted means dogs won't even care that you're there or murdering their owners, etc.\n\nStory: As far as the story goes it's neat I suppose, where random things happen like you get put into some room talking to 3 people wearing a horse, rooster, and owl mask which I'm STILL convinced this is basically your subconcious or something.  And later when it's hard to tell what's real and what's fake since everything seems the same with the 80's vibe around the game with the colors and areas you go to.\n\nSoundtrack: This is one of the few things that got me into this game was the really catchy soundtrack, one of my friends showed the "Knock" song to me and I instantly got hooked onto the rest of the soundtrack.  Granted some I don't really like but the large majority of them I do.  I keep hearing the 2nd game has a hit and miss soundtrack which I kind of agree on since some of the songs are great where others just sound weird and boring, or way too pumped instead of being the mellow music this game has.\n\nRight back in the action: Instead of going through a REALLY long loading time when you die it's a instant reload into the area with no waiting, making sure you get right back into the action without you having to get too bored and lose the tension too quickly if at all.\n\nSatisfying after levels: I was trying to be strategic in most of the levels, like when to charge in, when to shoot, throw weapons etc.  But one level got on my nerves so badly I litterally just charged into a room with a pipe with 4 dudes inside, massacred all of them, and when they pulled off a shot the rest came and I just charged out beating the living s*%t out of the rest while they all lined up, it's like I was on ice skates.  Then afterwards I felt so rewarded and then thought "What the f%*k is wrong with me?!"\n\nCONS:\n\nAiming in general: I might be a bit biased with this.  You see, when I was growing up and playing top down shooters like this, I was used to the character moving AROUND the pointer on the screen, not the character moving WITH said pointer.  And in all honesty this ends up getting me killed quite a lot in this game which can get pretty frustrating.\n\nThrowing weapons: Don't get me wrong I like this idea, but the aiming with it is so freakin atrocious and finicky.  I threw a pipe at a dude when I was about 20 feet from him (Imagine Jacket is 6 feet tall for a reference) and half of the pipe went through him and it said I missed the throw.  Missed the throw? You've gotta be s*%#$ing me half of that pipe was lodged into his cranium and I MISSED?!  It starts to get annoying too since when Jacket throws the object it's not spot on accurate which just adds to the fire, kind of wish this would've been worked out a little more or something.\n\nWeapons: Weapons unlocks are a kind of Miss for me as far as the weapon system goes, yeah some things like the sledgehammer and machete are awesome to use but things like the Magnum or Skorpion seem pointless when I end up getting M4's with 24 rounds that can clear out most of a building.  Plus most melee weapons are identical to the last since you don't really seem to care what it is you're using as long as it kills, I wish they would've redone this system too, or at least added different weapons.\n\nMasks: Some of the masks feel utterly useless, I never used Rufus or Wilhelm or anything because if you get shot you can only survive like 1 M4 shot or pistol shot and since it's usually ending up being rapid fire and having pinpoint accuracy with every guard you may as well just put paper over you.  I wish they would've redid some of the masks so they seem a lot more useful.  I only ended up using Peter, Ted, and Don Juan since they were the most useful throughout the whole bloody game.\n\nStory: I was really interested in the story at first, but after around 3/4's of the way through it went right down the drain.  I won't really spoil much but I do have to say, going from the Insane and questioning life you get in the beginning, trying to figure out what's real or fake, and then going to that? It just kind of killed it for me, and the ending was a bit dissapointing but I found the normal one, so I'm going through to get the good one still, so that might be better.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe game is fun, a bit ludicrous, but fun none the less and even after playing all of the levels I still really enjoyed going through the missions again so it does have some replayability.  In the end I'll give it a 8/10, it's really fun but some of the things I hate about it do get in the way at times but other than that I don't regret my purchase, and I hope you guys buy it as well.  Not the 2nd one though I honestly heard it was dog s*%t compared to this one, so save your money for this instead.","June 21, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hotline Miami from a first glance, looks like every other wanna be 8-bit, retro, indie trash, that overemphasizes on the use of cheap bloody pixels. But once you get into it, it becomes so SO much more than that. The first thing that really latches you in, is the music. Any audiophile or upcoming musician, will be able to identify with the pure precision and absolute quality of this games outstanding, unique and well produced selection of techno-jazz style beats. Beats that hit hard and flow so well with the gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, this game is harshly difficult. You will die, die again, die horribly, rage, die again, die in the most pathetic way, kill another NPC then die........and so on. But death in this game is a button away. The second you die "Press R to restart" appears and you are right back at your last (forgiving) checkpoint. It is enough to keep you trying time and time again, and subtle enough to make dying part of the gameplay in a sense. Now to the gory bits. Remember that ole "bloody pixels" thing? Well Hotline Miami is violent. Like uber violent. Like so violent, it makes you either sickly ill or sickly mad with bloodlust. Whether its slicing pixel dudes in half or popping out eyeballs; you will be surprised everytime a limb gets severed or brains get splattered(yours included). But yet again, the violence seems to mold its way into the rhythm of the soundtrack and the feedback of the gameplay. Next I guess, would be the story. Wow. Yeah. Believe it or not, this little pixelated bloodbath has one of the most complex video game storylines to date. So much so, that even the character's names are clouded in mystery. The storyline of colorful animal masks and bloody jumper jackets has spurred fan fiction and even growingly popular cosplay. Hotline Miami is an absolute treat to any fan of the 80s, hitman themed plots and retro classics. It is a punishing and rewarding experience that will have you trying to rack up high scores and paint the screen as red as possible, even after you have been wasted 1000x. The seemless flow that holds it all together makes it worthy of being a AAA title. Every time you hear a skull crack open from a baseball bat while wearing a Unicorn mask and slowly watching the blood cover the screen. Just try not to smile like you enjoyed it, at least not until you turn the corner and do it over........and over again.\n\nOverall 5/5\nGameplay 5/5\nControls 4/5\nGraphics 2/5\nStoryline 6/5\nMusic 6/5\n\nBottom line: For $9.99 you are getting a complete title. Its unique, addicting and will satisfy every aspect of what you are looking for. The game is worth twice that, if you take into consideration the excellent soundtrack. You can even find this game on sale for less than $2.50 which is incredibly foolish to pass up. Buy it. You will never look at indie games the same.","March 2, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First and foremost, the menu music almost made me shut off the game as soon as it started. Most of the early game just has painful "music" at the start but it gets much better in the firefights. Second is that god forsaken "stealth" level where you have to purely trial and error against hospital staff that would make the Metal Gear Solid guards out of a job and if THAT wasn't annoying enough, your character is a bumbling drunkard in it. It just feels sloppy and not befitting of the game. Finally, I dislike the "side storyline" where you play as the biker guy. Yeah, it's a cute gimmick but it seems they went out of their way to make them easy just to play a guy with throwing knives. All this and I wish it were longer (but I got it for a buck. Not complaining about that in the slightest).\n\nNow, onto why I enjoyed the game: it's a very fast paced shooter, It's very fair in its difficulty where there were few times I could blame the game for my deaths (there is the occurance where an enemy shoots you from off screen since windows seem to magnify their vision but I digress). It's a little trial and error based but you really want to rack up the combo count and do it in as stylish of a manner as possible and the game rewards you for doing just that. Like someone mentioned in the comments before me, this game is a very good game if you just wanna kill people... a lot of people for that matter.\n\nTo sum this review up, if you can get this game for cheap, as I did, jump at the chance to get it. I just bought it because it has exclusive DLC for Payday 2 but I thoroughly enjoyed the game by itself.","December 31, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Not out of rage at the game, but due to the sheer murderous mind the game implants into your head.\n\nAs you play this game, you will become a murderer. On the first level, the gore may creep you out a bit, but after that you wont pity any more Russian mobsters. This game will have you panicking desperately, making split second descisions and planning out your paths after the 1000th time you die. You'll feel like you're fighting for your life, but at the same time, you'll happily accept the call and go to the designated place and split open a few heads with a crowbar.\n\nAnd what makes this game so intense is the extremely fast pace of it... and the music. If you walk in front on a man with a gun, you have about 0.2 seconds to kill him or you're done. All of this transforms you into a psycho for the time you are in the game. Trust me, if you are impressionable or get all pumped after watching a movie or something, please don't play this game for the safety of the people around you, because it will turn you into a murderer.\n\nBut the one thing, the main thing that is most murderous about you is the creepy as ♥♥♥♥ rubber masks. Put one on and you're a psychotic, homocidal freak.\n\n\nGreat game, if you're over 18, at least over 15, then you must buy it.","July 1, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a blast from start to finish, and I'd say it's safe to assume it left some...\n\nLASTING IMPRESSIONS\nHotline Miami\n\nGENRE\nTop Down Shooter-Slasher/Action\n\nSTORY\nIn Hotline Miami you play as the fan-named delusional psychopath Jacket. His name is Jacket due to his distinctive letterman jacket that he wears. [Glasses, jacket, shirt, call me glasses-jacket-shirt man.] When the game begins, you find yourself in a dark, dirty room with a door directly in front of you. As you step through the door, you're greeted by three figures wearing different animal masks. The woman in the horse mask seems concerned for your mental health; saying it might be better if you didn't remember your actions or identity. The man in the owl mask, dressed like a Russian mobster,  begins to yell at you; disgusted at your behavior and presence.  However, the man in the rooster mask, dressed in the same clothes you are, says he knows you. He asks if the date 'April 3rd, 1989' means anything to you. You then wake up in your rundown apartment room to the sound of a phone ringing...\n\nGAMEPLAY\nHotline Miami is a game about pulse-pounding, high adrenaline combat. When you play you have to be on gaurd, on point, and on your toes; lest ye suffer a swift death. Everyone in this game dies in one hit; that includes you. Levels are set up by floors, with the next floor becoming accessible when you're the only person remaining with your brains firmly inside your cranium. You'll start out with your fists as weapons, but your fist can only knock enemies down onto the floor or up against walls. If you hit an enemy they'll drop their weapon; which you can promptly pick up and use to re-arrange their facial structure. Weapons range from close range objects such as bats, pipes, or knives; to long range weapons such as guns, throwing stars, or maybe even a plain old brick. [Brick too OP please nerf.] Hotline Miami is also a game about getting a good highscore; like back in the arcade ages. Each kill, maneuver, door-knockdown, execution, and combo will net you some points. It's a good idea to try and rack up a good combo and vary up your playstyle, as highscores unlock masks and points from the aforementioned scores will unlock new weapons. Masks by the way, are a central mechanic in the game; as they supply you with your...\n\nABILITIES\nThe game is centralized around an array of animal masks; each with different names so you don't have to feel guilty for killing over a dozen people in under 30 seconds. [Yeah, it wasn't you, it was Tony. Tony the tiger.] Each mask provides a different ability that will dictate your playstyle. If you wear the Aubrey mask, for example, more guns will appear scattered around the area; whilst if you wear the Charlie mask the opposite will happen. The mask's usefulness varies quite largely; with most being practically useless and some being OP beyond belief. [All hail Tony, god of tigers and punching people into mush.] Some are also just jokes; like Phil the fish. A personal favorite of mine would have to be Brandon the panther; who might as well be Sonic the hedgehog for how fast he runs. However, if you want to get an A+ on every level, use Carl; he starts with a drill that basically doubles the points you get for ground execution. Whatever way you prefer to play, there's probably a mask for it.\n\nVISUALS\nI love me some arcade aesthetics. Hotline borrows greatly from games of old with lovingly crafted pixelated graphics that are drawn [?] pretty damn well. The bloodbath that ensues as you step into a room is gruesomely depicted as pixelated grey matter and blood are strewn about the room. Characters look very interesting, a quirk I like, as it makes all the nameless personalities you encounter easily recognizable; you'll never find yourself thinking 'is that this character or this one?' while playing. I'm a fan of the art style to say the least, and I'd like to note that this game could easily run on a toaster.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nAmazing. A. M. A. Z. I. N. G. The soundtrack is full of many psychedelic, intense, and sometimes unnerving tracks. There couldn't be a better beat to accompany the trippy beat down that is this game. As you're constantly dying over and over again, the soundtrack is always there to give that sensation that makes you say 'I can do this!’ However, it's not all Fun & Games. As the red mist fades and you trek your way back through the bloodshed, there's a static, droning tone playing that makes it known that you've done a gruesome; terrible thing. [You psycho.]\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nHotline Miami is probably one of my favorite games that's come out in recent years. It's been a while since I've experienced a game that just lets you go wild and give in to brute instinct. If I had to compare it to another game; I'd say it reminds me a bit of Dark Souls in a few ways. The gameplay is gruesome and unforgiving, though there are a few odd quirks here and there. [Enemies are blind as bats if I'm being honest.] The story is very cryptic, and doesn't provide much in the way of answers. However, a simplistic story seems to fit this type of game very well; as sometimes there just isn't a method to madness. The masks are very nice, but as I've said; half of them are useless. The ones that do change gameplay are greatly appreciated though; and can entirely change how you play. I'd rate the soundtrack alone to be honest; it's that damn good. [I'd give it a 'pudgy Italian chef kissing his fingers and muttering soemthing in Italian after he makes a dish'/10.] All in all, It's safe to say that Hotline Miami has indeed left a lasting impression; depth begins with simplistic design.\n\nSimply put,'Should I buy this game?' has the same answer as 'Do you like hurting other people?'. So yes, you should buy this game,","April 3, 2015","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
