It's similar in its execution to limbo gives more focus on logic and physics puzzles. Couple of pros anc cons:\n\nPros:\n\n- Imaginative use of physics to solve puzzles\n- Chase scenes where you are trying to escape the foreman are quite well executed and built tension\n- If you die or get caught you will restart fairly close by so its not frustrating\n- Dull grey scenery is very well accented by reds and along with background music sets the mood\n\nCons:\n\n- Controls can feel at times sluggish, this is mostly evident when you are trying to time a jump but you get used to it and overall not a big problem\n- The game does not try and hold your hand, you have to figure out how you can use the environment to your advantage. Not necessarily a con, just could have been handled/introduced a bit better.\n- Bugs! I've encountered a few and save for the last one on the very last level they are not blockers on making progress. That said on the last level I had to die and restart because the game simply did not position things right\n\nOverall, great game with some flaws. Still recommend a playthrough for people into platformers. 7/10","November 14, 2014","true","3.4"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

It took me around 4 hours to finish, although those of you who are platformer stars could finish this in 2 hours most likely.\n\nIt is a beautiful game in the spirit of games like Limbo. Mostly black and white and grey, but with red highlighting special things and used to accent the striking world portrayed. Simply put, this game is stunning.\n\nThe game is also fairly deep into the topics of slavery and forced labor, by way of an alien invasion kidnapping all the children. You and your brother try to evade capture in this crazy adventure. There is a bit of surrealism or what have you here as well. You leave home to play, and really never see your home again. The ending is one of hope and sacrifice.\n\nThe controls for the gamepad handle quite nicely. I had no issues with clipping or any of the other issues that can plague games. In fact, as far as I could tell, it was perfectly optimized and free of bugs.\n\nIt has a nice save system that auto saves at each juncture or before any challenging or significant event and also saves after getting past the same. That means that when you die (and you will likely die a lot), you never have to go too far back, and so even with the more challenging sections, it never feels like a chore.\n\nSpeaking of challenges, this game was quite challenging IMO. Not that everything was, but I found that some of the puzzles could stretch the mind trying to find the solution. Still, with a 4 hour playtime, obviously nothing was insurmountable. In fact, I would say it was just right for the type of game that it is.\n\nAll in all, this one is an easy recommendation.\n8 children escaping the clutches of their alien overlords out of 10 possible.","January 2","true","8.6"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","7"

Without any story told, you will pickup your little brother and help him go through all the obstacles you are facing and escape from bad people.\n\nPro:\n-Graphics: The graphics are REALLY good. I love the black'n white with hint of red style. Feels reqlly unique (despite this is not the first platformer who offer this, check out Limbo an excellent platformer).\n-Sound: The music is really good, feels like 1950's musics, with a bit a jazz, it is a good experience for your ears.\n-Puzzles: Puzzles feels rewarding when solved, almost all of them are well designed, there some that could use a visual hint or two (like the double lift, I was looking at the wrong solution for quite a long time, had to look up for the solution as I couldn't see it but just the one I was trying which at some point seemed possible). I tink sometimes visual hints to go backward could have been good.\n-Story: Despite being without any background, this is a success I think. You understand things one bit at a time, the background is the narrator. The story told here is not very big, it rely mostly on helping your brother. You get attached to that task.\n\n\nCons:\n-Controls: Controls are sluggish at time. It is not that important except when you need to do timed jump, and at that time the game gets frustrating. The tutorial was not clear enough about the jumping system, as I was succeeding all my jump, I didn't give any thought at first, and then you are in a chase scene and you need to do thing fast and it is not well responding, then you start yelling at your jump. Specially on the achievement Conscience to save a robot from crushing under a press. Looked up a playthrough online, and the layout of the button was different from mine (perhaps a different build than the final one), You have to do some timed jumps and be very reactive, I was trying really hard for at least 15min, then doing more or less the same thing as before, the jump activated as wished and I was able to complete it.\nI should'nt stop you from completing the game but a bit of polishing on the control would have been good.\n-Bugs: I found some bugs, mostly collision, when that happens you are a bit in a bind as you have to restart the whole checkpoint, despite them being well spread it's still a bummer.\n\nTo conlude:\nI finished the game in about 4h (a bit more with the achievement of the robot), found 9 out of 16 secrets (I will probably look up for info in order to get them all).\nWill you, like me, help your brother? I do hope so.\nI do recommend this game to people who like platformers (specially if you liked Limbo, this one should be in your taste).\n\nLuuna.","January 4, 2015","true","5.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

What is not to love in them! The atmosphere they create, the sense of mystery and old 50‚Äôs films. And these are only some of the virtues today‚Äôs game has to offer. Its name? Monochroma. The story takes places in an alternate version of the 1950‚Äôs where there is a huge company selling robots to the people in a fantastic city. You are playing the big one of two brothers. On the night that your brother gets injured and you are seeking help around, caught in a storm, you find yourself in a warehouse and reveal an awful secret about that company. The younger brother is afraid of the dark therefore the player can only put him down under the light to be able to jump higher and move faster but you can‚Äôt leave him behind like in real life! The really strong element of this game are the amazing visual and music. The black and white is in perfect balance with the red color and creates a really unique environment the player can move and unfold the great story of this two kids!  Of course, you can‚Äôt have such type of game without 50‚Äôs music. The soundtrack in this game is really amazing that enhances the overall experience a lot. Moreover, I loved the realism in the locations where each Act takes place. They blend perfectly with the story and the silent narration helps the player think and imagine the dialogs and how everything will evolve next just like in the 50‚Äôs movies we all love! (Too bad they couldn‚Äôt add red color to them). Furthermore, it is really worth mentioning the fact that there are also puzzles in this game. The puzzles are really well created in a way so they will fit in the story and it is really fun to be honest to solve them, so you can continue to unfold the story of the game. On the other hand, there are some negative aspects too that should be mentioned. Even though the game features puzzles unfortunately they are of moderate difficulty. Moreover, even though the game is a platformer and a good one I may add, most of the time you will find yourself walking. So more platforming aspects are recommended.\n\nFinally, even though the game has some negative aspects, the positive are the ones that rise in the surface. The game has some stunning visuals and gameplay that I will totally recommend to everyone who loves games like Monochroma. Monochroma promises and delivers hours of fun in a ‚Äô50s atmosphere we rarely see in detail in titles like this. Must try game and a unique experience that will satisfy even the most demanding gamer!\n\nVerdict 8/10\n+ Stunning Visuals\nThis game makes you love your brother and family in general\nUnique gameplay and mechanics\nRealism in locations and a silent narration that sets a unique atmosphere\n\n-Puzzles of moderate difficulty\nA little platforming features and more walking in the game\n","December 15, 2014","true","2.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It's platform puzzler with many similarities to Limbo in its dramatic tone and styling. I think the art is even better in this one, with a  quite memorable storyline and character design. The level design was top-notch: puzzles are generally fair in that they can be reasoned out from the clues given and seem to fit the storyline and the environment. The ending was a little difficult to figure out, however, as, unlike the rest of the game, it involved pulling in certain elements from somewhere that's not obvious. Overall it had a cinematic feel, and despite the limitations imposed from this particular plot I think the setting is ripe for revisiting in another game or perhaps other media.\n\nLike most games of this type, however, it has basically no replay value. The total playing time can also be rather short. I finished in probably 7 hours, with a good chunk of it trying to trigger the final scene properly. I spent a little time revisitng an earlier section to try to earn an extra achievement but eventually decided it was impossible -- or not worth the aggrevation, at any rate.\n\nDespite those limitations, I really loved the game. In the end it felt more like a good movie than just a series of puzzles. If you want to feel something and experience another setting, I highly recommend this. If you just want something to beat as quickly as possible before moving onto your next conquest then this probably isn't for you.","January 3, 2015","true","8.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Monochroma is a short, highly stylized puzzle platformer and feels like what would happen if you mixed equal parts of Limbo with Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons. It's definitely a flawed gem and comes with a small share of annoyances and problems, but gameplay is mostly solid and enjoyable and the beautiful interactive scenery is a real joy and makes this very worth seeking out.\n\nHighlights\nThe thing that brings Monochroma above the level of just an average platformer is undeniably the art style. The background layers and assets marry each other fantastically and it makes for an incredibly visually appealing world. More than that though, the first level sets the tone and more than just introducing the gameplay mechanics in a subtle and fluid way, it visually prefaces the overall story and starts the first transition. The story tone defined by the visuals, and cinematic elements all compliment the game as an experience rather than just gameplay, and it never feels forced.\n\nThe story is subtle and more of a shadowy overlay throughout, until the end where it starts to ramp up, and gets interesting. It's quite strange and I don't feel like the story is as good as it could've been, but it does add a little personality and interest that might not have been there had it just been a game about two brothers going somewhere.\n\n* The close checkpoints help to detract from some of the issues with the puzzle segments\n* A great level selection menu screen makes revisiting areas hassle free.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nMonochroma has all the hallmarks of an ambitious project without the budget to back it up and while those are often the games I love most, they're also some of the most frustrating because of the lack of polish and technical problems, and this game suffers from plenty of both. Fortunately they're subtle enough and the other aspects are strong enough that overall it redeems itself, at least in my experience, but mileage may well vary on different systems and for different players.\n\nThe controls and animations are often clunky and more often than not you'll find yourself repeating the same step, jump or movement because something didn't line up properly. This isn't much of a problem, but the saturation of tiny fidgety annoyances from start to finish starts to scrape after a while and really takes away from the whole experience.\n\nThese issues are compounded by some frustrating repeated trial-and-error like sections where you're simply iterating the same steps til you get it right. It's often unclear what you should be trying to accomplish or where you should be headed, and the game does a poor job of communicating these things. Again, just a general lack of polish that some time and attention could've and should've taken care of.\n\nThere are also a ton of small bugs that come down to just a lack of polish, time or dedication that you'd expect for a game like this, especially when it feels like it's had developers love poured over it from start to finish. I found multiple instances where I was unable to progress, or got stuck in a place that shouldn't have been possible.\n\n* Loading screens are infrequent but very slow, especially for quite a small game. Reload times after death are also tedious and slow which is particularly annoying when death is very frequent.\n\nRecommendations\nMonochroma is available on Steam for ¬£14.99/19.99‚Ç¨/$19.99 at the time of this review, and while it's striking and very much worth exploring, I feel it's overpriced, especially considering the 4-5 hour average playtime. For comparison, it's around 30% more expensive than Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons and twice the price of LIMBO, which I think most would argue are fuller, longer games. My recommendation for most people then, is to stick it on your wishlist and wait for this one to hit at least -50% on sale.\n\nThe DLC includes the soundtrack, a comic book, a development design book and some extras which are all quite nice to get more of a feel for the game, but at half the price of the game for what is essentially some PDF and wav files, I have to say it's ridiculously overpriced and should be avoided by most.\n\n* There's a free demo available on the Steam store page.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/265830/\n\nUnedited notes 27/08/2015 for Monochroma pre-review:\n\n+Smooth, simple, nice overall, minus jarring controls after first few chapters\n+Cool simple background story elements\n+Hidden collectibles add a second or third playthrough?\n+Brutally jarring deaths, nice\n-+Limbo meets Brothers\n-Very basic/simple til mid-game\n-Controls not explained well at start\n-Short?\n-Small bugs","August 27, 2015","true","8.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The controls feel slow and floaty, and the key to making a precise jump is to press jump before you actually want to go up. I think the thing that bothered me most about this game was that you break your brothers leg and have to carry him around, and you can only put him down in spots that are well lit because you are a nice guy - that part is okay, I guess, but it falls apart when you can only leave him under a street lamp in the rain where you're going to lower a shipping container (which will crush him if you're not quick enough to pick him up after you pull the lever), but you aren't allowed to put him down next to the lever that lowers the container which is not only well lit, but it's also out of the rain and not under threat of being crushed. The puzzle plaforming just doesn't seem well thought out in some spots, which will probably cause me not to bother coming back to this, which is a shame because it looked so interesting.\n\nIf you liked Limbo, this is very reminiscent of that. Dark and moody, no voice dialogue, imprecise floaty controls, and many industrial-themed environmental deaths to be had.\n\n4/10 Would not break my brother's leg again.

The game is a 2d platformer but the background and foreground that you can't interact with are used well to conjure the world and tell the story\n* the menu allows you to revisit bits of the game that you've already completed, so if you've missed collecting secrets or want to replay a bit you liked then you can do that without needing to replay through from the beginning.\n* check points are spaced fairly closely together, so when you die you usually don't lose too much progress.\n\nBut mostly I'm afraid that I found it a frustrating experience, without much fun.\n\n* No attempt to develop connection to brother\nThe main gimmick of this game is that your brother has broken his leg, and cannot walk so you must carry him everywhere, and because he is afraid of the dark you can only put him down in (very infrequent) spotlights.  Because do not spend much time with your brother before he breaks his leg you don't develop much connection to him.  He makes you jump less high and he basically just feels like a burden, because he does nothing for you, and doesn't interact with you very much.\nThe story would have much more impact if your brother had more depth, if he had a personality and you could develop a connection to him, instead of just feeling like he's a burden.\n\n* Long reload times and not infrequent deaths\nEach time you die it takes about 5 seconds to reload. That is quite frustrating in and of itself, but it is also quite easy to die, some of the jumping puzzles require a fair amount of precision, and some of the puzzles require a bit of experimentation to see how things work, so unless you are pyschic you won't work out how to solve it without dying at least once.\n\n* Bugs - not many\nThe game is a little buggy, a few times I have passed through walls and floors that I shouldn't have been able to, but it doesn't happen so often that this is a big problem.  Dying takes you back to the latest checkpoint which isn't far away, and solves any problem that the bug would have caused.\n\n* Slow and unfun controls\nPlatformers often have characters who are very nimble and are fun to control, and much of the fun comes from the sense of agility that the game gives you. In this game your character is a bit slow, and while you are carrying your brother you can jump less high.\nIn Limbo, and to some extent this game, the unfun controls to some extent serves to make you feel less powerful than you normally do in platformers.  In Limbo that feeling of powerfulness and lack of fun emphasises what the game is about.  Here it also makes you feel not very powerful, but less so than Limbo because you can still make a jump equal to your height even when carrying your brother.  So while there are design reasons for these limits on your abilities the effect makes you feel weak, but not really that much, and is still not fun.\n\n* Punishing puzzles\nAlmost all of the puzzles are not very difficult, and can be solved mostly through trial and error, but some are rather fussy about their timing and it often feels like the fault of the controls that you fail.\nIn a lot of platformers you have a range of abilities and solving puzzles involves combining them in an interesting way.  Here you can only run and jump, which limits the range of puzzles/challenges to timing/precision based puzzles (which the slow controls don't really lend themselves to), and interacting with objects.\n\nAs I said above the puzzles often require experimentation, which is okay in and of itself, but you will die quite a few times because of this and the slow pace, unfun controls and long reload times make the puzzle solving feel more chorish than fun.  Often you quickly workout the key idea of the puzzle, but sorting out the details involves dying a few times, and repeating the bits you've already done.\n\n* No camera control\nIt is quite helpful in platforming games to look up or down, so you can tell where you need to go next, but here you have no control.  So sometimes you make leaps downward to explore and maybe find a secret, but you just die.\n\n* Short - I completed the game in 7 hours\nI do not think that this is a big deal: Short experiences can be much more rewarding than some longer experiences.  But some people do think this important, so I feel it should be mentioned.\n\n\nThis game is by no means terrible, and if you can forgive unfun controls for pretty art and an okay story then it might be worth getting this game.  But even then I think there are games out there that do that better.","June 29, 2014","false","7.7"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","27","50","0","3"

But the whole character of the game is so intriguing that I am fascinated by it. It is a dark and tense game, you feel the tension all over the place. A good thing about it is that, the game does not rush you at any time, as it happens in many games(i hate that) yet it is not slow in any way and achieves to be somewhat dynamic and entertaining. If you are a clumsy gamer when it comes to the controls, you gotta be careful, I am a bit clumsy and had to repeat things for several times at times, so that could be a downer if you are both clumsy and impatient at the same time. As I said before I am not a big fan of puzzles, and that is because most of the time they are impossible or too easy, and not very well constructed, now this is what makes Monochroma special; the puzzles are constructed in a very intelligent way, not only that you enjoy while figuring them out, but also you get to feel smart after you solve them=D. And an A+ for the music, not only it suits the game perfectly, but also independently from that it is real good, actually I am listening to it on Spotify. Kudos to Gevende for the amazing soundtrack!\nWhat got to me the most, are some details as you can not leave your little brother anywhere you want, you have to leave him at some place where it is sufficiently illuminated because, as a little kid, he obviously is scared of dark, that's gotta be the cutest thing I've ever seen in a videogame, and it is especially beautiful, when it is in such a tense, cold and hostile environment that the game is set in. The last thing, before going back to keep playing some more, while in the immense majority of the videogames, you have to compete no matter what, be reckless, merciless and etc. a game set in a (not so far from the potential reality of a) distopia, in this game, you have to take care of your little brother and be compassionate of him; this is a breath of fresh air! Amazing job! It is not so often that I feel almost proud of being a fan of something. But I think I get can pride in being a fan of this amazing videogame! Monochroma is definitely a must-play game! get it, play it, enjoy it!","June 19, 2014","true","8.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It has some minor bugs, but can be forgiven due to the appreciable effort applied in this game development.

The narrative of the game is told without any dialogue which adds dramatic impact somewhat to the story. Along with its dark settings and unexpected ending it is definitely a memorable experience.\n\nOverall I had a wonderful time with this game and loved the artistic environments. There are a few annoying things though that I found frustrating while playing:\n\n-Hard to judge the jump mechanics at times as it seems to change with the environment.\n-Because of above reason, lots of cheap deaths\n-Still a little buggy... I installed the game and when I was playing my system crashed twice. To the developers credit they have fixed most of the issues that effected the game early on so I think they're doing a good job to fix the issues when they come up.\n-Relatively short gameplay at 6 hours with not much replay value.\n\nI would still recommend this game if you are a fan of a dark, dystopian world with a unique story.

It consists of 4 lengthy levels.\n\nThe setting seems to be more like the 1930s than the 1950s - with a few bizarre and completely out of place elements.\nThe game is silent and does not have much of a storyline. The description says:\n\n"The game has a unique approach to storytelling without using any written or spoken words."\n\nThats like the opposite of storytelling ...yeah, its a fail. I still have no idea where the brothers were trying to go ...not that it matters.\n\nVisually, the game is absolute eye candy. I especially liked the city ghetto, it reminds me of the Kowloon Walled City.\n\nLets get to the Negatives:\n(Some of you may not consider these to be negatives)\n- The game is short.\n- The game is silent and mostly grayscale.\n- There are a good number of time-constrained puzzles - I like my puzzles laid back.\n- The whole game takes place in the middle of a rainy night... there was no reason for that (at least they did not include blinding lightning strikes every 5 seconds like another platformer whose name I am not going to mention).\n- Storyline had a lot of potential, it should have been more developed.\n- The setting feels very empty, the lights are mostly on but you never see any people (except for the big guy that chases you around, the train station is empty, the flying zepplin cockpit is empty, the machinery is running but no one is there, etc.).\n- The little brother was useless, I was glad when at one point you get to play without him.\n(As a side note; the "little" brother is GIANT, carrying him around looks very ackward).\n- The robot was nothing more than a objects you position and climb over, no different than most of the other objects.\n\nIf the negatives do not deter you, then you will really enjoy this game. I hope that our purchase of it encourages the developer to make similar games.\nMonochroma 2 should be made longer, colorful, story-driven, mainly based in the city ghetto, and with a more useful little brother and robot.

The story was okay. I thought it was going to be a deeper story about the brothers, but it seems more like a game against big business, big brother, and the greed and tyranny that they produce. The story is not told in words, but rather the gameplay so it is possible I interpret this differently than the game intended. I felt the music was good, but the problem is that it seems to rarely be there. Sort of sets a very boring/quiet tone. But when the music plays, it really seems to enhance the experience.\n\nOut of the 4 hours I played to beat it, about a third to a half of that time was waiting on loading and death reloads. Oh, I didn't mention the game takes about 30 seconds to load inbetween each death. Maybe this is just me, but my computer can run games like the Batman Arkham series with very little loading, so why does this game take more than 5 seconds to load? And you will die alot due to trial and error, a format I don't mind, but don't think I should die about 10 times in the same spot and wait 30 seconds each time.\n\nThe character feels sluggish. Not sure how to accurately describe it other than saying that the control of the character seems imprecise. Since I also played Never Alone, a game about the Alaskian native tribes, I would recommend that game over this to get a similar experience. And the two play differently, but I feel Never Alone is the better game in the genre, even though I ran into a few bug that didn't break the game.\n\nI don't feel this is worth the retail price, though it may be a good for some at a steep discount.","January 9, 2015","false","4.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Unfortunately the controls of the game arent't good at all.\n\nThere are some design flaws in the core mechanics. I think the game doesn't make it clear where and when you can put your little bother down. You can put him down in ares highlighted by a light source. But there are some bright spots in the game where it simply is not allowed to put him down. At one point not far from the start there are two light bulps, one you can use the other one you cannot.\n\nAnother thing I really don't like is that you have harsh punishment as instant death in the trial and error puzzles. Trying out a lever aaaand you're dead.\n\nThe timing puzzles are a real pain because of the previously mentioned issues with the game controls. It feels to me like strechting the gameplay because the player have to retry the puzzles over and over (some not all).\n\nThe Music is good, but i think the game has to less soundeffects when the music stops, you're litterally punished with almost complete silence while the puzzle sections. It feels like something is missing here.\n\nI really like the atmosphere Monochroma wants to creates, but the to less used/missing soundeffects on one hand and the light sources wich are sometimes usable and sometimes not disturb the whole atmosphere in a really bad way.

At several moments in the game, I found the game genuinely beautiful. The design felt complete and well thought out,\nThe soundtrack.\nIn the rare moments where the music comes into play, it builds tension, atmosphere and pacing beautifully.\nWhat I was disappointed about:\n\nThe silence.\nThroughout the game, the silence is only accompanied by the sound effects that are made by the character.This starts to become grating as time wears on and makes it difficult to play the game for long periods without getting bored. (Especially in the beginning.)\nAlso, the brothers never talk with each other...through the entire game. This would be ok in regards to keeping the tension, but there are multiple moments where they are literally alone and not in any relative danger.\n\nFunctionality of the controls.\nThere are times where certain puzzles are very time based. This is frustrating when your character doesn't jump when he needs to. This will happen multiple times where you literally have to start the puzzle over because your character didn't react fast enough.\nAt times, I came across puzzles where I thought I was unable to solve to puzzle...only to realize I was going about it the right way and the controls weren't responding the way I had wanted.\n\nPuzzles.\nThere were a couple times where I felt very accomplished after solving a puzzle, but that is far and few in between.The majority of the puzzles are actually very straightforward and not too difficult to figure out.\nIn addition, nearing the end of the game, involving a boss battle, the ingenuity felt strangely lacking. It wasn't immediately clear what needed to be done and made for a lot of trail and error. Not the good kind.\n\nYour main characters.\nHaving the little brother being carried throughout 90% of the story made for the brother to be a nuisance than someone you'd protect.\nThe entire game is essentially an escort mission. The little brother doesn't feel alive, but rather an item you carry that can consequently die and restart your game.\nYou don't get to know the brothers much throughout this long journey.\nNo small interactions/ conversations between the brothers and how they react to the world around them.\nThe logic of the younger brother only wanted to be left behind in light made sense in the beginning, but as the puzzles started getting more complicated, it got a little silly.\n(ie. Sure, bro, I'll just leave you on this conveyor belt where you might get crushed. But it's OK. There's a light, so it's safe.)\nPlot.\nThe universe and its visuals are what is holding this game up. The plot itself feels like it wants to be intriguing and gritty but only ends up feeling bland and without depth. I love stories that are told without narration, but not when I come out asking more questions than when I first started.\nWhy is the world like this? Why is main antagonist the way he is? Where is everyone? Why don't we ever run into other people despite literally running past and through their homes? Where are the workers for the factories?\nSummary:\nI can feel what this game is trying to do, but when I reached the end, I only felt relief that I didn't have to play more and disappointment that they didn't do more with the universe they created.\nThe aesthetic is beautiful, but the world feels empty and unlived in.\nYou're forced to invest your time in characters you have a hard time caring about.\nAnd the only thing to get you to come back to playing the game is the aesthetic.\n\nOverall, if you want to try the game, get it during a sale.\nIt's definitely not worth full price.","January 20","false","5.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melovinci/recommended/265830/","Melovinci","Icarus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melovinci/","483 products in account","MonoChroma is a puzzle-platforming, adventure game set in a dystopian world, somewhat similar to the 1927 movie, Metropolis. Coincidentally, MonoChroma also utilises silent narrative, is black and white (except for a splashing of red here and there) and portrays a city ruled over by an assumed evil mega-corporation. Unlike Metropolis, the story is full of plot holes and explains nothing. It‚Äôs supposed to be set in an alternate 1950‚Äôs. But even this is unclear. The backgrounds and world you move through actually have some strong design and a unique art style, really pushing for that dystopian mood. But that‚Äôs it. Because there is no reinforcement from the story, no exposition or even purposeful and strong characters, the setting becomes weak and shallow.\n\nI feel that MonoChroma is a loose collection of similarly themed pictures that has been converted to a game, after the developers played Limbo and decided that indie fans love this stuff.\n\nHere is  an exert from the blurb with my opinion interdispersed throughout:\n\nThe game is a cinematic puzzle platformer that balances unique puzzles (technically true) and non-violent action (untrue ‚Äì you die all the time). Take on the role of a boy who needs tp carry his injured little brother on his back (but why?!?). You can‚Äôt move as quickly or jump as high with him on your back, so at times you have to put him down‚Ä¶ (yes, this is as exciting as it sounds)\n\nMonoChroma has been described as Limbo meets Ico (no game should use other games to bolster its own name); but it‚Äôs much more than a skilled mix of two great games (no it‚Äôs not): It is a deeply visual, intellectual, and emotional experience (also not the case). Explore the hard emotional realties of life (there was no reality to explore), relying on interactivity to grow into an art form (what does that even mean?).\n\nFor full review, visit: http://icarusreviews.net/2015/06/21/monochroma/","January 4","false","4.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The artstyle and surroundings in the pictures of Monochroma was what drew me to buy this game since they reminded me of Limbo, one of my all-time favorites. With that said, if you have not played or heard of Limbo this review might be somewhat undescriptive.\n\nIn Monochroma you are the older brother of two, who has to protect the younger brother who is injured and pretty much lifeless by carrying him on your back through the game. So basically the entire game is one long escort mission. You can drop your brother off at certain points which allows you to jump higher and so forth, this is a core mechanic of the game and it's puzzles. The gameplay and puzzles are quite good although sometimes they can be quite unclear of their objective. I had to resort to a guide online several times throughout this game. I don't know if that is a sign of a somewhat poorly designed game or of me being stupid. I should point out that throughout my intial playthrough of Limbo I never had to resort to a guide. Another criticism I have is the controls. (I played this with a Xbox 360 controller.) I'd say that the jump button has a little delay and is not nearly as responsive as in, surprise, Limbo. You might get used to it, I don't think I did cause it made me irritated pretty much through the whole game. I think the controls in general could be better and more responsive. Also the game can be occasionally buggy.  The boss battle with the octopus dude is crap. I had to do that several times. Not because it was difficult or because I suck but because it was poorly designed if you ask me.\n\nIt might sound like I dislike this game since I've only brought up criticism but there are good parts as well. The music is pretty nice although the "death jingle" is ironically happy. My biggest praise for this game would be for it's beautiful graphics and the settings. I usually don't care that much for graphics and such but in this game they are just right. The atmosphere in the many different settings and surroundings is great and fits just right. The plot is pretty basic yet interesting with tidbits being shown during the loading-screen.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend you to buy Monochroma if you already have played Limbo and are looking for more of the same. If you have not played Limbo, go buy that and play it. I'd say that Monochroma is more of a poor man's Limbo since it is not nearly as well polished as Limbo if you ask me.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game if you have some spare cash and enjoyed Limbo.","August 31, 2014","true","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just hope it's inspired and fresh. I'm not really a fan of platfomers since I've been gaming for over 30 years and I'm hard to impress, but I was easily wrapped up in this gem.\nI was a little weary of this game because a review said that the control isn't tight but I didn't have any issues. You just need a little practice, which this game will give you plenty of. (I used a wired Xbox 360 controller to play).\nGame design so far is exceptional. The game is very, very much like Limbo, but in this game, you need to escort your injured brother and the puzzles are unique because of this mechanic. The puzzles so far are challenging and you may scratch your head for a moment before you get it. This is better and unlike many games where you just do things because you can and therefore you can assume you are "supposed to" (figuring puzzles out on accident). Not in this game. You figure out how to die or get your brother killed on accident. :-)\n\nThe graphics and effects are great. First time you launch the game it's at 720p and I didn't even notice because they looked so good. I put it at 1080p and it was very sharp. The music is good. The sound is good. The control is tight. I found myself able to jump at the last second every time to just barely make the jumps like challenging platform jumping should be. So you will need smarts and good timing in this game.

Sadly I should have just watched a playthrough of the game rather than lay down the $20 I paid for it (I'm thankful I didn't back it either), and you probably should too.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, you run around, jump, swing from ropes, push crates and interact with switches. Every 2D platformer trope in the book, except none of it is done well. Your top speed while running is somewhat slow and when you jump or land you come to a pause which really breaks up you pacing so it only makes your speed worse. Swinging from ropes is the worst as it takes way too long to build up momentum to make it across gaps and if you lower yourself to the bottom of the rope (for the most momentum) you're probably just gonna go too far and drop off and die. The controls just feel really, really stiff, it feels like you're desperately trying to get the boy places and do things because of just how "off" the controls feel. Also the "controller" support in this game is abysmal: the game was made for the keyboard while the controller was definitely an after thought, you can't rebind any of the controls on the keyboard either if you want to opt into using those so enjoy the arrow keys for movement, Space for Jump and Alt/Crtl to interact. You also can't interact with any of the menus with a controller or even the mouse, the controller also doesn't feature the "interact" command anywhere, so you HAVE to use the keyboard in combination for the controller. Also, at the very beginning your brother/friend hurts himself and you have to carry him on your back a lot which is a really tired mechanic and never fun. He can't interact with anything (from what I've seen) and he's just a burden to make the "puzzles" challenging by figuring out how you're support to get across obstacles with him.\n\nThe game has the intrigue of similar titles, the story is all told through actions and the art-style set forth and there's secret flowers for you to find if you're so inclined. I'm 40~ minutes into it and while I'm usually a sucker for art games I don't know if I can bare to play through the rest of the game because of the controls and and gameplay. If you're expecting something to the calibur of Limbo, this isn't it, I'd only recommend this if you could find it for $5 on a Steam sale.","December 14, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

An overwhelming number of the puzzles can be solved at a glance and often just involve fighting the controls quickly enough to grab your useless lug of a brother before Object X returns to rest. The models and animations are amateurish with the main character, a vaguely humanoid blob with an oversized hat, gripping the air  while handling a rope or splitting his brother's head when offering a hug. I really can't fathom why so many of the reviews on Steam testify about some great experience or tearjerker of a story - I certainly didn't find one.\n\nThis game isn't broken or offensively bad but it really has nothing on Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons, The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom, Adventures of Shuggy or the more recent Never Alone when it comes to 2D platformers. Unless you're a diehard indie platformer fan with those titles already cleared in your library and in desperate need of another I'd advise staying away from this title.\n\n4/10 if you need a number to go with.","December 23, 2014","false","4.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

While I appreciate the games nod to silent black\nand white films in their atmosphere, the lack of any\nnarration or dialogue, and the spare usage of any music made this\ngame boring and somewhat monotonous. I found the brother to be more\nof a bother instead of becoming emotionally invested in his character,\nas he didn't offer anything useful to the experience.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent walking, and I'd have liked to see\nmore puzzles and platforming as what was used was implemented very\nwell into the game. Many of the platforming elements centered\naround strategic timing, leaning heavily on trial and error strategies\nand making this more geared towards those new to the genre.  In my\nvideo review, I cite specific examples of this try- die- try again\nphilosophy.\n\nWhile the character movement can feel a bit clunky, the developers\ndid an excellent job of balancing this out by working around this\nshortcoming in integrating the puzzles into the game. The puzzles are\ncreative but basic, and fit well into the game.\n\nOverall I wasn't able to complete this game due to boredom from the\nlack of music and weak story, and the simplicity of the puzzles coupled\nwith the long gaps between any puzzles or action. The games doesn't\nrespect your time, and it gets old relatively fast.

To play the game you do not need to use a lot of combinations. I played a game with my family and would recommend to anyone. All I can say for graphics and other features are limited. You are so beautiful. Thank you for everything Nowhere Studios!","June 3, 2014","true","9.0"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

The game literally starts immediately and you are thrusted into the role of a young boy wearing a red scarf, and the majority of the world in different shades of whites, blacks, and greys. Now of course there will be some red that will poke out from time to time but the majority of this game will give you the feeling of one of those futuristic and yet old noir feeling movies. You will soon find that your little brother is in this bleak world as well, and you are going to have to protect him if you are both going to survive what is ahead of you.\n\nGraphically I have to admit that I LOVED the look. There's something to be said about not trying to make the game extremely complex. Sure there was always this feeling of depth to the areas that you are moving around, even though you will always be running from left to right, right to left, up to down, down to up, and so on. The subtle use of red throughout the game makes certain things pop. Sure most of the time the reds don't mean anything to the character, but the balance of colors, and the lack of many of the usual colors in the game drew me into the feeling of a shady world filled with unease. A world where not all is what it seemed, and a world that even though there might be pictures of happy people there was something fundamentally wrong going on that was just out of view. Now there are several different areas to this game, and I have to say that all of them make you feel like you are actually progressing through a city. It definitely does not have that rinse a repeat feeling that some games have, where they simply change a couple of assets and try to sell it off as something new and different.\n\nThe music in the game was another thing that was was subtle but definitely fit right into the game. It made me think of an old crime story. You know where you have that lonely saxophone in the background, where you know that there's some dame, or person in danger.\n\nThe controls took a bit to get used to and was probably one of the weakest parts of the game. The just didn't feel precise enough. There are times where you have to make a jump, grab a ledge, or some other feat just right to continue through the game, and it was just a smidge off, just enough where frustration could creep in, especially if after doing the exact same type of movement in the game, you got different outcomes.\n\nAlright so lets get into the game. The thing that impressed me the most about this game is that they had challenging puzzles throughout the game. There were puzzles where you had to move platforms, you had to clear the way of something, you had to time a swing just perfectly, you had to climb, you had to sneak, you had to push and pull, and more. The thing that makes this game different from a lot of games that love to put obstacles in front of you was that there wasn't this ever growing curve of difficulty. Now I'm not saying that there weren't puzzles that were difficult, but there was something about the way that they laid the puzzles out in the game where I never knew what to expect. To me that is an even better layout. Now I'm faced with maybe underestimating the next obstacle, or maybe I end up over thinking it. There was this hidden balance where no matter the difficulty if you kept an open mind you were going to be able to complete the puzzle/obstacle.\n\nNow I know that I mentioned the not tight enough controls, but there was one other thing that bugged me to death about this game, the load screens. It is beyond odd when you are playing the game and you are advancing through an area and then all of a sudden, BOOM, load screen. Now not only does this happen, but because it is so abrupt I feel like the developers made the decision to put in a "Press Any Key to Continue" mechanism in there so that the player doesn't just get thrown right back into the game.\n\nAlright so all is out on the table, I would love to tell you about the story, but I'm not really sure what it was, I know that I'm trying to protect my brother, and I know that I'm running through a city. I'm not sure why I'm doing it, though I know that I have to be careful around certain corners because there are those who will chase me down if they see me. I also know that there doesn't seem to be anyone but those around the corner that seem to be around. I know that this game is supposed to try to pull at your heart-strings a bit when it comes to your brother, and I have to say you are going to see a big payoff on that piece, though I'm not telling you when in the game (that would be cheating).\n\nOk so lets get to it. If you are looking for a game that definitely is not your average game, that uses an art style, a bleak world, and actions that will draw you into a story filled with obstacles, this is the game for you. It is only violent when you mess up in the game, so if you are looking for blood, guts, and glory, this is not the game for you. This was a pleasure to play, and overlooking the two shortcomings of this game, I have to say that I would play another game much like this one, so with that I have to give this game an 8.8 out of 10.","June 5, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

As many have mentioned in the reviews here, it evokes memories of Limbo to some extent, which is not a bad thing. Gameplay wise, I am liking the puzzles in here more...in Limbo, the puzzles let the game down after the opening third.\n\nVisuals are really good. I like the touch of red in the otherwise black and white landscape. Music is good too, though for some reason the music doesn't play all the time in the background. The sound effects at times feel rough though, but nothing major.\n\nNow, the game does have issues, particularly with the animations. They really could have been better. Nothing bad now, just noticeable at times the lack of smoothness in animations.\n\nThe bigger issue for me personally is the jump button is inexplicably tied to the UP arrow key instead of the SPACEBAR or another key like X or Z or S. And it's hardwired...no way of changing. The reason I have an issue with this in the game is because then basically your right hand does the work all the time, and the SPACEBAR is used by default to carry/drop your brother, something that could easily have been mapped to the E or Q key for example. I play other games where UP is jump (like Giana Sisters) so that in itself is not the issue.\n\nOverall, it is really good, but an hour in I stopped playing due to the poorly thought-out controls. If you are going to be playing with the keyboard and don't find it desirable such that the jump is tied to the UP arrow, then I reckon waiting it out. Animations have some slight issues but nothing major. Most important thing is that puzzles are good, and the atmosphere is amazing.","May 29, 2014","true","5.5"," 16 of 52 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","16","52","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Assassin17/recommended/265830/","Assassin17","Reeze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Assassin17/","198 products in account","Monochroma is a very solid game with great atmosphere. The game is not without its downsides however. The first thing to mention is that I felt as though the puzzles were repetative, with the constant need to set down your brother to find something to jump on with him. The other issue is that the animation is pretty choppy, and sometimes a little bit glitchy. I have to say that the game feels a little bit too long, I would rather it were around 2 hours as opposed to 3 and a half. The game also has some pretty sluggish controls which made some of the puzzles a trial-and-error, and sometimes getting frustrating. On that note, the puzzles themselves were never a challenge though, which I found rather dissapointing. Despite all of the flaws. The graphics are simple but pleasent, the atmoshpere is really nice, and the art style is very pleasing. I can also say that the story is pretty solid for a game with no words and only 3-ish hours long. I will also disclaim that this game is not as similar to LIMBO as you may expect. Overall, I'm not really sure if I enjoyed this playthrough or not, which is why I can't recommend it.","November 1, 2015","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
