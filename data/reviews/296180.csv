Entente was reformed to United States of Western Europe to resist new Russian-Mongolian Empire for fourty years. Endless war is source of capital - there's stock-market, which is functioning on weapon-trade, so every event in the warfront (and in the rear) affect on stock indexes. Investments, advertising - all of these become "gears of war"... or its fuel. Paradoxal sutuation, when even soldiers can make investments in company, which produces arsenal of their elimination.\nFabula of game's storyline is simple - Empire is ready to start produce fundamentally new type of weapon - not infantry weapon, but weapon of mass destruction (closer to game's final it can be identified as nuclear). Main character, as veteran of this war (fighting practically for 21 years) and professional commando, get order to destroy manufacture of this weapon and get its sample. So, lieutenant Anderson must pass frontlines and reach military object in the deep of enemies rearward.\nFirst World war in 1964 is kilometers of trenches, crossing former Reich and full of infantry with semi-automatic and full-auto weapon, hunting snipers, pillboxes with machinguns, roaring artillery, barraging helicopters and crawling tanks. And infiltration behind enemy lines means breaches through trenches, assaults of heavy-guarded positions, cleaning of bunkers, hide-and-seek with heli's and assymetric duels with awkward tanks.\nIn gameplay-terms that means variety - variety of situations, which we can solve with variety of arsenal - technical progress of this war help us to react on all types of threats, using knife or silenced pistole for careless soldiers, automatic rifle and trench-gun for CQC, semi-automatic rifle or sniper rifle for long range contacts, RPG's for war machines and sorts of special weapon and grenades for special situations (as tribute to essence of real WWI here exist grenades with mustard gas). Role of commando helps player to meet face to all faces of this war. And this role obliges him to be careful too - enemy is dangerous and even one soldier (and even cook!) can kill you, if you're not ready to kill him - you must be ready to shoot, cover, find ways to victory. Game uses health-system, but there're enough amount of medkits to not turn game in S/L-carousel.\nThere're different quasi-realistic details, that pretty good work for game's atmosphere - first of all, that's one of games, where you can see your body in FPS-mode - trifle, but pleasant trifle! Furthermore, inventory of character is not a black hole, where player can hide crate of machineguns and pair of RPG's - it consists of knife, pistol (silenced or machine-), trenchgun, sniper rifle and sort of heavy weapon (automatic/semi-automatic rifle, heavy machinegun or RPG/grenade launcher). And you can see all arsenal on model of your character - behind back, on hip, in holster and scabbard. Health-system is simple, without delineation of damage, but it's compensated by ability of your enemies to bring that damage. Well, abilities of enemies - their AI - are good. That's no level of "F.E.A.R.", for sure, but they can suppress you with fire, use grenades, retreat and cover.\nReturning to the storyline as part of game - well, this is game of great atmosphere. Little dialogues of soldiers, that can uncover some sides of life in the world of endless war, transmitters with TV-broadcasting, that help to understand situation around you, terminals with orders, cautions or diaries... all of that make "Iron Storm" not just simple meat-shooter, but ticket to another world with it own life. And yeah, separate gratitude to developers for game's sound! When they had given voices to game's characters, they used authentic languages, so soldiers of Ugenberg's Empire speak on good russian and deutsch - there're no grammar or context mistakes, no accent. What about ambient sound - exploding shells, echo of gunfire - well, there're no problems.\nSimple fabula of storyline will blossom with few intriguing twists. And yes, what I said about variety of in-game situations, means variety of game locations too. It's not only about trenches and bunkers (despite of fact, that these trenches are good made) - there are streets of german town, large scientific complex, wagons of armored train and... something more. Somebody can call them linear, but there's fact, that often enough you must find way to your goal, trying different variants.\nWell, it looks, that I must draw a line to all this massive of different objective and subjective facts. "Iron Storm" feels differently: there are rough of fire contacts, cold of silent slicing of enemy's throat, rage of machine gun fire, fear of meeting with steel beasts - and of all of these is mixed of joy, which is called by delicious execution. It's game of great story, that gives you opportunity to breathe smoke of fire, devouring world, which could be our world.\nAt least, this is game, where you can meet face to face with german sturmpioneers, siberian elite specialists or heavy tank UG-III - and win.","August 13, 2014","true","15.2"," 72 of 84 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","72","84","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoDad/recommended/296180/","DoDad","Combat Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoDad/","403 products in account","I've read a number of reveiws of this game, mostly negative. Quite frankly I don't understand why. I've owned the disk version of this game for some time now and have played it nearly a dozen times. It is what I like to call one of my "perennial favorites", or more specifically, one of those games I play every couple of years. Now having picked it up on Steam for a mere $1.03 I'm enjoying it yet again.\nIron Storm has immersive atmosphere, cool weapons and satisfying, challenging combat. The story, while nothing particularly original manages to drag me in and keep me there. You embark on a seemingly simple objective but circumstance makes the goal anything but simple. There are some tricky parts that leave you wondering what you are supposed to do or where to go but they are few and once figured out pose no problem.\nThe level design is quite good for a straight forward shooter with some good indoor and outdoor combat. Graphics are dated but pleasing enough. Sound, especially ambient noises are quite good, as is the voice acting, what little there is.\nOne of the biggest complaints was the ending, I won't spoil it for you but I felt it was one one of the best conclusions to a game I've had the pleasure to experience, one that fit aptly the somber and dark mood that prevails throughout the game.","October 25, 2014","true","15.9"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","41","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/296180/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 6 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Ironstorm is one of these games that really annoys me.\n\nMostly because of how it's just a lot of wasted potential. It's a game with an extremely original premise, and it's bogged down by convoluted objectives and forced stealth missions.\n\nIronstorm takes place in an alternate history 1964, where World War 1 never ended. So you have things like trenches and mustard gas, but you also have automatic weapons and nukes. This premise is very good and I've never seen a game attempt something like this. Indeed the action segments of the game are passable and remind you a great deal of Return to Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nUnfortunately the designers ruined this by having convoluted objectives like forced stealth segments. Ones where you require a strategy guide to get past. Or nearly impossible objectives like luring a tank to a prior area without getting instantly killed by it's gun.\n\nThe game is okay if you're particularly masochistic and don't mind looking a lot of the solutions up. But if you're looking for a quality fps experience that feels tested and polished look elsewhere.\n\nAlso note the screenshots for this game on the Steam store are misleading. They're screenshots from the later PS2 port. If you wish more accurate screenshots check out the Gog version.","August 6, 2014","false","8.0"," 74 of 110 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","74","110","0","6"

Although it had its issues back then and still cannot be crowned as the king of shooters or any kind of video games, still, IS is able to grant a few hours of brainless fun.\n\nThe graphics are acceptable, I do not have the urge to throw up every few minutes. It is ugly, but still does not stand in the way of gameplay thanks to the overall simple design. The movement and geometries are blocky, but someone who had the most fun with the first two Call of Duty games I found it comfortable. Other than that the shooting is pretty basic, does not tries to be realistic, or anything. There is not any kind of iron sight, so it mostly has the feel of an old Counter-Strike title. There are multiple types of weapons with a few for each slot, one can be carried for each at a given time. The usual stuff is there like a knife, a simple and a heavy machinegun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, etc. Life is not replenishing itself, the collection of medical bags are required which gives some kind of resource management regarding the use of these packs. A third-person view is also available, which is mostly useful for special tasks like stealth. The maps are pretty simple too, with corridor-like pathways and a few hidden places and shortcuts. The game has a few dedicated sequences when I was forced being stealthy. These are frustrating and pointless in my opinion, but they are pretty simple and straightforward fortunately. Spawn points and timestamps can also be a source of frustration, but with the quick-save option, they can be exploited and expected. Later levels have a few harder parts where there is a need for retry because certain enemies are spawned or placed in a location where there is not much room making them even more dangerous. For example I found an enemy soldier with a rocket launcher in the sewers while had about 8 others in my back.\n\nOverall, the game is flawed but ultimately fun to play. As I played through most of the similar games made in the early 2000s (mostly utilizing the quake engine), I like to have something "fresh" in my hands. As for that Iron Storm is a decent shooter and brings back some of the nostalgic moments of other, better titles.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 7.0/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nSound: 6/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","April 15","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
