There is a freeride/delivery-mode as you might know it from ETS2, but it is smaller and, as far as I can see now, less complex (still much fun to play). The ´amazingness´ (Is that a word?) of this game comes from the many modes and missions. Drive along a messed-up road, a mountain pass, or a flooded area (...).  This game seems to be the "middle" between ETS2 and 3, to show off what is planned for #3 and what this engine can do.\n\nSo, in short:\n\n+better graphics\n+better controls\n+runs much more smooth than ETS2\n+exciting (!) roads: building sites, narrow bits and tricky obstacles of all kind\n+brilliant missions\n+online top-lists encourage competition and motivate to play every mission a thousand times\n+very well playable with keyboard, pad or wheel\n+not an easy game at all, but not frustrating->If you screw up a mission, you will go out with 0 points unable to compete with anyone online, but you will never get stuck in a mission, forced to do it a million times in order to be able to go to the next one\n+++Devs seem to actually read forums and watch videos about their game and listen to the players\n\n-the AI has some minor glitches: nothing game-breaking, more funny\n\nConclusion: If you liked ETS2, you will love this game even more. It has everything that people wanted in ETS2.\nIf you have never played ETS and you like to drive trucks in every kind of situation, then this game is something for you.\n\nRecommended .... totally!\n\nEdit: Game seems to crash when doing Alt+Tab, at least for me. Solution: Window mode (which means fullscreen + task bar) or use OpenGL.\n\nEdit²: I found out that this game was released BEFORE ETS2 (Thank you, comments section!). Seems like the fancy graphics have tricked me into some wrong thoughts. ;)","February 27, 2014","true","12.6"," 274 of 310 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","274","310","2","17"

It provides a sizable amount of Challenge Stages, broken up into a variety of disciplines.  Those familiar with Gran Turismo's Licence Tests will be familiar with these routines.  They're challenging and rewarding, demanding that you learn the finer nuances of skilled truck driving.\n\nMy personal highlight would be the various obstacle courses, titled Dangerous Drives.  You're given a point to point stretch where you have to navigate tight passages over a great number of environments, high-mountain switchbacks, flooded cityscapes, etc.  25 completely unique environments with fresh assets to test your skills under pressure.\n\nGame comes complete with online Leaderboards (watch top replays too) as well as a nice bonus photo/video gallery covering the real-world annual Scania driving test completions.\n\nJust remember, this is not ETS2.  It's its own beast with its own set of unique charms.  It's polished as heck just like ETS2 and even shares the same engine.  But that's where the similarities end.  Totally worth it to Driving Simulation fans and a complete no-brainer for those who follow and enjoy SCS Software.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nNote: Review based on pre-Steam retail copy.","February 27, 2014","true","1.1"," 81 of 98 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","81","98","0","0"

It would be nice to have it all in one game, but if you like ETS2 a lot, you will enjoy Scania Truck Simulator too. I compare it to ETS2 a lot, and for good reason, the games are similar and attract similar gamers except Scania has little mainstream appeal in comparison.\n\nPros\n\n- hazardous roads are good areas that are really missing from a game like ETS2.\n- driving school and competition challenges are well done. Some are very difficult!\n- graphics are as good if not better than ETS2. Some people miss the fact that Scania is actually an older game\n- the game world is smaller but it is detailed (makes ETS2 look generic in comparison)\n- bonus content (actual competition photos and videos are good stuff)\n- there is still a sandbox mode to free-roam in, though...\n\nCons\n- smaller and inferior sandbox compared to ETS2 (not bad, but ETS2 is just that good)\n- driving physics feel inferior to ETS2\n[EDIT] - After playing more i find slippery roads and mud to be better than i first thought, so overall physics are quite good.\n- fewer customisation options (can't set brake sensitivity, disable speed limiter, "pretty up" your truck)\n- game engine lacks some touches (water splash for ex.) Though i played with the relatively crappy Intel HD4000 IGP, so take that into consideration.\n\nOverall i'd recommend the game. It won't dissapoint, but it wont blow your mind either. A solid "niche" game worth picking up if you're into realistic driving sims.\n\nThumbs up!","June 29, 2014","true","10.8"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","2"

And if you are going to pay full retail price for this game, buy ETS2 instead.\n\nScania Truck Driving Simulator was made by the developers who made Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a good thing. The game itself is really great and totally worth the price, but that's because it's almost the same game as ETS2, same map, same vehicles (but only the Scania ones) and same graphics. What I've seen, there's no story mode in this game, unlike ETS2 where you can start like a freelancer make your company growing until you have several employees and trucks. However, that's not how this game was supposed to be either, because then it would have been exactly like ETS2 -but worse.This game though, have some good game modes, including multiplayer and a wide range of tasks. For those who just like driving around, there is a free mode where you can just drive around and do anything you want.\n\nAt last, as I always do, I recommend this game to the players with a WHEEL, as in my opinion, all driving games are boring with keyboard and mouse. BUT if you do enjoy this kind of games with any kind of controller - don't care about what I think and buy the game.","April 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 66 of 89 people (74%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","74","66","89","23","5"

It obviously is different than ETS2 (Euro Truck Simulator 2) which many of the reviewers have already mentioned. It has less to offer, only one truck brand and delivering cargo seems to take the minor part in the game. Yet I do recommend it for those people who like precision-driving. This game can really teach you how to properly steer a truck with (or without) a trailer when there is not much space available to manouever. I had lots of fun doing the really challenging  dangerous courses. The game includes some media, mostly photos of Scania trucks, truck-driver competitions and also some short video clips all about trucks and driving them. It maybe is not worth its full price of 15,99€, but if you can manage to grab it for 5€ or below it is totally worth it in my opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StickiesAreOverpowered/recommended/258760/","StickiesAreOverpowered","Tim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StickiesAreOverpowered/","127 products in account","Scania Truck Driving Simulator (STDS), plain and simple: Do you need help handling your truck? STDS is a game dedicated to helping improve your understanding of truck and trailer handling. If that doesn't interest you, well, I can't make you stay. The rest of the review will be about the gameplay, so buckle up. Or get ready for a nap.\n\nMost of you here must've played Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) to even be remotely interested in this. Don't be ashamed, this game was mostly forgotten when Euro Truck Simulator 2 came out. Why buy this when ETS2 is obviously newer and better? However, it will be on sale until 15th July, 2014, so if you play Euro Truck Simulator 2, you won't regret buying this.\n\nFirst, the gameplay. The gameplay varies from simple driving tutorials to driving on dangerous mountain roads. The game gives you thorough practice on the art of trailer reversing, so if you're struggling with that in Euro Truck Simulator 2 (especially multiplayer mod!) then I will recommend this game for you. But do not think you are playing ETS2. Play the game, how you would any other new game. Expect a new game. Obvious, but true.\n\nThe handling of the truck (Scania R-series) is different to that in ETS2. The truck feels heavy, underpowered. In fact it might be. But the game isn't about power, or speed. It is about precision and agility, or sometimes even pure luck. Speed is not a big factor in the game. It is perfect if you need to learn about how your trailer behaves on and off the road, whether you try to turn a tight corner or reverse into a loading dock.\n\nThat was for comparison to ETS2. Now, onto the game itself. I will recommend you go from top to bottom of the menu list, after adjusting the options.\n\nDriving Licence gives you basic tutorial lessons on truck driving. If you are new to trucking games, this will be a quick introduction, and it can be challenging. If you are confident with your driving skills (looking at you, ETS2 players), play this section regardless. While ETS2 focuses more on freeroaming and company-building, STDS focuses on handling and precision driving (not necessarily at speeds), and the two games are different based on those values.\n\nDriver Competition would be next in line after you finish Driving Licence. You are entered into a competition where you must complete tasks in a showground, while getting around lots of obstacles and without collisions. It will test what you learned previously, and it will also test your patience to the max. Of course, if you're not a perfectionist, things can be a bit less annoying for you.\n\nDangerous Drives feature a range of locations with real-world challenges, from natural disasters to manmade ones. There are a few hours of content in the section, again, depending on whether you want to perfect every challenge or not.\n\nFreeform Driving is self explanatory, you can deliver cargo in a freeroaming, exploring manner, although the area is not quite as big as other open-world trucking games in the SCS family. It is not the game's primary focus.\n\nTime Reaction Test is also self explanatory, in this section you can test your reaction times. How quickly can you step on the brake pedal when the unexpected occurs?\n\nOverall, the game is a content-rich tutorial into the world of trucking. If you are unfamiliar with how trailers behave when you travel in reverse, or to get a feel of the size of trucks (believe me, you'd be surprised at how much space you actually have), or just plain driving for the fun (and thrill of it!), then I recommend this game for you.","July 11, 2014","true","5.0"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","2"

I have yet to see a game that puts you in a city situation where you have really check your space margins when taking a right turn next to traffic.\n\nEuro Truck simulator seems to focus more on highway driving and has a bit of city driving when you get near the warehouse. Thing is though, seems like warehouses are the only things that make up the cities. I bought Scania for the reason mentioned above about city situations, I wanted to be driving in tight situations where turns would be difficult. The game gives a few options regarding driving such as free drive mode (where you pick up a trailer and deliver it, more like time trial mode), driver license where you go through a tough licensing course, driver competition to test your accuracy around obstacles, and my favorite and reason why I bought this game : dangerous drives. Dangerous drives put you in situations where you must drive your truck or cargo through super tight scenarios (such as driving along side of a cliff). My favorite feature of this game setting is that the devs seemed to try to incorporate everyday life scenarios into this mode. One challenge requires the player to back up their truck behind the stage of a rock show, and attach to a trailer, do a 180 through a bunch of parked cars and other band trailers, and drive away.\n\nThe controller bindings for this game are absolutely beautiful once you figure it out. I wish more games had this much control over controller settings.\n\nVisuals are nice neat and relevant to trucking. No hiccups or gaps here. Sounds are generic as trucks are all the same brand.\n\nAlthough I would put it on par with Euro Truck 2, I would say if Euro Truck had dangerous drives I would have most likely skipped over this game and kept with that one. That being said, I would still like to see a truck driving simulating game that puts the player in a city where they have to make turns in busy pedestrian and traffic scenarios. Sure it would be hard to make entire maps for cities, but even have a few to choose from with a few tight roads to outmaneuver through would be cool.\n\nI feel Euro Truck has given in their game a bit more to do, and for that it's rating will be higher than this games. None the less, great purchase on sale.\n\n\nRATING : 7.25/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	C+	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	B-\nScreenShots :\nExpect these sort of type road scenario situations, except every car is stationary\n\nThey place parked cars in convenient places\n\nBeing the rodie at the rock show","April 12, 2015","true","3.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

It is full of fun and challenges that are actually challenging. It is made by SCS so you know it will definatly be a good game. This simulator puts your skills to the test! Get ready, your in for a fun-packed challenge!\n\nThe game comes down to 5 different sections:\n\nDriver Licence-This is just the beginning of the challenges. You will be put through several tests such as reversing, parking, reverse serpentine, and parking.\n\nDriver Competition-This is were you put your skills to the test were your are chellenged with extremly hard challenges such as roundabouts, almost impossible reverses, and more. These driver competetions also take place in real life.\n\nDangerous Drives-You are put through TONS of different situations such as you being stuck in traffic and the only way out is to go on a road with parked cars all over and try to make it through without crashing! Easier said then done!\n\nFreeform Driving-This is the part of the game that is similiar to Euro Truck Simulator 2 were you deliver goods to different places. However, the only downsides are that there is no navigation/minimap so when you are trying to make a delivery, there is no way of knowing were to go. You are basically always lost. The map is also not that big, but its a good size.\n\nTime Reaction Tests-Lastly, you have the time reaction tests were you are supposed to trive through roads and they give you a "obsticle" and you are supposed to stop as soon as possible.\n\nOverall, This is a GREAT game and I think that it was nessasary that SCS made this game because it really puts your skills to the test and it determens whether you are a great driver or not. It is also Great fun!\n\nWatch me play it!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aIViy7ESMU&feature=youtu.be\n\nFINAL RATING: 9/10\nThe reason I gave it a 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because of the problems with the free driving.

Picking up trailers or delivering them was always really easy, so it wasn't challenging enough to be interesting and the long stretches of road were populated enough with details to be somewhat convincing, but it gets old after a while.  The real star of Euro Truck Simulator 2 was the fantastic traffic AI and dealing with traffic respectfully throughout your travels.  A great game for what it is.\n\nScania Truck Driving Simulator is made by the same company, but this time it focuses on everything about truck driving that is technical.  There are truck driving license tests, there are championship truck driving competition challenges (exact copies of real life events) which require extreme precision and there are short refined stretches of dangerous drives to attempt more like natural obstacle tracks.\n\nI ate a lot of penalties for minor collisions, but some of the challenges were tricky just to finish at all due to very particular trailer angling requirements around certain bends.  You're forced to understand what each mirror is for and gain an appreciation for them, putting them to regular use.  Through-out the game, you come to understand some of the strategies necessary to accomodate for the semitrailer.\n\nWhile it has all those challenge modes, it also has a couple freeroam modes similar to a large city in ETS2 that have trailer missions to pick up and medals to collect if you can find them.  Certainly the most casual of the modes, it does not have ETS2's lengthy 30 minute drive requirements and instead focuses more on quick pickup and deliveries with technical driving aspects.\n\nIf trucks don't interest you this probably won't change that, but if you care a little bit then you are likely to come out of it feeling elucidated in respect to trucking.","July 13, 2014","true","10.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

If you have ETS2 you will love this game regardless of what truck brand you drive. This game will seriously test your driving abilaties and will separate the men, from the boys!

One tip for the "Dangerous Drives" missions is to make small adjustments to your steering wheel and take your time, don't drive too fast or you will trash the entire mission. Also, try not to use your exterior camera view, you won't get as many points if you don't. If I was to rate it, I would rate it 4/5 stars.

And if you are going to pay full retail price for this game, buy ETS2 instead.\n\nScania Truck Driving Simulator was made by the developers who made Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a good thing. The game itself is really great and totally worth the price, but that's because it's almost the same game as ETS2, same map, same vehicles (but only the Scania ones) and same graphics. What I've seen, there's no story mode in this game, unlike ETS2 where you can start like a freelancer make your company growing until you have several employees and trucks. However, that's not how this game was supposed to be either, because then it would have been exactly like ETS2 -but worse.This game though, have some good game modes, including multiplayer and a wide range of tasks. For those who just like driving around, there is a free mode where you can just drive around and do anything you want.\n\nAt last, as I always do, I recommend this game to the players with a WHEEL, as in my opinion, all driving games are boring with keyboard and mouse. BUT if you do enjoy this kind of games with any kind of controller - don't care about what I think and buy the game.","November 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you think backing a trailer is hard in ETS2, just wait until you experience the rage-fuelled exercise in misery that attempting the same in STDS turns out to be. Your gear-shifting has to be more accurate, your stopping distances longer, and if you're anything like me, you'll stall the truck roughly 285 times during hill-starts or when manoeuvring at low speed. (Planting your foot on the accelerator for a couple of seconds before releasing the clutch rapidly becomes a way of life.) And if you think you can just hook up a trailer and trundle off in 4th gear like you do in ETS2... I'm afraid not. The Scania you have in STDS is powered by an emaciated hamster with a respiratory infection, and he just can't turn that driveshaft fast enough.\n\nCompared to this, ETS2 is child's play. You spend the vast majority of your time cruising down the Autobahn listening to Def Leppard. In STDS, you're navigating tiny cargo yards strewn with pallets and forkhoists, or squeezing down narrow side streets between parked cars and roadworks. And then, if you actually manage to get to your destination without ploughing into a field or getting yourself stuck in a hedge, you'll spend the next 20 minutes performing a 27 point turn in a cack-handed attempt to slot the trailer into the crevice left between another trailer and those barrels some git left sitting in the middle of the yard.\n\nMost of the truck drivers I know swear a lot. If there was such a thing as the 'profanity olympics', they'd be gold medallists. Now that I've played STDS, I know why. Having said that, it's a lot of fun. You do, after a few hours spent shrieking like a lunatic and cursing the laws of physics, get the hang of it. I can now make deliveries without causing a multiple car pile up in the middle of an intersection. I can navigate the city (no GPS for you, young man) pretty well, and I can even reverse my trailer into position without stalling, punching a hole through a fence or reducing a pedestrian to an unsightly crimson smear on the pavement. I still can't parallel park. But then I can barely parallel park my car, so I'm not that fussed to be honest.\n\nTo sum up, STDS is basically ETS2 with mushy controls, crappy force feedback, slightly dodgy physics, somewhat underwhelming audio (the Scania doesn't so much roar as mewl piteously), no career mode, a much smaller map, and a learning curve so steep you'll need a velcro wetsuit dipped in PVA glue to have even a hope of scaling it. Unlike ETS2, it forces you to drive properly -- pay attention to your mirrors, shift gears at the right time, make tiny adjustments to the steering wheel when manoeuvring, and practice, practice, practice. Because it really is a simulator (as well as being a gloriously shameless advertising campaign for Scania), as opposed to a scenic tour of Europe by truck. I love both games, and for completely different reasons, but I would recommend STDS to die-hard truck driving fans, Scania fetishists and masochists only. This is a game that will kick you in the crotch and then laugh about it, but if you're willing to spend the time (and we're talking a lot of time here) mastering it, it may eventually shake your hand and buy you a pint.\n\nMaybe.","April 8, 2015","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not what I thought it would be. Its not really worth money, at all.
