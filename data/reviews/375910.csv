I don't see how they could have added good things to the mechanics of the previous games without changing what is already in place, so I think change was necessary. The devs did too, and so it went.\n\nHowever, what we ended up with is an empty game! Or, rather, a collection of loosely connected minigames, but in any case nothing as deep as any of its predecessors. It is all child play.\nBasically, you are just filling the map with buildings until you run out of space (if you manage to not get bored to death before). It doesn't really matter where and how as long as it is in the right sector, connected to a road and, preferably, as close as possible to the service producing buildings it requires (or the other way around if it is a service building you are placing). As for the kind of building, basically you start with some houses, then you go on with service buildings and factories until your stock manager says production meets consumption. There are no trading routes, you just select the type of good, the source, the destination, the transfer rate you want and you are done. Also, you don’t really need trading routes so much in the first place because you can produce anything in any sector as long as it is a sector of the right biome. At some point you may need some rare materials. To get these you will have to either do some quests (move your main (only) ship around the current sector), do a crisis sector (some sort of donjon crawler with boats, totally independent from the main game. I don't really understand what it thinks it's doing here. Maybe it stand as a reminder of the fact that the previous games had a military aspect) or play the asteroid miner android game.\nThere is just no mechanic in that game that is not trivial to master.\n\nI understand why some of the mechanics have been removed. By replacing the carts and boats with abstractions of themselves, you end up with something that, from any meaningful perspective, behaves the same way but only uses a fraction of the resources the original requires to run which, in turn, allow the devs to make things huge. But then, despite all the potential offered by this approach, it looks like they went for the cheapest solutions. Why did you have to make trading routes so dumb? Why did you have to remove the fertility mechanic? Given that these two things could have been there, was it so hard to replicate the random maps with sectors instead of islands? Sadly, no.\nThe devs made room for new things and gave themselves great tools and then did nothing with them. So that's what the game ended up full of: nothing.\n\n\nSo, to new comers I would say, save your money, buy anno 2070 instead. You will get way more for a much lower price. The anno game series is definitely one of the great names of its genre and 2205 tried to renew it but it fails to create anything worthy of your time and money as far as gameplay is concerned.","December 7, 2015","false","44.1"," 768 of 840 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","768","840","23","19"

This game has one big storyline lasting a few hours, which offers you nothing really interesting when you're done with it. All the city locations are the same in each playthrough, all the missions will be the same in each playthrough, and there's not even a skirmish mode to bring anything new to each game. They got rid of it completely.(along with manual saves for some reason)\n\nYou also no longer get to trade with/declare war on your competitors. They don't even have any cities present on the map. They offer you missions with small rewards from time to time, as well as sector project missions, but the only trading done is with a neutral space station that happens to have every resource available. The only combat is done against some really generic villain who declared the Moon independent for some reason. The only representation of your competitors as actual competition is found in a bar graph, showing who's got the highest corporation rating based on the total population managed by each corporation.(though their people doesn't really exist anywhere, you're the only one with an actual simulated population)\n\nThere's no downside to being below your competitors, other than their constant smug comments that you suck.\n\nIt's an Anno game, so it's still pretty fun to just manage your cities and build your production chains, and I love how you can finally see the supply/consumption rates of your city at a glance, but I wouldn't recommend getting this one over the older games. It doesn't offer anything particularly new, and removes a bunch of good, staple features of the Anno series.\n\nBuy the older games if you're interested. They're cheaper and last longer.","November 7, 2015","false","13.9"," 453 of 509 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","453","509","6","12"

I own every Anno and was so excited for Anno 2205, I preordered the gold with the season pack...  I haven't been this disappointed since EA ruined Command and Conquer.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, except that the gameplay is very different from 1404/2070 and grossly overly simplified.  The biggest thing that bothers me is that there is no resource management, citizens tell you exactly how much of a item they want, and you build a building to provide it, there is no guessing or balancing. Once you build the resource building it just happily generates resources for the rest of the game.  Most buildings just have slots you build them on, especially disappointed that the island warehouse and dock area is prebuilt and can only be in the location the force you to put it in.  There is no creative expression, you can move buildings any time you want for no cost, there is no multiplayer, no skirimish, no scenarios, no challenges,  just one campaign consisting of nine maps.  I've been playing the game on expert and have yet to worry  once about income.\n\nThe combat is only done on the same few maps, on rotation, completely seperate from your city.  You get one of every ship and you cannot set task groups or use any tactics beyond scorched earth.  Simply order your ship forward and spam the special ability.  The very few side quests are all piled together on the trading posts and are pointlessly stupid "go here, get this" type quests with rewards that have no use.  They give you a command ship but there really isn't any point to having a command ship.   I can't stand the terrible voice acting constantly repeating the same thing at me.    There is no challenge, there is no point.  This game is like a crappy time management sim that i'd expect to play on my tablet five minutes at a time.\n\nI regret my purchase.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mc_Intire/recommended/375910/","Mc_Intire","Mc Intire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mc_Intire/","289 products in account","Anno 2205 brings a lot of change to the Anno franchise. Unfortunately not all of them have been thought through.\n\nLet me start with some good changes: The economy system has been changed. Inside a "sector" the need of establishing trade routes has been removed. Power, build force and resources are automatically transferred between different islands. However the concept of trade routes is not gone entirely. It has been shifted to the "world view", where you can exchange needed resources between sectors.\n\nAlso, thanks to the fact that the game now displays resource and goods output per building and also per sector, it has become a lot easier to create such routes.\n\nA lot of reviews claim that the system of "storage" on an island/sector is gone. This is not true. Overproduction is still being sent to the warehouse, and you can still monitor it by hovering your mouse over the goods item in the sector overview (found in the lower left corner of your Hud in sector view). It will still fullfill the needs of your residents if the sector output drops to the negative. However, if you have negative output and build new production lines to fullfill that need, it will increase resident satisfaction instantly, instead of slowly charging up like in the previous games.\n\nWhat is gone from the game is the ability to load overproduction onto your ship at will (you still do this for missions). I am also still searching for a per sector breakdowm of my inhabitants and, more importantly, free living space. This, among other function the Anno regular might be used to, seems to be either removed or tied to one of those final monument structures that I have yet to reach.\n\n[edit] ScoobyDoomyDoom mentioned in a comment that you can find your population statistics hidden behind the little "people" button next to the minimap.[/edit]\n\n[edit] I have encountered a very annoying bug with the public needs buildings and the "move structure" feature. Whenever I move resident buildings in order to optimize public needs output, to reduce the amount of required public structures, the game will calculate the new layout wrong and assign needs deficits when there is actually a huge overproduction. Strangely enough, this bug will sometimes fix itself by closing the game and restarting the map. It is quite annoying however to have 150.000 Investors move out because of a lack of mobility even after creating a +27 surplus around them, with sufficient road connections. Especially when this means your income suddenly takes a death plunge.[/edit]\n\nDifferent sectors\n\nRight now there exist 3: Temperate, arcitc and lunar. Arctic and lunar have special requirements to their building sceme, and Lunar buildings cost an arm and a leg to build, but other than that they mostly add some visual difference rather than gameplay ones. Your population in temperate regions mostly provides the money for your exploits in the other two sectors, so you go back once in a while to up population. Meanwhile population in the other two sectors is only important to increase your spaceport level (to be able to transport goods back to your home region).\n\nModules\n\nThis is probably the best addition yet. For every production building you can make meaningful adjustments in order to increase productivity or reduce maintainance. Not only that, but in different sectors different modules make more sense. Rule of thumb: upgrading a farm is cheaper and puts less strain on your energy/income than building a second farm. It also takes up less space. And for those mountain and shore spots it is absolutely neccesary in order to get the best out of them.\n\nNow to the absolute negative... combat.\n\nI am not sure what to say about it, so here a brief description: Instead of waging war with concurring factions in your own sector the game has a set of crisis sectors where you can duke it out with a preset fleet of ships that can be upgraded and will be expanded as your population grows. The gameplay seems like a simple Dawn of War 2 Clone, with varying but similar objectives. So far so boring for someone who came to Anno after playing RTS for years.\n\nThe AI is horrible. Ships patrol in preset sectors, you get too close they stick to you like glue until you run away far enough. The games trickle down to "kill those five ships, retreat, repair, kill those four ships, retreat, repair" while finding the best route to your objective. In order to increase the difficulty the amount of ships in the sector is simply raised, to the point where you are tiptoeing trough a minefield on hardes settings. Tedious, but not in the slightest challenging.\n\nVariation? No. There are three or four scenarios for each region, and they will start repeating soon. by repeating I mean very same map with opponents in the very same spot. The only reason to do this is to get rare materials that can be used to upgrade your buildings. It could have been a smartphone app. Woud have had more replay value than the app they actually released, if not by much.\n\nCompared to the excellent combat system in 1404 and the still very god combat system in 2070 this is a joke, and a direct insult to my intelligence.\n\nThe crowning touches is that the only online activity in this game are council votings and trading on the online market.\n\nIf Ubisoft wants a positve review they will need to address:\n\nThe combat system, best you throw it out and do it anew.\nShip building, I want to build my fleet myself. And I like my fleets big.\nMultiplayer, and by that I mean both coop and competetive\n\n[edit] According to Ubisoft, multiplayer is to follow soon(tm). There is no information yet on how exactly this is to work, though.[/edit]\n\nIf you want to pull Anno out of the garbage before the playerbase vanishes you better get those done. Not neccesarily quickly, but in a well polished and professional manner. Playable. Enjoyable.\n\n[edit] Minoes claimed that if you were looking for a singleplayer economy building game and did not care about the military part, you could safely buy the game. I felt that I had to put up a clarification for people like him: Yes, the economy part is done well. No it does not make the game a safe deal.\n\nThe problem is the replay value. The average player will be hitting the last technologies after 15 hours of gameplay. Adding the sector projects you gain roughly 20 hours of progressive gameplay. Half of that if you build up a strong economy from the start and do not take up as much time waiting to unlock sectors from other corporations.\n\nAfter that there is pretty much nothing to do other than prettying up your settlement or perfecting your goods chains. The 9 sectors currently ingame are pre made with pre made main and side missions and repetetive mini-quests. This might be great for casual players and people going for the perfect pretty city. But even that only became interesting in the prequels because the random islands and their different properties spiced things up.\n\nOkay, 10 to 20 hours sounds promising to some, but in the prequels you spent the same amount of time on your average random map, with always changing challenges and opportunities (some which you could pick, some which the map predefined), with a singleplayer campaign and single missions still on top of that. And (I know I am repeating myself) multiplayer support to play together or against each other.[/edit]\n\n[edit 05.Nov.2015] Fixed a few typos, added information on population and multiplayer.\n[edit 06.Nov.2015] Response to comments added.\n[edit 14.Nov.2015] Ubi announced a fix for random online disconnects","November 4, 2015","false","110.9"," 482 of 584 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","482","584","9","8"

I never did multiplayer, admittedly, because I'm not a huge fan of acknowledging other people even exist, let alone let them invade my game.\n\nI reccommend this game... with some stipulations. This is a great game, but it seems Anno fans will have to give it a little time before it gets really great. The complexity is still there, and don't let anyone tell you different. They just haven't played it long enough.\n\nHere's my pros and cons list.\n\nPROS:\n\n+This game is BEAUTIFUL. I mean, absolutely astounding. I played on both low and ultra graphics, and I must say it is spectacular on all counts, little details are so satisfying I don't mind ignoring gameplay for a few moments just to watch the little people move around in the buildings.\n\n+The characters are intriguing. For a city building game, anyway. I'm visiting new areas and I'm seeing people who, admittedly, are cliches. The Lunar faction bad guy might a well wear a Darth Vader costume, and "Mysterious Woman" is a strange way to hold emissary to the big space station. But I enjoy their presence for the most part, even if they like repeating the same phrases in heavily accented English.\n\n+Accessible, easy to understand gameplay. The moment you begin, you jump right into the game. I was expecting a tutorial of some sort, but it's streamlined easily into the entire system, a rather fantastic setup. I don't mind the lack of other game options, for now, but I'm also not far into the game. There IS that little bothery feeling that the story will end and I'll be left bored, or have to start over to play more.\n\n+Interface. Besides being beautiful, clean, and simple, you get to see exactly what the load balances for your economy are. This means you know exactly what you need to balance the lines, and admittedly, this change might make previous Anno game players feel like it's TOO simple now. Before, you just had to sort of guess: or look up schematics online for high-efficiency building layouts.\n\nCONS:\n\n(This one is no longer valid, as of 10 hours playing the game. It got complicated pretty fast.)\n-It DOES feel like baby's first city builder. It's simplified, no doubt, and the added interface telling you exactly what you need only makes it easier. Eventually the difficulty ramps up once you colonize new lands and have to balance your needs, but your workforce doesn't seem as demanding, and without any sort of trade ships and storage, it remains a simple act of adding more weight to one side in order to balance things. Only rarely have I really messed up and had to do damage control.\n\n-No multiplayer. As I've said, I don't do multiplayer. But I've seen a large number of people complain about it, and seeing how there's only one game mode, I can see why the value should exist. There should be SOME other option to enjoy, instead of this on-the-rails experience.\n\n-Lack of Lore. In my opinion, this world is very interesting. I like seeing all the little details, and I like hearing a vague idea of how the factions work and fit together. But I want more story, I want to know what it was like 100 years ago, or how exactly my new implants are changing the population of my people.\n\nTL;DR Anno 2205 is a really beautifully constructed koi pond. It's great to look at, maybe even jump into, but if you're looking for depth and power, you won't find it. Everything you see is right on the surface, and jumping in only gets you wet and wishing there were more.\nNonetheless, I give it a thumbs up because... while it's just a kiddie pool, it's a pretty damn fun kiddie pool. But then again, I'm a pretty casual player, so I don't mind the simplicity. If you don't mind a simple, good-looking game, I suggest you jump right in and splash around. But do it somewhere else, there's no multiplayer.\n\nEDIT: I'll update this once I've gotten about 12 hours, as per Shynx's suggestion.\n\nUPDATE: I tried to wait the full 12 hours, but I'll stick with 10.\n\nI take back the con about this being a simple game. At first? Yes. Very simple. But then I colonized the arctic and the moon, and now it's getting fun. There IS a storage system, I just never noticed it until I did a quest relating to it. There's also a rather significant amount of balancing compared to what I originally thought, because with the addition of modules, it can make things VERY dynamic. Plus, I just bought out a weaker company, and man, that feels good.\n\nOn a side note, I've barely noticed uPlay is there. It popped up for a few seconds asking for the activation code in the beginning, and now it's almost as if it doesn't exist.\n\nTL;DR The more I play this game, the more I like it. I wouldn't call it a disappointment to the series at all.","November 3, 2015","true","50.5"," 872 of 1,092 people (80%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","80","872","1","82","29"

Naturally, the newest addition to the franchise, Anno 2205 by Ubisoft Blue Byte, was going to be a definite purchase. Does it live up to its numerous predecessors?\n\nAnno 2205 is a logical continuation of Anno 2070. 2070's main selling point was the new setting, but apart from that it stayed very true to the Anno-formula in which you navigate a large open map, filled with randomly generated islands on which to settle, optimise your economy, care for your citizens' needs, all while dealing with your NPC-competitors (or other players online), who do the same in real time. There always was something magical about starting the game with nothing but a single exploration-vessel with some wood and a few tools on board, finding a place that suits you and watching it grow until it is thriving and full of life.\n\nWith Anno 2205, Ubisoft Blue Byte seems to attempt to step outside of their own comfort-zone. There are several radical changes to the old formula. No longer do you start the game with a race for the best island. In fact, the whole concept of the single large ocean-map was done away with alltogether. Now, you get to choose between one of three maps of the Temperate zone, all of which preconstructed - no more random generation. The maps differ slightly in the amount of buildable land and resource-building-spots. They also all feature a unique set of side-quests - this may be rebuilding an old dam for a massive increase in power-generation or constructing a monument. While the maps still technically feature islands, they are much larger in size than they were in previous games and some can even be connected via bridges.\nSo far, so good, yet that is not where the changes end.\nNo longer do you and the NPCs coexist together on the same map. Instead, they automatically occupy the maps you did not choose to build their cities off-camera. The only interaction you have with them is through sidequests they issue you occasionally (much like in Anno 2070) or through the ingame-menu, which connects all the zones on a worldmap. Once you reach certain milestones with your corporation, you will gain access to again one of three maps of the Arctic region, then again to one of three maps on the moon (creatively, the craters are the islands here). Both of these regions come with their own challenges, your Arctic settlers will need to live near factories to stay warm, your Lunar colonists must be protected from meteor-showers by building shield-generators. All maps produce unique consumer-goods required by the inhabitants of all your three maps, so you must have them supplement each other via trading routes.\nAgain, the three maps are completely seperate from each other, but you can access them all through a menu and while you are playing, all three will continue simulating in the background.\n\nThe intention behind all this is, according to the devs, to let the players focus on what they enjoyed most in Anno - building a huge, sprawling city with a highly industrious economy. Granted, this is one of Anno's strongest selling points, yet in 2205 this is made so easy for you, achieving this seems too trivial to have much of an impact.\nNo longer do you carefully monitor your resources to decide which production-chains need optimising. The game flat-out tells you exactly how much of a deficit or surplus you are producing. The large, completely uncontested maps give you more than ample space to plonk down much more than you need to reach the highest-level citizens, so space-management isn't quite as much of an artform anymore, either.\nOh, and did I mention the military-part of the game is now also its very own sub-game?\nInstead of having to balance economy and military, you now have an off-map fleet, given to you at the start of the game, which resolves any conflicts you may have. Much like the maps you build on, the game features "Conflict zones", purely for your fleet to do short combat-missions in. You will always fight the same enemy (this game's version of pirates, basically eco-terrorists), find consumables to help you out (like instant-repairs or missile-strikes) and, scattered through the mission and upon completion, gain rare materials. These materials cannot be mined/produced by you, so you must either do sidequests for them or play in the conflict-zones. With them, you can upgrade your existing factories and add modules to them Sim City-style.\nThe combat missions become dreadfully dull after doing them all on each difficulty, especially while not being able to customise your fleet. Having the military-aspect banished to its own maps also means that your cities are never in any danger. Your only enemy here is messing up so bad that you run out of credits, and even then you will be given loan after loan.\n\nCan I recommend 2205?\nI have bashed many of the "new" things in Anno 2205. This is because personally, I didn't want it to change this much. I wanted the old formula with a few added twists, new factions, spiffier gameplay and all that. The Anno-engine is a solid foundation, it still looks absolutely gorgeous and simply planning everything out and optimising still had me engaged for a solid 8 hours in the same game.\nYet, to me it feels like 2205 is caught somewhere between its ancestry in the RTS/economy-sim heaven and its contemporary brethren of the casual city-builders. This indecisiveness is what makes me not recommend the game, because it doesn't satisfy either genre. It is not complex enough to be a classic Anno-game, yet also doesn't feel like a city-builder (still no round roads, no terraforming or landscaping).\n\nIn the end, I must advise caution if you are interested in 2205. Have a look at the mechanics and ask yourself if you want an Anno which is so very different from the old ones. Also keep in mind the very steep pricing.\nAt the time of writing this review, barring any revolutionary DLC or content-patches in the near future (multiplayer, anyone?), I cannot recommend Anno 2205.","November 4, 2015","false","8.2"," 297 of 357 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","297","357","6","14"

The end result of that was that I barely remembered where I put that generic production building that I want to upgrade now but can't recall where it was or what it looked like.\n\nIt is a very pretty game. Quite something to look at and thus far I have not encountered any bugs, which for an Ubi game is rather surprising. I got a good few hours out of it before it just felt like a chore to keep jumping between the different maps to boost production of X would then needed to boost production of Y to support the increased population and then needed to go to another mapo to boost the supply of P to send to that colony. In some ways we did the same in previous Annos but there was something delightful in setting up your trade routes efficiently and everything was on the same map and it all felt more immersive. Jumping out of the map to go to another map breaks that sense of interconnectedness that I didn't even realise was so important from prior games.\n\nThere is no long term playability to be gained here. Just a hand holding campaign that might as well be on rails for how simple it is. I will try out on the highest difficulty and see if maybe some challenge can be gleaned from this game. Not that challenge is the most important thing but when it feels like all you are doing is balancing numbers to maximise other numbers that then need to be balanced....the game becomes pointless.\n\nI am very dissapointed that I caved and bought this game. Especially at full price. The game is functional and certainly isn't a bad game. I feel that it suffers from that curse of it falling short of being good and even having potential to be great. I would love to see some free DLC that expands the gameplay and gives us more replayability and randomness to the game.\n\nFinal verdict:\nIf you enjoyed Anno 2070 you might enjoy this. I personally was dissapointed with Anno 2070 but still enjoyed it but this has moved further away from the winning formula and falls flat with repetative mindlessness. No challenge, no surprises. Too much constant drivvle being spouted at you by NPCs "reminding" you about the next mission that is pretty much the same as the last.\n\nIf you have anything else to play at the moment then don't buy this game. I would say that it is currently would 20$ at most. Anything more than that and you are not getting enough bang for your buck. Which is a pity because the game has been polished well and has a lot of good production values that should warrant more money to be spent but the gameplay falls down too much for me to suggest purchasing it in good conscience.","November 6, 2015","false","9.2"," 277 of 343 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","277","343","5","6"

W.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robw/","292 products in account","Anno 2205.\n\nAfter playing countless hours of Anno 2070, I was expecting an expanded universe set further into the future set to explain the story of the people that lived on past the troubles of Anno 2070, including trading, land grabbing, and even a whole in-depth complicated tech web.\n\nHowever, I was sadly mistaken.\n\nAnno 2205 does include such things to a very very basic degree that dumbs down most of the key ideas in the game, and only complicating the idea of constructing what materials you need to keep your citizens satisfied, at the same time not over producing so you don't go negative in revenue. As you progress through the game, it slightly progresses in difficulty with multiple biomes that are needed to send even more goods to your one main big city located in a more green environment.\n\nI found that the heating component in the Artic Biome finicky and difficult to build up any sizeable towns, and the moon is forever unforgiving with how expensive it gets. The whole premise is that the more you make money wise in your main city, the cost of manufacturing and fabrication of goods in the Artic and Lunar areas still do not lean you to the negative end of the spectrum. This is where difficulty does offer some interesting challenges, but it can be easily done with a proper strategy.\n\nThe story is boring and other wise useless due to the fact that they hardly explain the lead enemy faction, nor the other competing corporations. Story is very linear, and provides an end goal which defeats the purpose of an end game. At least with Anno 2070, when you were done in a world, you could pack up upgrades and other materials to be launched on a new map. However, in Anno 2205, once you start a new corporation, you are stuck to go through the same old boring speech about being a corporation to build up a huge community spending enormous amounts of money doing so. And lucky you, if you go bankrupt on most difficulties, they just give you more money!\n\nThere is only one upside to this entire game that I must say. Ok. Maybe two.\n1. The graphics look amazing. The massive detail the designers went into is phenominal. If you zoom in on even the closest tiny robot, it shows super high resolutions with awesome animations that seem flawless.\n2. Call backs to Anno 2070. A few side missions will relate to old technology that has been left behind by some of the leading factions in Anno 2070, which provides you materials and resources. Surprisingly, they did it for the most part in a very tasteful way, however I do not like a lot of the actual side quests, most of them being "Attach this small robot and go find trash or kill stuff or collect stuff across the map".\n\nThe fun of exploration and city construction have been severely gutted in this recent installment of the Anno franchise, but probably one of my biggest disappointments yet.\n\nPROS:\n1. Graphics are the best yet seen in any Anno game I've personally played.\n2. Call backs to Anno 2070 seem tasteful and provide small background for those who haven't previous Anno games (Including Anno 2070).\n3. The tutorials were extremely helpful, strangely at times too helpful. I had to turn them off at one point to focus\n\nCONS:\n1. Dumbed down resource management - Resource management is so gutted it seems, that it takes away from the games potential\n2. The story is boring and outright unnecessary - The story provided a very basic idea of what the goal was to "completing" the game, but dragged it along with a few forgetable characters and annoying supporting characters. Combat scenes seem tacky and rushed.\n3. Continuous play / End game hardly exists - Back in Anno 2070, when you got to the end of the game, that meant you were currently researching or finish researching everything in this massive tech web that would support upgrades and boosts to material deposits. This no longer really exists, and the reason to keep going is pointless.\n4. A basic economy with basic production buildings with complicated building placements - The overall idea of building structures was fun in Anno 2070, and it was essential to progress. In Anno 2205, they have decided that "levels" should determine your progress in the game, which can keep you high up in ranks against other corporations....Which I still hardly understand the point of having a leaderboard bracket essentially. Instead of an expanding people across massive lands with different needs, the needs for most in the game are nearly the same except at few times, which lunar is the most different out of them all.\n5. If you suck at the game, they just keep giving you money! (Normal mode and below essentially) - On a specific difficulty level and below, the lead company having interests in your corporation will announce they are worried on your financial situation, and fund you a huge load of cash. This defeats the purpose of even trying to keep positive in revenue throughout the game, because you can just keep rolling in your imaginary cash (Bundles of IOU's).\n\nVERDICT:\nI think Anno 2205 is a game that should be at least tried out through a one time only playthrough, and then you'd grasp the whole concept of the linear games storyline. One playthrough (roughly 20 hours if slow like I was) is all someone would need to realize that this isnt the type of game that deserves $60. Maybe $15-$25 at best.\n\nShould you play it?\nYes, briefly though\n\nWait for Sale, or Buy Right Away?\nWAIT FOR SALE! This game is definitely not worth full price (In my honest opinion)\n\nReview - 5/10\n\n***EDIT***\n\nI would also like to mention the fiasco that was called BETA. You know, that thing that I swear was promised, and never happened what so ever. I know none of us should ever expect something such as that, but I think it would be a really wise decision for the to follow up on their word, and make possible changes that could affect the overall likeability to the game.\n\nAnnnd I didn't see that Anno 2205 will have quite a bit of free DLC, which should be nice, but not ground breaking, probably still not worth it (The $60).\n\n***END OF EDIT***","November 26, 2015","false","21.0"," 172 of 204 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","172","204","5","1"

Wait for sales / additional expansion(s) to play this game. There's no MP, so you won't lose any fun.\n\nThe game LOOKS gorgeous, but compared to previous installation (Anno 2070), there's so many elements that have been cut down from this game, such as:\n\n- Skirmish, Multiplayer mode. You can only play Campaign.\n- Massive command ARK that you can personalize & store items.\n- Events\n- Army. There's no army production or military buildings that you can build. Battle has been seperated into its own mission, away from the base building. And you can only use ships (not even submarines!). And you are stuck with 3 types of ship that you can upgrade (stats only, no visual difference).\n- AI Opponent. In any map, you're playing by yourself! There's no opponent AI, only some static trader AI.\n- Random map. You will be playing on the same map on all playthroughs, 3 different map for each region type (Temperate, Arctic, Lunar)\n- Progression. You'll only unlock some achievement and some MINOR cosmetics for your command ship & corporate logo. That's all. Unlike Anno 2070, where you can customize your Ark, get some rare components for stats upgrade in an island, etc. You will have nothing to do once you can build company HQ except for one-time achievements (in Anno 2070 you can continue playing to get some rare components)\n- Manual resource management. All items produced in a regions is calculated into a total automatically, unlike in Anno 2070 where you have to carefully adjust your trade routes and amounts.\n- No component research. You can't make some upgrade to boost your production / reduce maintenance of buildings in an island like Anno 2070.\n\n\nThen there's some part that annoys me:\n\n- The company HQ doesn't provide any benefits at all, but will need an insanely high maintenance (Credit, Power, Worker).\n- Building location for docks are fixed, as well as locations for mountain / coastal buildings.\n- Building modules for your buildings require special resource that can only be earned from missions / special map project. Really problematic in early game, but not at late game. And different for Temperate, Arctic, and Lunar regions.\n- Resources are shown in net rate, not amount. I can have surplus of +1 of Android (late-game resource) and 400 of it in storage, but I can only sell / transfer it in rate, not amount.\n- Amount of credit that you can hold is limited, based on your company level.\n- You will jump a lot between maps to adjust your production rate. It's very repititive and brainless, BORING!\n- Sector projects are almost only for getting achievement; once you're in late game, their bonuses are small compared to what you can make by yourself. Oh, and the ornamental projects are purely for some ornaments, not even a steady income.\n- Every new game will be the same. Same story, same maps, etc. It will only differ by the game settings that you picked.\n- There are some rival companies, but only for preventing you from buying additional regions. Once your level is above them, you can buy the regions they hold. Only that. No economy sabotage or any of the activitied that the AI used to do back in Anno 2070.\n\n\nBut, there are some parts that I like:\n\n- Resource are counted in rate, so it's much easier to control resource production, especially one requiring many other resources. And it makes transfer to multiple regions much easier.\n- All special buildings for increasing population level as well as warehouses doesn't have radius, but instead provide a constant amount. This adds flexibility to building placement, as well as some realism where I have to build multiple of them in a small, dense population area.\n- Uniqueness of each region type. In arctic, you can only build resident places near factories, and in Lunar you need shield around everything.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nClearly, Ubi wants much larger player base (= MOAR MONEY), and thus this game is streamlined as **** to almost pure pile of ****. There's no depth at all, no sense of progression, almost no online features, no opponents to challenge my company, trading with AI is almost useless, no military buildings, bland army, and some units are clearly reskin of unit models of Anno 2070.\n\nPerhaps, Ubi is cutting down all those elements so they can charge them for additional $$ as DLCs (or expansions. Ubi & EA name DLC as Expansion, as the term 'DLC' has such a bad rep because of them)\n\nFor me, this game is a 20$~30$ game that has really polished looks and animation. THIS GAME DOESN'T WORTH YOUR MONEY. And the saddest thing is that I pre-ordered the Gold Edition and can't refund because I spent hours trying to find additional depths to the game that I couldn't find.

This one is barely worth $25. It's good for one playthrough only and this is not an angry exaggeration.

The goal is to build a generator on the moon.

No more challenges, scenarios, multiplayer, factions, trade, or real combat. It's Anno, with everything that makkes Anno sucked out of it.\n\nThe game is still ok, but $60 is an insane price for what the game is, and locking the rest of the game behind an additional pay way is just disgusting. $20 is probably the sweet spot but that doesn't actually make the game any better, so... choose wisely.","November 4, 2015","false","8.7"," 240 of 309 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","240","309","5","5"

Many of the modes and features from the previous game have been removed, along with multiplayer which was excellent. However, that doesn't mean that Anno 2205 is a terrible game and in isolation I may even have recommended it. The tipping point for me is the price. It's simply too high, and there are several other options on the market that offer a similar experience at a lower price, including the previous game Anno 2070.

But we can't blame them for cancelling it, can we? Seeing how the game is now, the release of the beta would have been an extreme knockout for the sales, because many players, who loved the Anno series for it's not so mainstream features could have easily returned their copies of the game... Oh and of course a large part of the community would already have lost interest in the game even before the official release date...\nSo let me list some pros and cons:\n\npros:\n- (my taste) i relly like the setting the game is in\n- a large number of buildings are well animated and fun to look at ( especially the mines! )\n- the mountains look really great\n- the move tool is useful, but! even on very hard mode *cough* it does not cost you anything at all, which is a joke\n- like the upgrade tool ( easily upgrade many housings at once )\n- ( german synchro ) cool to have some of the old voice actors\n- i actually like that the buildings aren't always rectangular - combines good with the module system\n- i'm not sure yet whether i like or hate the module system. Seems like a revisit of the old field mechanics\n- some hints and easter eggs linked to 2070 and older Annos\n\nWell and now they come - the glorious cons:\n- the combat system is not so funny at all as you are doing the very same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. On 3 different maps. But to be honest, i only visited the combat missions 4 times as they are so booring imo.\n- ok, so i had to get the rare materials elsewhere - let's do some jobs for the replaceable npcs... wah. that is one of the most annoying things i had to face. "Follow that drone, get get that drone and let it kill some ship, get theres goods..."\n- i don't know why, but the assignments are so much more mentally painful then in the previos anno games ( where i sometimes even enjoyed these! )\n- so you actually need to do booring assignments or booring combat missions to get rare materials which you will need to make your production work efficient... ( you also will get some for free when your corporation level advances and sometimes also can buy a little amount of them - but thats way not enough )\n- i really miss the opportunity to build a fleet by my own and cruise them over the map\n- they proudly announced there will be islands with 3 times more building space than in previos Anno games - what they didn't yell out was, that there are just 3 - 5 'islands' per map, which also is way much smaller than the largest map size in previos Anno games. And also : through the indroduction of 'housing complexes' which are basically 4 times larger standart houses, the relative island size shrinks a lot ( basically you don't have more buildings on the island than in previous Anno games )\n- they always told, you won't be forced to to combat missions. So far so bad. Every 5 minutes or so an annoying npc reminds you with the same text over and over that your 'help is needed', didn't find any button to disable these yet.\n- no competition, no random events, no AI ( please don't tell me that that cheap 'this is you and there are the big 5'- screen should be something like competition...\n- of course this is my personal opinion but! there is no AI, no multiplayer ( i don't expect them to implement it ), what is there? only building? not even a single survival aspect? that is defenitely not an Anno for me.\n- the removal of influence radius of the pulblic buildings is bad for city layout. in combination with the not so in line going dimensions of the public buildings, its now the best way to put them all clumped together in an ugly supply block\n- also the public buildings integrate very bad in the cities when there are many post level 2 buildings around - just looks misplaced imo ( was better in prev Annos )\n- the new way they handle the economy systems is to much simplified for me. I really liked that every building produced its own goods in and then had them in their own inventory ready to get hauled by a transport vehicle - I found it good that the production had to spin up to finally run at full capacity( in the previous games ) It created a good element of mini-disaster while already running out of goods...\n- the soundtrack is weaker than in prev Anno games\n- the 'endless-campaign'-combiantion is not really well done. I don't even see any campaign in that, as the sector-projects ( which i think they are talking of at campaign elements ) are again only a series of these already mentioned extremely annoying assignments... ( get dat boat, follow dat drone, bla, bla, bla )\n- i don't see much complexity, but quantity... ( thousands of booring fruit farm buildings to support you 100000s of people... )\n- i see many people writing that the water looks 'soooooooo good' - am i the only one, who thinks that it is a step backwards from 1404 and 2070?\n- the 3th and 4th tier housings in the temperate zone look very low on detail compared to the other tiers\n- reminds me of cities skylines in many moments ( which is bad imo, because i don't want to play cities skylines, but an Anno! )\n- Someone realised that all islands have cliffs? no beach at all? Hurts the look imo\n- i restarted after some hours on medium, because it really felt to easy - actually i didn't feel any game changing difference after starting and playing on that 'hard mode'...\n- oh did i forget to mention that the game is basically dead ( booring ) after ~18hrs ( which is a pitty! )?\n- currently i really regret buying this game, but theres no possibility to return it right?","November 8, 2015","false","35.2"," 121 of 142 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","121","142","7","5"

However, with the launch of Anno 2205, that changed.  I know this is a way for the developers to read about what players think about their game, so I would like to put my opinion out there.  This review is not hating on Anno, however, it highlights differences between this one and previous ones.\n\nNow, I'm sure people are going to challenge my opinion because I have less than two hours in the game(as of launch day).  However, I own almost every other Anno to date, either virtually or hard copy, so I think I have a pretty good knowledge base when it comes to city building, micromanaging, and fully enjoying an Anno game.\n\nOn a good note, the game runs beautifully on Ultra High graphics.  The textures look astounding, from buildings to oceans to mountains.  Anno 2205 is a more casual, new user friendly game compared to other Anno's(1404,1701, 2070), which I assume because the developers want the game to target a wider audience.  However, Anno 2205 feels like a dumbed down version of previous Anno's.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? The challenge of "building a city" is gone in this Anno.  Instead, you are building a corporation to fight for resources and land in temperate, artic, and lunar zones.  Yes, there is still building of houses, managing of energy and money but many of the tasks which made Anno stand out are gone.\n\n-The concept of storage is gone(edit: changed per say), same with overproduction and underproduction.  In previous Anno's, you had to balance amounts of materials you obtained, otherwise you would end up with a surplus or a deficit of material.  If you mined too much or too little, there were repercussions.  Also, This Anno has removed non-renewable resources all together. For example, I can mine coal out of a mine until the end of time, whilst in previous Anno games, you'd eventually run out of coal on one island and need to switch to another.\n\n-Anno 2205 limits the user to where they can build on land zones. For example, You want to build a algae farm(which is built on the coastline). It must be placed on a spot which gets highlighted for the user when they try to build the algae farm.  You cannot choose where the building is placed on the coast like you could in previous Anno's.  In simple terms, Freebuild has been limited.\n\n-This may be the biggest one for me.  No Skirmish or Multiplayer.  For $80, I do not want to play a campaign only.  I enjoyed having the ability to create a randomly generated world to play on.  It keeps the game interesting, as you don't ever see the same map twice.  The Ability to add or delete AI's, and make the game as challenging as the user liked.  Being able to spend hundreds of hours with friends building and cooperating. That is what defined Anno as my favorite city builder of all time.  Without these features, the game will become boring very fast for many players because no one likes repetitive things.\n\nNow, I will be updating this review as I keep playing the game, as I have only played a short amount of time into the game.  If other modes to play are released in the future as well, this review will drastically change.  However, until updates happen and changes to the game occur, I will have trouble enjoying this Anno like I enjoyed the rest of them.\n\n\nEdit 11/3/15(answers to comments, cleared up some things):\nJust some random answers:\n\n"For example, I can mine coal out of a mine until the end of time, whilst in previous Anno games, you'd eventually run out of coal on one island and need to switch to another." Well that was also removed in 2070, so you can't really comment on that\n\n-The player would have to build something(or buy it from traders) to obtain more coal on the island, which means you had to plan ahead for when you ran out.  And it added a miniscule amount of coal compared to what the island started with.\n\n\n"You cannot choose where the building is placed on the coast like you could in previous Anno's. In simple terms, Freebuild has been limited." - I'm not really sure what you mean by this but it's not like you could place buildings where ever the ♥♥♥♥ you wanted in old Annos. Coastal buildings especially only went in certain places.\n\n-Coastal Buildings can only be placed in designated "slots" now. There are no beaches to fill full of fisheries etc. like in Anno 2070.  So I guess you could say its like Anno 2070 crab fishing now, where there were designated areas only for crab fishing.\n\n\n"There was no challenge in anno 2070 either when it comes to managing production and overproduction. All you had to do is look it up online. So in essence I see no problem with removing a bit of tedium of looking up something online."\n\n-I guess I never looked it up online, but by taking it out it still simplified the game too much, at least in my opinion.  And I will be playing this game all today to see what else I can say about it.\n\n"1.5 hours played !!!!!

It's a fine game but as someone who waited 4 months for the game I truly expected more. Especially when I played Anno 2070 before and absolutely fell in love with it. There are so many good features in Anno 2070 have been removed in 2205. To me Anno 2070 is a 9.5/10. Anno 2205 is only 7.5/10. Here are a few things I believe the game missed:\n\n1) Endless/ Skirmish mode: I just don't understand. In Anno 2070, you can customize your game, choose how many islands in the map, pick your opponents and all kind of other stuff. What did they do with all of these? There is actually a "campaign section" in Anno 2070 with many different missions for you to try. What does Anno 2205 have? One single campaign. What the heck was that????\n\n2) The RTS element: I love the RTS element in Anno 2070. You have to save every single bit of your income and material to build your ships. With your army, you can protect your city and trade routes. It all feels so meaningful. What have they done with that awesome system in Anno 2205? They separate it from the main City building game and what we have is a boring, repetitive mini game that I just refuse to do any more after a few mission.\n\n3) Diplomacy: No more diplomacy, no more factions. All characters now basically serve the same function: Provide goods for trades and give you those boring missions over and over again. While in Anno 2070, every character is different and plays a very clear role. Hector was an annoying pirate who won't stop harassing your trading activities. Thor has a mighty army with him and can destroy you with ease. The oil guy, the scientist, the trader, they all serve a very unique purpose. The missions they gave you can have direct impact to your relationships. That awesome diplomacy system was wiped out completely in 2205.

Don't get me wrong, most of the changes they made to this game from 2070 I actually like.\n\nEconomy System\nThey simplified this a lot. Each building tells you exactly how much you produce and exactly how much of which resources it needs. Most people complain about this feature, because they liked having to fiddle with the inputs and outputs of other factories to make the production balanced. I didn't like having to fiddle with them, I like being told how much I need to produce outright, not guessing how much I need to make.\n\nModules\nModules are probably the best addition to this game. Every factory can be upgraded with different modules that do a variety of things: decrease credit upkeep, decrease energy use, decrease worker use, decrease logistics use (I'll get to this later), but every factory has the option of upgrading its production at the cost of needing more energy, credits, workers, etc. It's always more effecient to slap on a production module than to make another factory (but more expensive).\n\nLogistics\nMuch like the economy system, they simplified this a lot as well. They tell you exactly how much "logisitcs" a factory needs when it's put down. This depends solely on how far away it is from the main harbor, or one of your depots. Again, most people complain about this simplification, I do not. In the previous game, this variable still exsisted, it was just hidden from the player and took a massive amount of waiting around and monitering your factories to make sure each had enough.\n\nCommunities\nManaging your population, once again, has been simplified a bit (and made more realistic in my mind). Instead of each building needed by each teir of population having a radius and you have to compact your population buildings into those small pockets, it's more akin to the logistics system. Each housing requires a certain amount of "information" or whatever from different buildings. The buildings that produce this "information" or whatever produces a certain amount. Each housing costs a different amount of this resource depending on how far away it is from the nearest building that produces it (pathing along the roads, not as the crow flies). This is another change that I like.\n\nThe rest of the good stuff\nI lump this stuff in here with no description because I want to leave enough room for what I really want to talk about in this game.\n\nContinents contain different types of workers (previously called corporations: Eco, Tycoon, Scientists).\nTrading routes between islands on the same continent are no longer needed, trading routes happen between continents themselves.\n\nCombat\nAnd now we get to the real problem of this game: the combat system. Here's what I imagined went on at HQ when they were making this game:\n\nThey went through all of alpha and half of beta production stages thinking, "Naaaah, we don't need combat." But when they finally allowed play-testers to play it, they hated it, and wanted the combat back in. So, all of a sudden, they decided, "Well ♥♥♥♥, I guess we do need combat back in there." So they created some horrible, mis-matched abomination of a combat system and shoved it down the game's throat, hoping it wouldn't throw up.\n\nThey messed up just about every facet of combat that I can think of. To start off with, it was extremely confusing to me at first. I spent at least ten minutes searching through all my factories, all my buildings (both already made and those I can produce) looking for the shipyard, or ability to create ships somewhere. There is none. None. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Uhhhh.... wha? Instead of making your own ships, you're given a pre-made set of ships... There's no customization whatsoever. The only thing you can do to change it is level them up once they attain a certain amount of combat experience. THAT'S IT. So you're stuck with what they give you. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible set-up, and it's a pretty well balanced set of ships: a couple of tanks, an aoe burster, a long ranged mortar, and one massive ship. But sometimes, I don't want a well balanced group. Sometimes I want to run in there with one tank and the rest mortars, or all burst damage, or all tanks and one healer (btw, the first mission has an allied cpu healer ship, but you never get one).\n\nOkay, so they messed that up, but what about where you fight? When I was looking for my shipyards, I was also looking for defensive capabilities to protect my cities (turrets, sheilds, walls, etc). There is none. None. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Uhhhh.... wha? Once again, this confused me, until I found out that combat NEVER happens anywhere NEAR your cities. It happens a couple of continents over. When you go to the over-map to view your different continents, you can see combat missions popping up there. You click on it, and it unloads your other continents, and loads that mission map. Each mission is a map in and of it self. If you lose the mission, just do it again, there's no consequence to you or your city. There's 0 fear of failure. They could've made a mobile game with the combat system, and it probably would've been better than the one they ACTUALLY made.\n\nOkay, so they messed that up, but what about the GUI for the fights? Most of the things I've come to know and love about RTS GUIs and have been a staple of them since the very beginning have been THROWN OUT THE WINDOW.\n\nOkay, so they messed that up, but what about the fights themselves? Well, the first misison is pathetically easy. This, I wasn't surprised by, it's the first mission and you're figuring out the combat system. Come to find out, the real reason it's so easy is because of the difficulty setting (the only one unlocked for the first mission is Standard: aka Easy). That mode is way too freaking easy, and gives proportionally less of a reward. Sure, that's fine, don't have a problem with that. The next level, Advanced, is much harder, and requires some tactics employed. It's actually not bad, the first time you play it anyway. Every single mission is exactly the same. Groups of ships path blindly and stupidly through lines of mines that you can easily sneak in there and blow them up with. Or, you can kite them through the mines, saving your combat resources.\n\nYour combat resources include two types of objects: Fuel, and single-use items. There are three uses for fuel: Shield, Repair, and Mines that don't do much damage, but push enemies away quite a distance. There are three single-use items: Missiles, Summon Submarine allies, and EMP. The combat system is pretty well balanced in my opinion, just not very extensive. Once you've played through two or three missions, you've plumed every strategy you can, trying, but failing to make each one different. So it just becomes a grind to do the missions in the end, because it's the only way you can get a reasonable amount of "Rare Elements." You need those materials to create the modules for factories.\n\nCampaign\nThis is the biggest problem I have with this game and pisses me off the most. The campaign is fun, well balanced, and well paced. But that's it. That's the entire game. Just the campaign. There's 0 replayability. And even that, you finish in ~15-20 hours. There's no skirmishes, there's no secondary campaign, there's nothing. The only way I can see them adding any more content to this game is by introducing DLC for it. So, once a-♥♥♥♥ing-gain, they're squeezing their players for all the money they're worth.\n\nRating\nThey made a lot of things easier to comprehend and balance out, which I, personally, like. But they simplified the combat system too much. The game is fun, and it's worth ~$20, not $60. I would've been happy paying 20 bucks for a 20 hour campaign, not 60 with promised DLC to pay more for.","November 11, 2015","false","11.6"," 93 of 110 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","93","110","2","0"

It takes too much inspiration from SimCity 2013 and tries a bit too hard to be original.\n\nThe funnest part of Anno 2070 was micromanaging trade routes and different production chains on different islands, 2205 has way too much reliance on different sectors, which gates players in a negative way.

Instead I was met with a dumbed down ANNO that seems to be meant for beginners or a kiddy pool game meant to entice people who wouldn’t normally play a game such as this. Unfortunately in doing this they have alienated the fan base for this franchise.\n\nKeeping It 100% - The Break Down:\n1. You have 3 zone types. (Temperate, Artic, Lunar(aka the Moon))\n2. You have out of those 3 map zones you get to pick 3 different maps for each of those zone types. (No more random map spawns) This matters little because you can unlock the other 2 for each zone in a single game play.\n3. There is no enemy; instead you get a makeshift mini-game that has you command a small fleet of ships running around and killing everything on the screen, this you play at you leisure as it has no impact other than letting you get your hands on rare materials early in the game and after you reach the Moon you will have no further need or even attempt.\n4. Trade is done automatically and due to there being no enemy to worry about this is just icing on the cake of features removed. (NOTE: You get one ship per zone or in regards to the moon (a rover) this is used to claim areas/ islands and has little use beyond as all resource transport is automatic so you don’t ever load the craft with anything; just move it, click and done.\n5. It works and is a beautiful game but with so many features removed it has the depth of an inflatable kid’s pool and thus has very little replay value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unknownvector/recommended/375910/","unknownvector","Randy Quaid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unknownvector/","338 products in account","This game is getting a lot of hate on Steam, and after 8 hours I have to say that I don't get where a lot of it is coming from. I logged hella hours in Anno 2070, and really enjoyed my time with it. So much so that Anno 2205 rose in ranks to become my most anticipated game for fall of 2015. I guess take into account that I was pretty hyped about this game when reading my review..\n\nFirst off, I only played Anno 2070 in "Continuous mode", and let me say that while I didn't click a button that said "continuous" on the main menu of the game, the default game mode is exactly what I would have wanted out of "Continuous", anyway. A rose by any other name..\n\nThis game is less cumbersome to play than Anno 2070, not necessarily less complex. There is a big difference, in my opinion, between "dumbing" something down and "streamlining" it. Anno 2205 feels very streamlined. It emphasizes the JOY of COMPLEXITY in the interactions I value most (tool chains, the new factory modules, etc.), and deemphasizes the FRUSTRATION of ARDUOUS TASKS we all accepted in Anno 2070.\n\nFor instance, trade routes: in Anno 2205 trading is accomplished by simply spending credits to establish a route. No designating ships, offload/onload procedures and waypoints. The game clearly marks for you what goods you have a surplus/deficit of, and based on that information you can set up a functional trade route in just a couple clicks.\n\nIn Anno 2070 the trade system was a great deal more complex, but not necessarily in a good way. As the systems you built grew in complexity, the complexity of the routing system would also increase, eventually rendering the tools provided by the developer inadequate for the job. The new tools in Anno 2205, and the views of your resource levels / economy they provide, are not "dumbed down", they're just easier to get what you want out of. Did people really love debugging waypoints so much? That's baffling to me.\n\nMaking it easier to get what you want is this game's greatest strength, in my opinion. Frequently, my desire as a player in Anno 2070 would be subverted by cumbersome tools and poor feedback. Now the feedback is much more immediate, and the tools much more intuitive, and as a result I can focus more of my attention on the thing I really enjoy about Anno: making my cities as complex and massive as possible!\n\nI do miss creating a fleet of ships and ordering them around the map to scout for resources, enemies and AI factions, but I don't miss the intrusion of poorly designed combat on my city building experience. I definitely don't miss being bombarded by the dread pirates within 3 hours of starting the game, without fail, but I do miss the random island generation. In this sense, the general structure of the game is a bit of a mixed bag for me, but in the end I'm okay with the decisions made by the developers for the sake of streamlining my experience. They did a great job of maximizing my enjoyment with a couple minor sacrifices.\n\nAs for multiplayer: I never successfully played a multiplayer game of Anno 2070 with anybody who had the time and patience for a marathon session of city building. I'm not sure who plays multiplayer in Anno titles. I was not one of them, and so this is a non-issue.\n\nElephant in the room: I hate uPlay, but I had no problems launching this game. Also, it's hard to criticize DRM on a Steam forum.. it's a bit hypocritical, don't you think?","November 3, 2015","true","29.1"," 249 of 367 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","249","367","7","15"

On the one hand, it's more beautiful, fluid and simple (in a good way) compared to earlier titles. On the other, it's just lacking a lot of things that didn't need to be taken out of the series (so essentially, it's also simple in a bad way).\n\nGot a bunch of spare resources hanging around that you want to sell? If you only have the small-sized transport for taking goods to the global trade market, you're gunna make a loss every time you try to sell anything because of transport maintenance costs. You can't sell directly to other corporations, either, nor can you sell to merchants who are sitting in your region trying to get you to buy their own goods. I would suppose that trade gets easier later on, but by then, you'd probably be bored of the game anyways.\n\nAfter a while, the gameplay gets boring and repetative, too. The combat missions are fun at first, but get repetative and uninteresting. Whilst they do add an extra layer to the game and the later missions become optional, there's not enough that's special about them to make them worth all the features that have been taken out.\n\nAnd do you want to play multiplayer? Sandbox/Skirmish mode? Special scenarios? Tough. The only thing present in the game so far is the campaign. Whilst some may argue that the campaign contains an element of sandbox, there are still quests that you are forced to do to progress and there are no randomly-generated maps, so each time you restart, you're given the same selection of regions.\n\nThe devs evidently decided to change up the series with this one, and whilst they had some interesting ideas, they were simply poorly integrated. Would I recommend it? In its current state, no. But if the devs are smart, they'll realise that there are things that need adding and hopefully add them in the future (even if it has to be via payed DLC). Perhaps one day, this game will become worth its price (or have decreased in price enough to be worth its quality).","November 8, 2015","false","7.1"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","55","65","3","0"

It's a good idea overall but the stored amounts are burried too deeply and the inability to instantly sell excess (and you'll always either have just enough or be making excess) like you could in previous Anno games is a drag.\nThe intra-sector trading and dependence. The game is much more one big living, breathing creature than the scenarios of old. This was clearly a big deal to Ubi, and I think they delivered it pretty well.\nSome interesting mechanics that shake up the city building a bit - biggest of all being the alternate environments like the Arctic, where your factories provide heat in a radius that population buildings require. Also, social services and the like aren't really radius based anymore but quantity based, which allows for some more freeform building which I approve of - the circular radius of influence was always a bit unrealistic.\nHowever, at this point shortly after launch the negatives outweigh the positives, earning this a thumbs down:\nOver-simplification of goods storage. You can see how much you have stored by hovering over the goods display, but there's really not much point to it when you're not able to sell it and there's no real need to move it around other than in an over-time basis.\nThis one's a real killer for me: The population system is TERRIBLE. Gone is the old tax rate system (which admittedly was a bit gamey) and instead the supported population (and tax paid) goes up as you fulfill needs. But here's the killer, unlike previous where you could see how many rights to the next tier and how full overall you were, there's no display for that. You can get a total population display, but that's useless. I want to know how many T1 I have of the current max, how many of those I can upgrade to T2, etc., but that seems to be utterly missing. For an Anno game, this is a cardinal sin and completely unacceptable. This is fixable however, and I can only hope that Ubi will hear the pleas on this.\nThe second major flaw is the combat. I could live with it being off-shored to special "conflict" areas if it was engaging and interesting, but instead it's like a minigame that just eats up time. You have basically no choice in the units other than to upgrade what you have in a linear path, and far as I can tell once you've lost a ship on a particular mission it's gone until you're done (and then it's just back again). The shame of it is, I doubt there's much hope of this changing, since the core mechanic of it in 2205 is so drastically locked away compared to previous versions.\nI'm a pretty diehard Anno fan and I sincerely hope future patches will be enough to switch my review to a "Yes." But as it is now, unless you just about bleed Anno, 2205 is a pass.","November 4, 2015","false","13.6"," 92 of 125 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","92","125","4","0"

While the core supply chain gameplay is still present it has been altered so heavily that it is hard to consider it to be a game in the same series. Yes you still build cities and look over your populations ever growing needs, but its all handed to you. you do not explore islands in search of the resources you need, competing with those around you for the precious space. No in 2205 you are simply given your islands as token progression milestones, and even then these islands are in seperate game states from eachother so you must constantly "switch" between them as you progress, while each island has its own supply chains to look after it feels more like a distraction than expansion. All the progress you have made on your first island is put on halt as you now need a 2nd tier resource from your new island, that requires plentiful supplies from your first to get your second up and running. Active combat has also been moved to its own seperate gamespace as well with no unit production and on a much smaller scale. you now have a small fleet of pre determined waships that gain "experience" as they fight in a similar way to Command and Conquer but much slower.  Even so combat ranges from tedious and nearly mindless to quite hard dependant on the difficulty you choose. However it becomes a game not so much of strategy as it is managing your limited 3 abilities. If you have taken the time to read thusfar thankyou and I assume you are likely on the fence about this game as a whole and while I personaly would not pay for this game, and if given the chance to refund it I would have, But I will leave you with two more likely deal breakers : 1 there is no multiplayer whatsoever as a result of the game's islands being in seperate instances it was decided this would make multiplayer to complex and it was never implemented and has no plans to be at any point. 2 I was able to "finish" the main content in the game (that is to say the main story) in under 10 hours, and this is without some sort of guide or me even being very good at the game, it is just uncharectaristily short of the genre.\n\nThankyou again for reading and personaly if you are craving more Anno after 2070 has become stale I would say just try to grab a few friends and go back to playing that before you pick up this one.","May 9","false","10.0"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","45","51","3","0"

You have no shipyards, ships are provided for free for combat missions and transport ships just cost upkeep. No ships or vehicles present in cities except for cosmetic doodads that do nothing.\n- Huge shift in focus; you'll spend a majority of your time doing missions that are as terrible as ever, fast forwarding the game while your command ship (The only controllable ship outside of combat) does the same gather flotsam/lifeboat/buttplugs missions from anno2070\n- Factions are island specific: no option for where and when you pursue them. Arctic, moon, temperate all have seperate people and production chains but they aren't interesting anymore; since military is cut there are no alternate ships available, and:\n- Island variety is gone; different islands (There are only 3 of each type in the game BUY THE DLC FOR MORE!) have different layouts and mining/fishing spots, but there are no fertilities, no finite resources like ore/gold, they just keep going. Did i mention every map is a single island and you just swap between them? To top this off all factories require population to work so having different islands serve different purposes is no longer a thing; they are ALL cities now.\n- Extremely casual resource management. The game looks like a proper game, but oozes IOS gameplay: basic buildings are built like normal but they require special resources for upgrades that make them more efficient; resources you can get by doing the stupid combat missions, regular missions or buy at a ridiculous price. Instead of producing goods that go in your warehouse, the game's economy operates on the Cities XL formula: Each building produces X amount of tokens and consumes Y amount of other tokens; There's no storage and goods aren't collected by warehouses anymore.\n- Modules/equipment/research removed. A major part of anno2070 was the academies; producing and distributing equipment for increasing finite resources on an island or giving an island certain bonusses.\n\nI've got more complaints and no space.

Turns out after installing it I blasted through till morning and yeah. It was good.\n\nOne of the major complaints I see is that 2205 is dumbed down. I disagree. While at first it might seem simpler, it's not. A lot of people say that the change in surplus/shortage is a change from previous cames, but I also diasgree there. You were always producing a set amount over time, consuming a set amount over time with other buildings, needing a set amount over time to sustain your population's satisfaction. The only change here is you get to atually see the production numbers, you don't have to go to the wiki to figure out what you will produce x units of whatever over y minutes.\n\nThe game starts to become fairly complex fairly quickly, if you're growing your company. Once you get transfer routes, you're going to need to start shipping biome specific items to other biomes in order to continue growing. To support that, you're going to need a healthy population, requring more shipping lanes...and so on. Finding a balance to grow your population steadily without endagering your bottom line is the main component of this game. And I'm happy to say that it delivers a challenge.\n\nIf you want Anno 2070 Part 2, this is not the game for you. 2205 took some risks in changing up the formula, and I think it maintains itself as a very good management/simulation game. Sure, there might not be multiplayer, but if I want multiplayer Anno, I can go play 2070 or 1404. This is not the game I play for that.

When this game was announced, it was the most anticipated game of the year for me, alongside FO4. However, when they started releasing information about the game, I started to be more and more dubious because some key components of the series have been replaced.\n\nNotably, resource management has been very simplified, which attributed to the removal of a big component of the series: logistics. Manual management of each trading ship and scarce resources has been the biggest selling point for me as a fan, but now all of that has been removed. The second is combat and amassing your own great fleet. With the disintegration of combat from the game, 2205 makes it feel like combat is a hassle. Contributing your time in combat serves zero purpose except for getting rare resources. You get zero satisfaction since it's been distanced from your main gameplay. This also means that there is absolutely no purpose for ships; therefore, the power and freedom to make your own ships in your sectors is gone. You are given one ship per sector for the sake of claiming an area and completing quests. That's already half the game gone.\n\nNow, what are the things I like in this game? This is undoubtedly the most beautiful game I've seen, yet. It has a very sleek design with many small details which is hard to be unliked. The quests are a small, but a definite improvement. Not to mention that they have made these changes viable in 2205; enjoyable? Not very much, but viable.\n\nAt the cost of their fans and the integrity of the Anno series, they dumbed this game down for the sake of a broader audience.\n\nAlthough I'm a big fan and will still play this game when the bad heavily outweighs the good, I will give this a negative review in hopes of developers improving the next in the series if there will even be one.\n\nEdit (Additional notes):\n- The pathing is fairly bad, boats stuttering into the cliffs, rovers stuttering into craters. Boats turning unrealistially. They had perfect pathing in previous games, I don't understand why they changed it. Perhaps they had to remake it but were negligent.\n- There are so many beautiful vehicles in this game, but I can't control them, they are just eye candy.\n- The game gets boring early on with the blame on the lack of complexity.\n- Many details that were present in the past are missing: Ability to edit the context menu, Shift queuing visual not shown\n- Modular farms and factories are a very big improvement.","November 3, 2015","false","39.5"," 73 of 106 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","73","106","2","2"

This isn't my first language, but I did bother to write this all up to give a warning for anyone who hasn't already preorded it. This is NOT a clear "BUY IT!", but merely a description of how things have changed, sometimes quite radically, which can be a huge turn-off for those who expect the same gameplay like in all the Anno games before.\n\nShort and superficial summary:\nLimitless ressources. No free harbor building - everything is now confined to slots, just like mines and quarries. Decent graphics. Surprisingly bug free as of now. Small-ish individual map sizes. Less inflexible production complexes but predefined amounts of input/outpot, more individual tinkering and upgrading of buildings with modules. Combat is optional and plays out on separate maps. Also: NO AI BOTS!\n\nI have always been a great fan of the Anno series. Even the fact that the 2 recent games can only be played with Uplay didn't exactly bother me, so no negative review just because of that. I want to exclusive talk about the gameplay experience I had in the first few hours of playing Anno 2205.\n\nJust as stated by the publisher, there have been radical changes to the game as we know it. Certain elements that every game up to this point contained, that provided a coherent structure to the series and were an integral part of the overall gameplay are now gone or replaced by new means production layouts and ressource management.\n\n\nThe first big change: No more storage limits and heavily reduced penalties for low stockpiles. All ressources except a very few building materials are part of a flow dynamic. Overproduction is ok, perfect satisfaction is great (as it means that your production runs efficient), underproduction has an instant impact - although not as heavy like in the rest of the series - and should be avoided. Your civil society won't crumble anymore just because your CEOs are low on service robots... they get mildly annoyed (depending on the amount of underproduction) and tax rates are reduced.\n\nAll buildings either provide or need several of new "ressources" in different combinations: Money (for maintenance and building in the first place), energy, construction components (different types of them, just like wood, bricks etc.) and the new "workforce" (which is basically your population that gets substracted for every new production building). Additionaly, theres logistics, which is used just like workforce, but is provided by what was known as the basic warehouses, which are now dumbed down to simple area-of-effect logistics centers without any (real) physical interaction of drones and production buildings, although this isn't really a bad thing. (Warehouse spam in 2070 because drones aren't fast enough with picking up wares was a minor flaw, which the developers have solved quite nifty)\n\nFurthermore, all non-renewable ressources are gone. You get a certain amount of building slots per map - just like in Anno 2070 - but instead of riverside buildings you can now utilize seaside slots. Yes: SLOTS. No more free building of customized harbor areas. The only limitation to ressource exploitation is the amount of slots for mining and coastal extraction.\n\nThese changes radically simplify the game (HUGE EDIT HERE: in some areas). It feels more like a puzzle: Build this, stress a ressource, build production building for said ressource, something else is now in low supply, build another thing. It is sometimes more unnerving than a challenge, but that's just my personal opinion.\n\nEDIT: I said in my original post that I assume the rest of the game will be quite like the first zone (temperate island). After some additional hours spent with this game, I have to partially correct my statement. The core dynamic of flow-based ressource management doesn't change, but that is no surprise. What does indeed change is the way settlement has to be laid out: Arctic regions recquire placement of houses close to industrial buildings since they need to be heated by thermal "power" which is provided in a small radius.\nA similar amount of rethinking is needed on the lunar colonies, where shields against meteors have to be built.\nAll three (types of) settlements have to be connected by trade routes, since a zone needs a ressource that it can't produce itself - similar to the different islands of the game's predecessors. Trade routes don't come cheap, especially for space routes. This changes the focus of the game more on efficiency management and less precise ressource storage management. As radical as this change is, it does offer a refreshing innovation to the series. This new approach is reflected in the way that production buildings are built. Individual (industrial) buildings can be upgraded via two types of connected modules (each recquiring a special ressource, but I'll get later to that in the combat section) that improve the output or reduce demand on energy, workforce or logistics.\nLess inflexible production complexes that should be closely packed together and basically only work efficiently within a confined ratio of buildings, more precise tinkering with input and output.\n\nNow to a completely different subject: Combat and AI interaction\nIf you don't want to fight, you don't have to. Since you are now mostly alone on your map/zone, there aren't any direct competitors that try to snatch important islands. The other coorporations have their own zones which you can buy for a hefty amount of credits. Your own assets - islands, buildings, trade routes - aren't in any way endangered. Military conflicts are played on separate maps with ships you don't even have to build. As I said, these conflicts are optional. They can provide you with additional special ressources (graphene, irridium, oil) that are needed for upgrade modules. Each conflict map offers a primary goal, mostly just destroying a target. Additionally there a optional targets, which mostly play out the same: Destroy something and then collect stuff, or just collect stuff (and destroy something on the way there).\nAs open-minded as I want to be concerning the gameplay changes, this is my biggest issues with the game. I really like the threat of disrupted trade routes or blockades and the additional ressource management, logistic planning and spending that went into a considerable defence/attack force. As demanding as the overall efficiency management may be, this dumbed down combat puts it all kinda in perspective - at least for more competitive players like me, but there are certainly quite some players who will welcome this change.\n\nAs stated in the summary, the graphics are fine, but not overwhelming. I have a decent, albeit older rig that can run the game on high settings, althoug after starting on the moon (the third zone) my FPS and the simspeed tend to drop sometimes. Since I'm not focusing much on graphics in such games, this is all I can honestly tell.\nTo my surprise, I haven't encountered any bugs and I'm still waiting for my first crash-to-desktop. I had now problems starting or running this game, but maybe I'm just lucky.\n\n\nTo come to an end: I still can not wholeheartedly recommend buying this game. There are a lot of refreshing changes, demanding new approaches to certain problems - which I really like. Parts of the game are so simplified that long time players of the series may regret putting their money into this.\n\nAnd to address some critique from the comments: I am very well aware that 30mins playing Anno2205 won't provide any deep insight into every feature the game has to offer, but some core features/flaws can be accessed in this time frame. I don't need to spend 20-60 hours to write a qualified review on the most basic features. Nevertheless I greatly appreciate any constructive criticism.","November 2, 2015","true","14.5"," 115 of 178 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","115","178","2","53"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bacusan/recommended/375910/","bacusan","Bacus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bacusan/","228 products in account","Greetings fellow gamers.\n\nThis is my 1st review.\nMy History with Anno Franchise:  I have played all of the Anno games since the very first one. I loved every game to the bone, playing more than 500 hours each. I loved the intricate system in which you guessed the consumption of your citizens the trade that you could create, and all of those good things the game had.\n\nUpdate 1.1\n•	As various posters wrote, I check and found that indeed there are stockpiles. What I find lacking is the ability to do something with said stockpile. ATM (I am already established in the Luna zone) I don’t know what to do with my excess, I cannot sell it to an NPC, or let my warehouse sell the items.\n•	More mechanics have appeared, Artic zone compels you to build housing within range of factories, which produce heat. If you do not build the houses within range of heat sources, they will not function at all. This is cool, because it tends to make you fashion towns based on your factories, instead of the usual clump of housing. Luna, on the other hand, needs to have all of the buildings protected with shield generators to “avoid radiation and meteor strikes”. I find this part super cool.\n•	As more your progress your resources take a new spin, mainly you cash turns out to be a rather important item. Factories start to cost 45000 credits, which can be a hefty sum. Heck even housing costs. This makes money way more important than in previous anno games which focused on the goods produced. I still prefer the old approach.\n\n\nAnno 2205:The game is indeed oversimplified, as it was stated on videos by the company. But hell, I never expected the game to be dumbed down.\nAt first glance the first new feature is the fact that the people who work in the city, now indeed work, which is a cool addition, your population now means something else besides taxes. But that’s it. I haven’t found a way to increase or lower tax rates, and now I need to have everything in the island connected with a road. I remember my storehouses connected with the farms and that was it.\nProduction was completely destroyed. You now have buildings which state how much amount of something they produced, (which is cool, but takes away from the tinkering of preview Anno games). So you know exactly how much of a given building you need to get resource “A”. There are NO STOCKPILES, so if you have surplus of a resource it won’t get stored, therefore you cannot sell that resource and trade with NPCs. You may upgrade production buildings with different stuff, such as more production of said resource, less worker/energy/supply maintenance, of course all of these upgrades cost “special materials” which are acquired by doing quests, and/or fighting the warzone maps, I have only experienced one shortage of a product because I rushed in on a quest. Finally resources have been tampered with, rivers are gone, and in with the “coast slots” just a cosmetic change in my opinion.\nFleets are gone, and this surely pisses me off. I’d love building boats, and acquiring defenses for my towns. I remembered popping my first transports creating connections between my islands, well that is gone, the only “trade” in existence now is between the different “zones” (more of that ahead). If Zone A produces more than 5 of “x” you can trade that to zone B. Continuing with fleets, you now have “warzones” or whatever they are called, in which you are provided with an amount of ships and you have to complete a certain target (capture a point, destroy X objective, and so forth). You only interact with your ship by purchasing upgrades for the different models you are given. Fielding a fleet by manufacturing the goods, gathering the cash, and building a shipyard? Yeap, that is all gone. You cannot create controls to you ships, you can select all of them with the TAB key.\nThere is no save icon, or option. I had my brain going nuts about, it Today I hope the save is still there cause in the end I left my “corporation” by leaving the whole game.\nYou got zones now, which are basically the different areas in which you produce different goods. Ala European/Arabic Island from Anno 1404, or Eco-Tycoon/Tech/underwater Island from anno 2070. Thing is they are on a whole different map. WTF? You now have Temperate, Artic, and Luna. So if you need product X produced at Artic on temperate, you go to the “world map” if artic has surplus of said product you select it and create a route to temperate. DONE, no real boast involved no nothing just a few clicks.\nI truly cannot find the challenging layer from other Anno games in this one. It is completely simplified, and not in a good way.\nFactions are gone. No more Ecos or tycoons. Which blows for me, but then again they did announce it on the trailers. Still there are “factions” AKA good guys vs bad guys.\nCombat is simplified, yeap, there is not even that rock/papper/sicsors thing from the lastone. You now have various boats, which surely have those capabilities, but since you never really build up your forces you just horde the enemy slightly smaller horde. After the skirmish you heal up with the “fuel” dropped by the enemy. Rinse and repeat.\nUI is amazing and up to day standards, sleek transparent and cool looking. Graphics are mind-blowing, but I sometimes get stutters I run the game with 16gb a SSD drive and a 290x graphic card. The water physics are cool and everything about the visuals is amazing. There are some in game videos with subpar animations (the people look like they were brought from 2003).\nI could not find any skirmish modes, or some way to play multiplayer, I shall be updating this review with more hours played though.\n\nTL; DR:Pros:\n•	Game is beautiful. And the views are amazing, from the dazzling buildings to the waves in the sea.\n•	UI is amazing, sleek, minimalistic, and very modern\n•	I’d say this game would be OK for someone entering the anno series, it is a very, very simplified version of original Annos,  this of course is a Con for those of us already engaged with the series.\n•	You now know how much stuff is produced from each building\nCons:\n•	No trade, just a simplified version between zones\n•	No storage just positive and negative outputs.\n•	Since you now know how much is produced, for those experienced Anno players, the difficulty depth was taken away\n•	No ships, you make do with what you are given. You can upgrade your boats but that’s it.\n•	To those knowledgeable with other Annos, you will find this game too simplistic, and should avoid it. Stick with the other older versions.\n\nHope this was valuable for you.\n\nWill try to keep playing to get to know the game better.","November 3, 2015","false","19.9"," 176 of 281 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","176","281","2","5"

They did it with Settlers and now Anno. The 2070 I'd call a "perfect game", the jewel. They dumbed it all down in 2205 and just like with latest Settlers they made it a DLC cash-cow.\nIn my opinion there is only one thing that could revive this game and it's RANDOM MAP GENERATOR. It won't bring the greatness back but will pour some replayability in.\nDon't get me wrong. Going to moon and back is pretty good experience but what then...?\nConquer all sectors where the only challenges are one time "project" driven chain quests? This is boring.\nWithour real time resource transport the cities feel just dead. With no constraints this quickly becomes the game of "where is the microchip factory without production expansion". Sad.\n\nGame resembles very much Sim City Societies when you build build build... till it looses all appeal.\n\nI recommend to buy this game. In a year or so, when with all DLCs price will drop below 10 EUR. It's a good one time experience. You can also buy it before, if they include random maps, but I really doubt it wil happen.","April 8","false","74.4"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","33","40","2","0"

I appreciate when a series tries somthing new but in my opinion the devs went the wrong way. First, I couldn't really get my head around what it was, but the more I played, the more it got obvious, that all challenges were missing. The game is for sure nice, if you never played Anno before, but for me it's boring. I went back to Anno 1404 to get the differences and they are enormous.\n\n- you can build whatever you want without any problems in 2055 while every other entry had restrictions which forced you to plan\n- all you do is to wait to get the numbers up\n- the management of resources is gone\n- the "campaign" doesn't has an interesting storyline\n- it feels like the people are always happy even if you dismiss their needs\n- the whole buildings look even more generic than in 2070\n- not much of exploring, trading and routes if at all.\n\nI don't need or ever played MP, so this is nothing negative for me. The whole game simply doesn't feel right, it isn't even close to any Anno game in the series. I am not saying making it more casual is bad, but it got me bored in under 2 hours and I never touched it again.\n\nIt looks good, no question, but looks aren't everything, when the gameplay and/or story isn't getting me interested. If you loved any other Anno game, I can't recomend this one. If you're new to the series, give it a try if you want. For me, Anno 1404 is the best one and since it's only 10 Euros, it might be the better start into the series.","November 8, 2015","false","1.3"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","38","49","0","0"

I love the Anno series, played every single game, Anno 1404 with Anno 1404 Venice being my favourite. However Anno 2205 just simply doesnt compare, it has lost all the main features that made the Anno series fun.\n\nIt has taken me 12 hours to complete the campaign (which is essentially the whole game). No scenerios or custom maps to play afterwards, the campaign is literally the only thing to do in the game. Once youve finished doing all the missions and built all the buildings there is nothing left to do apart from replay the exact same campaign again which isnt really that appealing.\n\nOne of the best parts of the Anno series for me was managing and transferring goods from your different Islands while protecting yourself from rivals with fleets and armies like in Anno 1404. That gameplay has been pretty much removed and all thats left is a peaceful and rather dull city building game where there is very little challenge.\n\nAfter completing this game, all I really want to do is go back and enjoy Anno 1404 and even Anno 2070 which was like a futuristic upgrade, Anno 2205 however just feels like an entirely different game... with beautiful graphics.","November 5, 2015","false","12.5"," 45 of 62 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","45","62","0","0"

I spent 16 hours looking for content, did everything I could possibly do in the game, which at that point got pretty repetitive, and the game has nothing left for me.\n\nPersonally, I didn't mind the changes from previous Anno titles. I'm glad they tried taking the franchise in a new direction. However, this game has the depth, complexity and challenge of an iOS title. The combat was laughably easy (seriously, another nuke? there's 5 on the board and I'm max'd out as it is! Well ok then, nuke everything!) and because it happened on a different map than your city, there were no consequences to failing. You don't even have to build your ships you fight with. And there were 3 missions. THREE. That's it. And they constantly repeated themselves. Over and over. Exactly the same.\n\nAnno 2070 is a far superior game. Maybe after a year or two when they've bloated this title with another $150 worth of DLC (or, you know, finished it) it'll be playable. As it is right now, I can't recommend it.

I had no problem spending $90 (CAD) on the gold version, provided there were no micro-transactions. I was really excited about 2205 but after playing it, I cannot recommend it. The start of the game is easy and boring. Sure, it gets more complex as you go but it's not as fun as previous titles. The game forces you to bounce between sectors to manage production chains but first you have to wait for that sector to load first. Oh and if you want to optimize those chain, you will be waiting for those sectors A LOT. Plus, the games sector map lags and drops frames when you are loading into a sector. So you get to hear an NPC stutter about a quest they want you do. I keep telling myself it will get better after a few more hours, but it doesn't.\n\nIn my opinion, there are some changes for the better, but boy are there a lot of changes for the worse. Let's start with the negatives. They dumbed down Anno 2205 A LOT. Production chains have been shortened and there are now less. Setting the difficulty to Hard does not make the game hard, it only slows you down. You cannot fail unless you try to. No one in this game can touch you. The AIs can do nothing to you, they are only there to give the illusion of competition. There are no fires, floods, pirates or disasters of any kind. There are unlimited resources. Apparently, the future is a perfect world. I remember the devs talking about how no one wanted fires, floods, pirates or disasters of any kind, people only wanted to build a city. News flash, you could turn all of those off in prior games! If I wanted to only build a city I would do that in Cities Skyline!  No wonder they canceled the beta. The Crisis Zone is a joke, you can run in lose all your ships and they just get replaced next time for free. You cannot customize your ships but rather press the upgrade button to “level them up”. All of your actions in this game have no consequences.\n\nThere are parts of this game that are interesting. Such as in the arctic, we have to heat homes with the heat radius of production buildings. The modules are interesting as you can get perks with global elections. The ability to move buildings is nice.\n\nThere is only one way to play this game, just keep expanding. In previous Anno games, you could play different scenarios such as “residents pay no taxes, earn all income from trade”. These scenarios were very interesting and provided much replay value. In 2205 there is no replay value, you build up your corporation, that's it your done. There is no sand box mode. There are no random seeded maps. You can only play the campaign which doubles as the tutorial. I could go on and on about this game but I think you get the point.

When i examine the store page i see that many people are disappointed in anno 2205. and it has the mixed user review status. I personally feel that this is not entirely fair so i would like to dedicate this review to replying to some of the more common complaints made by people in other reviews. Now before i begin: i would like to point out that i greatly respect your own opinion but i also ask of you to respect mine.\n\nStarting out: many people compare this game to anno 2070 (the previous game in the anno series). This is ofcourse understandable and i think that noone will disagree with me when i say that a person who is expecting a new version of anno 2070 will likely be disappointed because it is not anno 2070.\n\nHOWEVER: we should ask ourselves: does that make this game, a bad game? well opinions seem to differ on this but i, myself, would say no.\n\nThis game is not a reskinned anno 2070, it is a whole new approach to an existing genre. I like some of it but i also dislike some of it. Overall however i really like this game, with my current play time i have payed about 50 cents (gold edition) for an hour of playtime which i feel is an acceptable price.\n\nSo let me begin:\n1) The storage system: i hear from people that they dont like the "ratio" based storage system, which they feel is shallow.  i can understand it if you would prefer a "absolute"based storage system but in previous anno games i found myself using an implicit rating system where i increase production if my production of good X if my storage was decreasing. If you feel that making this system explicit is making the shallow then that is your opinion however i strongly disagree.\n\n2) the transport system: the system used to manage trade routes is different where you no longer have to build ships, instead you hire then. i agree that this made inter sector transport simpler to manage but there are also differnt oportunities for optimizing. For example: a load just to big for a small ship can better be transported in 2 small ships then 1 big ship.\n\n3) Lack of rts play: compared to anno 2070 perhaps there is less rts play, however for me anno has always been a city builder, not an rts game. If you want a rts game then there are plenty of better alternatives here on steam that are cheaper then anno 2205 or anno 2070.\n\n4) no random map generator limits replayability: well if you feel this way then that is understandable, however the random map generator of anno 2070 was in my opinion verry disappointing where maps generated under similar settings are virtually the same except for maybe their exact position on the map. the maps in anno 2205 however are hand crafted and are actually different from eachother.\n\n5) A common complaint on the forums is "i can go afk for a week, come back and my town is still ok" This is true, however the same could also be said for the older annos. For example: my building strategy in anno 2070 is one of stability, in fact the only thing i have to do in order to keep my cities running is to make sure i have the raw materials, which practically boils down to using those silly "drill" things to make sure i can pull enough copper out of the ground...\n\n6) no multiplayer. Yes, this anno game has no multiplayer (yet). and people seem to be really on the fence about this. I myself am not that interested in anno multiplayer because most of my games take a workday of playtime before they start to get interesting. For the people who hold off on buying this game i would say: how much of the time (relative in this case) of your total play time will you actually spend in multiplayer? is this 50%? or 5%? and if it is 5%, is it still that improtant to have this feature in this game?\n\nAgain: This is not meant to critise the opinions of others, it is meant to formulate a reply (with my opinion) to some of the things people have pointed out in their own review.\n\nSummarizing:\nI have played both anno 2070 and anno 2205 and i like both games. Now if you wish to go for the more rts-y experience i would recommend anno 2070, however if you want to go for the city builder experience then i would recommend anno 2205.\n\non a sidenote: ubisoft recently released a survey in which they ask for your opinion on how they can improve this game. I would urge everyone who has tried this game to participate so the game can be improved. links to this survey can be found on the steam forums.\n\nthank you for reading my review","April 8","true","140.5"," 53 of 79 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","53","79","0","2"

So I say this with a heavy heart, I can't recommend this game. It's actually quite literally a heartbreaker. The initial views as improvements to the game quickly reveal themselves as limitations.\nThe over simplication of the interface and build options ultimately take the best and most fun aspects out of the game, removing it's soul, leaving a nice looking emty shell. Babies very first builder is the new game engine here. An extremely acedemic, unchallenging, repetetive, builder with very basic resource management aspects, that feels intent on capturing a five year old audience. I feel even this age group would tire relatively quickly actually.\nGone are the days of infinitely variable module builds for ships and warehouses from Anno 2070, just gone. Replacing them are a few modules to add, that one quickly realizes are useless save for one. The lack of "randomly" generated map seeds was the first sign of the end of well...fun. Which to be honest in prior there were a regular series of maps that would turn up, with small variations in resources per island, but it still remained fresh per your choice of landing sites, etc. That is gone also. We have the same stock locations of warehouses, stock maps, stock, simple, everything...everytime. Those glorious functional docks you custom built and admired, spent hours watching...nope. You get a dock to connect to other maps. Period. Want to let your city grow organically, fight your citizens for resources for fun? Nope...you only manually upgrade residential buildings. You can flip them around and move them to make them looks slightly different or line them up in nice looking patterns.\nThe trading system is so simple it's virtually pointless, woops forgot to build something and supply is down? Click, build, trade, buy, done. No challenge besides knowing where to click, which thank you for simplifying and improving that one aspect devs, right...back to it being totally unchallenging. The addition of multiple maps and of course the highly anticipated off world  moon aspects lose there novelty almost immediately when you realize at the heart of this release...is empty space...to build on. Had this been executed a bit better, with even the slightest nod to the depth most hoped for, in terms of retaining or expanding upon key aspects of prior games that have remained a pillar of gameplay, those that kept us coming back, Anno 2205 could have been a truly amazing chart topping game. Sadly, it is not, it looks very pretty, but this is a pretty face on a boring, souless, repetitive, unchallenging, all too easy to manage city builder. There's no rush, no panic, just a couple clicks and you are all set.\nThere are no playing of factions against each other, no sudden unexpected game changing attack, just one enemy and he plays into things off screen in the form of easy challenges. There is also no mad dash to grab territory before a rival gets to it, you have the whole world whenever you feel like getting to it, to build more of the same boring stuff, over and over again, to have a bigger population, just to have one, no point beyond that, no super builds or achivements beyond what you get early on.\nYour one enemy is entirely weak and two dimensional, he wants the moon. Great, have it, you appear to be on the dark side as I've never seen a city or base of yours, I've got too much space to build there for no point anyway, have some of mine, please. He never goes on the offensive against your cities and you can't attack him directly (simple in prior incarnations, but simply fun!), you just fight him for achievements in the form of limited and marginal ship improvements which are accomplished all too quickly...to fight him again and again on the same challenge maps, same ship placements, same objectives, now very easily won. You can turn down fighting him with no consequences besides not getting anymore ship improvements...the ones you already got 20 battles ago. The naval battle mechanics WERE nicely improved, BUT...they are now called to task in repetitve predictable challenge map battles. Nothing close to home, where it might be fun. Not much in the way of signifigant early gain to no gain mid game. From mid game...there is no end game or even anything that can be called climactic or intruiging...just get to a point where you can't build anything more or improve anything, have a billion billion dollars with nothing to buy, can't even build units, step back for a look at the series of clicks it took to get there. Game over. Unless simply clicking on maps to enjoy the sterile pretty views of things without a threat or care in the world, maybe shift a farm a space over to add a useless module, swivel a building that looks like all the pretty others, provides unlimited entertainment for you. Maybe it does. The whole game is an incredibly easy sandbox, without even the challenge (huge aspect of replayability in prior) of a changing landscape to build on. If anything, this edition is a depressing encouragement to go back to others in the series, to find again what I love about quirky micromanagement, creative use of limited space, characters and drama that felt 200 times more immersive than this game. The thing is, every challenge removed, this game is trying to be a builder, but it is not interesting enough to sustain that shift. It simply can't remotely touch a Cities Skylines in terms of shere content and creativity or even (shudder) Sim City 2013 in terms of management. So why the heck even go there? The game was great, why take every thing except the builder aspects about it that was great away? It's like keeping the super sweet frosting and throwing away the cake. I fear even a very substantial, even game changing, series of overpriced DLC will not save this sad, sad state of affairs. Unless...imagine for a moment the DLC was opened to users? Impossible I know. Imagine an Anno 2205 that goes the way of a Banished community? I know it's delusional crazy talk, it can't happen, but imagining it is more fun than this game.","December 11, 2015","false","124.5"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

In Anno 2070 I loved being a production powerhouse, setting up intricate trade routes, and maximizing profit.  That is all gone in this game.  In addition to missing a core part of gameplay, there is another implication: the only way to increase revenue I can see is to build more residences.  Meaning you need more resources, meaning... well you get it.\n\nIncome quickly became the blocking resource for me.  Hey you reached the moon! Awesome, wait I built 4 buildings and I am out of money...  So I guess I wait, or might as well do some...\n\n2) Military missions are jacked and basically forced upon you.  The gameplay in these missions is really basic and requires little strategy.  That wouldn't be an issue, except the primary source of numerous critical resources are in the missions.  I don't like having side/mini games forced on me, especially when they are time intesive and boring.\n\n3) Static maps.  After thinking about the above for a couple days I decided to launch a brand new corporation and go in with a fresh perspective.  Hey that first map I chose with the dams, yeah it's the same as the last one.  Same maps over and over means no replayability for me.\n\nIf I could sell this game at a retailer today for some money back I'd take $20.","November 5, 2015","false","8.0"," 39 of 56 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","39","56","0","0"

Or maybe I can? I don't know yet, but I bet by the time I post this crap, I'll have made up my mind.\n\nEither way, this game has a lot, and I do mean A LOT, of issues. I'm gonna do here what I did with SimCity 4 vs Cities Skylines. COMPARE THE LIVIN' SHÏT OUTTA THIS STUFF!\n\nFirst off, let's look at building stuff. 2205 DEFINITELY has improved over 2070 on that point. I liked 2070 fo' sho', but göddämnit, building cities in it was a freakin' chore! Just trying to plan out the whole "making room for more police stations end-game" crap was focking infuriating. Now, with 2205, you have a LOT more freedom about where and how you place these sorta buildings. Now, you can move buildings around (don't ask me how they thought this made sense in-game-wise...) so accidentally miss-placing something is no longer a rage-inducing mistake.\n\nNext up, let's look at the whole "citizens and upgrades" thing. This, unlike point #1, is not a pure upgrade (no pun intended). Granted, it's become an extreme lot easier and more fluid to attract new citizens to your city, as the amount of people a house holds is directly connected to the general satisfaction level of that type of citizen. These numbers aren't necessarily correct, but here's an example formula: your level 2 citizens have a satisfaction level of 50%, which means all level 2 residences holds up to 50% of their maximum capacity of citizens.\n\nYou can also "promote" (i.e. upgrade) new residences just a moment after they've been built, unlike in 2070 where you had to wait almost a minute or more before you could upgrade them after you established a new housing block. So that's nice. What ISN'T nice, however, is the fact that it's now almost IMPOSSIBLE to keep your citizens well-fed and hydrated while expanding your city. Every new house you build is another strain on your rice fields and desa-whatever plants, and every citizen you attract is a fraction less surplus of food and water.\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue in 2070, since IRONICALLY, the ISLANDS WERE A LOT BIGGER IN 2070, BLUE BYTE! Focking retärd devs needs to learn what "five times bigger" really means. Idiots, the lot of 'em.\n\nAnyway, on to issue #3! And this is a direct DOWNGRADE from 2070, imo. The islands. When you start out, you're restricted to the choice of ONLY THREE DIFFERENT ISLAND REGIONS. That's right, no more slight-but-still-refreshing randomly generated islands. From here on out, it's STRICTLY pre-rendered and pre-built islands for you to settle! Now THAT, if anything, is what would've been a HUMONGOUS deal-breaker for me, if those cünts at Ubisoft had told us this before release.\n\nI mean, okay, the islands you DO get to choose from are interesting, with the chiefly intriguing one (so far) being Walbruck Basin (seen in screenshots as the place with the dams). It's cool. And I like being able to actually perform quests in the game which ACTUALLY GIVES A USEFUL REWARD. Because most quests don't even give you a remotely useful or even NOTICEABLE reward. Money? "GEE, THANKS UNCLE NIC! IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GENERATING THOUSANDS OF CREDITS EVERY MINUTE, AND HAVE A COMPLETELY ARBITRARY, BÜLLSHÏT CAP AT A MEAGER 1M CREDS!"\n\nMoving on. Thing #4. The economy. I like the new stream-lined system, I really do, and actually, there's no "but" here either. The system is no longer based on having 8,000 depots near your rice fields so that you can have a constant focking flow of rice into your warehouse like in 2070. Now, it's based on a new tertiary resource called "logistics", and this dear kids is what I REALLY liked: You no longer have to build depots! HOORAY!!!\n\nSeriously though, ANYONE who played 2070 for more than 30 minutes remembers the EXTREME displeasure of having to CONSTANTLY establish motherfocking 20 BILLIONS depots on an island, just to keep the infrastructure running smoothly. It was a CHORE. Now, you build transport terminals instead. And what really tickles my economical strategy strings here is that if you position one JUUUUUUST right, you suddenly make it worth more than THREE of them placed in shïtty locations.\n\nAgain, these things work like the whole citizen satisfaction thing. Actually, no. Not really. The closer a transport terminal is to an industry building, the less of a strain is put on the logistics resource from that building. So planning is important. Goodie goodie! Me likey!\n\nLast but not least, #5: Politics. 2070 had a really cool political niche. I liked it a LOT. It made you feel very involved in what happened in the game. The senate/council votes, the Nordamark Conflict, it all made for a very "global" feel of the game. And the fact that no one made a huge impact made it even more involving. You had the sense, even if you were only ever playing it in SP, that you were part of a whole WORLD of players.\n\nBut that's completely missing from 2205. There are no votes that makes ANY kinda sense any more, and "events" are nowhere to be found either.\n\nOn the plus-side, you're now free to create your own corporation instead of being restricted to just the EI or GT like in 2070. So that's... actually no, it's not nice at all. It's actually a very dull and restricting experience, considering the vast dichotomy between EI and GT in 2070. They had completely different playstyles, whether you played industrial-economical, domestic focus, or even just militaristically. Now, your playstyle is blended into a gray goo of generic "Do what you want, game doesn't care" style. It detracts a LOT from the game.\n\nSo I guess, in closing, 2205 is not much like 2070. Actually, it's nothing like 2070. If you're new to the Anno series, and 2205 is the first to tickle your fancy, go for it! Maybe. Actually, don't. I regret spending a massive 60€ on this game by pre-ordering it, so I won't recommend it yet. But once it's dropped in price, then yeah. Go for it! ...maybe. 5.1/10","November 5, 2015","false","16.2"," 50 of 76 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","50","76","3","0"

Huge mistake!\n\nIt's not all bad: beautiful graphics, and interesting gameplay ideas. Unfortunately it stops there. The ideas that have GREAT potential to take the Anno series to the next stage falls flat on the proverbial belly as the main thing with the previous Anno installations - the resource management system - has been dumbed down to being litterally non-existent. I can appreciate the presentation of goods as being in surplus or lacking, but only as a complement to the classic warehouse balance. Lacking this makes the business of trade virtiually impossible, and the previously charming micro management of goods completely absent!\n\nThe business of transporting goods from one place to the other, calling for careful planning of where to put the different production facilities in relation to each other, and warehouses in relation to everything else has also been dumbed down, taking the fun of settlement planning away completely!\nYou can just plop your buildings just about anywhere, and it makes no difference at all.\n\nApart from this, there are a number of balancing issues I hope will be addressed by Ubisoft soon enough, such as me trying to settle the moon without Titanium Plating. The thing is it takes Titanium Plating to settle a crater, but it can only be produced by the space people persons in their little titanium plating thingy! If you're lucky you can find some crates lying around on the surface, but my last playthrough I did not and had to start a new game - having to replay tedious hours of no-fun-at-all resource non-management.\n\nFinally, and the biggest nail in the coffin for Anno 2205 is the lack of both skirmish and multiplayer modes!!! Who, in their right mind, releases a game in 2015 without a multiplayer mode!? And since we now have been deprived the replayability provided with a skirmish mode the game sort of... ends (if you find yourself lucky enogh to actually settle on the moon).\n\nSo! If you want the feel of an unfinished game without ANY of the features that made the Anno series awesome up until now, please go ahead and buy this game! Otherwise DO NOT!!! Sorry, Ubisoft: this game is not living up to expectations... You can do better!\n\n/Mike","November 5, 2015","false","20.7"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","0"

That said, it's not what I expected from an Anno game. Anno has traditionally been a game that's heavily based on trade within the map you're playing on. In this game you trade between maps akin to Sim City 4 but with far better control and much more intuitive interface. It is very unfair to compare the game itself to Sim City 4 however as this game has nowhere near the number of gameplay issues that one did. That all being said, I have very much enjoyed my time playing the game withstanding a few minor annoyances.\n\nPros:\n*large maps, ability to jump between regional maps makes production chains a breeze.\n*great graphics.\n*intuitive building system, does not punish you and allows movement of buildings later in the game.\n*easy production chain monitoring\n*awesome soundtrack\n*Temperate cities are awesome and fun to build.\n\nCons:\n*No Multiplayer.\n*Battle maps are stupid. It feels like a mini-game. I want to defend my trade routes, I don't want to play a battle on a random map.\n*Logistic System.\n*non-Temperate cities are literally just for the production chains and lack any depth in terms of building.\n\nI'm going to just comment on the logistic system quick as I think this is the major issue I have with the game. In all the previous Anno games you had a warehouse, you needed to set up trade routes, and you were always monitoring how many supplies were in your warehouses on each of your islands. That is completely gone from this game. Yes you can trade between maps, but to be honest you're just balancing the number of goods flowing into the areas and if you're like me you have no idea how many actual supplies are anywhere at any given point - which sucks because that was what was fun in the old games!\n\nNow although this isn't exactly what I was expecting from an Anno game, since I wanted something where I was establishing trade routes, playing with friends, defending trade routes, and colonizing islands (notice how many times I focused on trade there) - I won't say I regret my purchase. They've made a decent game here and I did enjoy my play time - in fact I'll probably continue to play it. The lack of multiplayer, the uninteresting “city-building” in non-temperate regions and the changes to the trade aspect of the game are definitely a bummer, but perhaps there is hope these will be added/fixed in the DLC – though it’s also sad I have to say that. If you’re looking for a game that’s fun to play, has a decent storyline, and has some new ways of tackling city-building, I would recommend this game. If you’re looking for an Anno experience, go with one of the older ones until this goes on sale.\n","November 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 73 of 119 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","73","119","0","1"

After beating the game, I found myself bored and done with it.  I started with the highest difficulty so it took me awhile to beat it, but it was still fairly easy since the only pressure you get the whole game is from the people whining at you to complete the combat mini games.\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous graphics  (The one thing they did very right)\n- NPCs look much more human (Not as cartoony as before)\n- Industrial output is clearly defined (Less guess work)\n- Your population actually works in your factories and such!\n\nCons:\n- No multiplayer or even single player skirmish\n- I liked EVE way more than ADAM\n- Combat is stupid since you are just about always on offense\n- Overpriced\n- Forced to maintain online connection to use certain features, lame...\n\nThis doesn't feel like an Anno game, this feels like an almost casual sim...  No urgency, no rush, no worries about hostile takeovers, nothing really that inclines you to play aggressively.  Taking away some of the best parts of Anno 2070 such as multiplayer and random island generation really hurts this title.  I don't want to play the campaign over and over...\n\nIt's still a decent game as it is, just disappointing if you're an Anno veteran, and Uplay is just a pain to deal with most of the time.  I'd wait until it goes on sale or try Anno 2070 instead if you're new to the Anno series.","November 5, 2015","false","27.5"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

This is a prime example of the saying "Try to please them all and end up pleasing none!". Too many compromises of the cornerstones that defines the Anno series.\n\nPros:\n* Very nice and detailed gfx\n* Multisectors is nice and like the basic idea, however it lacks depth.\n\nCons:\n* Crysis sectors, because a few loud mouths didn't want combat in their main sectors (risking their buildings when they didnt plan the defences properly) - Instead of making it an toggle in the options menu they added it arcade style in separate sectors with a shallow objective with the rewards of some rare resources thats needed to upgrade the factories and you want to do that so repeat the same booring missions 20 times over.,.. a day at work is more entertaining. (Try to please all....)\n* No planning needed - The old system where some planing was needed to have a sucesseful colony is so dumbed down a monkey would have a fair chance to win the game at its highest difficulty by just hammering the mouse. (Try to please all....)\n* Warehouse placement is gone, now the player have some pre-assigned spots.\n\nDont get me wrong, the graphics are easiley the best of this type of game but what point is nice gfx when the soul of the game is gone.\n\nI really hope the Dlc's / Expansions will add depth!","January 1","false","52.8"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

Which is a shame, because up until 2015 Anno was the only series that Ubisoft hadn't ♥♥♥♥ed over.\n\nGiven that I've only played 1.3 hours on this account at the time that I'm writing this, I need to clarify; upon pre-ordering this game, I literally was unable to get it to work. I could have seen this coming and refunded the title if there was some sort of beta *cough* given to pre-order customers, but Ubisoft doesn't have that sort of foresight.\n\nSo, I went and played it on a friend's laptop. Did it work? Yep. Was it good? LOL, nope. This game is barely similar to Anno 2070 - only aesthetically can you see a tie-in. This feels more like SimCity for babies. I've never said this before, but Anno 2205 is insultingly simple. In previous titles such as 1404 and 2070, a certain degree of actual strategizing and thought was required, and the replay value was massive. In 2070, for example. replay value is constant with the everchanging world events and randomly generated map scenarios. In 2205, there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ campaign-type thing and build plots that never change. It's baffling how much of a down-grade 2205 is.\n\nThis game helped me to decide to NEVER give a cent of my money to Ubisoft ever again. Anno is honestly a much softer example of how terrible they are as a publisher. If you want a really good example of how awful Ubisoft is at publishing titles and releasing games that actually work and are complete, go look at the Assassin's Creed series. It's embarassing how terrible Ubisoft is at delivering new content. They either change nothing, or change everything in a bad way.\n\n2/10.

A simliar 'hub' system that the revamped sim city uses for its missions.\n\nTerrible disappointment. Several hundreds of hours on the previous Anno games, can barely bring myself to play this because its a point and click to build here and here with minor space management issues. Not challanging or fun at all.\n\nEdit -\nFor a few comments. "Haven't played enough time." Clearly some of you do not know what the steam refund policy is, as a gentlemen in the comments stated, this is not a valid arguement. I shouldn't have to play a game for over 2 hours or more to be convinced to play it. This is not an Anno game, this is a revamp and really brought down game. Which, ubisoft to their credit, did warn at E3 they were 'going to simplify it." Its not the Anno 2070 you are looking for, and its not worth its current price.\n\nI also have over 300+ hours on Anno 2070. So yes, I am very familiar with the anno games and their complexity.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jmaurina/recommended/375910/","jmaurina","jm4music","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jmaurina/","194 products in account","To be honest I really enjoyed the first couple of hours of gameplay.  The visuals, like usual, were quite nice, the game ran smoothly (for me) and it was overall quite pleasant.  Then I hit about 6 hours in and I unlocked the Lunar base and was pumped.  But it was just downhill from there.  I had hoped with the greatly simplified UI (if a bit perplexing at the start) that the tediousness of the last Anno would be fixed.  Wrongo.  If anything with multiple 'settlements' the micromanagement was intensified.  The supply chains, to me, are useless.  Produce something at colony X send it to colony Y and since colony Y doesn't pay for it I get a net loss.  So then to help offset the huge costs to start a lunar colony (and the artic to a lesser extent) I figured that if I shipped resources to the world market (or whatever its called) I could use that as a means to develop my colonies more.  NOPE!  Even selling resources on the world market cost me to sell it.  The only way I made a profit was to sell 1000+ units of the item.  Completely stupid and baseless (not to mention improbable).  Short of dumping a huge amount of time and effort to overdevelop my starting colony I couldn't make enough to make my lunar colony sustainable.  Which then made it impractical to send the resources I was producing back to Earth, which made my people mad, which made me less money which made me shut off more things.... just sprials.\n\nPros:\n+The simplified UI does help in many regards (more on this later as this is a cusory pro)\n+Introduction of a Military into the game was a nice touch, if not implemented all that well.\n+Interesting factions, even if your relationship to them is fixed and therefore meaningless\n\nCons:\n-While hardly known (at least recently) for telling a story, the campaign of the game is hollow and feels more like a checklist and less like a way for the game to get me involved.\n-The factions are hollow are offer nothing to the game other than different people.  You can only buy items from them, but cannot sell.   You could lump them all into the group of 'Other' (with the remaining factions being us and them) and you wouldn't miss a thing.\n-MIlitary integration feels like an afterthought and like you are hired as a contractor to help with someone elses problems rather than managing the military aspect directly.\n-Missions are bland and often are 'go here, pick this up, bring it back, get resource, rinse and repeat'.\n-Feels more like you took the previous game, reskinned it and made me pay for it again.\n-No replay value (in my limited opinion)\n-The UI while it looks pretty is just strange.  When tabbing between the different menus (population types for instance) I would expect to see only buildings unique to that population showing up.  IE:  The worker tab has worker buildings, the Exec tab has exec buildings, etc.  Nope.  When tabbing between the two (which when you first get the second tier population you spend time looking around to figure out how to start building the 'tier 2' (if you will) buildings as it is not explained) it seems the whole bottom row comes with it.  After the first couple of times you figure out that those buildings are common buildings but the level of detail in the menus are just nonexistent or just not explained (starting to see a trend?).\n-Speaking of level of detail, playing as a CEO of a multi-planet corporation, one would think that details would be in abundance.  I like games Distant Worlds for instance where there is an immense level of detail always a click away.  If I want to know something I can find out but the game doesn't innudate me with detail otherwise.  Anno gives me little to no details on very important things.  Like on the lunar colony for instance, I built a maintenance center and my income dropped for 17K to 9K.  Uh, how?  If this building is going to cost me 8K to maintain a little heads up would be nice!  Sure I want to know how much resource this thing is going to cost me but without mula, resources (Which again cost more to sell than you get by selling them) are useless!\n-A little more about factions:  The other companies are useless.  They are more like obstacles between me and new regions rather than a competing factor.  You could delete them from the game and miss nothing.\n-This game fails to innovate in almost anyway.  It is standard now for games of this type and supposed caliber to improve on old systems and to experiment a bit.  We got the experimenting bit with adding new regions (which is done well, to be fair) but all the old systems are just reskinned.  Public opinion seems like an after thought (if you even pay attention to it), decisions (which are 'lets pick a company to vote for', more on this in a moment) are pretty much pointless, the global market is broken, I can't monopolize on having a fricken SPACE ELEVATOR!  Apparently space elevators are only for this global company/government (confused?  So am I) and security centers cost more to maintain (seriously?), etc etc.  Just poorly implemented systems that have the exact same failings as the previous Anno.\n-Decisions.  I can't think of a reason why I would vote for these things.  They seem to give no real benefit (or it is so poorly implement [and not explained, period] and so transparent and ineffectual that if you don't vote then who cares!).  Plus I am voting for other companies.  First of all, why?  Why would I vote for another company?  I mean seriously!  Second of all, I am a major corporation, why am I not included?  Why are they included?  Why why why why.  Oh, and are votes a daily thing?  Weekly?  ummmmm, yeah, idk.  I just went back every once in a while and it was like 'and this was the outcome, vote again!'  Thanks but no thanks.  (I feel like there is a trend here)\n-This game feels like everyone created their own systems and didn't talk to anyone else.  Just plain pointless.  SAVE YOUR MONEY\n\nBut all in all, I have little playtime so I would take that into account when reading this.  Maybe things change as you play more but, at 8.6 hours, I feel no reason to go back to the game other than to watch my little company spiral out of control.\n\nSarcasm fully intended.","November 14, 2015","false","8.6"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","25","35","0","0"

There's just a lot to be desired for this game that one can only hope to be added in the future. There is just so much lost potential from their new ideas too...\n\n21/3/16:\nOn a harder difficulty it is a little more enjoyable as I know the options and what to expect a little better but it really shows how much of just about everything uses money. While most things should have a money cost, I heavily dislike the ship system as it is just unlocking levels for a fleet you cannot customize. I would have rathered just built them myself with metals and constructo bots (as well as for the super bland upgrading or for that just put it an xp system it's not difficult to think of).

This game does not feel at all like an Anno game. In fact, in its current state, it feels like a deluxe edition of something you'd find on Facebook. This combined with the bejeweled companion app makes me think they wanted to make the game accessable to a wider audience. What happened instead was those people kept playing Farmville, and Anno fans are extremely sad. I wanted to love this game. I have been googling "new Anno game" for the last four years, hoping and eargerly awaiting the news that another game would be made after 2070. So, now for the specifics:\n\nPROS:\n- Game is beautiful. Watching my rocket launch to the moon and puttering around there were great.\n\nCONS:\n- Lack of variety. While game is beautiful, there is very little variety in housing. This makes for very boring, abeit shiny, cities.\n- No multiplayer.\n- No map randomization.\n- Combat is repetitive, and combat zones and situations are identical from game to game.\n- Factions play little to no role in this game, whereas they did in Anno 2070. In this game you'll get an occasional message from one of them telling you they passed you in the rankings, or that you passed them.\n- No meaningful, visable storage. What people mean when they say this, it there is no Arc storage for use between continuous games. Yes, we all realize overflow goes into storage. What is lame is you cannot see it. You cannot hoard upgrades and high level items to take with you to your next continous game, etc. Quit telling people there is storage when you know this is what they are referring to. We all agree overproduction does not go into the void, but no one cares.\n- No meaningful continuous game. This is a HUGE hit for an Anno game. The game feels very scripted. You start, you choose one of three static maps in each of the three areas as the game progresses. You're told to build things, and shown exactly how much you're over or under producting. You finish what feels like a long tutorial only to find out continuous game now means you can "keep playing as long as you want" but to do so feels very pointless. Starting another game means progressing through exact same long tutorual again.\n- Weird fetch/Facebook game mechanics required for collection of rare materials. You have three options to collect rare materials in this game - materials which you do need for building modules (fields, etc) on your farms now. 1. Combat zones. 2. Extremely bring and repetitive "go to point A, grab something, and take it to point B quests. 3. Bejeweled app. This is saddening when in Anno 2070 advanced materials were created in a lab, or academy, etc. Yet another way the game has been dumbed down.\n\nIn short, the game was a massive disappoint to me, and I have to imagine, all long time Anno fans. I bought into the positive reviews refuting some of the claims made above, and ultimately bought the game. This was regrettable because this is not a $60 AAA game by any stretch of the imagination, and is not an ANNO game. I hope someday to be able to update this review with more positive feedback, but at this point I am on the fence about sinking yet another $20 into DLC that probably should have been included in the game to begin with, and probably will not buy it.\n\nHere's hoping Ubi fixes this game, or releases new content for 2070 instead.\n\n","November 11, 2015","false","29.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/375910/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","Is it any good?\nI really like it.  I realise that isn't exactly helpful, so to put this in some sort of context, many people aren't enjoying it for the same reasons I AM enjoying it.  As a background, I very much enjoyed Annos 2070, 1404 and the rather older 1602 and plowed hundreds of hours into these games.  I was rather worried that this new game would simply be a reskinned Anno 2070 but I'm happy to say it's not.  There are many fresh ideas that change it just enough to make it feel like a new and different game yet retaining the Anno feel.  The developers have removed some of the more menial micro-management tasks - contentiously, because many players are complaining about that now.\n\nThe graphics are as gorgeous as shown in the screenshots, and the three different areas of temperate land, the Arctic and the moon have been incredibly recreated.  One issue people are running into is performance; I have a 6-core i7 with a 6Gb nVidia Titan Black together with 16Gb memory and even at a basic 1080p resolution I've had to pull back the settings from 'ultra' - the first game I've ever had to reduce.  Ubisoft has recommended playing with a GTX 680 or higher to get the best out of the game and I can see why.  Use Steam's 2-hour refund window to see how it runs on your PC.\n\n\nIf you've never played an Anno game before...\nUbisoft has clearly worked hard to make the user interface much more friendly.  However, this game explains even less than the tutorial of Anno 2070 did!  For example: there are no on-screen prompts to help a newcomer in towing a vessel with their command ship (do you left-click, right-click or what?  Do you click your vessel first, or the ship you are meant to be towing,   and how do you know which vessel to tow?).  Us oldies will know that you highlight the mission, look for the orange dot on the map that appears and head for that.  Newcomers might flounder because a lot of very basic stuff has been left to players' memories of previous games.\n\nPersonally, I would recommend first dipping into the still gorgeous and highly enjoyable (and now cheap) Anno 1404 - simply because the detailed campaign teaches you how to play ALL the Annos pretty much.  If not, ask in the forums for opinions from other newcomers because most reviews seem to be written by experienced players.\n\n\nIf you've played previous Anno games...\nAnno 2205 is getting a very mixed reception because there have been significant changes.  For the most part, I really like them, but many people don't, so I'll list the main changes in the hope it helps you decide whether you will like it or not:\n\n1.  No random map seeds.  I can see why, because maps are fully 3D rendered with incredible dams, places for gargantuan bridges and it would be very difficult to generate these procedurally.  As a result, you basically have 9 fixed maps from which to choose.  It's not many, but more will be coming via DLC such as Tundra and Orbit.\n\n2.  No multiple warehouses and transportation of goods.  Everything now must be connected by roads to your coastal warehouse, and the costs you incur are determined by how far goods must travel (you can place localised transport depots to reduce these).  Again, I REALLY love this change.  It's more realistic, and in Anno 2070 it was annoying having to pock-mark my maps with warehouses just to make all areas of the terrain buildable.  That's a thing of the past now!\n\n3. No more town centres.  Nope - you don't have to build within a small, circular radius now.  This I think is a fantastic change.\n\n4.  No more fields for farms etc.  I found fields cluttered my city designs in Anno 2070 so am not missing them particularly, but it's made some people unhappy.  Instead, your production factories now have modular add-ons to increase their output, reduce their energy consumption and such, and they bolt onto the building in the same style as Simcity 2013.\n\n5.  No 'continuous map' mode.  This is a bit of a concern, but what seems to have happened is that the developers have this time merged the campaign into what IS actually a free-form world.  Imagine playing a continuous-map game as in Anno 2070, when up pops one of the (once separate) side missions right in your new world!  It's making people think there is JUST campaign mode when it's actually just a map that you can play how you like.\n\n6. No multiplayer in this one.  I'm perfectly fine with that (I don't like multiplayer and Ubisoft claims that the multiplayer part of Anno 2070 was only played by the tiniest percentage of users).  If you enjoyed Anno 2070's multiplayer, this is something that might be of concern to you.\n\n7. Combat has been moved to its own map.  This is so that nuisance enemies don't bother people who really just want to build relaxing worlds.  However, you really need to partake in some of the battles in order to win resources you can use in your own map.  People have criticised the combat but, beyond it being in its own map which I don't mind too much, the combat seems to be quite an improvement on Anno 2070's combat, but it is still very basic (as it always was in Anno games).\n\n\nIn summary...\nAnno 2205 has been received well with 81% on meta-critic at the time of writing, but many Steam reviewers are panning it for some significant changes to the Anno formula (the biggest are listed above) so existing Anno gamers will need to decide for themselves, using Steam's 2-hour refund window.  I love it personally.  In my opinion, most of what was annoying has been removed, to be replaced with better features.  I am a bit concerned about the map limitation (no random-seeded maps any longer) and performance is a tad hefty, but there have been no bugs and it is a gorgeous game - incredible to look at and enjoyable to play.","November 4, 2015","true","71.2"," 95 of 163 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","95","163","2","0"

Whilst the somewhat simplified gamestyle is a bit of a thorn, cannot complain too much as it makes the game more new player friendly. Though even so it would have been nice to have more complexity and not keep it as linear. SimCity 2000 is more complex than this title is at the moment.\n\nBut the little bit of text compiled into simple things that I personally feel ruin the game experience for me are:\n\nNo Multiplayer\n\nNo Sandbox/Skirmish/Any other mode but Campaign\n\nSimplistic mechanics\n\nPerhaps in the future if more content is released the opinion might change, but as for the time of release, greatly disappointed.","November 4, 2015","false","17.4"," 37 of 58 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","37","58","0","0"

Strategy is not a thing in this game, you can just throw down buildings randomly and happily chuck along. Your citizens need food? Place a rice farm in an spot and they're instantly supplied. Are they thirsty? Find a coastal slot and throw down a water bottle whatever. It's simple and it's unappealing, half of the time I'm just waiting for numbers to go up.\n\nOh right, there's combat too, I guess.\nSee, the game is split into "sectors", some of which are Crisis Sectors. These are the only points of the game where you will get SOME excitement. You can just ram on through everything, spamming abilities to get yourself out of the danger and then do the objective.\n\nSpeaking of sectors, one of the selling points for me was that 2205 was supposed to be "5 times larger" than it's predecessors. Well, it technically is much larger than any other Anno game, but in the wrong way.\nAs stated earlier, the game is split into sectors. These sectors will ALWAYS be the same, no matter what. The temperate sectors are the same, the arctic sectors are the same, the crisis sectors are the same, and - surprise, surprise - the lunar sectors are the exact ♥♥♥♥ing same.\n\n"Lunar sectors, you say?"\n\nOh yeah, you go to space. It's more of a novelty thing. You build your cities in craters on the moon and have to make shield generators to protect from meteor showers, it's nothing exciting.\n\n"Shield generators? Are you saying we build cities with a TWIST?!"\n\nOh no no, it's not as exciting as it sounds. In fact, it's more of a hinderence than anything.\nIn the arctic sectors, your citizens need heat, so you need to place your housings next to factories and mines and such. This becomes an EXTREME annoyance when you're trying to get the neccesary amount of citizens to advance, seeing as they cant even be a single inch outside of the heat radius of their pinky toes might freeze to death or something.\n\nStill, the game is enjoyable for an hour or two, I'll give it that. But don't expect this to be worth the 60€ you're cashing out for it.\n\nLong story short, I would not recommend buying Anno 2205, I regret pre-ordering the Gold Edition and I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake as I did.\n\nRating: 1/10.\n\n-Kian\n\nEDIT: Felt like pointing out that I did leave out quite a few things (unintentionally) like the lack of multiplayer and such. The other reviews probably do a better job at explaining everything anyway, this was just made as a rant review to vent my disappointment.\n\nI wanted to love this game but I couldn't.","November 6, 2015","false","9.5"," 32 of 49 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","32","49","2","0"

There are no longer different factions to play as, just different types of people for each location. The people icons that appear when you click on a residence or a trading warehouse is no longer a decent size tucked away off to the side of the screen.

There are three main zones (temperate, arctic and lunar) which corresponds to Ecos, Tycoon and Tech factions in Anno 2070. Gameplay is tweaked and streamlined such that resource management is straight forward plop-and-forget, unlike previous Anno where placement is more critical and planning is required. Trading is also streamlined but in hindsight regressed, with trading featured only between sectors (world). Within sectors, there is no need to move goods around islands as they are all interlinked.\n\nHowever, at initial launch, the game lacks replayability and excitement that comes from random maps (almost all previous Annos), items (Anno 2070), exploration in that adds depth to the game. Maps are fixed (9 variants) and lack variety, and missions are very similar in nature with the same scripts across multiple play-through, unlike GTA or even other modern games where the scripts are varied. In particular, items are also totally stripped out, and there are no longer things that make your world unique such as ship equipment, ark upgrades, island-specific upgrades that makes the game exciting.","November 7, 2015","false","36.3"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

If you are looking for a strict yet-another-Anno-with-same-mechanics, this is not for you.\n\nHowever, ironically this is hands down the best Anno experience for me. Streamlining the logistics (Anno hasn't really never been able to give much tools for that) works perfectly for me, and now it's a strict production and space optimization simulation.\n\nPerfect. Consider this a spin-off of the original series, and it's easier to objectively consider the game's overall value.\n\nThe price is a bit steep, but damn it's beatiful to look at; the terrain is incredibly detailed or at least manages to convey a really good impression of detail. UI is also so much better than the clusterfudge of previous Anno 2070. Also, combat is now done in their completely isolated missions, and works for me; it has always been the least interesting part of the series.","May 4","true","67.0"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","30","48","2","0"

Honestly the game gets really boring after 15 hours of game play mainly because as far from what i see there are limited things to build and u really get the whole picure of the game within 4 to 5 hours of game play, so there is really no future suprise element that enhances the game play.\n\n2)Combat: The combat system is nice but i wish if the developers made it bit real time. Combat in this game is just basically 4 to 6 ships and controling them to the enemy base with their units and nothing else. so basically you don't invade a city and you don't destory it so the entire combat thing is just on a different isolated map from where you actually build your city.\n\n3)Building the Ciy: What is really sad about this game is that everything u want to build is kinda bit forced on you, For example the bridge & Dam you see in the images are kinda invisible in the game or destoried  (the dam that is) and you just right click and it builds them once you supplied the materials. so basicaly if u want to build the bridge else where u can't as you must choose with the AI tells you in the recommended locations same thing goes for many structures in the game.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf your looking for a game that will give you 100 hours of game play addiction, this is not for you and it will simply just waste your money. The only maps you will enjoy building is the temperate zone or green zone but the Ice zone (polar maps) and lunar base gets really boring due to restrictions such as heat field & enegry shield when building houses.\n\n","November 17, 2015","false","16.7"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

It is impossile to profit, even using the world market is barely enough to draw in a profit.  The taxes on trades can go well up to 10,000 after a couple of units and eat up all your profits instantly unless you're in the game of super massive overproduction (which is impossible to achieve because mass producing things just raises your needs more and more.) - This system is further insulting when you have to pay extortion level logistics between YOUR OWN colonies.\n\nI played the campaign on easy and finished the game "story" with 3 maps, however I was unable to continue my career as I was constantly in the financial negative and unable to help myself as the other 6 maps were locked behind whopping 2 million credit costs.  To make matters worst everytime I built a profitable thing to sell (Example: A.I.) it's needs would interfere and I would have to supplement them.  This leads to an endless circle of somebody - somewhere missing resources, and no profit being made - energy expendature constantly increasing and leaving me with an overall feeling of dissatisfaction.  It was like playing on a teeter totter except at the end the other kid gets off and you're stuck on the bottom with no way up.\n\nMaps are small and awkward, and most space is not viable for building, of course the module sizes contribute to this and eat up atleast 60-70% of your map.\n\nThe Naval combat was shallow and boring and had no depth whatsoever - and no purpose as it did not affect your development - in fact I wasted credits upgrading ships when I could have ignored this aspect alltogether.\n\n30 hours or so on the game I wonder why.  Why did I waste my time on this?  I don't feel victorious, I feel I failed at a game dedicated to "balancing" which just gets frustrating at the end.\n\nReally would not recommend this game to anybody - if it wasn't pretty I wouldn't have even stayed for as long as I did.  2/10 game at best, completely bad purchase.","December 10, 2015","false","26.6"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

Some make no sense like the dam one, its a dam in an ocean? Again feels like SimCity, building different maps to work as one.\nIt has been over simplified, to the level that iPad apps are simple. This game is an app with PC graphics. Its that dumbed down. Im surprised you dont need to tap (sorry click) on buildings to gain taxes.\nSee them ships, yeah you dont use them. Well you do but only on a seperate map to the playable ones, when a job is offered. Your given a handful to do a mission, just a taste of what could have been seeing them.\n\nRant rant, rave rave. This game all in all is an epic fail, it has taken the road of SimCity for a reason unknown to humanity. Someone at Ubi or BlueByte thinks this is the way PC gamers want to play, or would be a good idea to reinvent PC gaming (because when I load Anno of course im looking for a quick fix while watching TV, nothing more).\n\nAnother classic, pedigree, legendary game franchise torn up.

I have played on the hardest difficulty from when I started this game up for the first time.\n\n\n\nAnno 2205 differs alot from the other Anno games and many of the mechanics are more streamlined and dumbed down. Infinite resources, no random maps, no multiplayer, no AI to battle on the maps where you build your cities and no warehouses or town halls.\n\nThe Anno feel is still here though, managing your supplies and juggling betwen regions instead of islands and send materials back and forth betwen your different cities. Trading is now instant and you don't need boats to do it, instead it will cost X ammount of cash to maintain each trading route.\n\nFor anyone new to the Anno series this is probably the best game to start on, and for the veterans it is still a polished and bug free game. Just keep in mind that alot has been changed, so that it wont come as a surprise.\n\nDifficulty is really easy, even though I'm playing on the hardest difficulty. Generating resources and income is as basic as it get's in a city sim and I've had no problems getting the resource I need. Planning your cities ahead isn't that big of a deal any more since you can freely move buildings around and since you have no warehouses, building a logic road system isn't an issue any more.\n\nThey've changed how the industrial buildings work by adding the ability to upgrade them with modules which costs resources you cannot obtain other then by doing missions. This does add a sense of missions actually being worthwile. But I have so far not ran out of said resource and I always have a surplus of them.\n\nBattles are now confined to areas where there are no city building. You will get a fleet and a mission on a map that you need to complete to get the rewards, which consists of rare resources to upgrade your factories. You can upgrade said fleet if you have the cash and experience needed, and it feels like a nice edition. This does mean that there will be no combat where you build your cities though, so no defense what so ever is needed in your cities or on your trade routes.\n\nYou will spend most of your time on three areas; Temperate, artic and the moon, each being more expensive to build on and each having it's own resources that all of your cities will consume. Going between them isn't an issue for me, but if you don't have a good computer the loading time is probably really laggy and long.\n\n\n\nAll in all it's a polished city builder with some really basic trading elements. And it would be a great game if the price was lower. Considering all of the things they removed from previous games, like multiplayer, I can't see how the price is acceptable. As I keep playing I just get this feeling that an DLC will be released sooner rather then later that will add a bunch of the stuff that feels like it's missing now, and we the players shouldn't accept this buisness model.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nGet the game on a sale, there are more content rich city sims out there that are alot cheaper then this one. This feels like a set-up for DLCs,\n\nFor anyone still intrested in how the game mechanics works, here is a video of the first 30 minutes of gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEf4avR_tLk&feature=youtu.be","November 3, 2015","false","21.6"," 92 of 168 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","92","168","3","2"

Even with all the great games that came out within a month of this one; Legacy of the Void, Fallout 4, and SW Battlefront this was the game I was most looking forward too because when all other games start to get tedious and the story starts to feel stale, you could always jump back into an Anno game, start from scratch and get 20+ hours out of a single development.  Anno 2070 was a gold standard, it provided the right balance between city-building, combat between competing factions, and random objective / crises situations that could be resolved or ignored depending on how you wanted to play the game.\n\nAfter a single 26 hour playthrough of Anno 2205 I can sadly say that this game diverges an astonishing amount from the incredible Anno gameplay style players have known and loved.  There is absolutely no challenge beyond resource balancing that occurs throughout the game.  After putting +250 hours into Anno 2070, I can say with a great deal of sadness that I wont be putting more than 30 into 2205, because there's simply no point in replaying.  Even on harder difficulties its just a matter of expanding and expanding resource production...no challenge, no replayability, the first and only playthrough most players will experience also starts to feel tedious after 10 hours.","January 7","false","22.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Graphics were good and overall seemed a decent upgrade on the Anno series. The addition of heat zones in the artic region was also a new twist that I enjoyed creatively solving (just like the lunar shields). Modules to expand existing buildings were also cool, much better than blindly making a carbon copy new building each time. Increasing immersion was the parallel running of all the zones since it simulates how it would really work. Finally, auto game save/sync worked flawlessly for me.\n\nHowever I feel there is also a lot wrong with this game.\n\n1. I liked the AI as the enemy in Anno 2070 as I feel it helped build and round out the story. In 2205 the terrorists (wow original) are forgettable, literally ignorable, and seem to break the story immersion more than than help it.\n\n2. There are a ton of zones but pretty much all are useless. Sure I bought them all from competitors but I never needed more than my original three zone plus one temperate zone in order to max everything out. Also the zone swap load time is an annoyance, entirely too long even on a SSD and high end computer.\n\n3. Transport routes are ridiculous as well. Easy to set up but having to set up a new route for every little thing was a HUGE pain. Especially when my route list got to the point it required scrolling (again that was only 4 zones, not even half the ones possible). I much preferred the 2070 method where you could mix and match on a single transport. Making this far more absurd is that you get 'magic' transport size in 2205 anyway where the amount you can transport automatically increases and you just pay more credits. With that being the case why limit one transport to one item?\n\n4. Building modules while an awesome thing were also problematic in that they only fit 'right' in about half the building types. Some of them would fit like perfect puzzles in a couple different ways while others were so far out in left field I wondered if maybe they had one designer on the core building and another on just the modules.\n\n5. Uplay required and Uplay sucks. Ok it has improved but who uses it because they want to?\n\n6. DLC also sucks.\n\nAll in all it was an OK game but far more negatives than positives in my opinion. If you loved 2070 you will like this game even if you might not love it. Worth buying ONLY on a significant Steam sale.","February 14","false","40.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Yes it is cool that you can/have to have supply lines linking the 3 different area types in the game, and contary to popular belief you CAN stockpile goods. The problem is that the stock pile of consumer goods is almost non-existant compared to Anno 2070 and the amount of supplies in storage is not displayed.\n\nThe game is really pretty, but not very well optimized and tends to start dropping FPS after an hour or two in game. The combat is limited to 2 missions that you repeat to get rare resources.\n\nBut what really bugs me is HOW THE HELL DID TERRORISTS FROM THE MOON GET SUCH AN ENOURMOUS WET NAVY DOWN TO EARTH WITH NO ONE NOTICING!?\n\nAs with every other game I've given a remotely positive review of: get it on sale if you want it at all.","January 20","false","33.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Wait for a significant discount.\n\nPros\nGraphics are, as always, extremely beautiful\n\nCons (in order of impact from my perspective)\n*  (Added later)  My new worst con is that the epilepsy warning lasts literally 30 seconds and you can't escape out of it.  You have to wait every time!!!\n*  The change in battle mechanics is just too much for me.  Having a dedicated zone with no risk in your home sectors is no fun.\n*  There is no sandbox game capability - it's all campaign only.\n*  You can't trade energy from map to map, so I have +1000 energy in one map because it's special project is actually energy generation, and am starved in the next, but can't utilize my surplus.  (Edit:  You end up being able to very deep in the advancement chain)\n*  Islands are in no way 5 times larger as was stated - they might be larger, but the buildable space is actually pretty small.\n*  Zoom capability - you can't zoom out much and I feel too close to the map.\n* Control-Number assignment doesn't work.  You can't assign 1 to your command ship which is actually quite disrupting.\n* Other comments have mentioned the change in logistics, storage etc, and I actually prefer the old way.  Everything seems too dumbed down to me and it potentially removes game play hours.  I can see myself getting bored much more quickly since it already seems like a simplified (and disappointing) grind.\n\nMy hope is these things will be addressed in patches or free updates, but for now, I'd wait if I were you.","November 3, 2015","false","73.9"," 42 of 76 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","42","76","0","4"

At 1st I failed to see how a franchise at this level could in good conscience release such a product.\n\nYou know who is to blame though: us. We need to stop pre-purchasing these AAA games. I, for one, will no longer be doing it. These AAA developers are getting fat while they laugh and count our money and sit back while we debug their rushed out crap. |f I worked for blue byte - I'd be embarrased.\n\nRegarding the gameplay: It's unfortunate but the rather than moving towards a City Builder RTS (which aside from the earlier Anno titles there are none other in the game market) the developer decided on the easier and less bold route - City Builder with a pseudo RTS minigame. I guess there is no need to stand alone in this market when you have a following - people will buy enough units apon pre-release and then on release day to cover initial development.\n\nI was excited about getting to build monumental cites and then having the satisfaction of fighting to keep them.

There are a few things that I don't completely like. In specific, it seems a simplified version of Anno 2070. In 2070, you need to set up productions on different islands building ships to trade and send stuff from one Island to another, organizing the route and so on, it is very detailed and\nit requires a lot of planning and care to organize it. In 2205, most of the things are automated, and this detract, in my opinion, from the fun.\n\nIn 2070, if you don't satisfy the needs of your population up to a percentage, they simply move out and you lose the revenue. Here it doesn't seems so or it doesn't seems to have much negative effects.\n\nThe combat missions are... meh... Ok, they are not required, but still... they feel a bit like an addendum that was thrown in to spice up the game.\n\nThe Tundra was a bit of a letdown, mostly because I got in after finishing everything else, with almost 5 million in the bank and a positive balance. So I basically steamrolled over everything.\n\nThe Tundra, in my opinion, would have been nice just after the Arctic, because it adds a lot of complexity. The population is divided in 2 groups: there are the "ecologist" that are equivalent to the Arctic's Preserver, and the Researchers that are the scientist. Also the population's needs are mostly the same. The trick is that they require canned food, but you can't fish or make canneries here! You need to make them in the Arctic and then ship them in.\nSo it's more juggling resources, that is challenging when you've just started, but not much when you've finished.\nAlso, constructing stuff there require construct-o-bot and super-alloy, but you can't make them on-site. And instead of going and building the required production lines somewhere, I went "rockfeller" style, just popped down at Papadakis' place and bought up all his stock, then trucked them here and that's it.\n\nThe only real problem, ignoring the prick head researcher here, is that the "project" is the draining of the marshes and the reconstruction of some sort of 'seed vault' built by the Eden project in 2100, and it requires a load of Iridium, that you only get from combat missions. So it is start a pump site, that uses constructobot and superalloy, go take a combat mission to pile up in iridium, go back to papadakis and buy more of the stuff, pop back in to finish the job, repeat for the next site. There are 7 of them, so it takes a bit of time, but when you have a positive balance of 40.000 and 5 millions, there is no real challange.\n\nDo I suggest this game? Yes if you haven't played Anno 2070 yet and want to have a quick intro to the mechanics, but if you are an experienced Anno 2070 players, you'll probably find this a bit overrated.\nIs not that is not fun, it is, but it pales against the complexity of 2070.","March 9","true","88.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Unfortunatly it's a massive disappointment. The strength of Anno was its ability to allow for great depth in gameplay that stemmed from enjoyable micromanagement, complex industries and resource management of scarce materials that forced the player to think strategicly. That central aspect of the game which fans loved has been ripped out and turned it into a bland balance sheet system that makes the game painfully simple. I do like the new enviroments and I was really hoping going to space would have been similar to going underwater in 2070, seamless and engaging, yet another disappointment. The game has been gutted of complexity, made simple and inviting to an audiance that normally wouldnt appreciate Anno, I felt the new direction was just a sell out, all at the expense of fans of the past games. This isnt a game you can sink 100's of hours into, after 5 I was bored and dont care to pick it up again.

I have a lot of hours logged on Anno 2070 and never had an issue with it.  Until launch today.  Tried my email and password combo...no dice.  Asked for password reset - still waiting 3 hours later.  Said "F--- it" and made a second Uplay account just to play this and discovered there was gated content that is now locked out because I have no points history on my new account.

And queue the crash and lockup.  Locked so hard Task Manager can't be shown.  Force log out on Windows 10, restart.  5 more minutes, and crash and lock.

There is ZERO NEED for the Uplay DRM, none. At all.  There was ZERO NEED to cancel the beta, and doing so removes ANY EXCUSE that the game is unplayable on a Windows 10 system at decent settings at release.

This excitement stemmed from playing Anno 2070 multiplayer. So I bought it day one and was quickly dissapointed. Anno 2205 is so lackluster for me because building was not entertaining, The battles were too frequent, and the lack of multiplayer. The building is too simple, You place a building down connect it to any road and now the whole sector has the resources. One thing i really enjoyed about 2070 was finding optimal ways to place different buildings, or maiking sure you have enough depots to manage transportation based on physical units. In this game, you build this building that helps transportation by placing it on the island. To improve efficientcy of these buildings , you plop upgrades  connecting to the building based on materials that as far as I know, you cannot produce.  That brings me to the next issue, The fights. At first they were really fun with the missile barrage recking havack, The cool EMP, and the support submarines. However, Each mission drags on forever if you want to get all the materials and do the AI missions. This would not be so bad if the AI didn't constantly ask for your help every 3 seconds. In the 4 hours i played this game, I spent the majority of the time fighting Moon rebel jerkface. The battles become boring really fast despite multiple maps because of how they drag on and on. Finally, the Lack of multiplayer was the final nail in the coffin. My friend and I bought the game solely for playing together. We were playing singleplayer because there really isn't a main menu when he asked me how we played multiplayer. I didn't know because the Popular user tags are Strategy, City Builder, Simulation, and Futuristic. Yes, it does say Single-player next to ubisoft DRM warning, but I missed it. Sue me. Anyways, My friend and I quickly got refunds because we would not deal with this dissapointing experience without multiplayer.","November 11, 2015","false","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you're going into it expecting a sequel to 2070, you're going to be disappointed due to the number of things left out or streamlined in such a way as to lower the barrier of entry.\n\nWhile I initially liked the logistics trucks concept, after 5 minutes of going back to 2070 this afternoon, I realized that it was far too simplified.  As were the mechanics of always knowing exactly whether supply was trending upward or down or knowing that an island had finite (read: specific) resources, forcing expansion to grow.\n\nThe combat missions have potential but are tedious and overly simplified.  Plus there only seems to be a couple of maps for the two conflict zones.\n\nSome of these things can be improved upon through DLC but they should be included from the start.  Continuous play as well as careful resource management is the bedrock of this series.  2205 doesn't live up to that legacy at this point.\n\nThe software itself is buggy (it has crashed a couple of times) and is a serious resource hog.  In late game, my machine slowed to a crawl so be advised if you're running on slightly older hardware.\n\nThere's potential here but I would definitely wait for some patches and/or a sale.","November 9, 2015","false","31.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It is different in a lot of ways from previous ANNO titles , but overall I think they have done a good job updating the series.\n\nI especially love being able to move buildings (watch out some can be ridiculously expensive to relocate!), and the various addons that you can customize for them. Game looks amazing, and being able to now jump between your different settlements is another welcome addition.\n\nI definitely have not found the game to be too easy, I've only recently reached around lvl 12 and started the moon base and it is already challenging keeping all of my sectors in balance while bringing in enough income to fund the steps needed for the main progression!\n\nThe side quests can be a bit generic and repetitive, but do offer a good way to supplement your income or get those last few rare resources you need. A lot of players did not like that all combat was moved to a separate part of the game, but I don't mind so much. Having these 2 parts separate lets you concentrate fully on one or the other without having to stop in the middle of what you were doing to address whatever event/crisis pops up. Just make sure you have a positive income flow before starting the combat missions - your settlements still run in real time while youre fighting!\n\nIf you like strategy, city building, or any of the previous ANNO titles, give this one a try - you can always refund if you hate it, right?","April 14","true","34.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I agree that the game is a little too simplistic and could be fleshed out in a few ways to offer more depth.  There are what I would consider to be some missed opportunities.  But when I combine the good and the bad, I still come away wanting to recommend it.  If I were to assign a percentage, I'd say 60% of me likes it while 40% of me is left scratching my head over some of the shallow design decisions.\n\nHere are a few positive bullet points...\n\n- The game is beautiful.  Even on my GTX 760, the game runs very well.\n- Setting up the balance of goods and trade routes is actually pretty enjoyable.  That being said, this is pretty much the centerpiece of the game.  This is all you need to do, but that task has a lot of sub-tasks.\n- As simplistic as the game is, I can't seem to get enough of it.  That may change and I often question the replayability, but so far I'm having a good time.\n- While I am not blown away by the storylines in each sector, I do enjoy the overarching questline to achieve something.  This also adds to the balance difficulty as I'm expanding.  If I need to increase a specific commodity (it's usually something really expensive to produce), I've had to be pretty careful in that venture as to not begin hemorrhaging cash.  I lost my first game as I was powering through the content and quests.  Before I knew it, I was in the red and couldn't figure out where things went wrong.  2205 will surprise you if you aren't careful.\n- As you upgrade your buildings, the challenge to meet the needs of the new demographic presents itself prominently.  This is where you can really screw yourself over if you aren't careful.\n\nHere are my reservations about the game...\n\n- The mini-quests in each area are a waste of time.  Once you've done about 5-6 of the variations, it's a repetitive and mundane task to do the quests unless you need the reward.\n- There is a distinct lack of depth on the resource side.  You create specific resources in specific regions.  No pre-req required, just jump right in.  For me, I missed the challenge of obtaining the correct fertility and building an island around the production of that resource.\n- Also on the resource side, when you build the buildings, the resources are immediately available. There's no delay to allow production to ramp up and give you the feeling that there are some logistical challenges in opening a new factory/farm etc...small detail, but it was strange at first.\n- Combat is separate from your region builds.  I'm not sure I understand this design decision, to be honest...If it weren't for the pestering of the NPCs to do my combat missions or the fact that I'd end up low on a rare resource, I'd probably never do them. When I do complete the missions, it's not a very robust system.  I hold down my + key a lot to speed things up and even if I lose a few ships, completing it on Expert difficulty isn't insurmountable.\n\nIt's not a BAD game by any means.\nDid it fall short?  Most certainly.  The side quests and combat are questionable.\nWill you still enjoy it?  I believe you will if you give it a chance. Start building up your moon colonies and you'll see what I mean.\n\nUPDATE:  I'm still playing this game.  I really feel that anyone passing on this game will be missing out.  What's amusing is that I think I make the majority of my "rare" materials from the Anno 2205 Asteroid Miner smartphone game.  I haven't had to do a military mission since I posted this review.  One day, you'll buy his game and agree with me.  Whether it's now or when it's on sale for 5 dollars in 3 years..\nI'm very much looking forward to Wildwater Bay!","January 3","true","113.7"," 31 of 60 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","31","60","2","0"

I found this game to be simplified, but not in a way that was unpleasant. For example, there is a new window which tells you how much you are consuming and producing of each good; this makes it so much easier to balance production chains. Additionally, the move tool is awesome given that I like to rebuild things.\n\nOverall, based on my 4 hours in the campaign, I would recommend this, especially if you are on the fence because it is published by Ubisoft. BlueByte did an excellent job with this game and I am enjoying it so far. It's both simpl er and more complex than 2070 (haven't played the other games, so can't comment on that). Running one city is pretty easy, but moving up the chain and expanding to having multiple cities is a more interesting thing. Definitely worth a look at least and I am excited to see what else they do in the future.\n\nThings that are different:\n1) Multiple "theaters" in the form of Temperate, Artic and Lunar biomes which each have their own gimmicks. Artic bases are built around factories in order to protect warmth which results in sprawling collections of hamlets while lunar bases are built under forcefields to protect from meteorites. I am not sure on this, but it looks like you can "buy" theaters from other corporations once you are ranked higher (read more citizens, supply chains etc). Not quite sure what this does yet, but it looks like you can you have quite a number of theaters going at once and not just one of each type.\n\n2) No manual trade routes for ships in each theater, all goods / energy in a theater is instantly traded by a fleet of ships which grows as you do, but which you do not control. Instead, you form trade routes between theaters as there are specific items only produced in each one which are demanded by employees in other areas. Some people will not like this, but I think it works due to the fact that you are in multiple theaters at once. Having to run trade routes manually would cause a lot of lag I think. Also, having a centralized store of goods in each theater makes it easier to expand and develop islands. Trade between theaters is handled by a space port, which you need to build / expand in each theater. This means that you need to actually build in each area and can't just "load an ark" with everything you need. Credit balance is global as well, so you definitely want a big positive balance before building expensive stuff in the artic for example. All in all, I don't miss the setting of routes that much.\n\n3) Combat, at least in the campaign, is removed from the central gameplay by making it an optional side mission which rewards you with resources you can use to build modules. Combat puts you in command of a few ships with abilities which you can power up from drops in the map. Ships can be upgraded over time, but the upgrades are linear per ship.\n\n4) Modules: this is the big one. In 2070, you built these massive collections of fields in the hopes that you built enough for the demands you needed. Fields had to be attached to each farm. Here, farms run on their own, but you can add modules in exchange for resources. The modules do different thing such as boost productivity (more productivity than you would get with another farm at the same resource cost), reduce workers needed to maintain the place or lower energy consumption. Modules in each theater use different special resources. I have found that the way to go, at least so far, is to build a farm and then build up modules before building a new farm. This lets you save space.\n\n5) Mountain sites: you can build any resource gathering field on any appropriate (mountain / water) site.\n\n6) Move tool: oh god yes. You can move any factory, farm or building (even between islands) for a nominal fee / free (I forget which). This is amazing. In the campaign, I built up my first island with people and production, but ran out of room. I upgraded my production facilities with modules in a random fashion and then moved all the population to another island (I demolished the buildings). Then I moved my existing farms and factories to something that both worked and was visually pleasing without a massive loss of resources. Coupled with a central storage of goods in each theater, you can easily rebuild islands whereas it would have been prohibitively time consuming in 2070. This encourages you to expand organically.\n\n7) Graphics are very, very pretty. It's not Crysis, but it all feels real enough to let you get lost in the game.\n\n8) Production balance window: This is actually a massive thing and can't believe I put it this low. You have a window (small one which you can see by hitting 'v') which shows you all your goods. It shows you the production and consumption. This was need in 2070 as you often had massive surplus or massive shortages. Now that you have modules, you can slowly increase your capacity so you keep pace with what is really needed. This makes it a lot easier for people to get into building cities I think. That isn't to say that you lose all complexity though, now that you work in different theaters, you need to produce goods for your own theater as well as others. It becomes a game of balancing things in a region and then figuring out what is needed elsewhere. The system plays together nicely and prevents newer people from dying instantly due to lack of consumer electronics or whatever.\n","November 3, 2015","true","5.3"," 50 of 98 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","50","98","2","0"

Taken away from the serious is a lot of the user unfriendly elements.  Gone are the days of using tables, calculators and chains.  The game is now built in such a way that it will show you exactly how much you need to balance everything off.  It's just a matter of doing it yourself.\n\nGone are the days of hitting Tier 3 only for all of the AI players to immediately declare war and usurp you with giant barrages of ships.  Now all of the fighting is done on separate combat maps that require little to no investment from your colonies.\n\nInstead you get a game that feels kind of flat by comparison.  But it is also a very very different game than the rest.\n\nYou will have three different types of zones (regular, arctic, and moon) in which each place will have resources that the other needs.  Added to the game is a new resource of workers that means you need to maintain actual populations in order to work in buildings.  These buildings will produce all of the resources you need.\n\nThere is no more building ships in the game.  Instead you have to choose between three crafts for each trade route of increasing size and organize your routes from here.\n\nAlso gone from the game are items and the ARK.  This is a very large hit on the game.  However it also makes the game balance more likable.  Without requiring to have 30% speed on all transport ships they will just have that 30% from the start.\n\nThe game has simply become one of managing various resources, populations and needs.  It's not a terrible game, but it is most certainly a very different game that will scare away any of the faithful who enjoyed the Anno series.\n\nIt is most certainly not Anno and probably should have not been named as such.","February 28","true","148.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Seasoned gamers STAY AWAY. Check the last part for after 30+ play review.\n\nAs a seasoned Anno player I must say this game feels like a massive disappointment, the whole depth and substance of the game has been taken away. It's now a childrens playtime game, no real resource management, no real challenge, not even an interesting story line. It's just massive amounts of great graphics and that's it, nothing more.\n\nIt is so obvious this is another game made for not-so intelligent yet massively pampered and lousy millenial kids, you do trivial stuff and you get levels bonuses praises and crap, while there's not a real game going on, this game can be played after a real game as you let your mind to ease and eat dinner in front of the screen. It's that easy and crappy. THEY KILLED ANNO. Skip this one.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nPROS:\n+ Easy interface\n+ Great graphics\n\nCONS:\n- No real strategy\n- Not much of a resource management\n- No real challenge\n- No storyline\n\n----------------------------------\nAt this point I tried to give the game a second chance since I gave so much money to this damn game and forced myself into its system, turns out they actually put some sort of resource management scheme, in the old games you'd manage the resources in between the islands of a single map, in this game you have to do it in between maps which means you have to wait for loadings and transition effects each time you visit a map location, they space bit is nice but not detailed, the other corporations dont even challenge you, the graphics engine is not optimized to you get damn frame rate falls, what else is out there ?

They got rid of some of the original concepts which was really good and replaced it with new ones. The game however lacks a bit more substance to it as if this is just a base game for things to come. With hopefully dlc or expansion to fix it up and create more depth to the game it is unfortunate that the core version did not offer much much more. I do however recommend it as worth being played.\nSome may love this game, and some hardcore veterans of 2070 looking for more depth and  the same game will most likely hate it. It has its good point but also letdowns. Hold off on it a bit for the dlcs to kick in unfortunately.\n\nPros+ The graphics in this is aesthetically pleasing. Great to watch the people and the day and night cycle (Which is optional and can be turned on bottom right)\n+ Sleak, clean interface that is easy to learn and use\n+ Music never fails to impress in the anno series\n+ Open ended campaign system so that you can build and do whatever else you like\n+ Modular buildings, easy to build/move buildings, combat in seperate zone, and strategized resource locations for some factories (can be a hit or miss for some)\n+ High density building content can prove a challenge you think its easy till you try to upgrade everything\n+ Multiple ways to earn rare resources t (Trading, mission/quests, and combat)\n+ Build and manage cities in 3 different areas at the same time or focus on one, from temperate climate, artic, and lunar. Still your choice on what you want to focus on\n+ Alot of new features that fixes hectic hassles I had in 2070, The ability to move buildings is one so that I don't take down an entire area to build statues.\n+ Each areas of the world requires different strategy for settlement placement i.e placing near factories to stay warm in the artics, having to build under shield generators on moon to avoid space debris\n+ Hopeful for additional content and release for the game to make it much better than it is which is a base game atm\n\n\nCons - They took out alot of the management system from the original that added depth to the game\n- Not as much depth and content as I expected after reaching end game, only thing to do is build high density and balance it out to work which is the challenge will be fun for a while. There needs to be more challenges\n- The combat system is arcadey and feels like it was just thrown in for the sake of it. I am glad however that it is optional\n- The rare resources are not so rare at all, there are 3 ways to earn them and it is really easy. too easy for rare\n- Needs more map randomization to add replayability\n- Multiplayer is gone unfortunately, but sometimes that is a good thing.\n- Needs more content\n\nReview Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3safqsJjFaA&feature=youtu.be","November 4, 2015","true","44.5"," 69 of 138 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","69","138","0","8"

I wasn't the best at it either, failing many cities but I still kept coming back for the challenge, and to try new things out and go with different themes.  This installment, however, seems devoid of any challenge and variety at all.  Maps are pre-determined and don't change, but they are very prety, especially the arctic and moon.  There's only one 'faction', your own.  You can slightly customize it by naming it and picking a logo, but it will always look the same in the game world.\n\nCombat is pretty stale too, as it is shoehorned in with battle arenas that are forced with each stage of your space program.  Take your fleet, navigate the given arena, kill ships, and loot things in the water to call in artillary or EMP.  I miss having all the factions present on the map and having to defend my settlements when the time came.  That aspect is no longer present.  On top of it, it all feels incredibly linear as to your settlement's direction.  There's no harbor design, many buildings go where the slot on the map is, and goods and storage are so streamlined the game basically plays itself.\n\nThe game is fun, but very very stale in the complexity department and I feel I won't return for a new game after one is completed, because the experience will largely be the same events in the same order.  I want to enjoy this game, and the theme is amazing, and it's gorgeous to look at, but there's no substance here, not for $60 at least.  Wait till it gets cheaper, or maybe changes with patches or DLC.","November 3, 2015","false","1.4"," 63 of 126 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","63","126","0","9"

Whereas 2070 was essentially 1404 but with different assets and a few new mechanics, 2205 makes some big and bold changes - but most are for the better. If all you want is another 1404 or 2070 you might not be happy with 2205.\n\nPerhaps the biggest and best change is the removal of combat (save for self-contained generic missions) from the building and management sections. Instead, combat has been compartmentalized and moved to separate maps that you complete for upgrade materials. It's not a perfect system, as the combat has little depth and isn't very strategic, but it can be a nice change of pace and lets you build capital while being somewhat productive. Not just the combat is removed, there is no competition from AI players. There's no urgency to settle islands to avoid being locked out from resources as once you settle in a region, it's "yours," including any and all islands (though you don't get access to them all right away). Wether this detracts from the experience varies from player to player. Personally I prefer the relaxing building simulator, but some might miss the competition.\n\nGone are a lot of tedious and needlessly time-consuming mechanics from the old games, where you sat around and waited for resources to tick in and population to rise so you could ascend dwellings. Instead, you get instant access to any information you need regarding production and consumption, letting you focus on what the games have always been about: efficiency. There is always something you can do to improve revenue flow, citizen numbers or space usage.\n\nIt might sound like the game has been simplified, but in reality it has just been streamlined and sped up. It's still plenty complicated once you unlock and get far enough in the different types of regions, and making big sweeping changes require careful planning and preparation to avoid plummeting production and income.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws, of course. While there is a lot to do in the game, there isn't that much replay value. Once you've "completed" the game, that's it. Unless you wanna start again on a higher difficulty or with a more efficient building/expansion plan, there is little else for you to see.\n\nI'm still not done with the game and I believe I have gotten plenty more than my money's worth from it, but I don't believe I will be playing it for years like I did with 1404.

I am in the middle of the semester here and 9 hours into the game (which is all I've had time for) I still feel like I have a million things left to do.\n\nA lot of things have changed. My biggest issue with it is replayability. It is true that the way the game is set up, there is not much of a replayability mechanic implemented (the maps are all going to be the same). There are, however, plenty of things to do in just one play through if you do it correctly.\nAlso, Uplay is not even an issue in this game. If you haven't done so already, you just link your steam account to your Uplay account and it won't open uplay anymore like it did with Anno 2070 and numerous other ubisoft games.\n\nAlso, to be honest, even with everything I still feel like this game should cost about 40 bucks so I'd recommend waiting for a sale. There is also the posibility that future patches might give us what a lot of people want.

Also, for the true Anno experience, you should be playing on Expert, which will erase your save if you have a negative balance for more than 30 minutes. I found the other modes much too easy and restarted twice.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, I have an older machine with an i7 850, GeForce 550Ti and 8 gigs of RAM and I am able to play on Medium settings and get around 20 FPS. It's not buttery-smooth at 60 FPS or anything but it's definitely passable on a very old machine. The graphics are nothing short of stunning.\n\nThe game appears to be 'dumbed down' at the outset, but wht you'll actually find are quality of life improvements. All items are stored in one central location, you can tell how much or little you have of something, and what the balance is of that item in that sector with a simple mousever. No more monitoring individual storehouses to make sure you're not over or under distrbuting goods. You won't have to micromanage shipping routes, either- it's all been streamlined.\n\nThe addition of the World Market allows you to buy and sell resources to the rest of the Anno community. I challenged myself to not use it but eventually there are items that (for now, anyway) just make more sense to import.\n\nCombat is completely optional, as is the associated app- but they do make the main missions a lot easier.\n\nMy main advice is to take your time, grow slow- and enjoy!","November 12, 2015","true","145.6"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

I've played all the annos and loved them. I purposely did not read the reviews until I got it for myself and played for 6 hours. I already know a lot of the bad reviews would solely be over the fact that you have to use uplay. Lo and behold, I got it right.\n\n--First, I want to say, give the game about 5 hours of gameplay. That's about how long it takes to really feel the game as a whole and see what it can bring and if you like what it's bringing--\n\nI'm going to talk about the game first. When I just started, I felt like the game was a bit "fast" in terms of progression and I was breezing through it. I wasn't forced to micromanage right away like the older annos. Now am I saying that the game is easy like the others claim it to be? No, not at all. For those who never played any anno series, I think starting with this one would be best because the game starts off easily enough. However, I think they designed it this way so that you can reach the point of the game where you now have to be aware of your resources and if leveling up your people into higher tier shiny buildings can cause you to not have adequate resources for your regions/cities. It pretty much wants you to get to the meat of the game fast. But once you get to that point, you have to take your time.  Also, unlike the other anno series where you have to check your cities on the other islands constantly, this time around, you just need to simply  go back and forth from the temperate region, the arctic, and finally, the moon. Once you hit the arctic region, that's when the fun starts.\n\nAgain, you must be willing to invest more than 2 hours to really experience what the game is capable of (although, as I've mentioned earlier, I really recommend 5). When you start having colonies in the arctic region, you must ensure they have enough heat sources which they can get from the factories you plop down *they have a heat radius*. From there, you must make sure that your other region is trading enough of what they need (and vice versa). It's more streamlined/trade flow than the other annos.\n\nThe moon is my current challenge because it's very expensive to colonize. You also have to make sure that you have the protective shield around your colony so they don't get smashed into smitherins by them asteroids.\n\nAesthetic wise, the game is gorgeous. Very beautiful and I just love going in postcard mode, just looking around my settlements. The only issue I have with this is it might need a bit more optimization. My desktop can run skyrim with all the heavy mods in ultra setting with no issues. But I get drops of FPS here and there with this game. Not so bad though and not often. But I feel it will be a bit of an issue later on when I have more things congregated in one spot.\n\nBugs? Currently no bugs for me.\n\nInterface? I love the interface on this one. That one they optimized well.\n\nBattle system? I never liked that part on any of my annos because I always felt them lacking. However, I liked what they did on this one very much. You now have to have fuel in order to do certain things with your vessels (like, repair) but at the same time, you can salvage around for the "special" abilities as I call em. You can get them from enemies you sunk or just floating around. This revamp made battling enjoyable for me.\n\nI'm not saying the negative reviews don't deserve to be heard. But, generally, with games like these, it's best to eye the ones that invested a big chunk of time before putting a negative reviews. Reviews such as, "ugh, uplay! Bad GAME", or "NO MP?! WELL F-- THIS GAME! TIS HORRIBLE!", isn't exactly something to go by. Sadly, it repels other gamers from getting the game and they end up missing out on a game they have the potential of investing a lot of time and enjoyment in.\n\nAgain,I've played the other annos. I actually like this game a lot. I read some inaccuracies on a bit of negative reviews which made me realize they obviously did not invest a couple hours at least in the game. It's not water downed. It's a bit different from the previous anno but it brings it's own flavor of difficulties with it.\n\nThat's about it. I don't want to invest too much time on other's reviews than the actual game itself in my review. I hope I pointed certain things out enough that it will encourage you to make your own decisions. Luckily steam has a refund policy so you always have that option.\n\nPS: Do not listen to those who said even on youtube it has a negative review. No. Most of them are quite positive (I know because I've been watching a lot of em' before  I bought the game). Also, there's a lot of fair reviews about the game and I saw it was a pretty consistent B+ average. (A lot of the ratings I've seen so far were averaging 8).\n\nCan't wait for the expansion. This will satiate me til fallout 4 is in front of my doorstep. =)","November 3, 2015","true","7.2"," 66 of 134 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","66","134","0","2"

The setting was perfect for me. I love history, and that game scratched every itch I had. Everything made sense: Of course your pioneers needed fish. Of course they needed meat, coffee, wine and tools. The production chains made sense, I understood them. You need cows to produce meat. You need iron and wood to produce tools.\n\nThat is why Anno 2070 did not manage to suck me into it. That is one of the reasons Anno 2205 fails. Do you need nano ceramics and cobalt to produce construct-o-bots? I have no idea.\n\nWhat I truly loved about the previous Anno games was this:\n\nIf you had joined a game after 20 hours, everything would seem like complete chaos. Fleets of ships going in all directions carrying tons of different goods to a dozen islands. But for the player, every little thing made sense. Because they had built everything from scratch. Every boat, every building, everything. That was the real beauty of it. The best learning curve I have ever witnessed in a game.\n\nIt was challenging. You had to keep trying getting the perfect balance in your production chains. You had the option to taxate the population and selling surplus goods. You had to fight for the best islands.\n\nNow, they have stripped most of it out. Every warehouse is in prebuilt locations. The ships are just generated, making no sense. You cannot set taxes, you dont need to fix production chains as they tell you exactly what you need to do, and you cannot sell goods! So what do you do when you are low on cash? Its quite simple, actually: You just leave the game with a positive income, and let time take care of it.\n\nThat was the point when I realised how poor this game was: When I could leave the game on for several hours, and when I opened it again, the ONLY thing that had happened was a big bank account. In Anno 1404, that would have been a suicide. Pirates would attack. Other players would steal the best islands, they would invade you. The production chain was guaranteed to be a little off-balance, so after some hours your citizens would have left your town. Because they would run out of bread, meat and books. And I understood them. I would leave too.\n\nWould I leave due to a lack of neuro implants? I dont know. Probably not.\n\nThis is not strategy, its barely administration. Bring back the excellent gameplay of 1404, and make a Anno 1800 or 720bc. Until then, I will keep beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of Leif Jorgensen.\n\nPS: If you havent played Anno 1404, do it. Its the pinnacle of the series in my opinion, and it has aged quite well.","November 6, 2015","false","15.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Streamlines a few systems, namely trade between sectors, logistics within sector, and how combat is handled, but that doesn't mean they are simple or dumbed down.  The ability to move structures around is a nice addition, you don't have to wory about screwing yourself with a poor layout early on since you can just rearrange it later.  The temperate, space, and arctic/tundra ecosystem all play uniquely and emphasize different aspects of the game.\n\nYou're got to give it 10 or so hours before you really hit the complexity that Anno is known for.  Each of the first three initial sectors is like a big tutorial for the game and once you complete all three (the Lunar Licensing Program in-game), you are turned loose to go around and complete the other sector projects.  This is where the free-form style of game that feels more like traditional Anno begins.  I imagine a lot of the negative reviews that complain about lack of complexity or short length either never got this far, or were simply expecting some other than what they got.\n\nIt took me about 45 hours to complete all of the sector projects (including the Tundra dlc), which is the meat of the game.  This game definietly continues what Anno 2070 started, so if you didn't like 2070, you probably won't like this.\n\nThere is currently no multiplayer, which may or may not bother you.\n\nLike any game, this has some bumps, but that wouldn't stop me from whole-heartedly recommending it!","April 20","true","73.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Depends on whom I'm talking to. I'm assuming you're reading this as someone who has played the game a lot, because you're a fan reading your trillionth Steam review to try and work out if you'll like the game. I can 100% assure you that I enjoy this game to a very very mild degree. It's not much of a step up beyond what was already happening in the Anno series, so for someone new, it might be a fun little game. For someone familiar with the series, it might be a bit disappointing. That said, I've played a bunch of the old Anno games, and I haven't found myself moving on from it yet.\n\nSome mildly interesting things to affect your mild decision to mildly purchase this game:\n\n1) It provides a colony-to-colony transfer system that meant I had to manage the different resources from each of the biomes in a cross-planet trade network, which was simple, yet delicate.\n2) If you were like me, and you really want to like this game, chances are you'll enjoy it, provided you don't feel like it's a big expense.\n3) You don't get to your moon base for a while, so don't expect it to be there at the start\n4) the various in-colony optional missions are kind of boring and arduous. Just a bunch of fetch quests to justify a plane or boat model on the map.\n5) the military campaign missions are also kind of boring, but in a different way. It's just bland to wander around the map with your full armada of ships and either be at an adequate level, and thus just breeze past most things, or to be insufficient, in which case your units will atrophy away before you can finish the level. That said, if they were difficult, I probably wouldn't bother playing them, as they're not that important for the main game.","April 18","true","25.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Did not ever hit any environmental disasters, which were a hallmark of ANNO 2070's replay value.\n\nThe main "streamline" that alters the game from 2070 is that resources are managed as a surplus/deficit counter instead of actual supply/demand. What this means is that it's much easier to see whether you need to produce more of a certain good, but surprisingly this makes the game less fun: it is too easy to balance the deficit for a good, and then when you're running a deficit of that good again it's obvious, so there is no real supply chain breakdown ever, and that was half the fun of ANNO 2070.\n\nThe combat is lacking, and seems to have degraded from 2070, where your options for combat involved planes and nukes, in addition to boats. Combat now feels very arcadey, with powerups and roaming groups of enemies. It is just not the same as 2070, where the military aspects were very engaging and intertwined with the city-building.\n\nTL;DR\nAnno 2070 is better, buy that instead.","November 3, 2015","true","13.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Definitely not a fan of how the game starts you off on a 1-way path with a single play button (pretty much 1 gamemode like others have said,) and the super-limited choice of maps really threw me off.

You've really amazing people. ;)\n\nAnyway, short form: Not quite the Anno you know. A lot of the core aspects are present: resource and production chain management, income balancing through satisfying population needs, laying out roads and your city, and the complexity of not having all resources at one location. Caveat is that the scale of the game has become a bit grander that it takes time to manage your chains because instead of managing different islands you now manage different maps you have to jump in and out of. The maps are limited in selection, and without multiplayer replayability is pretty low.\n\nIs this an Anno game? Yes, in it's own way.\n\nLong form...\n\nThe story is also you guide to "winning" the game and also your basic tutorial. Playing the game for the first time, you will be thankful how the story progresses and asks you to do tasks sequentially based on what kind of resource chain should go up next. If you already know what you're doing, you can safely ignore the story content and it will actually automatically progress as you build your chains on your own. One quirk is that you may get intrrupted by the story as it automatically progresses along with you.\n\nResource collection and production chains remains pretty much the same, except you no longer directly deal with invetory counts. Yes, storage does exist. But, it's not really there because you need to keep watch. The new UI now presents data in a meaningful way and goes completely out of the way when you don't need it and is easy to access when you want to see them. Also, you only see if you surplus, deficit, or not. If you want to see how much is stored in your map, you will have to over over the good's icon in the UI. With the invetory system stripped away of it's essential fuctions, you no longer have the ability to transfer quantities of goods between spaces. They simply exist in the background automatically stored and consumed by your production chains, and citizens. The only goods you actually see and need to care about are goods that you use to build and upgrade your buildings. They are presented at the top of the screen, only displaying relevant goods based on your map.\n\nTrading is stripped converted from the easy drop and sell to the new surplus trading. You sell the surplus flow your sector creates, oh and it costs some amount to "transport" these goods magically to the world market. Each good you want to sell will have to have it's own trade route, instead of maybe a a ship that can be filled in with goods of different kinds for a cheaper transport. Oh, and you cannot sell to the world market if you are offline. And, you cannot sell to the other AIs in the game, but you can buy from them! I tried trading, but unless you are selling higher tier items, your trading lines are just going to bankrupt you as they don't really provide any profit, if at all.\n\nRemember when I said you now manage maps instead of islands? Yeah, you are presented with a global map, prefilled with pre-created maps. No, no random maps. Bummer. No big deal, the maps given present their own challenges and puzzles in their own way. I'm just a bit worried about replayability when you get tired of playing the same maps. (What's that? there might be a map pack DLC? Colour me excited). You are given 4 map types, the Temperate map, Acrtic maps, Lunar map, and the Crisis map. The first three are your build your city and production chain maps, while the crisis map is an optional map where you control your military ships to attack enemies, gain non-renewable resources, and earn some more credits. They are completely optional, but they do grant some nice incentives if you play them.\n\nCombat. I'm not exactly a fan of combat in my Anno games. Separating it on a different map makes the game a bit more accessible and relaxing. I did play a good amount of combat in the Crisis maps, they were entertaining but after a couple fo plays they just gave me the same maps and missions. I suspect if you play them more they might give you more variety? But, that speculation on my part. I don't bother much with the combat. Actually, I only played them to gather resources used in upgrading buildings, like iridium, and graphene.\n\nOverall, this game still feels familiar if you've played Anno before. What's new is that this is a whole different beast on it's own. Once you grasp the game further, you'll understand that this new Anno tries to be a whole new game on it's own while building from the foundations that it's predecessors have built. That's a good thing. However, due to the limited map selection, and pretty linear story (which is more like your progression guide) I am highly concerned about the replayability of this game. I understand you can play this a higher difficuluty, but that only goes so far.\n\nWithout Multiplayer or random maps, I doubt this game will go far enough for me to sink in as much time as I did playing the previous Anno games. As much as I hate to bring up the topic, but an Anno game just has to be replayble. At it's current price, it just feels like it's overpriced for what it gives you.\n\nIf you want to play this game, I'd recommend waiting for it to hit a lower price. You won't be missing out as much not being able to play Anno 2205 right away.\n\nP.S. I have a season pass, so I'll be receiving future DLC automcatically. Depending on what DLC comes out, this recommendation may change. As of now, it stands where it is. I don't see myself updating this review even with more time I invest into the game and learning more about it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you're looking to make fun of my DAY ONE review I initially posted, it's right over here: pastebin dotcom /ApYuQgzW","November 2, 2015","true","45.2"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","25","52","0","45"

Or read them all, whichever you prefer.\n\nIf you are new to the Anno seriesAnno games are more of a tycoon game; an economy simulator rather than a city builder. So if you are expecting a city builder to kill your time with, Anno isn't for you, and I recommend checking Cities: Skylines instead. But if you are still reading, that means you are interested and I'll do my best to help you decide.\n\nThere is no multiplayer. However, that shouldn't be a deciding factor for your purchase, not for this game at least. Multiplayer has never been a strong point of the series. Anno 2070 features co-op in addition to competetive mode, maybe 5% of my total playtime is in co-op multiplayer. However I gave up on it as you cannot speed the game up in multiplayer. The bread and butter of any Anno game is continuous play; which is intertwined to the base campaign now, and I like it quite a lot.\n\nGame focuses around building a population, and supplying them with their needs. As they get satisfied, you'll have an opportunity to upgrade their residences, which opens new building options, and unlocks new production chains. Production chains get very complex as you progress, and requires several buildings to keep the efficiency at 100%. You have a nice little panel which tells you exactly how much you are producing and consuming (or sending/trading).\n\nThere are 3 types of environment; lush, arctic, and lunar. Lush is maybe the easiest, with no additional mechanics. Arctic and lunar has different mechanics. Arctic for example, residences can only be built around a heat source - your production buildings so to speak. This makes Arctic map different from Lush, a lot. Every environment has their own set of buildings, and in order to proceed in the game, you'll have to transfer resources between your regions. It's very easy to set those routes up though. You'll swap between these regions, and play every map at the same time so to speak. credit income from one map affects you globally - only resources are localized.\n\nThere are 9 maps as far as I can tell, and you start on one lush, then grab an arctic, and then grab a lunar region. You can purchase the other regions though. Every one of them looks gorgeous, and I didn't really miss a random map generator - because as I've said before, bread and butter of Anno games is continuous play, and when you start a game, you'll keep playing it. Being able to also play on 8 different maps - that's even more butter for the bread so to speak.\n\nAside from the resources, there are 4 things that you need to manage; power, workforce, logistics, and credit balance. At first it may seem easy to do so, however as your city grows, the distance to your warehouse increases, and production buildings will have higher logistics requirement. Soon, you'll have to build transport depots to increase your logistics capability; however these depots require power and maintenance of them is rather high. After a while you may find yourself in situations where you are trying to get a balance between power, logistics and maintenance. Aside from these, there are special, rare materials which you get by doing mini-missions and combat missions.\n\nMini-missions are non-mandatory, optional stuff that you can do in order to get more of the rare materials. Combat is on separate maps, so you don't have to worry about them if that's not your thing. However, I found myself quite enjoying the combat maps from time to time. You have a separate military ranking, and as you gain levels, your fleets gets bigger & better. Each map has one primary goal, and up to three secondary goals, and you get a lot of power-ups & pick-ups on your way to deal with the threats in the mission. Your rewards are rare materials which you require in order to upgrade your buildings - and these upgrades are very powerful.\n\nGraphics are very nice, however I feel that the game could use more optimization. I also feel that there may be a memory leak, as after 2+ hours of playtime, the framerate starts going down. I have an average PC, and usually sit around 40-60 FPS on medium settings, but it starts dipping down after a while. Music is as always, very good. Relaxing, soothing. The UI could use some help though - I'm not sure if I can - but being able to pin some stuff on the screen would eliminate a few mouse clicks.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game if you like economy simulators / tycoon games, with a little touch of city building. If you are interested, but would like to wait for a sale, it is understandable, it's not a cheap game afterall, You may want to check Anno 2070 meanwhile, however this game has big differences to Anno 2070, just keep that in mind. Have a nice day!\n\nIf you are NOT new to the Anno seriesI see a lot of reviews, comments, and discussions saying that this game is dumbed-down, and is easy. I beg the differ. All the changes I've seen are primarily aimed to please the people who enjoy continuous play a lot. I'm someone who plays Anno just because of the continuous play, and I'll take Anno 2070 as a base while trying to explain the changes.\n\nNo multiplayer - I believe it was the most underused feature of Anno 2070, and that's why they got rid of it. Anno has never been a good RTS either. It was the right decision in my opinion. I tried to play it, but I gave up on it as you cannot increase the game speed in multiplayer (naturally) - and at most 5% of my playtime is in multiplayer.\n\nNo storages/warehouses - To me, primary aim of these two buildings was to provide logistics drones to your facilities. Now, we have something called Logistics, and it makes the game harder actually. There is a building that increases your logistics capacity, but it doesn't come cheap. And as the distance to your warehouse / depot increases, the logistics maintenance also increases, so you cannot just put cheap storages everywhere to cover the map and then build as you like. There are no aerial drones to make your job easy either.\n\nNo random maps - I am STILL playing the very same map that I've started months ago in my continous play in Anno 2070. To be honest, looking at the same thing for a rather long while gets a bit boring. In 2205, the main campaign is actually a beefed up continuous play, and you can swap between your maps with a short loading time. You can establish routes between your regions - as opposed to establishing routes between your islands, to develop them even further. What I'm trying to say is, now at least I get to look at 3 (9) different maps, the main difference is that we all will be looking at the same maps. But personally I'm fine with it, since they are hand-crafted, they are gorgeous to look at.\n\nInfinite resources - Well, Anno 2070 also had infinite resources. You either researched or traded special warehouse modules, and applied those on an island to regain some resources. It was tiresome in continuous play, checking every trader, doing research, etc... and doing this for every island that you owned, and every resource that you needed... Now it's infinite, and I'm glad they've changed it. It was one of the most irritating aspects of previous Anno titles.\n\nNo factions - No, there are factions. It's not what we had before though. As the game has 3 different environments, you also get to play 3 different factions in essence. Arctic for example, you can only build residences with access to a head source - a production building so to speak. That alone makes arctic play out differently than what you've got used to before. Not to mention that every "faction" has different production lines.\n\nWhat do you enjoy the most, in an Anno game? Continuous play? Then this is the game for you. All of  the changes are to make continuous play even more enjoyable. I can keep going and explain more but character li","November 4, 2015","true","51.1"," 45 of 93 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","45","93","0","0"

It doesn't play like the previous annos but for me thats not a bad thing, I like what they have done here, it's refreshing.\n\nThe pros:\n-Amazing aesthetically, the graphics are really nice, the character models/animations and even voice acting is much more improved.\n\n-Regions of settlements - this is really refreshing and nice to build up and start fresh with new visual styles, new conditions depending on the climate in that area and trading depedancies between regions really give them personality (Artic region costs a bomb but is essential for other regions to develop).\n\n-The campaign flows much better, in previous annos you would have mission that you would load in and out of to complete objectives, this anno feels much more seemless, a persistant long term goal that lasts throughout the game.\n\n-The combat - in previous annos it never felt like a core pillar of the game, while still being completely optional this one it treats it as a seperate experience, which does infact remove from the risk of getting your hard built settlement blown up (I kinda liked that in the old ones), but it does mean that they got to focus on the combat elements in a completely fresh way that actually makes it more engaging. You have a ships that you can unlock via leveling up your corp level (through population and other bits and bobs), you earn experience via doing the combat missions and this experience can level up your boats, each boat has a key role to play which brings quite a bit of interesting strategy to the table, on top of that you now have abilities which you can use to call in reinforcements, nuke, stun, repair, shield and send out a wave to push the enemy back. Overall this is much better than previous annos as you won't need to wait until the 20 hour+ mark before you have any fun with the military side of things.\n\n-Modules on factories are quite refreshing, allowing you to customise your settlements focus, it means I don't have to keep spamming tea farms down and finding much more real estate for additional buildings, if you are negative in a particular resource, find the building and simply place a production module to tip you over the edge back into positive readings.\n\nThe cons:\n-No multiplayer, I think people have expressed this enough already that this was a weird design choice when the previous annos where so popular for it (It increased the longevity of the game considerably).\n\n-Not enough information is easily exposed, in previous annos you had how much of each resource displayed in your depots, in this one you simply have a positive of negative number and as long as you keep it at 0 or above, then everything is gravy.\n\n-Everything feels a bit too simple in regards to raw RTS traits, they have removed the hard numbers in areas and streamlined it so you know exactly what to do and when, although this isn't really a con, compared to old anno games it can make it feel 'dumbed down' saying that I kind of prefer it in someways as it means I can focus on getting that space elevator up and progress with a lot more flow.\n\n-Slots, this one is mentioned a lot by other reviewers but my opinion of them is quite indiferent, in anno 2070 you had slots for mines, slots for river modules and slots for dams, in this one they have extended it to bridges (Which are large), to your depot that settles on new island and to structures that would work similar to fishing ports... I don't really get how this makes for a negative experience other than restricting customisation in regards to building (Which doesn't account for much with these few structures).\n\nOverall, maybe give it some time and see what blue byte does with future patches/DLC, if you are looking for a traditional anno game then this may disappoint you, but if you are looking for a casual city builder with combat elements to distract you then this one will keep you entertained for 30hours +","November 3, 2015","true","27.7"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

Run on a single GTX 980 full ultra, with a average between 45-60 fps, depends on the density.\n\n+ The musics also are nice.\n\nSadly that's the only great points.\n\n- What's the point to playing a game without multiplayer (or even coop) and all the long you are assisted by a guide. There is no difficulty. I felt like i was playing the last SimCity in solo mode.\n\n- The maps are smaller than in Anno 2070 because there's no underwater. Instead, we have the moon and the arctic zone in a separately map. By the way, they told there will be no loadings. You must click two times on a map. First time to load the map, and second time to enter the map.\n\n- The story is useless for a game like that.\n\n- No diplomatie.\n\n- Without the manual save, we can't go back. So if you are not sure by testing some projects for your city and you want to go back, that's impossible.\n\n\nBecause of this simplicity, there's no motivation and no initiative during the whole game. I can't recommend you this game for that prize...\n\n(This was my first review)","November 3, 2015","false","3.7"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","12","26","0","4"

Overall its a fun and streamlined experience for the series, the modular buildings are great, as is the large interconnected system of zones you can build on. I like the new take on how the continuous game will carry on after the main campaign is over.\n\nI am a fan of the combat changes, and the fact that they are optional! Graphics are top notch, the 3 zones (temperate, arctic, moon) you can build in are all unique in their own ways, and mix up the game play. Also its wonderful to be able to move buildings around and fix the accidental misplacement of something.\n\nSome people do miss multiplayer, I am not one who ever bothered, but I can understand why people are upset over it being removed.

At first it's great cause it's a bit of a challenge to get everything balanced. I chose the medium difficulty as I've put a fair amount of hours into 2070, but it still never lets you get a negative balance. Once you get yourself to all areas though it's just the same, over and over and over. I can't get a refund cause I've played it to long but I can't see myself returning to this unless the dlc's make some spectacular changes.

I personally give it 5/10 points, if you don't love building games and anno specifically, just drop it. Or read the review below and make your own score based on that.\n\nThis is, because I enjoyed it more than Anno 2070. Still, earlier games (starting with 1602 even) are all better in my opinion.\nThe game HAS some good potential and is fairly enjoyable on the first biome. Even the tacked on combat is fairly ok the first few tries. (but not on the long run)\nThe combat gets VERY repetetive on the limited maps and objective types. You just don't really have any fun after you beat all maps at least once or twice, than it gets tedious. It is fully optional though, so just let us leave that be.\nIn the game you have quests. Some are ok (like in Anno 2070, time wasters), but in most cases you have to repeat same stuff all over again - tow ships, tow drones, find some ridiculously small items on the map and click it (outrage!) or meet economic criteria - which would be fine, but NO - you have to wait from 5 to 15 minutes for it to complete (can do other tasks in the meantime though).\n\nThan you have progressively unlocked biomes - Arctic and Lunar. Those are not really fun. All they do, is provide slightly different economy type and make it more difficult by having to build around factories (heat radius) or shields (anti-meteor shield on the Moon). All you get from that is different visual style and rarer resources, that you have to export to other biomes. And they never generate income (at least on normall or higher) - so the whole point is to build up/buy more temperate region biomes and use them as cash cows, so you can afford loosing hudred of thousands on arctic/lunar biomes. That makes them very unrewarding and as less you can build there, the better for you in general.\nEventually you will unlock energy transfer from the moon and ability to build HQ on your starting map (game goals).\nFor some weird reason, you have a money cap, dependent on your corporate level (so you can't generate cash in advance and one mistake can destroy your cashflow, no matter how high it would be).\n\nSo why the hell do I even recommend this game!? Becaue I spent some hours on it and don't really regret that. I liked some aspects of it, while I hated others, but I enjoyed it more than Anno 2070 at least. Keep in mind that many people disagree and like previous game better. It shares one thing with it's predecessor - it is too expensive for what it is.\n\nAlso, optimization is bad. I play on everything maxed, on GeForce 970 and i7 6700K, 16gb DDR4 3000mhz ram, and I get about 30-60 fps in normall play (mostly at 40-ish), and in combat when the flyby starts it can tank to 15 fps for a while. Not so much in normall play, but still.\n\nWith all that, game looks stunning, temperate biome building was pretty fun, other biomes frustrate a bit, but at least look different.\nThere is Voting mechanism (council) but it makes little sense to me.\n\nCombat is used to get extra rare materials (there are 4 types). Those can not be mined, can only be acquired through missions, combat, small amounts when you level up your corporate lvl and you can also send them by using a companion app (a minigame, where you connect 3 or more diamonds).\n\nAs for the minigame, it is optional and it gives some easy missions at start, but later it promotes heavily the use of premium currency. You have to be REALLY lucky to be able to beat later levels without spending ridiculous ammounts of cash (which in turn make every puzzle increadibly easy). I do not review the companion app itself, but it is an insult. Exist not just to promote and make the core game more fun, but to look for whales that will throw cash at it to progress.

At least to the point that I got to build the corporate office.  The tutor said at that point that I could stay and continue building. Im sure I missed a bit of the game flying through it like i did,,but, with no directions really, I was just trying to figure it all out. Next time through I'll take my time and enjoy all the little side missions and build up a bigger navel force.  At this point, I dont know where the extra content is, as I bought the gold version, but i'll have a look in the folder it downloaded to. I'm sure there are things I missed on the first run through. As of now i'd say wait for a sale. I dont see what the gold version really brings to the table, but this is my maiden trip to an Anno world, I don't have anything to compare this game to. Also, I never connected  to their server to trade with anyone. The graphics are very detailed and is very enjoyable to look at. I guess to sum it all up,,,,,This won't be my "go to" game,,,,but,,,,it is entertaining and I will play it from time to time. At this point I think I overpaid. Its a beautifully built sim with demands and a goal. My advise is,,,if this sounds like your cup of tea,,,take your time playing it the first time through and just enjoy the journey...........JMO,,,,,,that and a 5 bucks fifty will get ya a cup if coffee :-P         Just did some searching over the ole interwebs and,,,i guess all the extra content is yet to be released..Doh!

Very balanced and easy to pick up. The atmostphere is stunning : graphics and music. As in the previous title, this Anno does a great job in taking you through competitive market systems and complex, but not straining, assembly lines and trade routes. Some of the ideas for future products are creative and humoristic. The only downside is that it is rather finite. Once you've reached the top, there is not much else to do. The competitors' dialogues should also change more drastically as you progress but that's a minor detail. However, given they have already released a "Season Pass" for a future expansion, it is more probable that Ubisoft will be adding features to make it more "replayable"/"continuous" in the near future than not. Regardless, I would still recommend this game in its current state. 7/10","November 10, 2015","true","68.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thejadestorm/recommended/375910/","thejadestorm","TheJadeStorm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thejadestorm/","1301 products in account","I can not decide how I feel about this yet.  I've played quite a bit at this point, up to level 35 or something, and I'm pretty sure almost done with the campaign.  1602 being my favorite of the series, I miss a lot of the ... rawness?  For example one of the things I loved about the earlier Anno's was having to balance your population need materials with materials -you- needed.  That's all but gone in this.  The trade route handling via the "overworld" map doesn't feel nearly as rewarding as the earlier games where you literally were building ships and mapping them to routes.  Gone is the anxious and glorious feeling of "oh my god please tell me this NPC boat is bringing construction materials".  Gone is the frustration (but imo a good frustration) of your population grabbing the last of the construction materials right when you were about to build something.  Now, one thing I found is that if you go to each of your zones and in the bottom right click on the non-minimap icon, you will see a checkbox to have your people auto upgrade themselves.  I feel that this brings back a good deal of the feel of the population and you kind of "fighting" over goods.  It brings a lot more of a challenge in that you don't get to just go upgrade when YOU are ready, they do it when they are ready and therefore you end up finding out "oh crap I need more food now", which I think adds to the game.  The lack of randomized maps and lack of competition on ANY map doesn't feel right.  You are literally the only one in our zone map, aside from NPCs that give you quests -- no one else is colonizing on your same map.  No race to get the island that has the materials on it you need.  In fact there's no such thing as materials exclusive to a particular island (or zone of the same category) anymore.  If you didn't get an island that had diamonds on it in the past, well, you better go trade with someone who does or conquer them and take it -- in previous Annos if you want your Luxury goods filled.  You are easily self-sufficient in this one.\n\nNow, with all that said, I would actually recommend giving the game a shot.  If you can approach it with "this isn't the Anno I know" eyes, then I think you will find something enjoyable, at least for the first playthrough.  I do -not- think it has any replayability at all.. maybe in future DLC?  It's got a lot of interesting mechanics.  I'll also echo what some other folk have said, make sure you have an SSD.  You will get to a point where you bounce between zones quickly and that load time will make you want to jab a fork in your eye without an SSD.  At this point I have 4 zones (bought out a competitor's spot) and the game does appear to be beginning to get a bit laggy, but for the most part it's playing well.  Also if you give it a shot, try not to be discouraged early on.  I felt like I was being babysat for the first portion of the game with all of the main storyline stuff.  It was very linear and very easy at first.  I actually had a fairly negative opinion of the game until I got ... I'd say to a point where I had to start bouncing between the Arctic and Temperate zones.\n\nBut yeah, if you are going to spend your entire time going "this isn't Anno", then steer clear.  If you can put that away and look at it as a new concept, give it a shot!","November 10, 2015","true","17.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Period.\n\nIt isn't however an anno of the past, you don't lay out trade routes other than managing them electronically.\n\nI was a little offput by this at first but I remembered this is "multi-zone" play with 3 maps in each zone. (Temp, Arctic, Lunar). I have a suspicion that they simplified trade routes to avoid weird realtime cross zone trade issues that plague games like SimCity.\n\nOne issue im mixed on is the combat. Again, I believe they tried to make this a little more meaningful and in doing so took constant conflict out of the game in the form of a beatable foe and replaced it with combat quests. You can upgrade the given ships, but you always have those ships depending on your military level. I'm holding some hope that eventually they will give you a non quest zone military option.\n\nI'm holding firm that alot of the complaining is unfounded. 2205 is a solid foundation for innovation not only of this game but the series as a whole.","November 10, 2015","true","25.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

While some may consider this as a bad thing, I'm the kind of player that always make peace with everyone on the map anyway.\n\n- Good tool and UI: Building moving and mass building by click-and-drag are long awaited feature. UI is simple, friendly, and clean.\n\nCons:\n- Too few game mode: Only one career mode is available for now, though it contains all this game is to offer.\n\n- Lack of vehicle customization: You can upgrade your ships, but not like in previous games when you can apply different items and modules to them. No research to enhance them either.\n\n- Trading Route inefficiency: Now you can only send one ware at a time and pay hefty toll for it. I really like the trading mechanism back then, which you can prepare your own ship and freely trading around. Though managing route is one of the main chanllenge in this game.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a bold move for a long lived series like Anno. They planted a lot of new mechanism to this game while some concept may still in its infant I think, but I look forward to the future of them. Blue Byte is always one of my most respected teams, and I trust them can make another peak of this series.\n\nTL:DR\n\nRecommended: A great game for newcomers and STG lovers with much detail, but not so similar to the old Anno.

Anno 2205 is a game with huge ups and massive downs, and to me, neither really outweigh the other.\nThe biggest mistake to make is going into this game and expecting it to be "The next Anno game". It simply changed it's formula too much for that, though some base elements are definitely still there. So let's divide up the good and the bad, from my personal point of view.\nThe Good:\n+ The game looks fabulous. No ifs and buts about it, even on my mediocre system it looks stunning.\n+ Building feels more free. While some may call the lack of min-maxing a down, I like having some freedom in my citybuilders.\n+ Easier to see how much is produced by your buildings. They do take it a bit too far, you don't need to keep an eye on your storage anymore just on how much is coming in, but I like that buildings now tell you how much of other resources they need.\n+ HUGE areas to build on. 2070's islands were just too small, sadly.\n+ The moon...oh god the moon. Beautiful.\n+ The music is amazing. It doesn't take over the game, it's just there and works perfectly, sticking in your mind for hours afterwards.\n+ Ability to move built buildings. No more misclick -> Having to demolish and rebuild a tile away.\nThe Bad:\n- No "skirmish" mode. Every game is a full campaign, along the same maps, and they all start you out on a small island before you can expand.\n- Lack of diplomacy. There's just no real reason to keep up good relationships with the other companies.\n- No real trade. Yes, you can trade between your sectors and you have to do so, but you don't build a fleet for this, it just happens by just setting them on the overview screen. Trade with other companies? Nope.\n- Lack of an own fleet. I like building my own fleet and taking it to war when needed. Here I'm restricted by how big my company is. Not a fan.\n- War missions. They're on the same few maps and quite repetitive, with dull sidequests. Fun the first three times, but then quickly loses it's luster.\n- No Multiplayer. I also can't see how they'll implement this ever, given the way the various regions work.\n- Could do with some optimalization. A driver update helped, but I hope they'll go the extra mile here.\n\nAll in all, am I disappointed? Not really...I'm just not exactly thrilled either. I'm giving this a very cautious thumbs up and hope they'll implement a few good changes in the near future. If this all looks too negative to you, don't buy it.

This would be a good  “starter” game if you are interested in this type of game. I like how all the sectors are connected however they are played and managed independently. I also like that the simulation runs for the entire “world” while in-game; not just the currently loaded sector. The military play leaves something to be desired, although you can play through the entirety of the game and never touch the combat missions. I suppose it was the best way to separate the combat play from the city building play. I would have liked to see more “coupling” of the city/resource management and the military stuff.

It is not fair that people review this game against some preconceived idea of what they think the game should be. It's even worse since they knew what the game would be before release as it was well publicized.\n\nThe game in it's own right is amazing.\n\nUnlike the previous Anno's in this one resources are now flow resource, instead of gathering in a warehouse. I think this is a great change as you have so much more control. Resource gathering is fine for games with a micro scale where you manage a small city but do it in great detail. In this game you manage multiple cities on a macro scale, so flow resource makes more sense.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about multiplayer. I don't think that is fair as this game is intended to be played over many days/weeks. It will take a while to build up large cities. How will that work with multiplayer? It's a city builder so multiplayer doesn't make sense.\n\nA lot of detail exists in this game. People giving negative reviews seem to overlook the effort the developers put in, not fair.\n\nSome people are saying they played 20 hours and have done everything there is to be done. To those people I send my condolences. Once you get your city big enough things start to get very complicated. It becomes an incredible balancing act between production, supply and income. Your trade network can get very complicated.\n\nI've seen many complaints about the game not having random maps. But lets be honest, the previous anno's didn't really  have random maps, it was the same islands over and over again, they were just slightly in a different position every time. You can't have random maps and meaningful maps at the same time. This game has meaningful maps, and they are so large that it really doesn't matter. Even more the amount of time you will spend in a single game, random maps also becomes irrelevant. The maps have so much detail and is incredibly beautiful, they deserve praise.\n\nThe game does have sandbox mode, the campaign is the sandbox. the first few missions is just to get you started on your sandbox experience.\n\nPeople complain about the naval battles, but these are entirely optional and are only for rewards, that you can get in other ways. This is a city builder not a RTS. The battles are fine for the type of game.\n\nI only have two complaints about this game:\n\nThe world market needs work as it is a bit unbalanced. But since you can completely ignore it in your game and still be very successful, it's not that big of a complaint.\n\nThere seems to be a bit of a memory leak if you play for a long time, that slows down the game. Restarting the game solves the problem though.","February 3","true","255.3"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

I've played the original ANNOs and loved the previous one a good bit, but I still have to say that while this is not the ANNO that the others were, it still has a charm of its own.   Its still an ANNO game without being the overly complex time sink that the other ANNOs could be, meaning that it has been simplified down so you know just what your people need and how to make it with out having to guess that I need x Production building for x amount of production building to get me out of a hole.  To me this game makes it easier with knowing what you need and how much is being produced with out comprimsing the difficulty of the game itself to much.  I've noticed alot of people (Not All before some of you put on your Comic Book Guy braid and jump on your BBS) who complain the most about the game proabbly havn't played it long enough, or played it on extreamly easy to find that it can get hairy at times when your trying to expand and find yourself with 30 minutes to drag yourself out of a 5k hole while trasporting 5 bioenhancer units to your headquarters for a whopping 3k just to try and pull yourself out of that hole.  There's deapth to the game, its just not right there right away.\n\nWhile I am happy that I don't have to worry about Combat on the mainbuilding side, I never really enjoyed trying to balance the needs of the citizenry while trying to maintain a fleet just because Boris was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was sucking up to much oil instead of buying it from him, the way the combat is placed in the game is kinda meh.   The Difficulty for the combat is difficult to scale, on easy its way to easy, on medium it can get pretty hairy unless your going back after you're pretty much maxed out, and the Hard mode can just be rediculous.\n\nPeople complain about the lack of a Mulitplayer, but honestly now adays those same people complain that Solitair wasn't Multiplayer.  The game holds its own with out having to worry about trying to find a 'match' and then hope you can keep someone around for the hours it takes to build a successful Corporation.  With the way combat is managed in the game Mulitplayer would either be a Multi Day affair with one person you'd have to schedual with, or a series of short RTS Ship combat that, and lets face it, in the end would either be boosted by a paywall or would get full of hacks that would ruin it.\n\nI would still recommend this game to those that enjoy Management games that have alittle bit of story included, and while there are fewer maps in the game, the build area is larger letting you create that city you want much easier.  I might say that if you are still on the fence about the game, watch some videos of the game, and wait for a sale if your concerned about the price tag.\n\nAnother Up for the game is that we will be getting some DLC soonish, I am looking forward to the Tundra area moreso then the spacestation building DLC, but still can't wait to see just what these will add to the game and the story being told.","January 1","true","108.7"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

This game is beautiful and runs very well.\n(+) Gameplay has been streamlined. Trade is no longer a mess and is sent between sectors, rather than islands.\n(+) Map design is very good. Sector projects add a much needed end goal.\n(+) Building radii have been done away with in favor of a much more interesting supply system.\n(+) The UI has been given a much needed facelift. It provides much more meaningful information and ensures a much better experience in handling production and supply chain management.\n(+) Being able to move and adjust buildings AFTER you've placed them is a huge improvement.\n(+) Sound design and soundtrack are both improved.\n\nNEGATIVE:\n(-) Combat is restrictive and relegated to zones that exist outside of your economic empire. You will never feel threatened.\n(-) The variety of buildings you can construct in each environment is fairly limited.\n(-) The lack of a map generator, skirmish mode, and competitive AI rips a lot of replay value from the game. (DLC?)\n(-) The lack of disasters and ecological consequences strips a large element of surprise/challenge from the game.\n\nCONCLUSION: 8.5/10\nAll things considered, this is a very strong entry into a long line of complex city-building games. Many veteran players may dislike the streamlining of the gameplay and feel like a lot of the challenges have been stripped out, but they will find different challenges coming into play in the late game. If you liked Anno games beforehand, but felt the complexity was a bit burdensome, you will love Anno 2205. Likewise, if this is your first entry into the series or even city-building games in general, you will find a lot to appreciate.","November 9, 2015","true","103.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noblelyon/recommended/375910/","noblelyon","Lyon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noblelyon/","131 products in account","ANNO 2205 is a different beast from it's predecessor. Most notable among gameplay improvements is a virtual stockpile of goods; the game focuses on this mechanic of creating positive balances, and most other changes to core gameplay have been made around this one significant improvement over the last ANNO game. Skilled players will be able to balance their production at +0 and then focus on other maps, shutting out their competition and claming the free world for their own.\n\nThe graphics are really nice. Major improvement. Some of the buildings are re-used from the last game though, minus points for that.\n\nCertain aspects of the game have been removed, but it's overall improved. For example, I can't find any sort of multiplayer in this game, but the online play for 2070 was clunky at best and perhaps it's worst feature. With the removal of a military presence and splitting the game out over different sector-maps, multiplayer is unlikely to return. Good riddance.\n\nSpeaking of the military aspects of the game, they have been shunted into side missions. In these side missions, you control a small (what do you call 7 vessels? A platoon? squad?) of  sea ships with different but well-balanced and amusing weapons in order to claim the mission's main objective and collect 'rare resources' vital to improving your settlements. If you aren't building modules: you really should be. Modules are really what was missing in 2070: the ability to upgrade production buildings and streamline chains in bulk rather than building 10 or 20 individual factories.\n\nAnnoyances? When you have to switch between maps, there is a small load time. However, as much as the developer has tried to segregate maps from each other, there is still some resource bleed. I can feel my game becoming sluggish the longer I play with 10+ trade routes and a civilization on all of the maps. The region maps are pretty samey, If I'm not paying attention I can accidentally spend up to 10 minutes on the wrong sector. Really wish they had put a little more effort into making the maps visually unique. The "tech races": Moon and arctic, often carry negative income balances by default, unable to pay for themselves without their supporting temperate race. This is a pretty glaring oversight.\n\nOverall, this is a good buy. Worth the money. Should keep you entertained for a long time.\n\n","January 8","true","23.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I disagree, with some notes below:\n\nTrade Routes:\n-Resources and energy are now shared between your islands on a map.\n-You have different biomes (potentially 3 of each biome) that can all trade with one another.\n-Once you have several different biomes with lots of different population classes each I promise the trade routes are still challenging and you hve to get certain types of entire maps to focus on producing one or two goods.\n\nResource Balances:\n-This allows you to upgrade your population class, quickly see the new requirements, and then race to provide them by working backwards.\n-The neat cretive aspect is that you know eactly how many of what you need to build, and you have limited rare resources, so the puzzle game still exists, but you are less likely to overbuild.\n\nDifferent Biomes:\n-I like the temperate biome for the graphics. I like the Arctic/Lunar mechanics but not the aesthetics. They seem to be just places to set up resource chains.\n-The objective of the game for me is to create the most sprawling temperate megacities that I possiby can. Lunar and Arctic biomes are sort of like side puzzles that I have to solve in order to create the ultimate temperate city.\n\nCombat:\n-I don't like the combat in this. But who ever buys Anno games for combat?\n\nNo Continuous game:\n-Yes there is. The campaign can be largely ignored as can the combat missions.\n-Part of the idea of just drag dropping everything is there so you can haphazardly advance through the story then go back and opimize later once you have advanced. This is a good thing.\n\nDifficulty:\n-Creating and balancing a huge megacity remains challenging. Producing enough energy to efficintly maintain all of the production chains in the different biomes is difficult, especially when you are first starting out on a map.\n-Losing the game is difficult but it always has been.

I disagree, with some notes below:\n\nTrade Routes:\n-Resources and energy are now shared between your islands on a map.\n-You have different biomes (potentially 3 of each biome) that can all trade with one another.\n-Once you have several different biomes with lots of different population classes each I promise the trade routes are still challenging and you hve to get certain types of entire maps to focus on producing one or two goods.\n\nResource Balances:\n-This allows you to upgrade your population class, quickly see the new requirements, and then race to provide them by working backwards.\n-The neat cretive aspect is that you know eactly how many of what you need to build, and you have limited rare resources, so the puzzle game still exists, but you are less likely to overbuild.\n\nDifferent Biomes:\n-I like the temperate biome for the graphics. I like the Arctic/Lunar mechanics but not the aesthetics. They seem to be just places to set up resource chains.\n-The objective of the game for me is to create the most sprawling temperate megacities that I possiby can. Lunar and Arctic biomes are sort of like side puzzles that I have to solve in order to create the ultimate temperate city.\n\nCombat:\n-I don't like the combat in this. But who ever buys Anno games for combat?\n\nNo Continuous game:\n-Yes there is. The campaign can be largely ignored as can the combat missions.\n-Part of the idea of just drag dropping everything is there so you can haphazardly advance through the story then go back and opimize later once you have advanced. This is a good thing.\n\nDifficulty:\n-Creating and balancing a huge megacity remains challenging. Producing enough energy to efficintly maintain all of the production chains in the different biomes is difficult, especially when you are first starting out on a map.\n-Losing the game is difficult but it always has been. Just advance within your limits and you will be fine. I rarely lost games of Anno 2070 or 1404 either. It is just a matter of how impressive you can make your city and Anno 2205 has still made this challenging.\n\nIn the end, I wish I was as motivated to perfectly optimize all three biomes.

The heavy quest-line limits your every move until you find yourself just giving in to their whims. What this game lacks in strategy is simply emphasized by what it lacks within simulation. Anno 2205 comes off as a beautiful game to watch, and definitely something you can sink a few (many?) hours into, but at it's core, it is too easy and too predictable. I would rate it 3/5. If you are a strategy- and sim-freak like myself, this game offers very little that the previous titles didn't offer (while the previous ones did it better.) It is simply Anno in the future, dumbed down.\n\nThen again, the mindless repeatition was somewhat relaxing, and the graphics were beautiful. If you are short on cash, other games might be for you, but I will still reccomend giving this game a try. Hardcore sim/strategy? No. Decent game? Definitely. Worth the money?

It depends on what you want out of an Anno title. If you like multiplayer, deep-end game content, or random maps... you won't find that here. If you like a city builder with the ability to tinker with production chains and gradually build a sparwling city over multiple zones, this game might be fun for you. I'm recommending this game because it isn't BAD, though I find it inferior to Anno 2070. If you aren't bored with Anno 2070, though, stick with that.\n\nThe beginning starts out simple, but once you get through the tutorial "crisis mission", modules unlock. Which means all the careful optimization and building placement is back for you to play with.\n\nMoreover, the module system in 2205 gives the player more options to optimize than 2070, because each core structure (like the rejuve injection building) only reaches its best production when both production and maintenance modules are place by the player. They take up space and can be chained extreme distances to conform to terrain. I was surprised by how much fun I had with it in practice.\n\nCities can grow larger than in 2070. I find it noticably easier to use than the trade route screens used by 2070. The lack of any real threat (no combat in the city zones) makes growth a simple matter of time though- there are no external factors that can force you to change your plan. After I played for a bit, this lack became a real detriment. Without an external impact causing you to react, the game is just a puzzle to figure out. A pretty puzzle, but a puzzle all the same.\n\nEnd-game content is sadly sparse. Once you reach the energy generation buildings on the moon, the game is simple. Place generators, beam power to surface ad infinitum, and expand till boredom kills desire to play. There is no tech research with the chance to find rare modules like in 2070, nor is combat possible in the main city zones. The removal of combat to separate crisis zones means you can safely ignore them- the rewards are trivial for the time investment. Having unique reward possible through combat or some research mechanism would have helped the end-game for sure.\n\nThis version of Anno is more zen builder than strategy game, because there are never any threats or race to react to what the comp or another human player is doing. Because of that, long-term replayability is low for me. But, if you are looking for a zen builder, this could be what you are looking for.\n\nTechnically, the game isn't perfect- I'm experiencing significant slowdown after an hour or so of play, requiring a restart of the program.\n\nUplay Comment: I'm not a fan of Uplay being required (I already have steam for DRM and extra features), but the current implementation hasn't caused any game-breaking problems for my computer this time. YMMV, of course.","November 5, 2015","true","88.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

Make no mistake about it.\n\nBut is it a successor to Anno 2070?   Probably not.\n\nNow I must admit, I arrived in the "Anno" series quite late, 2070 was the first I ever played. And even in that, by the time I bought it, I got it as a Steam bundle with all of the DLCs etc. And it is quite possible, this set the bar for my expectations for 2205 too high. In 2070 there were tonnes of missions, a main story line, random maps and so on - so many angles to play, so much variety. 2 Main factions to choose from, and an reaching the top tech tiers was genuinely challenging.\n\nIn comparison, 2205 seems very empty. Only a main storyline to play through, not much point to keep going once you complete it, no factions to choose from for replayability. In short, it desperately needs DLC, and lots of it. It feels more like a game engine than a game, at times.\n\nBut all this aside, 2205 is a great game. It is only in comparison with its predecessor that it comes out lacking. Had I never played 2070, I would have enjoyed 2205 from start to finish and never given it much thought.\n\nNot worth its full price tag however, not by a long shot. There´s simply not enough game to justify the price. Buy it on sale.\n","December 26, 2015","true","46.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Im going to set this up as follows, description of what the game is, pros, cons, summary.\n\nThis game is basically is a production chain, corprate city builder. What that means is you need recourse x and recourse y to get recourse z (x+y=z, as well having to build a city to house your employees. This is standard for anno games. There is a combat element as well. This game is very similar in essance to Tropico games if you are looking for a comparison.\n\nPros\n- Multiple Environments (i.e. Temperate, Artic, and Lunar)\n- Easy access for new to anno players\n- Streamlined menus\n- Great graphics\n- Ease of jumping from location to location (environments)\n- Simplified trade systems\n- New economic emphasis\n- Very well polished and complete\n\nCons\n- Very shallow combat\n- Lack of weight to A.I. Competitors\n- No "true" continuous mode\n- Trade to A.I. basically non existant\n- No real weight to fleet managment\n- Lack of weight to Corporation value (i.e. stock price)\n\nSummary\n\nWhat this game does right in my opinion out ways what it does wrong. Lets start with what it does wrong. Combat is terribly shallow requiring no real thought or prep. You are just given ships to command and you go and click on what you want them to shoot. Now I dont think they are to far off the mark with the shell of combat in this game. A few tweaks could make combat worth while. If they bring back the ability to build your own ships as well as upgrade them properly with experience to each vessel it could be fun to send them out and have them return to port and you be able to view them there but as of now that doesnt exist. A.I. is basically just present corporations they seem to do anything other than exist as benchmarks for your progress. This ties in with corporate value and trade, if they would make the A.I. corporations dynamic as in directly competing for trade routes and stock sales as secondary income as well as bringing back hostil take overs from Anno 2070 it could be very interesting. One of the biggest complaints I have seen is no "true" continuous mode. Now the game itself is a continuous game framed around a basic campaign. It would be nice how ever to have the options to turn off all the talk and just to let you run the city without interuption.\n\nNow the good. First off this game is very well polished. It looks great and runs well. For players new to the Anno series this is probably the best place to start as the menus and systems are streamlined and easy to figure out. The new environments create diversity among the maps. The way you jump from location to location is done well as you dont feel as if you are being pulled out of the game to load. The new much more economic and city building emphasis works well. I prefer the new streamlined menues to the old Anno games just because they are quick and easy to look at, no more clicking warehouses to see what I need to buy and sell. The trade is also quicker, as you just set up the locations and go. A bit more depth would be nice but it works well. There is little more to say here other than I find this game to be very enjoyable. I think with the right tweaks this game like Anno 2070 will be fantastic. Anno 2070 started a little on the weaker side but was tweaked well.\n\nTo conclude if you are new to Anno I do not think you will go wrong here. Its enjoyable and has depth with out being overwhleming. If however you are an Anno veteran, it may be worth while to wait and let the expansions tweak the game to a more desirable level, particularly the combat and, stock systems. Again those are in depth features that veterans will know and wont really affect the quality of play for new players.","November 8, 2015","true","23.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The UI is great, the ability to move buildings and upgrade them instead of building more is awesome. However this game is an odd mix of "wow thats cool, but i wish xyz were back" i will give some examples:\n\n-New combat feel and design is awesome BUT no longer part of the main map and feels like there is no lasting meaning to it. AND its no longer part of construction chain. There is no more balacing building your army and advancing your corporation. The biggest complaint, though, is not having the army on the main map protecting your water ways. Big let down.\n\n-New building system is AWESOME, but all the complicated nature of managing specific goods is gone. this is a large part of what made anno, anno. So it is a critical gameplay component missing.\n\n-Cannot attack other NPC and fight over the space you hold. This would have been perfect to go with the less complicated nature of supply chains. I was expecting more action because of it, but no. Its just less complicated overall with nothing to show for it but snazier UI.\n\n-no mutiplayer. Seriously guys? Anno is one of those games that you sit down with a few good friends and just relax and play for hours. So i could honestly get passed a lot of the changes if there were mutiplayer...\n\nI am looking foward to how the game grows as the company said they have heard the critisisms so we will see.","December 5, 2015","true","25.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Fundamentaly different previous instalments, this game offers the very bare bones concept of the Anno series.  Its more an econmey managment game more than a city builder but not by alot and in its root is a city builder.  For those of you who don't know the Anno series, and Anno 2205, is a city-building/eco managment game where we build a city a supply your citizens needs at increasing difficulty.  While Anno 2205 is the same principle and fun at that, it feels to watered down to appeal to newcomers, I have no problem with that its that the execution is not great.\n\nFirst off the game is just in general just way too casual.  Farm buildings are now just one building(unless you count the building modifications) compared to previous games that had fields to place down and made you think about the best solution.  You can build houses anywhere which is an ok thing.  The new way of goods distrubition is ok and didn't need to change at all.\n\nI really just hate the artic region and really prevents me from wanting to go back and make a new session becuase it is just so slow and stupid.  You can only build housed near heat sources which are always production centers.  So you are constantly building industry which you can't support.  I understand the challenge of the artic, but its too much and too far from any interesting gameplay becuase it feels like a burden, just like the boring combat which is neccesary to move on with the game.\n\nNow one big change that just removes my ability to consider this Anno game to be one the caliber of others is that the lack/reinvetion of trade and goods movement.  Taxing trade routes would have a really neat idea if the game had NPCs that interacted with you at all or had interregional trade.  The new trade system removes ship routes from island to island and replaces it to super simple trade.  Trading with the only NPC in the game, Mr. Spaceport man, is almost, scratch that, is actually completely pointless.  Becuase of the tax on trade goods combined with the amount you need to produce and the cost of producing said goods is so expensive that the trade goods negate any income or profit, the only goods worth it are high tier goods which are even more expensive to make so there is literaly no point and if they didn't allow to sell your goods it would make no difference in gameplay.\n\nAll in all, that fact that the game fails to capture many big and small details and gameplay elements it just waters down the game and make it feel sub par.  For newcomers and veterans alike, the game is fun and worth it, though lacking features and replayability compared to the others.  It is fun and worth buying, but serioulsy Blue Byte/Related Designs, if the Anno series dosen't return to its roots in the next game that consider me and many customers gone from the series.","January 14","true","43.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I love the idea of Moon bases, when I first heard of it, but playing the game it really is just another base that has slightly more challenging environment than Arctic. The graphics in this game are 10/10. I love every detail. Very futuristic and educational on how resources, which kind and how much are used. Sound design is also 10/10, plus the music. Very well done. The part that didn't amaze me was the battles and wars you have to fight. They all seem to be the same, with just different level of challenge. I though that game could have had better storytelling to that point. Winning the game also doesn't give you any indication, I've played very long and pretty much at the point of winning all skills and challenges, but the game just continues. With maybe, more enjoyable missions, shorter battles and more storytelling to the war/resistance, this game will be 10/10. At this point it's more like 7/10 for me. Still highly enjoyable.","January 16","true","49.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

You can turn of the point with collecting stuff. If you play on the highest rank it's harder to be in the plus and the main key of Anno is still there. To build a civilisation without going to the bad balance.\nMillitäry is a bit off map in a single mission. For me who wants to build without disturbing it's nice. I didn't really liked the fight for your island and hope your enemy isnt better than you So i normally turned off the enemies. :)\nAnd you still need traidingrouts, but they are a bit different from the first Anno's. You dont make a route and put a ship on it. You make it on a world map and say how much the need to transport.\nBut its true that the longterm motivation isnt really given. But thats for me at all Anno's.\n\nA littel overview (personal thinking):\nPros:\n- a long campain\n- many sidequests to get rare resources\n- free mobile app to farm rare resources and send them to the game\n- 3 different sectors (normal, artic and moon) with different states\n- every map with a unic sector project\n- finally (if you dont have turn it off due difficulty level) can move buildings instat of destroying and new building\n- crisis sectors (military missions) in different maps so no impact on your civilisation\n- finally (I jumped of happieness) you can see if you produce enough supplies or need more\nYou can see if your stock is rising, dont having change or sinking and in which ammount\n\nCons:\n- only 9 maps (3 per sectors)\n- only 1 ship per map\n- no custom/random maps\n- only campain no mp with others (you could compare your companies)\n- no longterm motivation except achives\n- it's not like the old ones\n\nAt least I can say that if you want to build your civilisation and want to have a few problems with getting higher you can play this game good on Expert. If you want something like the first few Anno's you should keep your hands off this game :)","January 31","true","38.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I also think the game is still fairley challanging anyway. It costs alot to manage so many different cities and regions.\n\nOn that note though it dose lag behind in some aspects especially the naval combat which gets very repetitive.

In doing so, i think i forgot how easy anno 2070 was for the first couple of hours too. As i soon found out, Anno 2250 does indeed become challenging. At a glance, the simplification of trade routes and the lack of units by which to manage them seemed a big disappointment to me too. By the time I was maxing out my arctic colony and ranking up my lunar population it became apparent why. The amount of resources you will be ferrying between sectors can get dizzying, and I had more of them then i needed to accomplish everything than i did  in Anno 2070. By the time I really got things cooking in the late stages, It was clear that the simplification of trade routes was actually something I was glad for. If I had to micromanage the transports to much too, it would be overwhealming.

The lack of units, and being confined to only naval combat (no real air units) just dosent hold up, for anyone apparently. It might as well be a mini game on an iphone. Its lame, and I found myself really missing my air units and submarines from Anno 2070.\n\nOn its own this game is actually great. Its really hard for fams of the series to allow it to stand on its own, when its title demands it be compared in every way to its predacessor.

And before anything else: Uplay was not an issue.\n\n--------CON--------\nAdmittedly, aspects of this game are indeed a bit too simple. There is no longer a need to control Ecobalance (of which I actually found to be the most fun) or manage your production chains as much; instead of having to check your stocks and add storage to see how much resources your growing islands need, you look at a tab integrated into the UI and do simple arithmetics to see how many more production chains do you need. Also quite a large disappointment is the fact that I can't now manage to sell stuff to NPC's by building my own boats or wage wars by building my own airplanes; micromanaging your own transportation route was so much fun, and the lack of that ability is indeed disappointing.\n\nOverall, this means that there is less to do to manage your enterprise. You sort of just keep on plopping down stuff, check spreadsheet, make sure your balance is high and keep on plopping down stuff. Anno 2070 for me was plopping down stuff constantly as well, but aside from the plot efficiency managing, you also had to think a bit more about how to organize your transportation routes and so forth.\n\n--------MEH--------\nCrisis sectors are the only real places of combat. Although this means that at least you don't have to worry about your islands being ruined, they didn't need to have taken out normal ship-building as well...\n\nQuests... eh, they're sort of like the previous game. You pick up stuff, you find stuff, you hand it to the quest giver and get some resources or cash. Playing on standard, this often gives you a lot of rare resources, of which sometimes you may not need, but having is better than not having I guess.\n\nPersonally, I'm ok with having no coast buildings other than the slot ones. However, I would've liked to control where I placed my own port... the slots they give often requires you to place extra long roads to connect, and with the fact that you can't build warehouses to control your transportation this forces you to tie everything into the same road network; production layouts that was closed on the outside like in 2070 now requires extra roads to connect and nothing on the interior other than expanding your building.\n\n--------PRO--------\nAs much as people say gameplay over graphics, the graphics is ABSOLUTELY WUNDERBAR. Like, certainly the most beautiful city-building game out there at the moment. The temperate region is ok, but the chilly arctic and the foreign moon just completely blew me away... and I was running on low with reduced resolution, as a Macbook Pro isn't exactly designed for gaming. The visual attention to details as well as the small audio blips, like from the last game, really adds the sense of immersion in this game, to the point where when I get my desktop back I'm going to just have a monitor dedicated to only run the game in postcard mode and turn on the day-night cycle.\n\nAlthough the plot is fairly weak, the game was never about plot; bits and pieces of carry-over from 2070 gives a good feeling, seeing humanity recover from the great disaster that set the stage for 2070.\n\n--------ENDING WORDS--------\nOnce again, I never played previous Anno games other than 2070. Even compared to 2070, this game is a fairly simple game that, indeed, doesn't have that much depth. This certainly makes the game less challenging; however, I personally enjoy the less amount of things to think and worry about, as I want to play a game to relax and have a good time. With its clear UI, simplified mechanics and the stunning graphics, I can definitely recommend this game. Maybe not so much grabbing it right now, but when it's on sale some times later I'd say that this game is definitely worth it.","November 3, 2015","true","58.1"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","10","25","0","1"

The one thing they did away with was the stockpile, as other reviews said. I actually quite enjoy this to be honest. I previously experienced this style of gameplay in Grand Ages: Rome, and I thought it was an improvement, as it meant "resources" would flow instantly, instead of having to wait for an individual unit to travel from island to island, and it gave me a firm grasp on where production was having problems along the supply chain, instead of having to figure out that Factory X is only producing at 80% because it doesn't have enough input.\n\nThis will probably get a ton of hate, but I never liked having to deal with trade ships in Anno. It ususaly meant that I had to either constantly decide how much a ship would take off of one island to keep the balance between the two, or I would just build dedicated resource islands whose sole purpose was outputting the maximum ammount of resources or goods to the main island.\n\nI've read in reviews that people complain that the city building aspect is gone, and I have to ask, was there ever really one in the first place? Place houses around a city center and level them up with goods and buildings was probably all the depth Anno had in the first place, and that's all still in this game. Labor actually matters this time around however. You need to have enough people to run your buildings or production lags behind.\n\nAll in all, I do feel like this is a huge departure from the previous Anno games, and that always creates hate. Remember the rage when Civ 5 first came out? The lack of unit stacking turned Civ into a board game it was said. Well, I think that same kind of hate is being applied here.\n\nSo personally, I find that there are changes I like, changes I dislike, but I find the ones I like outweigh the ones I dislike.","November 3, 2015","true","16.4"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","8","21","0","0"

Here, Russians can choose only russian, which is well translated but still, i prefer to have a choice in a matter, especially when i paid more money than for Legendary Witcher III Wild Hunt. Overall i have issues with Ubisoft and how they ruin their games, than with Anno itself.

Well, I have 16.3hr in record already and here is my review.\n\nFirst of all, the concept itself worth the 80$ for me already. (Yah it sounds silly but futuristic is just my type, it gives hope)\nAnd space elevator and He-3 sort things, they are really possible to make; unlike Photon Torpedo or light saber, they look cool but doesn't sound scientifically possible at all. You can tell that developers did put effort in researching these things.\n\nBut seriously, although I do think it's a awesome game, it doesn't really worth 80$ or even 60$ at current stage for most gamers. All you can do is to repeat the same thing on different difficulty, but really the same. No multiplayer; single player itself is basically a combination of both  campaign and free built but neither systematic stories were told nor total freedom was achieved. Same nine maps all the time. For it's graphic, and name, probably 40$ at maximum. You can just find a camera and take a screenshot of your city, and all of them can be your wallpaper. But again, gaming experience doesn't solely come from graphics, the game simply lacks playability, in terms of how much money you paid to play.\n\nSome gamers complain about micromanagement and others stuff were being removed. I think developers just wanna reduce difficulty and complexity of the game. I mean, man, managing three four islands on same map was hard enough already in 2070, now you telling me to manage ships and space ships on nine maps at same time? That's gonna make me noxious at least. So, those who are actively looking for ANNO 2070 '135 years later' expansion, this is totally a new thing, probably not for you. But for those city builder lovers who do not like to manage ships run around islands to deliver goods, this is it.\n\nI wish expansions and updates would make this game better. Diablo3 was criticized when first released, but it did do better after several patches, so, who knows.\n\nAnd ubi better fix bugs.\n\nA detector drone or sensor drone, forgot what's the formal name, in the first mission of a sector project that extract graphene or something, won't work properly (at least in my case) it's detector is not working (not giving directions) at all, neither reloading sector map nor restarting game fixes it, and that means good bye to that project. Drones in all other missions work fine.\n\nOverall, it's a good game, but kinda lacks contents. Likely to make a lot of layers feel tedious after their first run, especially on easy difficulty. If you wish better gaming experience, buy it later when some thing new come out. Or just wait for ANNO 2313 or something if you just like typical ANNO game, observe how it goes.\n\nOr wait the complete edition and buy when it's just 20$.

I do miss a campaign mode instead of the sandbox where all the maps are combined into one. The graphics are amazing and there are so many buildings you can build. LOVE THAT. The moon was fun but a bit of a let down. There are only 2 lvl of people that you can get on the moon, which was the let down for me. I dont think the game is $60. Its more of a $40 game. If the DLC's came with the game and not be a DLC then this game would have been perfect for full price of $60.

Production/consumption rates of every item in the game are displayed, removing a lot of tedium and guesswork when setting up production lines.

I would like to share mine.\n\nI’m not really a fan of Anno games, but I do like city building / resource management games. I have played Anno 2070 for 265hours, finished all the hardest missions, and filling all the islands with endgame building monuments and modules for all 3 factions.\n\nI’ve been in Anno 2205 for about 3 hours. Much has been changed in this game. Resources are less modular and simplified, there is much less of needing to use your command ship to ship fixed amount of resource, most are done automatically. Your residence generate income, create workers supply, factories create more advance building materials to make next tier of buildings, and uses electricity and workers as maintenance. You build electricity modules to power all buildings, it simply cost income to maintain. Maintaining this 3 core resources seems to be the core of the resource management system, with much more advance building material in the late game.\n\nIn 2070, quest offered by npc are limitless. In 2205 there seems to be less quest offered, at least in early game, but they are much longer in chain, with the first quest resulting in being able to rebuild a dam offering lots of power resource. There are 3 regions to play in, each with multiple sectors, temperate, artic and lunar. Each sector has its own long line of projects to complete. The early intro quest extends to the late game from the start, guiding you in your entire game progression.\n\n\nThe combat in the game has been change. Instead of being in the sector where you build building, you join standalone missions and complete military missions with your fleet of warships. There are alot of variety in the different ships at your disposal. Modular upgrades that you can buy and place in your ship for extra bonus in various attributes from the previous game has been removed. Instead, each ships have multiple abilities, missile barrage, emp etc. Ships has utility abilities like repair and shield. This cost either limited uses or fuel, which is also limited. This can be replenished by fuel lying around the map or powerups that you can pick up with your ship to replenish ability use or fuel. By finishing assignments and missions, you gain military experience where you can permanently upgrade your military ships attributes or gain new ones. You also earn new rare resource iridium and graphene that can be used to upgrade your HQ or your factory with additional modules that boost productivity or becomes less taxing on worker use or power usage.\n\nMultiplayer has been removed, this game no longer has pvp support, though I wasn’t really interested in the pvp element of the previous game.\n\nOne huge impressive element in this game is the graphics. The islands and water in the game looks beautiful. The amount of artistic work placed in the futuristic theme is huge. All ships and buildings looks extremely high tech. Factories all have their unique looks from different regions. The military missions are much more explosive with the much more Arcady style of gameplay, with improvements in the fx effects etc. Large bridges extend and connects islands in the temperate region. Beautiful glaciers and artic mountains cover the artic region. Each sector also seems to be larger than in the previous games. All Sectors in different regions, including the lunar ones are all connected via the global map, which is where you can see the progress of other npc owned areas and also set up global trading routes from one sector to another.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed the game experience so far, and if you’re looking for a relaxing casual single player only game of city building mixed with military ship gameplay enhanced with gorgeous looks, I would recommend this game to you. (Will probably update this review as I play longer)\n\nEDIT: Been playing this for much more longer and game definitely has much more challenge.\n12 hrs in, not even close to filling up 1 sector, 1 game could possibly be 48hrs+\n\nEDIT: 1.4m+ population, this game is awesome.","November 3, 2015","true","85.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

However gives a fresh experience, many of us have been waiting for. Most Anno games in the past have just been the same thing over and over, with graphical updates, and set in a different Era. On previous versions there where many things to like, that were not put in this Anno.\n\nHOWEVER! That does not mean this (by any means) is a bad Anno experience. In fact, its a fantastic experience. Music is amazing, gameplay is very enjoyable, Story is much better then previous Anno games, and its overall just a great experience. A later DLC to add Skirmish is very likely, and when that fateful day arrives, the Anno fans of old, will get their fill. For now though, this game is great.\n\nDo not alter your opinion based on if its like the other Anno games. In alot of ways it is, and in alot of ways it is not. Never the less, the game is great as a whole, without compairing to the other Anno games. Don't let other opinions fool you, with judgements based on previous Anno games.","November 4, 2015","true","6.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

Instead of having only a number with the amount of goods in storage and a small arrow to mark if it is increasing or decreasing, they now show you much you actually get "overflowing". And you can see how much you have in storage by hovering over the resource.\n+ the UI is a lot sleeker now and hides a lot better everything, but at the same time gives you much information by a few button clicks. Wanna check how much goods is made/used up? One click. Also more emphazism on the different hot keys (a to promote, c to copy a building, d to destroy, m to move)\n+ the modular system is absolutely wonderful and gives new depth. You no longer "have to" put down all those farm bits for 100% working condition, but if you spend more place you can get up to 300-800% effectivity at the maintenence of 150-500%. It gives you new reason to attempt to build up a perfect system where everything fits a'la tetris.\n+ some smart small things, such as capability to press on a specificed sea or mountian spot and simply build what you want like that.\n\nCons:\n- the old trade system where you could use say one ship to transport six different kinds of things are completely gone. Whilst the new one is good I still wished we could somehow upgrade and make our transports bigger for having different kinds of material on same transport.\n- crisis zones are only really there since they choosed not to have war in your sectors, and that would be hard with war on nine different fronts, and the only us for them is to get rare materials, which you can later get with a project. Also they quickly become a chore.\n- the content amount maybe feels a bit to small. Yes there is nine projects you can do plus increase your military rank to new heights, but it quickly becomes the same old grind.\n- no multiplayer, in any form except for the world market that interacts with all players, also the Council.\n- as of right now, no random true sandbox maps. The nine maps are the ones you get.\n\nWhile yes Anno 2205 has deviated a lot and as many people say they have not followed the true spirit of the Anno games, I absolutely still love this. It is a fresh breath of air, giving us a new onlook from the old games. Anno 2205 is no clone, copy or retexture of any of the old games, as it is truly new mechanics. Do I say these mechanics are good? Well not always, but they are really all not that bad as some people would like you to believe. And the thing is the things we've lost to this Anno game is due to something we've all be screaming that we wanted, the multi-map system. For example the old trade system, setting them up in nine different sectors? Count me out. If you thought it could be complicated with one map and the old trade system, try nine with the old one. Also multiplayer (which we might see in the future?) I have to ask how they would implement it. Maybe through players having same company? Well the maps are now saved on your computer and there is very little usage of the internet and cloud. Most likely it would lag and in need of hosting from a certain computer. As the chosen computer probably would have to send information about all the different maps. And since there is nine maps right now only you cannot have another company.\n\nSo yea, I believe they done everything right to take the Anno series in a new direction, which I am interested to see how it will be because I believe, the multi-map system is here to stay, and that is for a long long loooooooong time.","November 3, 2015","true","52.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","4"

With Anno 2205 the developers take quite a different turn on the series.\n\nNow its much more a citybuilder with ressource management thown into there for good messure, while the struggle over getting the best islands has been completely dropped. The fighting component is technically still there but not really relevant anymore. Combat is done on completely seperate maps and the fleet you'll be fighting with is pre-built, you may only choose which units you want to upgrade. In addition there are a couple of "spells" you can use to support your ships. Anyway, the only use of combat is to aquire ressources used to upgrade buildings.\n\nAll production buildings are now modular, similarly to the farms in the earlier titles. To build the side buildings you need rare ressources, that you can get mainly through combat, side quests or the companion app for andriod or iOS (a match three style game).\n\nThey also cahnged the interface of your inventory, you are now presented with the rate of change of goods, rather then the amount you have stored, which helps setting up production chains. Further more goods dont have to be transported within the sector anymore, only between sectors (i.e. an arctic and a temperate map).\n\nSo all in all, would I recommend th game?\n\nIf you are the kind of player who always liked to build megacities in the past Anno titles, if you were just annoyed by the NPC stealing away islands from you, if you didn't really care for the combat system, if you'd like City Skylines or SimCity have some ressource managment aspect to it, then yes, definetly.\n\nIf you expect a Anno like they have always been, you might be disappointed.","November 7, 2015","true","21.0"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

I have now put over thirty hours into the game, and while I have enjoyed it and will be playing more I would like to outline to potential buyers what I feel are the pros and cons of this game are.\n\nPros -\n1) No microtransactions in game. Unlocks are earned by simply improving your corporation level or by unlocking them with uplay points which you earn by doing achievements.\n2) No game-breaking bugs. Game is very much playable, minus a few freeze ups here and there. Not enough to be frustrating though.\n3) Trade routes between cities are very easy to set up and keep organized and make changes to.\n4) Much more accessable and easy to get into for new players than any other anno game I have played. (I've played anno 1602, 1701, and dawn of discovery)\n5) With no pirates or enemies like previous Anno games had, there is no need to worry about your trade routes being attacked and production halted as a result.\n6) You can customize your difficulty in different areas. So for example if you want some parts to be hard but say have mission payout high to avoid grinding missions for rare resources you can set it up like that.\n7) With building cities in multiple regions you have to deal with unique, region-specific challenges which makes for fun gameplay.\n8) First dlc has been announced and is promised to be free.\n9) If you placed a building in the wrong spot, or a spot that is no longer effecent just pick it up and move it as you see fit.\n10) Production buildings all come with possible modules to either improve production, reduce worker requirment, reduce energy requirment, or reduce number of logistic trucks required.\n11) It is a more relaxed city-builder than others on the market. If you like the idea of a city builder but don't have to worry about sewage/water, or unemployment and polution this may be the city builder for you.\n\nCons-\n1) REQUIRES UPLAY EVEN IF YOU BOUGHT ON STEAM. YOUR GAME MUST BE ACTIVATED ON UPLAY AND UPLAY IS ALSO NEEDED TO SYCRONIZE YOUR SAVE GAME FILES.\n2) The isolated combat scenerios manage to be more boring than the previous anno game's combat. Sure it may require a little bit of strategy but essentially the same four combat missions repeat endlessly.\n3) You cannot set end-game goals like in previous games. Gone are the days of seeing that you won when you built that amazing cathedral or mosque. Now you just play until you get bored. This may not be a problem for some, but those of you wanting end goals to work for may not find that here.\n4) When you consider the game only ships with 3 temperate areas, 3 artic areas, and 3 moon areas the possiblity of replability is shot way down, especially when you consider that you can just buy the other areas in your first game. Essentially, once I get bored of the current game I see no reason to start a new game of anno 2205.\n5) No random map generator.\n6) You never interact with your competitors cities like you did in previous games, indeed you never even see their cities. Your "oponents" are just people you do missions for, or vote for to get bonuses. Great if you want to be left alone, not so much if you were wanting to trade or go to war with them as in previous anno games.\n\nIn conclusion, again, I do like the game and while it has a lack of replayability and interesting combat, the fact that I have gotten over 30 hours from just my first game and still have a few sector projects to complete yet in it is a decent sign. However, the current price point is something I am still not sure about. Someone said in a review that it is hard to reccomend paying $60 for a city-builder in a post-city skylines world. I have to aggree. Though what you should consider when comparing it to other city-builders is the fact that Anno 2205 is more relaxed. Allow me to explain. In Anno you do not have to worry about disasters, water pipes, intracite subways, effecent roads, crime, polution and so on. It is important to understand what kind of game anno is, and that is a supply-chain-management city-builder. So your people need food and many other items and you need to set up the right production chains to supply all goods, and as the game progresses the resources you need will need to come from the other regions. Basically, all you have to deal with is making sure your people have the items they need, makeing sure you have enough power, and making sure your have enough workers and making sure you have enough logistic trucks. Personally, while I did enjoy city sklyines, I could never get very far in it because so much went wrong and I am not good at dealing with setting up commute routes and all that other stuff. This is a much more relaxed and casual city builder. So allow me to some up my thoughts on this game in two sentances.\n\n"Anno 2205 is a decent and very peacful/relaxing city builder, but isn't great enough to pay $60 for. If you are interested put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale."","December 11, 2015","true","126.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

There is a decent variety of buildings to create, resources to farm, and plenty of things to do. With that being said, I feel as if something is missing. I can't seem to put my foot on it, but there is certainly a lack of something. Granted, I did play the previous Annos, and there was diplomacy, ground combat, trade routes, et cetera et cetera....but, I am speaking of this game in itself, NOT comparing it to it's predecessors. This game, within itself, is lacking content. There is no denying that. However, this game is, without a doubt, a good game nonetheless. I enjoy it, and I can be rather choosy with my games. Anyways, I hope that was coherent enough to stomach. Here is my tl;dr:\n\nPros:\n- has good, quality content (where content can be found)\n- the visuals are absolutely incredible - seriously.\n- the ambient life added to cities is truly refreshing. From the mechs on the loading dock to the snow mobiles in the arctic, I keep on getting surprised by the little "hidden" details\n- I have experienced no bugs what-so-ever in my time playing\n- The game runs pretty smooth on my machine - granted, my machine is packing a gtx 970, 32gbs of ram, intel Core i7-4790k quad, eh you get the point. With this set up, the frame rate seems to drop in cutscenes. Not sure if that is my computers fault, or the games.\n- the variety of locations, flora, environments, etc is a nice touch. I rather enjoy the arctic, as you must face the difficulties of keeping your workers warm.\n\nCons:\n- This game lacks extensive content. What you see is what you get. Nothing more, nothing less.\n- You will be dissapointed with this game if you compare it to the previous installments (do not make that mistake)\n- I'm a war monger. I find the combat very stale. I wish there was more combat variety. Yes, it's the future, but this doesn't mean that ground combat wouldn't exist.\n- I feel rather alone in the world. In your colony/city mode, there are no neighboring nations. Just you and a bunch of unclaimed plots of land.\n\ntl;dr:\nI recomment this game to newcommers to the series, and to people who are willing to overlook the lack of content, and feel satisfied with the very in-detail, hidden jems within.","February 12","true","4.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Isso dá alguma credibilidade ao meu pequeno review de Anno 2205. Primeiramente, é bom esclarecer que o novo jogo é diferente do antecessor. Mas com um detalhe, ele continua tão divertido como antes. A cadeia de bens que deve ser montada e na sequencia levada aos benefíciários, ou seja, os habitantes, está mais racional. Anteriormente não se tinha uma noção mais precisa da quantidade de bens que deveriam ser transferidos para ilhas, o que muitas vezes fazia com que se produzisse determinado produto em quantidade maior do que a necessária, ocasionando desperdícios de toda ordem, e prejuízo de recursos valiosos.\n\nDessa vez o menu (UI) tem um papel fundamental na organização da produção, pois ele passou a ser exibido de forma dinâmica, permitindo ver rapidamente qual item está com a produção negativa, e qual está excessiva. Com isso fica mais fácil incrementar a quantidade de uma determinada comodidade e satisfazer assim todos os habitantes.\n\nNo lugar de criar uma vasta cadeia de transporte de uma ilha para a outra, em Anno 2205 a configuaração dos mapas foi  radicalmente alterada. Temos três ambientes distindos para explorar. Começamos num continente com clima temperado, depois passamos para uma região glacial e por último conquistamos uma parte da lua. Cada local possui sua própria infraestrura e economia, de modo que alguns itens do outro continente e do satelite da Terra são enviados de um lado para outro por meio de um ônibus espacial. No lugar dos navios, o transporte de bens é feito 99% das vezes por naves espaciais. Fantastico!\n\nAcabou-se aquela exigência por vezes irritante de suprir a cidade com bombeiros e hospitais, mas foram mantidos a delegacia de polícia e o centro comunitário, que diferentemente de Anno 2070, agora podem ser colocados em qualquer parte da cidade, abrangendo toda a área pelo número daqueles prédios administrativos no mapa, e não exclusivamente pela sua área de alcance somente.\n\nAs batalhas foram transferidas para um cenário espefico, permitindo que o foco do player se concentre apenas na construção da cidade e na produção das comodidades e na distribuição de bens. No decorrer e no final das batalhas - que são todas navais - se recebe como prêmio itens raros que não podem ser produzidos por fábricas, o que implica num modelo de grinding para certos melhoramentos. Por falar nisso, agora se ganha XP ao fazer as missões, e dependendo do seu nível serão destravados os blueprints e ampliação da capacidade de acumular recursos.\n\nO jogo não tem um modo "continuos game", mas até agora confesso que não senti falta dele. É na campanha que as coisas acontecem, e ela é imesa!\n\nComprei Anno 2205 no dia do lançamento por R$ 129,99 e valeu cada centavo. Recomendo fortemente o jogo para todos que são, assim como eu, fãs dessa série maravilhosa. Num primeiro momento alguns poderão estranhar as mudanças. Mas acredite, elas vieram para melhorar o que já era quase perfeito. A Blue Byte está de parabéns!\n\nPros:\n\n- A engine gráfica tornou o game absolutamente lindo. De longe é o jogo de simulação de cidades mais bonito da historia dos video games;\n\n- Racionalização da cadeia de produção, pelo aprimoramento dos menus e em função do crescimento não tão acelerado das demandas pelos habitantes, o que tornava a versão anterior um tanto angustiante;\n\n- A substituição do transporte de bens através de espaçonaves ao invés de navios tornou o jogo muito chique e empolgante;\n\n- Não é preciso mais se preocupar com o meio ambiente, pois na visão da Blue Byte, a humanidade aprendeu com os erros do passado e, no futuro, a questão ambiental na terra está totalmente controlada;\n\n- Praticamente todos os bens produzidos no novo game são diferentes da versão prévia, isso é muito legal;\n\n- Roda muito bem com tudo no high e ultra, em 1080p, em um AMD FX 8350, 8Gb RAM e uma GTX670.\n\nContras:\n\n- Alguns travamentos e restarts aleatorios, mesmo com o PC em 75~85% da capacidade máxima;\n\n- Em alguns mapas, como no glacial, as exigências dos habitantes são altas. A falta de atenção nesse cenário pode levar você a bancarrota num piscar de olhos, Muito cuidado com seus recursos financeiros;\n\n- Existe um alerta sobre a possibilidade do jogo causar apilepsia em alguns jogadores que é demorado e não pode ser pulada pela tecla "ESC".","November 8, 2015","true","84.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Usually when I buy games I tend to read some of the user reviews and make them wheigh in my decission to buy or not to buy. The score Anno 2205 gets, makes me reevaluate my spending strategy.\n\nI'm glad that i bought this game as a preorder because otherwise i might have waited a year to buy this game at a discount.  Let me tell you, this game is worth every buck you spend on it. Ofcourse i don't know if the extra 20 for the season pass is worth the squeeze but after playing the base game I'm already looking forward what Blue Byte might throw at us in the near future.\n\nAnyway, from all the negative comments I've read there's only one that really counts and that's the lack of multiplayer. All the other things like no realtime NPC's to play with or the fact that you can't build ships anymore for traderoutes is really a matter of opinion. Where Blu Byte really shines in this sequel is that it streamlines old gameplay without taking the essence out of the game. All the frustrating things previous anno games had are gone.\nFor example, no more looking up on wikis what the ideal farm setups are or the ideal amount of buildings in a production chain which really was a gamebreaker for me in the last 2 annos. Oh and by the way there is a stock system but it's not as fleshed out as previous games.\n\nI really must recommend this game to anyone who likes citybuilding games. If you buy this game then please give it the thumbs up if u like it, Blue Byte deserves it.","November 12, 2015","true","161.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaero/recommended/375910/","xaero","Xaero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaero/","955 products in account","I'll preface this by stating that I've played every single Anno game since they started making them. I'm a long time fan of the series and haven't disliked a single game they've put out and this game is definitely not the exception to that rule.\n\nIs this game a bit different? Yes.\nIs that a bad thing? Personal opinion but I would say no.\n\nThis game certainly does quite a few things different than previous titles, so lets get into it.\n\nPros and ConsPros\nBeautiful graphics\nWell designed maps\nA much tighter and more cohesive campaign experience\nPersistent progression (corporation level and your built maps stay with you throughout missions)\nBetter stats for your settlements\nTrading economy network (much improved over previous games, far easier to manage and oversee what's going where and how much it costs you)\nNeed to adapt building strategies depending on map type\nCons\nNo multi-player\nNo random maps\nNot many locations\nSome rather major performance issues when playing for long periods\nRelatively short campaign (which is an issue when there isn't all that much else to do)\nSome other notes\nCombat Zones\nCombat zones separate out warfare into their own maps, and there aren't many of them. This is both a pro and a con because while I enjoy the new maps built specifically for combat, they get repetitive really quickly and offer no real meaningful contribution to the game outside of the story-related objectives. Collection of rare resource seems to be the only thing worth caring about otherwise and it's really just busywork and that's something we need less of in games, not more.\n\nThis also brings into contention the fact that there is, outside of some map quests, NO combat on your settlement maps at all; and, by association, means there will only ever be your corporation on a map, no land rushes to compete for space and resources, no fights over said territory, nothing. This probably also explains why there's no multi-player as after you strip the very fundamentals of what made Anno's multi-player there isn't really a great deal left you can do with it, outside of leader boards for population and efficiency etc.\n\nProduction Chains\nIf you've played the new SimCity you've probably seen this kind of thing before, basically now you can make "addons" to your buildings for numerous benefits including production increases and cost reductions. This, in itself, is a plus, I enjoy the extra flexibility it gives you and adds some much needed variety to building. Some will argue that this dumbs down the game but I don't really see it, it's pretty much the same except you have to think of most buildings like they're farms with different sized "fields" to consider once you've built the main building.\n\nConclusionAll in all I've enjoyed my time with this game, it's a significant departure from its predecessors in some ways while still feeling the same in others. If you're looking for a game that will last you a long time this probably isn't the game for you, check out previous titles instead, but if you're looking for another Anno game that mixes up the formula a bit while still being the sort of game you know and love, give it a try.","December 1, 2015","true","18.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Ultimately it is a city builder, but it also has a lot of naval combat and more from what I can tell so far. You start as a fledgling corporation of your design. Slowly you build your way up, gain connections, and explore the vast areas of the planet and the moon! No longer do you have to balance climate and factory output like in its predecessor. Instead just keep a balanced checkbook, build, explore, and destroy. There are tons of sub missions inside sub missions and a ton of achievements to unlock. Did I mention how beautiful this game is? The attention to detail is exquisite to say the least. There are no save game states like before, now it is an automated feature, kind of like in an MMORPG. You make a corp., and work within that game state. If you want to make a new game, you start a new corporation. So the missions, achievements, and different gameplays, are all a part of the same ongoing campaign. I am not sure how deep the game is at the moment, but from what I can surmise and from the previous Anno titles you can rest assured that the game will be a joy to play, over and over again.

My experence with the ANNO series is limmited to two games, this 2205, and 2070. I liked the whole trade and resource management thing from 2070 and city builders like Cities Skylines, but 2205 feels like it tried to mix both and ended up with a ill paced fusion of what feels like a psudo mutiplayer akin to Simcity 5.\n\nI like the game. I hated the first two hours because it was so limmiting in the scope of what you could do and it wasn't very well paced. I played a bit more and things got a lot better, a out of the pan into the fire kinda feeling. Options and managment got more in depth and once you could upgrade buildings things really take off.

Many of the old mechanics are now streamlined behind a layer of abstraction. Instead of waiting for each individual crate of grapes to get from one facility to another, many of fiddly things are made island-wide (logistics, the replacement for land-based warehouses) or even sector-wide (power, for example).\n\nMany other reviewers complain about the loss of these 'features', and that this makes it not feel like an Anno game. They're right, to an extent - this game does not feel like the previous Anno games, which paced your construction with long periods of waiting for the goods to start flowing. You had a lot of time to reflect and plan what you were going to do next. In 2205, however, as soon as the relevant facilities are constructed, you automatically see the benefits, and can even start exporting them immediately as well. You still have to build efficiently, but you can move directly from one challenge to the next.\n\nI definitely can recommend this game. If you really liked the fiddly micromanagement that bogged down the previous games, 2070 is a great entry with that classic feel. If you want to try something a little bit simpler and a lot more streamlined, Anno 2205 is great.","November 7, 2015","true","20.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

The giant game publishers take heat for releasing buggy games too soon, or milking a franchise with cookie cutter sequels... well this game is neither of those things.  It's a very polished game, and it is very successful in trying to innovate the franchise whose previous sequels never involved much more sophisticated than "more stuff."\n\nThat said, whenever you deviate from a core mechanic like that, it's going to take some hits from the die hard fans of the franchise who were perfectly okay with "just more stuff."\n\nThere is value here though.  They streamlined the production chain system and actually give you feedback on your "product balance," something that was always an element but always kept a secret from you unless you manually counted buildings.  Overall it feels a bit simplistic but there is some fun gameplay to be gotten out of it if you're open to adjusting to something similar but new.","January 18","true","12.7"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

As I did buy it I thought I would my two cents into the mix after playing for 5 hours and have just got to the 4th (and final) tier of population needs.\n\nDRM\nYes it’s a bit of a pain that you have to have a uplay account and have to install it onto your computer but apart from the initial verification process I can’t say that I have noticed it.  For me the DRM is not an issue.\n\nGame Play\nOverall I’m really enjoying the game.  I have seen allot of talk about the game being dumb down and on the whole I would have to agree with these comments.  I don’t think it’s as hard or as complicated as Anno 2070 however as your cities get larger there is a fair amount resource management to do (and it’s that what the game is about?).  For example in my main city the need for luxury food was getting high and I was running out of space so I decided to buy a new region and source my whole farming there which meant I could bulldoze my farms in my main city and just import the food. I thought this would be a quick task but realised that to support a farming community I needed to set up a small city.  I wouldn’t say this was difficult but did take a bit of time and I certainly found it enjoyable.\n\nCombat has been taken out of the city building sectors and has its own.  I would say this is the weakest part of the game but it’s ok and found it fun to mix it up every now and then and jump into the combat zone.\n\nResearch\nThere is none from what I can see, unless I’m missing something.  This was something that I really enjoyed in Anno 2070 and really added something to the endgame and also changed the way your next game was played.  Real shame its missing and don’t really understand why.  Perfect opportunity to have specific things in each sector you could research to help the others.\n\nStory\nIt’s a bit crap.  Basically it’s grow your corporation as big as possible.  The side quests in the form of sector projects are a bit better but not by much.\n\nGraphics\nThis game looks great however you will need a beast of a machine to run it at max.  I have an i7 6700, 16 GB DDR4 and nvdia 660gtx x2 in sli.  Problem is sli isn’t supported so my 2nd graphic card is just sat there with its feet up.  I run the game in 1440p on medium at 40ish fps.  Nvidia Pascal can’t come soon enough!  Also you will be changing between the sectors allot so a SSD will really help with the load times.\n\nSound\nIt’s ok, nice back ground music but nothing to write home about.\n\nOverall\nI’m glad I brought it and would recommend it but there are a few things such as sli support, research and improved story line which would really improve the game.","February 8","true","26.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Yes there is military action in seperate missions from the main game, but they are almost pointless and can be done quick enough to get back to city building that we love.\n\nThe game is simplified for sure, but also has the multibase system similar to the latest Sim City game, only each area has a much greater effect on the other as the income is the same, and you have to trade to produce what you need. I think with this system they had to simplify the main game mechanics or it would have been too much of a pain for half of the gamers out there. I think I may have been one of those frustrated souls!\n\nI will re-review if once I am done I feel the game actually sucked overall, but so far so good. Cannot believe I waited this long to buy it.

Here are some of the pros and cons I could think of.\n\nPros:  Graphics are amazing but will melt your computer if you dont have a beefy GPU or CPU.\nPros:  Artwork is very nicely rendered, all in all, its a very pretty game and full of eye candy.\nPros:  Its a bit easier to understand demands of your citizens, gives statistics on how much each industry produces instead of running to a WIKI like in Anno 2070 to figure out what you need to build and how much of it.\n\nCons: Maps are prefab, beautiful, but prefab, no random element like in 2070.\nCons: I feel as if the game has been EXTREMELY dumbed down.  Instead of supply chains (seeing transports on the streets) ferrying goods to and from it just instantly does it and shows the animation of stuff being moved about.\nCons: No multiplayer and I have to honestly say, after playing it I highly doubt there ever will be multiplayer in a game like this, it has changed that much between 2070 and 2205.\nCons: Maps feel extremely small but is a new engine, you can definately tell they skimped in a lot of areas probably due to engine stability and perfomance issues.\n\nEdit:\n\nI decided to add some additional details in regards to my opinion of dumbing down of the game.  What I mean by this is we were originally accustomed to the previous Anno games where you have to setup up trade routes etc to get the supplies to the manufactor and the end product to the citizens.  In 2205 this is not the case but rather deciding on how you are going to build the city, theres alot more city planning in this game than the previous Anno game.\n\nIn 2070:  Buildings and building layouts were static, no upgrades other than enhancements you loaded into your warehouse, global effects, or ARK upgrades.\n\nIn 2205:  Theres still a global effect through voting at your ARK *Space Station*.  However, as far as buildings go, most of your production buildings do instantly provide the product, however they are far from static in layout.\n\nBuilding Upgrades:  Each building that produces a product (electricity, water etc) has so many upgrade slots to enchance production, running costs, workforce costs etc.  So cramming abunch of veggie farms in one location, not wise.  Not only does it cost more in power, maitenence and workforce to run x2 said farms its better to bulldoze one, upgrade the other to exceed the production of the lost farm for a cheaper, more efficient cost.\n\nBuilding upgrades require rare resources which you cant really obtain from the map, you must buy them from the exchange or do combat missions to get them.  Scour the combat map, theres plenty of extra stuff you can get besides the end mission results.","November 3, 2015","true","7.7"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","12","30","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/375910/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","A bold new direction for the Anno Series, but it's going to be a hard pill to swallow...\nAnno has been an iconic series for a lot of reasons, Anno 1404 remains to this day one of the finest resource and city management games of it's time, it's less about city development and more about resource chain management, which makes it about optimisation and logistical planning. It married this with some genuinely timeless graphics, which even now remain entirely gorgeous, and a design that will almost certainly remain playable ten years in the future. It's that kind of a game, a true classic. Since then Blue Byte have been working on the formula and have been trying to recapture the lightning in the bottle.\n\nAnno 2070 was a regression, not least because Uplay was locked into a state where it would force you to remain online and would kill your game if you disconnected, but also because the game lost it's way a little, it just lacked the sheer charm and glory that Anno 1404 had. There were some great ideas in 2070, but overall it just crumbled under the weight of what had, by then become the sheer age and baggage of the "old ways". It was still a good enough game for fans of the Anno series like myself, but it was a failure as well. It was not the Anno we -wanted-.\n\nIn short, Anno desperately needed a ground up rebuild, and a break from the past.\n\nIn steps a fresh, minty new challenger...\nAnno 2205 takes the game and does away with a lot of the traditional ways of thinking. So much so that you initially think that the game has been dumbed down. The first map has a single environment, with no visible logistical management of trade ships, and no marketplace type buildings that restrict your placement anymore. It seems like they've made everything "easy". That's because the first few hours are the tutorial, disguised very cleverly as your first few hours in the game, no longer does the game take place on a single map split over ten islands. Now it takes place over nine maps, each individually the size of one of the original medium size maps in 1404, give or take.\n\nInstead of having maps randomly generated, all the maps provided are fixed, and have specific challenges on them that must be overcome, these challenges are sector wide projects that gift benefits ranging from the cosmetic (such as being able to tinker with weather effects) to the very significant (such as sector wide logistics bonuses). These fixed maps allowed Blue Byte to really, really layer on the detail. To the point that they resemble concept art in ultra setting, except you can rotate them and look at them from any angle. It's surreal. The graphics are truly "off the chart".\n\nA-round the world ah-round tha wo-ooorld....\nThe maps are split evenly between three climates - Temperate, which is where you generate your money, Arctic, which is where you generate higher quality goods, and Lunar, which is your endgame goal, and where you'll be shovelling credits into a furnace. Each zone offers unique challenges and will force you to utilise different building strategies, with Arctic, you are forced to build your homes around factories or power generators, as they're the only things that generate sufficient heat to counteract the cold. In space, you need shields to protect against things like Solar radiation. These stop the game from getting repetitive and also mean each zone has radically different ways to optimise your building setups.\n\nThe materials used throughout the game have become ever more diverse, with each area using it's own unique building materials, as well as some that are shared in various ways (be ready to ship Superalloys about), as a result of the three territories having such wildly differing requirements, you now have a new screen where you navigate between the zones you've claimed and you manage your trade routes, which are set up as continual paths. As time wears on, these paths will turn into a tangled spiderweb of golden lines around the globe, and it'll make the old Anno 1404 logistics network look calm in comparison.\n\nSee, here's the thing, in Anno 1404, you had a dozen to two dozen routes rolling because each ship could handle a few things at once. Here you'll be setting up a route for each commodity and the routes are point to point. You can manage and vary them, but longer term the list is going to look about as long as a phonebook when you hit the endgame. Be thankful that you HAVE this seperate screen.\n\nEqually, there's been a lot of changes in the GUI for quality of life purposes, no longer is stock expressed as an absolute number, instead sector balance is shown as a relative, such as positive or negative, so you can act to correct any imbalances a lot more easily, this is particularly useful in the endgame as you can correct anything before it becomes a much bigger problem.\n\nIt's not all smooth sailing though (and I'm not talking about the STILL mediocre combat)...\nThat said. No review would be fair without mentioning the elephants in the room. There are some, and they are big and nasty. No skirmish mode. This one is forgivable, the singleplayer campaign is perhaps the best one I've seen to date, it's the best Anno experience as a result and I really do not lament the loss of Skirmish on account of the fact that the Campaign more than makes up for it.\n\nNo multiplayer, co-op or competitive however, this one is not forgivable. For me, who tends to enjoy solo experiences, I can cope, but for other people, this is a dealbreaker, and rightfully so. Anno has always had multiplayer, and the removal is painful, I can only assume it was a design decision to allow them to focus on making the best solo experience possible (in the same way RB6:Siege is getting no Solo mode), but it doesn't make it any easier to swallow.\n\nuPlay, well, I won't say more than that. You either love it, hate it, or don't care. I'm in camp three. However, an important note is that it also means uPlay achievements, not steam achievements, if you -care- about steam achievements, keep that in your head when considering this game.\n\nFinally, the price. For me, a die hard Anno fan, yes, okay. I'll bite. For anyone else, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND UBISOFT. STOP FLEECING US. NOT COOL.\n\nClosing thoughts\nIt's Anno. It's still recognisably Anno, and the solo experience this time is comfortably the best it's ever been, by a long margin. If you were expecting Anno 1404 with a sci-fi reskin, you'll be in for a nasty shock.\n\nBlue Byte have decided that now is the time to change the formula, and to move the game forward, in my opinion, it was high time, and a lot of the changes make endgame play a lot more bearable, but understandably, some won't like them. However, the loss of multiplayer and the pricetag... yeah, that leaves a shadow. It's one thumb up. Not two, much as I love the game.\n\nVerdict : Recommended - But only if you're after a solo experience. If you're after a multiplayer experience, get Anno 1404 instead.\n\nUpdate : The Anno for the Endgame player.\nSo, 26 hours in. What are my feelings?\n\nGood. Really good. This is what Anno desperately needed. The formula by 2070 had become akin to a badly cooked stew. It was stodgy, had too many ingredients in, and only people who knew the game by rote had a chance of actually getting anywhere in it.\n\nThis "new" anno does away with a lot of the junk, and replaces it with a lot (not all) good decisions. There's a long way to go, but if this is the first step, Anno has a real chance for the next ten years.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

What was gained by that is 3 biomes that play very differently and each have special rules.\n\nGraphics are excellent as always, dont need to go into that, Anno was always very pretty compared to other building games.\n\nI have seen people complaining about that the game plays itself, but i think this comes from the fact that the easiest difficulty now gives you bonuses to all earnings and instead of giving you a gameover when too much in debt, it bails you out. So of course that will seem like a very pointless game.\nOn the harder difficulties, you now have to manage not only money, but also workforce and logistics.\nThe later biomes are very demanding of your economy, you can ruin yourself by just placing 2 lunar production buildings, the support these buildings need is significant.\nThe chains themselve seem to get more comples as the game progresses, they seem to not have been dumbed down much at all.\n\nCombat now is played on its own map and is still meh, but as always it is optional.\n\n\nThe one thing im not sure about is how long this expensive game will last, it only has endless mode with its predetermined maps, with a quick "story" told by tutorial quests included into the endless mode.\nI have the bad feeling that Ubisoft is planning to give us out scenarios...as DLC or microtransactions.\nI really really would have preferred the game came with a few scenarios, the anno 2070 ones really werent that complex, but they gave enough reason to start over and over and over.\n\n\nSo, gameplay is good, but beware of Ubisoft greed.","November 5, 2015","true","6.2"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

Being a huge fan of everything involving space, I have to say I really adore this game. It's extremly pretty, the moon landscape just makes me smile. Personaly I do not care about some missing features, like multiplayer, or the lack of storage. I even like the new system more! The response is not as slow as before, which makes it a lot more fun (atleast for me). I get why people are Upset, this does feel a lot more "arcady", but is that really a bad thing? It is definetly not like the Anno's we're used to, but I don't think that has to be a bad thing.

No.\n\nIs it a bad thing? No.\n\nI have been playing Anno since ANNO 1602 and I can say that my experience with the latest release has been an enjoyment rollercoaster. Many of the old mechanics have been removed or changed and admittedly I was mad at first. But as I took the time to play the game the new or changed mechanics started to make some semblance of sense. The first thing that caught my attention was the initial lack of farms you can attach to plantations. But as you played the game you unlock rare materials that you use to build additional farm modules to the plantation, increasing its productivity past 100% and making it more cost effective than building a second plantation. It around this time I realized that Anno 2205 is focused more on space management and economy, and I enjoy it. The game might seem dumb in the temperate zone where there are no restrictions on where you can build and space is relatively plentiful, but when you go to the Tundra and the Moon, the game gets interesting.\n\nIn these locations you are limited to where you can build. Not in the traditional sense where you are limited by land, but also by heat in the Tundra and shielding on the Moon. Your factories, in the Tundra, give off heat which your residence need, otherwise they will not inhabit the building. In place of the traditional method of building your cities in huge blocks and production complexes separately, you need to figure out how to build your production and shelter together in order to maximize the amount of people you can host. And on the Moon is changes again. You need to shield all your buildings from space debris. Now you have the issue of building and powering these awkwardly shaped shield generators to protect your buildings. Not only do you have to worry about shielding your building on the Moon, you have to fund all the production on the Moon and OMFG is it expensive.\n\nTo afford building and upkeep on the moon you need to expand your taxable population in the Temperate zone, and they consume a lot of material. If they are not happy they will not pay as much. Now you have to pay for shipping from the Tundra for the population’s demands which costs money. And having a positive income can be difficult at times, let alone a high positive income. So to build on the Moon you need to wait until you have enough tangible wealth to actually build. So why not kill some time with combat missions? Set your economy to a surplus and take a half an hour clearing out a hostile zone. You gain experience to unlock new ships and get rare materials to upgrade your factories. If you want to play the military missions on a harder difficulty for more rewards you are strongly recommended to increase your fleet’s level, which costs money. I am constantly moving between locations expanding and optimizing my economy trying to get to the next phase of the game. I feel like there is a lot going on for this game and it is quite possible that if all the old mechanics were in place with the new mechanics, the game would be too slow and no one would want to grind on a single player game.\n\nWhat can the game do to improve? Bring back the shipyard. It is pleasant that the ships are “free” in the game, but there should be the option to build the ships used for trade and combat. If you could build transport ships, trade would be easier. It becomes a huge expense for your economy to pay 200c for every 20 stack of product shipped between the temperate and tundra zone. It costs 3000c for every 20 stack for the transport to and from the Moon! Giving the player the option to use their own ships to move as much product as possible on a single route should be brought back into the game. As far as Military ships, this can solve several problems at once. First in makes the ships you lose more valuable since you had to pay for those ships to be built in the first place. Secondly, it makes the rare material slower to gain and more valuable since you need to pay for the ships to get the material. After a few visits to the hostile zone I have maxed out my rare materials, and I could do it because it did not cost me more than a few upgrades to win the engagements.\n\nThe Co-op and Multiplayer needs to come back. Ubisoft, this function has been a part of the game series forever and you need to stop cutting corners. Additionally, the cost is too high. If everything that was in the season pass DLC was in the game at Launch, then it would be worth $50; at launch. Recommending this game to another person, I highly suggest waiting until there is a handsome discount on the game. If you can pick up the game and season pass for $20, pounce on it. It is not a bad game contrary to community’s attacks on it. It needs some free add-ons and hot fixes, but it is visually beautiful and still a fun game to play despite the change in game mechanics.\n","November 5, 2015","true","15.3"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vandragorax/recommended/375910/","vandragorax","Vandragorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vandragorax/","286 products in account","Conclusion\nAnno 2205 contains all of the elements from previous Anno titles, improved upon and streamlined, whilst cutting out some of the annoying micro-management pains, and problems with giving the player the right information at the right time.  You still get the piecing together of the familiar production chain to make better stuff, to make better stuff, etc. all in aid of attracting higher taxed citizens to fund your off-world colonies.  It is still as complex as Anno 2070, but the interface provides the information you care about in such a way that it feels less frustrating trying to balance and juggle all of these things.  In Anno 2070 I almost never felt on top of the balancing act, but in Anno 2205 I very much feel this way... some of the time... then it all tips again (because I've started a new colony on the Moon, or built on a new island in the Arctic), and I need to re-balance the scales again.\n\nIt is a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying, (not to mention beautiful), city building, planning, and resource management game suitable for players new to the series as well as veterans, however it does need a few hours invested into it to unlock all of the complexities and can seem very simplified at first glance.\n\nThose giving it a bad review after just a couple of hours have quite clearly not spent enough time with the game to find out that YES, it does include storage, and YES it does include modular production plants, farms, power, mining etc. amongst all the other familiar systems from Anno 2070, for example. They are just hidden away under a couple of hours of gameplay in order to not completely overwhelm new players to the series... and personally I think this is a really great implementation of how to do a tutorial of sorts within the game itself whilst actually playing.\n\n\nFull review\nCity building:\nThere are 3 different climates within Anno 2205, Temperate, Arctic, and the Moon.  Each climate is split into 3 zones, giving 9 total zones where it's possible to build cities/colonies, (your first in each climate is free, and you can purchase the others later on for huge sums of hard cash to add end-game longevity).  On first starting the game, you get to pick one of the Temperate zones by reviewing each different map, consisting of multiple islands and one special monument option for each.  I chose the zone which could get the electric dam monuments as I know how power generation in Anno can be a real killer of your profits (and it turns out this was a very wise choice!).\n\nYou are essentially walked through your journey by the familiar mission layout on the upper-left corner of the screen.  This contains all the information you need about your main task, and sub-tasks, without shoving a tutorial in your face if you want to just get on with your own thing.  I really love this and I think it is a good and smooth experience for familiar Anno players, as well as newbies.\n\nIt turns out that the Temperate zone tends to be your profitable zone early-game, and you need it to fund Arctic and Moon zones which sap all your cash until much later in development.\n\nThe worrying moment...\nNow this is the point where I believe a lot of the negative reviews are coming from... it appears after the first couple of hours that there is over simplification to this version of Anno.  There doesn't appear to be storage, there doesn't appear to multiple add-ons to farms and production facilities to boost production etc. there doesn't appear to be island trading, (all islands in the same zone partially share resources), and there doesn't appear to be any fleet or combat!  At face value within the first hour or two, it seems like these things are gone... OH HOW WRONG FIRST IMPRESSIONS CAN BE!!\n\nAs soon as you start diving into the next few hours of this game, you soon start seeing all of these complexities showing up in their vastly more streamlined implementations.  The game turns into a mixture of familiar Anno, SimCity, and Command and Conquer, but every element fits perfectly into this strange cocktail.\n\nSupply and Demand vs. storage\nFirstly, the resource counter only shows + or - numbers for production and demand.  This is a simplified view, yes, however a brief hover of the mouse over each resource shows the total in storage, and although we had to build more storage containers in Anno 2070, you soon realise how utterly pointless it is storing these goods... and all you really care about is producing just enough to meet your citizens' demands without overproducing so much that you're wasting maintenance money.  I really love this, and it takes the player's mindset away from meaninglessly hoarding tons and tons of resources to fine-management of your production chains.\n\nNaval Combat and rare resources\nThen you unlock the combat missions.  Basically you get told there is a crisis somewhere on the globe, you pick which difficulty you'd like to play the mission on, then you load into a totally new zone (map) where you sail around with your fleet blowing the living daylights out of any enemy that so much as gets in your way.  This combat feels very trivial at first, and it is.  You can lure enemies into mines, ambush them on their patrol paths, plan your route of attack to reach their weak points etc.  However, once you start doing these missions later on the harder difficulties, it actually does get quite a bit more challenging and you need to use all of these tactics to your advantage.  The other thing to note is that you soon realise clearing the entire map of enemies is a bit of a waste of time.  You end up taking all 3 sub-missions at the very start of the map, as well as turning on the elusively hidden feature to show all the resource buildings on the minimap (this should be shown by default imo).  These are your real objectives, as they are your source of the rare resources which you desperately need in the city building part of the game.\n\nThe eureka moment\nThese rare resources are then taken out of the combat missions when you succeed and are used to upgrade your factories and production buildings!  I had first built several farms and power plants around thinking "This is way over simplified" and then upon doing this first mission and seeing how the modules worked I suddenly had a eureka moment where it all made sense suddenly! (and I immediately had to use the awesome new "move building" feature ;) haha).\n\nTrading\nTrading doesn't need to happen within the same zone/map in Anno 2205, (they share all resources and workforce automatically).  Trading starts to happen shortly after you colonise the Arctic in another zone and this is where your inter-dependencies come into play.  You will need to produce some goods in the Temperate zones to send to Arctic or Moon zones, and all variations therein.  This is necessary to increase the happiness of your populations to get them to upgrade to the next level (and then want even more difficult to obtain goods).\n\nThe trading happens much more fluidly than in Anno 2070 by having the player simply choose a trade good, the start and end of the route, and how much to send.  Simple but effective, and less annoying micromanagement.  Again, all the info is shown in one place easy to see and modify without deleting trade routes and worrying about boats being shot by pirates (*looks at Anno 2070*).\n\nOverall verdict\nMy overall verdict is very positive on this game.  The first couple of hours felt a little lacking, but it soon unlocked its full potential and now I'm off fending for myself, trying to balance my colonies against my main settlement, and looking forward to unlocking new zones to build in fresh, as well as work towards getting all of the monuments going.  Anno 2205 is a very cool and sleek new addition to the Anno series.","November 4, 2015","true","32.9"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

However the game feels lacking in terms of randomized challenges. This is its biggest flaw in my opinion.\n\nAs a player I want to feel a sense of adventure, and that requires randomness at some level. This game doesn't provide much of that, even on the hardest difficulty. It is as challenging as previous Anno games if played on a high difficulty, which was a concern I had before launch. But it can certainly be easy for all newcomers to the series too. But what is completely lacking is the randomness of discovering an unforeseen problem and dealing with it. That is such a necessity in gaming. Natural disasters and rival corporations provided this previously, and I would be fine if they took one out, but not both. To me, this game without randomness is like food without salt. Sure, the food is fantastic, but I don't want to keep eating it. It will get old much more quickly than it should, and it won't have the replayability that I need.\n\nPros (in order of strength):\nThe graphics\nMulti-session gameplay\nAccessability for newcomers\nManagement of a city's resources\nMusic\n\nCons:\nLack of features (randomness)\nCombat\nLack of compelling goals\nStory (Campaign)\nLinear Gameplay\n\nThe thing I love most about this game is the multi-session gameplay. It works so well and so easily -- it's something I always wanted in Anno. I can't praise this design enough. I will easily put 100 hours into my corporation, and I think I could spend 100 more on optimization, solely because of this feature. The modular buildings make the gameplay much more strategic than previous Anno games, although more could be done to make this aspect of gameplay more valuable. Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, this is a true Anno game. It retains much of the feelings I had for the previous games. It is complex, strategic, beautiful, and addictive. It would definitely be the best Anno game in the series if the criticisms I have listed were resolved in some fashion.\n\nSpecifically combat I want to mention because this seems to be a mixed bag. Personally I love the new combat system... if it were a tech demo of the new combat system. As a finished product it feels very incomplete. It reminds me of the RTS games I love, like Sins of a Solar Empire or Age of Empires. But there's no variety -- no randomness that I spoke of above. I played it once at each difficulty setting and that's all I'd care to do for now. I love that you have abilities to use now to help your ships in combat (1404 and 2070 had this concept but it is better implemented here). I just wish there were more of a point to it beyond grinding for resources and xp.\n\nMany reviews I have read are unfair and go beyond the scope of critising this game. I have had trouble with Uplay when I played 2070 around 2 years ago. It stopped me from playing the game completely for a long period of time. But, that experience in no way affected my decision to buy this game. Uplay has been perfect so far with 2205. Lack of multiplayer may be a criticism for the direction of the series, but it is not a valid criticism of this game. I have used multiplayer in 2070, and it was fun, but it would not work the same way in 2205 if it had it. A different concept for multiplayer would have to be established for this game, and I'm guessing that is why they chose not to include the feature. I would also argue that no feature is dumbed down in this game. They simply took out tedious micromanaging that I can't believe anyone would consider a strength of the past games.\n\nWhen it comes down to price, I don't see how this game is worth $60 or $80. I payed $80 and I'm glad I did, but for a lot of people it may not seem worth it. $30-40 is the price I would value it at.\n\nThe conclusion: I would bet that most people would enjoy 2070 more, but if they added some much needed features, this game (or its sequel) will definitely be the best of the series. For now, it remains on par with 1404 and 2070.\n\n(I will continue to update my review as I get further into the endgame.

My first Anno game was 2070. After playing that for some 300+ hours (+ many more offline and not recorded), I went back and played every single Anno game for the PC. I honestly think Anno 1404 was the best Anno of the series and still do (I have probably 400 hours or more of offline time in it), even with 2205 out. 2070 and 2205 stand a fair bit apart on terms of my overall liking of the 3 Anno games mentioned thus far.\n\nWhat I like thus far:\n\n- Graphics. Holy crap, they're excellent. Though, the game lags a bit on my setup so perhaps there could be a bit more optimisation done. I have noticed some spelling errors and grammatical mistakes in the game. I understand that at least, given that the Anno series of games generally are German-made. Thus, translations or second-language barriers are met. The night lights in cities are also quite nice!\n\n- Music. Excellent, like all Anno games. Sound effects are good too.\n\n- Ease-of-use. Surprisingly, I like that 2205 was easier to pick up than 2070 and 1404. A few of my friends don't understand how to play Anno, so this gives me hope that they can understand it! The UI is clean and easy to understand.\n\n- Variety of land types. No, I'm not talking about the 3x3x3 system. I'm taking about the fact that you can inhabit the moon, the arctic and temperate regions. I heard talks of an expansion for Mars coming for this game in the future.\n\n- 2070 references and sights. Drones, deep sea hunters, voices. The Ark. EVE.\n\n- Balance and tune. Logistics between what buildings need and produce is easy to understand so you don't go overboard and rack up unnecessary maintenance costs.\n\n- Modular buildings. They got this aspect right, like SimCity 2013. Having a fully upgraded building will be better than multiple unupgraded ones. I also love that the other modules can reduce your maintenance/energy/workforce use.\n\n- Sector projects. All of them are pretty dandy to have. After completing the resource generation ones in the arctic and temperate (graphene and petrochemicals), I am now on the sector to rebuild the dam.\n\nWhat I dislike or miss:\n\n- Overall amount of islands on the map and map size overall. I loved the huge maps in 1404. 2070 was a bit meh in that regard for me too.\n\n- Why can't I go into the menu and play a continuous game like 1404 or 2070? While I do like the concept of the company you made... if they integrated it in such a way like Anno 2070 with the ark and profile, it could be so much better.\n\n- Duration. I feel that this game won't keep me as enthralled as 1404 or 2070. I pulled a 28 hour and a 25 hour stint in 1404 and 2070, respectively, with friends online/over LAN.\n\n- Is workforce even necessary? It's too easy to have a lot of it, and thus, not worry about or manage it. It is a bit more worrying in the very early game, though... but that's about it. The same thing can be said for transportation of the goods. However, I do like the fact that it makes sense.\n\n- Why are all the goods automatically shared in the sector you're playing without the need for a ship from island to island? In the temperate areas with bridges, I get it... I miss the aspect of building ships and moving goods around. It gave me more incentive to make a large island dedicated ONLY for the production of goods, thus leaving other large islands to support populations. You can do this still in 2205, mind you... but it just doesn't feel as right as 1404 or 2070.\n\n- Crisis sectors are meh. They should be done like they were in 2070. They're too easy. I would LOVE to be able to build a settlement in those sectors and fend off the enemy faction, like 2070 as well.\n\n- There just doesn't seem to be many problems to solve, compared to 2070 (Ecobalance, disasters, health/fire, etc...).\n\n- The lack of online multiplayer is one thing may people griped about. Ubisoft probably gets that by now. Again, the aspect of having a company is absolutely perfect for online and competing in friendly ways. I do understand why they said they removed multiplayer in the first place. I did spend a bit of my time either critiquing cities my friend/s built (and bombing them), or waiting for them to catch up so we could defeat enemies together (Keto, Strindburg, Hector - all on hard).\n\nWhile it may seem like I have more negative points than positive ones, I do have a bit of faith 2205 will get better as it goes through DLC and expansions. I do like the game overall, and on a scale of 0 - 100, it is about 75. 1404 is a 95 and 2070 is a 90 on that scale. I also have faith future installments will build on the good things 2205 did and bring back the good aspects of previous installations (with that being said, I would LOOOOOOOOOOOVE an Anno to take place between 1850 and 1920).\n\nWould I encourage people to buy the game? For hardcore Annoholics or micromanagers, or city builder lovers, absolutely. For anyone not relagated to those groups in the extreme... I would say wait for the first sale, then get it. By then, some DLC may be out to build upon the game as well.\n\nI will also update my review as I play more of the game.","November 4, 2015","true","42.9"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","2"

I have seen a whole lot of < 3.0 hour playtime reviews and I felt compelled to leave my own thoughts after playing nearly nonstop since launch.\n\nA number of things have changed since 2070 but I think that on the whole it's for the better. That's not to say that I dont think they couldn't improve some things.\n\n-Random maps are gone which is really sad and is one of my only gripes at this time. More than anything This needs to come back or give us a map editor so that we can make more variations. 3 variations of each of the 3 climate types is really not enough.\n\n-They've added a Move Building button which I've seen a lot of people complain about but I absolutely love. It was annoying as hell to need to tear down my carefully contructed factory complex just to move the entire thing over 1 tile. To be fair, there should be some small cost at least, but its hardly the end of the world.\n\n-Combat mission maps are where all of the combat takes place in 2205 as opposed to having to defend your islands in 2070 and earlier games. It can be a nice change of pace from building but I cant help but feel like the combat section is not meaty enough to warrant the change from the traditional anno formula. That said, it is still useful as a place to get the ancillary resources that you'll need to build upgrades.\n\n-All buildings are now required to be on the same road network as your docks. THANK YOU! I have always hated the 'build a warehouse in the middle of the forest' approach to the resource management. It lead to ugly settlements with no sense of order.\n\nGraphically the game looks nice but does run a tad laggy at times on my 770. But in a singleplayer game like this, that is hardly a dealbreaker.\n\nYes this game uses UPlay. That should not have been a surprise to anyone. Honestly, I've never had a single issue with UPlay in all the time that I've had it. So for me, its kindof... whatever.

Here's why.\n\nStreamlining:\n\nThis game is actually quite easy to play! A lot of people are comparing this game to Anno 2070 (for some reason, like every ANNO game is the same. Which they aren't) but it is it's own game.\n\nMy favorite streamlined feature is that of the "sectors". There are three, the temperate, the arctic, and the moon. Each one is it's own map, instead of everything being on one map, which demanded micromanagement on an insane scale and was for the most hardcore of players.\n\nTrading:\n\nNo more ships!\n\nI hated those ships and setting up the trade routes. Trading is now just a simple thing in the strategic map where you decide what and how many of each product you want to move to what sectors. Setting up the ships before was such a pain. I know I'm in danger of sounding like I don't like certain complicated mechanics in games, but it's not like that. I just hate trade routes, I felt they added an annoyance to the previous games.\n\nShip Combat:\n\nShip combat is no longer waged on close to your cities. They are not waged on separate maps designed specifically for fights, which are actually kind of fun.  Your unit have a mix of abilities and types, with special powers that need to be recharged or found on the map to be used. No longer can the enemy come along and mess up your TRADE ROUTES with sabotage. They are also optional. For certain parts of the story, a combat mission can be used to proceed, but so can a second option. I take the combat route though for the upgrade resources.\n\nVisual:\n\nProbably the part I love about this new entry. It's beautiful. Like really beautiful. All 2 sectors look amazing. The buildings look amazing. The water (as always) looks amazing. And my personal favorite, the MOON. It looks amazing if you haven't guessed. My favorite touch is the traffic in your cities though, because I very much enjoyed watching in my arctic sector with everyone bundled up and all kinds of snow vehicles and the like. And then on my moon sector, people on jet backs and moon buggies. Lots of attention to detail.\n\nI haven't played enough to offer much more yet, but it's worth buying. Make your own opinion.","November 3, 2015","true","40.1"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

This game has a lot to offer, even though there are some let-downs.\n\n\nFirst off\n\nTHIS IS NOT ANNO 2070! If you are expecting Anno 2070 with a Moon expansion and a fresh coat of graphics, you will be dissapointed. I am reviewing this game as a stand-alone, without comparing it to previous titles. Also, I have previously only played 2070, so it is up to you to judge my credibility. Here we go:\n\nPros & Cons:\n\nPros\n- Great Visuals\n- Long-term Gameplay\n- Continuos Gameplay\n- Various Difficulty Setting\n\nCons\n- Price ($$)\n- Combat\n- Unengaging Campaign\n- Hardware Guzzler\n- No Manual Save\n\nCorporations\n\nYou create your own Corporation. You answer to yourself and only yourself. You are guided by the World Council, but ultimately what you do is UP TO YOU.\nAs you progress, your Corporation levels up, and competes with the other NPC Corporations. Eventually you can surpass them and buy their land (sector) for your own use. In the mean time, represenatives from various Corporations will offer projects to help you develop different benefits, such as improved logistics.\n\nSandbox VS Campaign and General Gameplay\n\nWhile it is true that there is no separate "Sandbox" mode, the main game IS the sandbox. Yes, there is story behind it, in the form of quests/tasks you have to complete in order to progress your population and advance to the next tiers. Whether you breeze through the story and start over afterwards, or spend a whole calendar year in the same game, is entirely up to you. Also as far as building your city, as long as you are connected to islands (Temperate Zone) via huge New York style bridges, or have a Warehouse on an island (Arctic), you are free to build your Residential Areas and Factories WHEREVER they can fit. The only exception to that are the mines and the water resources (Energy, fish etc), which are restricted to specific locations, but that is not necessarily bad. It makes management of space more simple.\n\nAs you advance your civilization you can expand to two more regions. Here is a summary of all regions you will eventually have access to (in order of progression):\n\nTemperate Region - Main region\n\nThis is where you will spend most of your time, because it is where your population is most dense and this region has the most resources. The region has a warm climate and a series of islands you can connect via the long bridges, mentioned above.\n\nArctic\n\nAs you progress, eventually you will need resources/goods you cannot acquire from the Temerate Region and you will need to expand to the Arctic. Much like the Teperate Region, the Arctic has a seres of islands that you can expand to with the use of warehouses.\n\nThe Moon\n\nThe moon is the final frontier in Anno 2205. Much like the Arctic, the moon has resources you cannot obtain anywhere else. The region has a series of craters that you gain control of through warehouses, like in the Arctic.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nHave you ever wondered why we never went back to the moon? (Humans) Well, one answer could be... Because it is VERY EXPENSIVE. If you go to the Moon too early, or as soon as you are able to, your people will experience an event that would make the term "Great Depression" sound like "Oh, it's no big deal". Develop your economy and then go to the moon. Or don't, and then it will be rough for a while, until you eventually have the means to balance it all out.\n\nEach zone: Temperate, Arctic, and Moon, has three regions (maps). Once you get your initial region you will need to buy the rest from other Corporations if you wish to exapnd further.\n\nTwo more zones are in the works. Check the DLC section on Steam or the main game website.\n\nOne problem however, is that while the campaign can teach you how to advance your civilization, it doesn't really do much to keep your interest in the setting of the game. Yes, you are supposed to advance your civilization, but you know that from the nature of Anno. The campaign does not reinforce your motivation to play what the game is all about.\n\nTrade\n\nOnce you control multiple regions, say one in the Temperate Zone, and one in the Arctic, as long as you develop the space port of each, you can set up a trade route for resources between the two zones. You can also set how much resource to trade. Eventually you will also gain access to the World Market (Space Station), where you can buy and sell resources.\n\nCombat\n\nWhile the focus of this game is city building and civilization development, there is some combat involved. After all, as you expand you need to defend your interests from extremists. Combat is in the form of missions. Some you need to eventually complete in order to progress, however, as far as when you do that, it is again, up to you. Other combat missions are completely optional, but can reward you with rare resources. NOTE: Some reviews say that those "annoying missions" are the only way to get rare resources. NOT TRUE. Each sector has an NPC Trade Port that sells rare resources for credits. Combat is the easiest way to aquire those resources, but if you have a stable tax rate, you can get said resources without firing a single shell.\n\nThat being said, if you want to build a massive fleet and reign supreme, play an actual strategy game. The combat here gets very repetitive at a pont and you have very little (if any) freedom of choice. It is a good way, to break the monotony of managing your cities, but don't expect an adrenaline rush.\n\nVisuals\n\nThe game looks amazing. The level of detail is definitely some of the best I've seen in a long time. If you go to postcard view (camera mode) you can really see your creation come to life.\n\nThere is one downside though. If you consider your PC a gas station, Anno 2205 is either a Big Rig, a Hummer, or their demon love child. The game eats your GPU processing power, like a kid in candy land. The maximum setting is ULTRA. I play on HIGH, and still get occasional chop.\n\nMy Rig:\n\nAlienware 18, Intel i7 2.80 GHz. 16 GB RAM, 2x Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M (2 GB each) SLI Enabled. OS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit\n\n- - - - Additionally:\n\nNo Multiplayer/Co-op\n\nWhile I get why some would want to build an empire together with friends, the game is built in a way that you don't have to. Players still can influence the prices in the World Market and vote in the World Council.\n\nNo Manual Game Saves\n\nThis game relies entirely on Uplay Sync to save your progess. You CAN save if offline, but either way you have no control over the saves, aside from exiting Anno 2205 every now and then.\n\nSummary of this review\n\nWritten after 20+ hours of Gameplay\n\nOverall good game, but falls short in some areas. I give an 8/10 score, because I personally enjoy it, but can understand if others may not as much.\n\nI've also never had issues with Uplay and this time was no exception. Note: Sometimes Steam messes up the Uplay lancher installation. If you don't already have Uplay, I suggest getting it from the Uplay website and THEN installing games.\n\n\nI Recommend this game to both Anno veterans, and newcomers. Veterans, please give this game a change. You may like it. And if you don't like it you can always play 2070 :). It is not the end of the world.\n\nThat being said,  wait for a sale . The game is too expensive right now, and not offering enough to make up for it.\n\nThis is my first ever review. Please provide feedback.\n\nSee you soon, friends.\n\nMr. Whoopass","November 3, 2015","true","53.9"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","6","18","0","0"

People posting reviews about the lack of 'depth' are mostly referring to the fact that you no longer have to download an external spreadsheet or calculator program to figure out how much of what you need to satisfy a given population.  You can, for the first time, use in-game feedback to figure out whether or not you're making enough widgets for your folks.  Further, while its true that the building of fiels is gone, the building of modules provides the same tetris gameplay with dramatically increased effect.  The alt-tab savings alone are astonishing.  If you combine that with the fact that your main population centers require more different goods than ever before, and the fact that you have 3 totally seperate production areas (as opposed to 2 in 2070 and 1404), the depth has by any reasonable measure increased.\n\nMany of the reviews have also not finished the intro/campaign portion and hit the wall that is large-scale lunar construction.  It's bloody expensive to build things on the moon, and doing so requires massive expansion of your primary settlement, which in trun requires expansion of your production base and so on. You will be constantly expanding your population and production in a very fun version of the red queen's race, just as it should be.  U-play is also a non-issue for me, worked perfetly first time and continues to do so.\n\nTL:DR Buy this game.  Unless your favorite parts of Anno games past is the parts you spent alt-tabbing","November 3, 2015","true","30.9"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","5","16","0","0"

I understand why die-hard fans of Anno may be disappointed, but the game is still very fun in its own way.\n\nI've found Anno 2205 to be extremely enjoyable. I've sunk about 5 hours in it today and I loved every minute of it.\n\nCompared to Anno 2070, I feel that the gameplay experience is a lot smoother. It's always extremely clear what kind of material you need. The buildings' area of operation are much less restrictive. While a house can be out of range, now the community buildings are considered a resource in themselves. This enables the player to be more creative with his cities without being punished too harshly because of building placement. In my humble opinion, this is a huge positive change.\n\nTo the people that say that trading has been removed from the game... It's still there, but now you don't micro-manage the most inconsequential trade routes with boats. Now you just have to keep an eye on how resources flows between your colonies and make sure your production can handle the demand. It's an important change considering you are not trading between islands but between different maps completely.\n\nTalking about the colonies... Having three biomes with completely different play-styles is really fun. Switching between each one adds variety to the game. And they are pretty.\n\nThe campaign integration is, in my opinion, very well done so far. Maybe it won't work for everyone, but I think it's a good way of making the world feel real. Honestly, I could hardly bother doing the Anno 2070 campaign because I found it tedious. Here, it feels like a suggestion. "Hey, by the way, I know you're busy but could you help us not dying pretty please kthx? Or just keep doing your thing, whatever." While the Lunar terrorists are a bit unbelievable, at least they are menacing villains with a really cool leader.\n\nIt's too early for me to give a verdict or talk about the re-playability. However, based on my experience so far, I am very pleased with my purchase.\n\nTLDR; I really liked Anno 2070, but I feel that Anno 2205 is a better game so far.","November 3, 2015","true","22.2"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

Icons, Coral. Even the previous futuristic sky-fyish instalment Anno 2070 was pretty much the same Dawn of Discovery (which I still like the most, mostly because of the Pirat, that guy was super cool). So Anno has changed. Some wil like it, some will not. The biggest change is that now you need to control not the amount of your resources but their flow through the three available regions. Now about the problems in a productivity chain you'll be noticed imidiately by some smart AI, and not with the blazes of a rebellion because of missing books (seriously guys). Overall the game may seem simplified compared to the previous ones for some, but its a point for long discussions for nerdy fans. There is no mutiplayer, by the way (who cares?!).\n\nOh, and I've found out we'll get tundra and orbit as new regions in the upcoming DLCs.

A lot of stuff has been changed. But as a result its a very streamlined game. A few things that come to mind:\n\n- Warzone: Very nice since it is optional.

It is the start of something beautiful.\n- Graphics: Enough said.\n- UI: Very streamlined and futuristic. Like it should be for a 2205 game\n- Move option: Genius. How annoying was it to destroy buildings just because you wanted to change something.\n\nAll in all a game with great graphics and nice gameplay. And with plenty more potential. Multiplayer trough the Warzone sector could be great.

Previous Anno instalments allowed us to make 100% unique cities. Now we are somewhat bound. Game does not see all Nvidia GPU's and starts using the onboard graphics, the game runs suprisingly slow and stutters at times.

The game has streamlined a lot of the more fiddly tasks of previous games which I feel is helpful for newer players to the series. Theres certainly work needed on the game I feel, lack of multiplayer of some information I feel is missing from UI. So far I feel its a pretty worthy starting point for a new title in the series.

I too thought for the 1st 2 hours that it was too simply but I was wrong. Once you get in to the multiple sectors it's becomes VERY challenging. Once you let go of the old Anno UI and realize that everything from the previous Anno is here, just presented in a different way you begin to apprciate the complexity. No more 3rd party calculators about how much production you need based on population. Anno now tells you what we all used to calculate out of game (+1 over production, -2 under production, etc).\n\nSecond, if you're a previous Anno player select the Expert level at the beginning. That will provide you the challenge you need. Also, right now, LET GO of your experience from prevoius Anno games. That's not a bad thing, but if you just keep comparing this to Anno 2070 you'll never be able to appreciate or enjoy the complexity and the complexity is very deep and real.\n\nThrid, not one negative review has even made it to the Moon and they want to talk about how it's a dissappointment?

No, it's not the same complexity of trade network routes you probably pulled your hair out over in Anno 2070 but for a lot of people that's ok too - hair pulling makes you bald. I had a real love/hate relationship with 2070 and when I last played it in anticipation of this one coming out, I remembered all the reasons I loved it - and hated it.\n\nAnno 2205 simplifies and streamlines a lot of things in the economy and building process. It seems to focus more on the overall story and bigger picture (getting to the Lunar colony phase) for your "Corporation" rather than precise detailed production balance and trade routes that were the biggest challenge in Anno 2070.\n\nSo, my recommendation:  If you've never played any of the Anno series and you love futuristic technology games mixed with map based city-building strategy then you will probably enjoy Anno 2205. If you were an Anno 2070 fanatic and are hoping for a game exactly like it, you might be slightly disappointed in this one even though most of the controls are still the same and they've improved on some things (like copying buildings).\n\nNo doubt about it, this game is real eye-candy and is casually enjoyable. It's NOT a hardcore economy strategy game though, and it's NOT a hardcore RTS combat sim either. It falls somewhere in the middle of city builder and story-driven space colonization simulator with a dash of simple economy and supply/demand thrown in for fun. "Fun" might cost too much for some at the price of this game but being a long time Anno fan, it was worth it to me but I'm able to overlook the simplified interface and economy objectives and enjoy it for a more casual but gorgeous game.","December 30, 2015","true","3.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

Every aspect of this game is just amazing to look at, especially the Lunar and Arctic maps.\n\nThe game play is very nice. With the hours i have on Anno 2070 I am very happy with 2205. The devs. took a fresh take on a fun game and made it very cool. They took the micromanagement of the storage system and moved it into more of a macro management style. I have to send resources to my Arctic and Lunar maps to allow them to grow. Any surplus resources can be sold to the global market for extra cash. (Beware when you get to the lunar map. Buildings get VERY Expensive.)  The ability to choose the boosts is unlocked after you progress a ways into the game. You can help decide which boost you get by voting on it.

First of all, I would disregard any negative review with less than an hour or two players, because these are people who had their minds made up to begin with.\n\n\nSo, the common complaints:\n\n\nuPlay:\nI don't see this as anything more than a launch platform these days.  Anno does not have Ubisoft's "always on" DRM and does not require a perpetual internet connection.  I don't blame people for disliking the bloat that is uPlay, but I think it is unfair to give a negative review to a game as a whole just because of the way you open it on your computer.  Not to mention, at least for me, I click Play on Steam, and uPlay opens and launches the game without any further clicks.  It also then syncs my save and minimizes uPlay when I am finished, so I don't even notice it on this title.\n\n\nNo multiplayer:\nI suppose that this is a legitimate gripe for those for whom multiplayer is an important feature.  I can't relate to that and I think the vast majority of Anno players did not play multiplayer.  I am guessing that the developers knew this and focused their budget on making the best single player experience that they could.\n\n\n"Dumbing Down" of Supply Chains:  I think this is a narrow minded complaint that fails to account for the new features and changes that mitigate the simplification of supply chains.\n\nThis is definitely still an incredibly complex game if you are looking for efficiency.\n\nIn Anno 2070, you would make a change to a chain, and then you would have to wait 30 seconds or a minute or two to be able to see if that change had the effect you intended.  You can now see this instantly.  This gives more time to actually play the game and less time staring at a number to see if it goes up, down, or stays the same.  Those 30 seconds add up over time.  Not having to check out a wiki for the most efficient layouts is also a blessing, as efficiency is going to be based more on how your personal city is set up than in how well you can copy a layout from the internet.  The "logistics" resource does a fantastic job of replacing the old way of making sure to have a supply depot nearby.\n\nIf you were a player like me who really liked fiddling with the fields, but always felt you were being less efficient if you didn't look online to see what other people had come up with, you may really enjoy the module feature they came up with for this game.  You get the "Tetris" style building placement gameplay while having more flexibility overall.\n\nNot to mention one of the best changes:  You can click and drag any building to move it around for FREE.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nAll in all, I completely disagree with the negative reviews and feel this is more than just a satisfactory entry in the Anno series.  I expect to play this for an unreasonable amount of time and recommend it to anyone who likes city building games.","November 3, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

If you've always hated having your transporters do ♥♥♥♥ you don't want them to and get annoyed looking at the same biome for hours on end, this is you Anno. Sure, the production chains are not as complex any more, but building the factories themselves has, with the new module system, become a whole lot more interesting. The different map regions (Temperate, Arctic and Lunar, with more to come, apparently) would be games of their own if they were not dependent upon each other for specific resources. The whole setting is very interesting, though the villain does feel, well, a little too "for the evulz" villiany and not well thought out, but Anno was never exactly Mass Effect to begin with. The one thing that actually really, really, really bothered me is that you apparently can no longer name colonies and ships.\n\nSo yeah, if you've always wanted to get into Anno but thought it was too complicated, give this one a try, and then later you might go and buy the previous one, or stick with this one.

Rather than posting a review after less time than it takes to complete the first mission and declaring this "Not My Anno" like many reviewers who havent played since Anno was a faux-historical game.\n\n2205 Is clearly an evolution of the franchise It takes a lot of what worked with 2070 and expands on it while scalng back some of what did not. Production is a lot easier to manage. City building can be done with an eye towards style rather than trying to maximize a social buildings footprint. Instead of the strange magic that people within a certain radius suddenly have their social needs met, the roads play a part now from what ive seen, better road planning can maximize the area of effect of buildings to an extent.\n\nFor those who claim the "challenge" is gone after playing 45 minutes have not progressed to the Artic map yet where the return of the dreaded sphere of infunence actually makes sense in the form of "heat". Certain buildings will give off a heat radius that is needed for housing which makes the city planning more of a challenge. I can only imagine the moon at this point.\n\nThe game runs bug free so far for me, it looks gorgeous and is easy to pick up and play even if you are not a vet without dumbing it down.\n\nA lot of reviews are claiming its been dumbed down, but it is fact simply better optimized to remove a lot of the nitpicky micromanaging that got so tedious late in the game. Instead its streamlined, it still requires you to pay attention but it is possible to play and plan a successful settlement without resorting to yield calculators and placement charts which always took me personally out of the game and made previous Annos a chore late in the game.\n\nThis review is admittedly only about 5-6 hours of playtime but I wanted to give it a fair try before posting.","November 3, 2015","true","31.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Mixed in with some military optional quest the game seems to be fairly robust, something that I think will only grow over time.\n\nThe soundtrack, not something I care about often, is actually quite good.\n\nOverall I think the game is pretty solid - if you dismiss the usual Ubisoft hatred and gnashing of teeth (some of it is warranted) and look at the game with an honest and open mind, I think you will find a beautiful fleshed out game, that will provide hours of fun for any city-building fan.","November 3, 2015","true","21.7"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

The most sour taste has been left with the feeling of an unfinished game, to be completed, in part, by the gradual release of DLC's.\n\nAnno 2205 at the moment is the foundation of a great game, the UI's been simplified and the interactions are somewhat easier compared to the previous Anno's. I find at times that it's been dumbed down a bit, perhaps to make it more accessible to a wider audience. I do fear that this will put off some of the more die hard fans out there.\nIt's a visually beautiful game, with excellent graphics and attention to detail, even down to zooming into buildings (I encourage you to take a look at some of the Lunar ornamental buildings).\n\nI get annoyed at the repetitiveness of, well pretty much all of the missions, summed up by "find x of this" and "destroy that". The military missions aren't much better! I do like the separation of the military missions to the main game. I miss the ability to take over other territories, I also miss the different factions of Anno 2070, although that's been replaced by the landscapes. Once in a landscape, they don't have different benefits per land piece, by that I mean growing coffee in one place and tobacco in another, again that's been replaced by the ladscape (alloys from Lunar, wine from Earth etc.), losing the trade routes within the map itself and switching them out to an overall space view. The trade route UX simplification is excellent in respect to creating them, click, click done!\n\nThe playability the game is affected by the monotonous tone set by the repetitive missions, and all in all doesn't take much to complete, a slow and steady growth pretty much ensures game completion. I remember being able to play Anno 2070 for days and still be entertained due to the intricacies of trade routes, land ownership, war etc. Anno 2205 feels lacking in a lot of ways.\n\nI have enjoyed the game, but have got bored with it after 24 hrs total play. All in all, what has been released so far is well rounded but ultimately an unfinished game, I have a feeling that next year it will have grown some muscle to conted with other Anno games, just not at the moment.\nFor that reason, I will recommend Anno 2205, just wait until a few more rounds of DLC have been released before you do buy it.","January 21","true","25.9"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","1"

You cannot just slap some buildings down and hope to succeed. You need to micromanage your production lines, plan out your cities, and if a major restructuring is needed, you're going to have to work at it.\n\nSo, why recommend this Anno when there are better games in the series out there? Plain and simple, this is a good introduction to the series. Anno Light if you will. For example:\n\nSupply and Demand is too easily met, but it's a good "tutorial" to the system.\nSpace is limited, but not really. There's no one preventing your expansion.\nYou can move your stuff freely, so no mistake can not be undone.\nLimited Resources are so easy to come by that it's more inconvenient than limited.\nInfinite Resources means you will never face a crisis from lack of basic materials.\nNot all of the changes are bad however, and some I feel do add to the gameplay.\n\nDifferent Zones mean different resources have to be shipped around.\nWhile 2 of the new zones don't feel different, the change in scenery without starting a new game is nice.\nThe limited resource concept if refined could be a nice challenge.\nI left combat and multiplayer out, because I am unsure how I feel about combat being moved off map. I certainly miss harassing my competitions trade, but without a means to directly confront an opponent on the map in the first place, not really sure how to respond to that.\n\nMultiplayer not being present yet is not really a bad thing either. I miss it, don't get me wrong. However, with the game as it is with what I'll assume is features coming in DLC, it would in effect be bad. So, wishing for a badly implemented feature is no better than not having it at all.\n\nIf you're a hardcore Anno fan like me, the game is a mixed blessing. It will certainly draw in new players to the series. I'd expect them to be hungry for more, and then seek out titles like 2070 or any of the ones from the Age of Sail. On the other hand, I feel this entry is still lacking in what makes the series truly special.\n\nExpect to see updates to this review as the DLC comes out. Until all the DLC is said and done, I'll be playing this game here and there. I do not necessarily regret my purchase, because I think there is a lot of potential here.","November 4, 2015","true","18.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Instead of being able to rely on keeping your employees content and have them passively generate all the money you will ever need , profitable export to the world markets becomes much more important.  And since producs fluctuate (sometimes quite wildly) in value in accordance with the vagaries of supply and demand, yesterday's most golden egg can quickly become tommorrow's dead weight.\n\nAnno 2205 is more streamlined than the previous version, eliminating some of the micromanagement of that game.  No longer must every island have to balance its own population of workers; in 2205 they have learned how to commute where needed.\n\nThere is also no need to micromange trade routes: goods flow automatically within the same sector and trade between sectors does not require ship building. In fact ships have been removed as buildable units for both trade and war.  Instead combat occurs in its own, optional sector as a somewhat separate minigame where the ships you own are automatically available at the start of the map.  Larger and larger trade ships become available at higher corporation levels, at progessively increasing mainteance costs.  Both of these are welcome changes.\n\nSo what exactly are sectors? It's how Anno 2205 makes a global corporation actually feel like a world player.  Each sector has a theme, and there are three of them: temperate sector, arctic sector and lunar sector.  The temperate sector plays most similarly to Anno 2070 with islands, employee residences, public buildings, factories and natural resources waiting to be exploited for fun and profit.\n\nThe arctic sector is where the scientists live and it's a bit different. Heat is generated by factories in a radius around the building.  Residences must be built within that radius.  This gives the layout of your arctic city a distinct feeling and gives rise to an interesting variation on optimal layouts compared to the temperate sector.  Maintenance costs are a bit higher than the temperate sector so a little more care has to be given to choosing when and what to build.\n\nThe final sector, the moon, is different again.  The moon is a harsh environment and buildings must be protected by forcefields due to the  constant danger of meteor strikes. It is also the most expnsive sector from high construction costs, to steep mainteance expenses, to the mostly costly transfer routes back down to Earth or the world market.  This means that unlike your temperate sector where life is easy you will need to carefully manage exactly what buildings you need and exactly how much population you are willing to support. Simply expanding your base willy nilly to every corner of your chosen crater is a recipe for swift bankruptcy.\n\nI am really enjoying Anno 2205. I have over 400 hours played on its predecessor.  The new types of sectors are interesting and challenging in their own rights.  While negatives effects like pollution and bad weather have been removed I am not too sorry to see them go.  I look forward to seeing if the newest version will hold my interest for just as long.","December 27, 2015","true","136.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

Dont get me wrong the Crisis Sectors are fun to play but It just feels\nlike a grinding process. What Would really improve this is that you should build a base err I am mean city then compete with the enemy then try to destroy or buy out his cities this make it less of a offline moba and more of in the line of Anno 2070 Oh how I miss the nukes.\n\nOn a side note it is very VERY pretty and I rarely say pretty for anything. It is a very fun enjoyable game but I find it too easy to get a successful settlement going. In all  it feels too easy.  Its fun and I am enjoying every moment of it. But its too easy atleast for me.  I recomend not buying it yet. Instead just play Anno 2070 if you feel this game is too easy. Despite all this I do recomend it for gamers who get intimidated by more complicated city based empire builders.\n","November 3, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

It can be even greater. How did i get to that conclusion. Well\n\nFirst all the stuff i expected to be there but was not. I played Anno2070 for many hours.\n\n- No logistics management. Now its just numbers. No trucks; No flying Drones picking up goods from production.\n- Military is now minigames (Thats great for me. I just wanted to build cities and productionlines.)\n- No Mountain destroying mining operations. (I thought the mines would slowly eat the mountains like a destructable environment like thing.\n- No transport ships taking flying from the earth to the moon thing. No more transport routes like with the ships in earlier versions. I wanted rockets like those ships flying between planets. I wanted to build on spheres (like in planetary annihilation) not flat maps. With a cool 3-stage futuristic rockets blasting off from the earth to the moon and back everytime goods are delivered.\n- I wanted to build a spacestation (But thats coming i guess, in the season pass).\n\nNow for the good stuff.\n+ Something new. Its not a clone of the earlier games with new skins on the units.\n+ I build a moonbase that supplies energy to every sector I have on earth.\n+ I got environments that is so beautefull I can look at it again and again and think wow.\n+ I got factories with the most awesome animations.\n+ I got productionlines and meaningfull storylines to fill up the wait time to generate money.\n\nI got a game that is not the end but potentially could be the colonization of the solar system and I can fantasize about it.\nI want to colonize and terraform Mars.\nI want to build cities in the skies of Venus.\nBuild large solar plants on mercury and cities on vertical walls in canyons to protect them from the sun and radiation.\nI want inhabit the moons of jupiter; Io, Europa (Under the ice cities and production), Callisto and Ganymede.\nI want to go to Titan and live among the rings of Saturn\nBuild a spacestation in the gravity equilibrium of Pluto and its moon Charon. And colonies on the surface of them both.\nI want to be able to stand on one planet and see the actual buildings I build on the planet, and rocket ships coming back and forth between them. (No shortcuts).\n\nI am recommending the game. PLease don't let us down. Make this game as awesome as it can be.","November 7, 2015","true","75.5"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

It seems that most of the negative reviews it originate from people complaining about the mechanics deviating from previous installments.  Keep in mind these guys probably complained about the changes brought on by anno 2070.  Don't get me wrong, I still prefer some of the old games where I could use troops to attack rival cities (1701 for life), but the new features make this game really stand out in a good way.  Another complaint I’ve seen is the casualization to where buildings no longer have an area of effect radius.  The top rating states that the game has become a "visual spreadsheet"... which ignores the fact that characterization can fit any of the games in the series.\n\n\nTLDR: It's fun a fun game with great presentation.  Most of the negative reviews are people complaining about really stupid things.","November 3, 2015","true","33.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

I like that.\nIts fairly easy, ive played on advanced.\n\nNow, when you reach all zones, it starts getting complicated.\nThe moon factories are crazy expensive in terms of maintence, and i find the game challenging at this point.\nSo you need to play at least so far that you come to the moon for the game to become hard.\n\nNow you will need more citicens so they generate income, at the same time you keep up of all theyre demands.\nAnd for that you need even more factories, that has maintence cost.

Not perfect and not everything it could be, but quite good.  It is also an expensive game, and for the amount of money there is only one thing wrong with it that turns it from a great game into merely a good one.  Yes, there are other issues, but one can always complain about something or wish for more in any great game.\n\nWhat really kills the quality of this game is the load times between different terrains.  You will need to switch back and forth between temperate, arctic, and lunar terrains in order to get the production balances correct and grow each sector.  The 15-20 second load times are simply unacceptable and make the city building experience much slower than it would otherwise have to be, particularly when you are playing on higher difficulty settings.  On a lower difficulty setting you might be able to overproduce in one sector in order to anticipate demand that will eventually come in another sector.  However, on higher difficulties the credits are scarcer and it's harder to keep the balance ticking upwards.  Thus, what "harder" means is that you have to switch back and forth between sectors frequently, slowed down by this load time delay every time.\n\nAll that said, I would totally buy this game again.  There are other good, cheaper games, and even some cheaper great games, but if you're bored with what you have in your library, have a discerning game pallette that is hard to please, and especially if you enjoyed Anno 2070, you will likely really enjoy this game as I did.","November 5, 2015","true","33.6"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

The one thing that I find this game unique is that it takes the benefits of the Anno 2070 and just improves on it, make it more complex and more unique.  In Anno 2070 the Modules you bought were part of the farm like you need 3 or 4 of Wheat Farms to make it 100% in a Nuetral Ecobalance.  In 2205 however, the Modules are just additions you can upgrade further on, it'll increase productivity, but at the same time decrease lets say, Power/Logistics/Workers.  Further on, it's Storyline and Quests, something that in Anno 2070 is changed.  Before you got 3 chapters, here, however you are part of the story, it just immerses yourself in, though I am abit upset that there is no Separate Sandbox Mode, but I do remember this game is still new so there will be alot of changes they might add.  To add further is the unique maps, It acts like 2070 when colonizing a new island, but they are all interconnected like this... Hub,  It's better than building routes inbetween that'll cost the credits.  The Arctic and Lunar, even better, my own knickpick is the requirments and space, not to mention the Costs, you can have a sucessful economy on Earth but the Moon might ruin that, so no spoilers there.\n\n2205 despite how much I can hate this game, still holds some respects for me. Being just released people will continue to attack this game because of Uplay DRM, or that the graphics were just terrible or something relating that it's lacking Multiplayer like what 2070 had.  Well to shoot down those people that just use that as an excuse to nullify this game.\n\n1) It just came out, Ubisoft is trying to release updates along with other games they got, so they might release a Multiplayer later on!\n2) If you hate the game because of Uplay, Why the heck did you buy the game off on Steam, you could've bought it off it's DRM Uplay at the same price!\n3) Graphics, come on you should've read the Requirements before playing, Fallout 4 is an example.\n4) Game is still "Beta" or "Just came out" so just give it time, it'll be fixed here and there! Just be Patient!\n\nIn all, this game is just worth it, if you got the time and wait for the gameplay~","December 29, 2015","true","75.3"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","4","15","0","1"

Like it.\n\nIt is a change from Anno 2070, for sure, but I am overall liking this game. The naval combat mission are a nice change of apce from base maximizing.\n\nThere is still storage like before, but this time the obvious number is the amount that that particular material is increasing or decreasing, not the amount in storage.\n\nThere are resources that your building consume to maintain population or to create other resources, but there are also building materials that you use to build other buildings. There are a few resources that only cannot be created by a building. They are given quite freely from the naval missions and even once through Uplay Rewards.\n\nThere is no multiplayer. There is no sandbox mode. Just campaign. The maps are huge and you can have multiple maps.\n\nThe building and management aspect of the game is still my favorite aspect, even if it has seen an overall simplification. In my opinion, that simplification was much needed polish to game mechanics that took too long to gleam valuable info from or to perform, such as resource balancing and moving buildings.\n\nI love the new modular building upgrade system. One of the best additions so far.\n\nI am also digging the regions and the trade between them.\n\nSo far I have not seen any real threat the AI factions pose. I just see them as a type of leaderboard.\n\nNot a single bug, although the game got a little bit laggy after 10 hours non-stop.\n\nI waited for this game for months, and even bit the bullet when the Beta was stolen out from under us. Yeah, Uplay is a sad reality, but I didnt have any problems with it (the download was kinda slow though even on 100Mbps).\n\nOverall, I am not dissapointed, although 60 bucks is a big pill to swallow for nearly any game. If you are undecisive, I would hope to see this on a winter sale or maybe cross your fingers for a free update or two. If all else fails, you can bet on DLC in the future to flesh out this game more.","November 3, 2015","true","43.4"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

Its easy to just pick it up and start playing. efficiency has changed a lot to. In the old game building placement meant everything you had to have an optimum layout for every item or you would be crushed in no time by an AI that was optimized. In this one placement isn’t as vital, there are ways to optimize and increase efficiency but in a different way from the old games.\n\nThere are a lot more changes to this title but I’ll leave it to you to find them out.

It is it's own beast, and after playing almost all the way through, I've decided I like it.\n\nYes, I miss some aspects of the older games, but what it lost in detail, it gained in playability. By removing the burden of managing inventories, the game now lets you focus exclusively on balancing efficiency which, in my opinion, is what Anno is really all about. My decisions have almost immediate effects which, again, allow me to focus on building and advancing, rather than having to micro-manage the storage slots on a dozen different trading routes.\n\nWhile I do miss being able to produce ships of my own and build defenses and all that, I again come back to the fact that this is just simply a different game and as it stands right now, doesn't suffer from the separation of building and combat.\n\nIf you're new to the Anno series, you'll love this game.

But not recommending this game just because of this is lame.\n\nMulti-player, this is a very controversial point, but let´s face it people, it´s not something that HAVE to be included in every game, there´s no rule book for developers and in it, is written "All games made by your company have to include Multi-player, not complying with this rule, your game will face rants and people crying all over the forums". So if you like multi, and feel this is a necessary feature, buy other game, or play Anno 2070.\n\nNot going to do a pro or con review, but I´ll give my opinion on the first 7 hours played and with my experience on anno series.\nThe game is fun, and have gorgeous graphics, I have a GTX 770 - 16gb ram and a I5 3.3 and the game runs on high with nearly 30 fps all the time with some drops when I close the view on the dams during the temperate play, so the game runs well and with not much problems.\n\nI reached moon only a few hours ago, and playing on the hard difficult is really hard, almost went bankrupt twice and the challenges artic and moon provides is what is making me enjoy this game, when you reach moon the buildings there are so expansive you have to re-plan your strategy to not get bankrupt. The changes that artic brings, like having to build your settlement around factories brings an interesting gameplay change, you are used to build factories as far as possible from your house and now you have to build house in the middle, of your industrial sector.\nThe moon, as being expensive, you need to plan around shields so to avoid meteor showers, but at the same time you need a lot of energy and income to keep expanding there.\n\nThe removal of warehouses seems a fair enough deal, having to build toons of this type of building was boring, now you have to deal with work force and logistics, so far I enjoyed this change makes the game more streamlined for this part.\n\nThe buildings have different modules, helping with more production energy conservation, workforce and a few others, I enjoyed this a lot, it´s nice ploping down factories in the begining and after have to go back, study, move (nice addition), expand and remove unnecessary factories, that you placed when you had no resources to build modules.\n\nA lot of things changed from Anno 2070 and I see this as a very good thing, I would be very dissapointed if we had the same game with only different regions, all of the same with no changes, but this is something that Anno team did well, they bring new challenges and new way of playing Anno.\n\nThis is a good game, and have a lot of potencial for expansion, already announced by Ubisoft, and will bring even more diversity. Ahhh forgot to mention the battles are very fun to play, even thou, and this is the only part I miss from Anno 2070 is the management of a fleet.\n\nI do recommend this game and don´t think it deserves the hate it´s getting only because of U-play and no MP.\n\nSorry if you see a typo, not my native language but I try to do my best.\n\nHope this review helps if you´re thinking in buying but haven´t decided yet.","November 3, 2015","true","46.2"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

However whilst the lack of scenerios and random generated terrain is of a concern for replayability I overall recommend this game.\nSure on the surface it lacks some of the finer gameplay detail that is abundant in the previous games but it also brings a much needed and refreshing set of changes that in my opinion do work, and gives you the sense of scale and pressure in making the connected areas work in harmony.\nI guess the question is, is it worth £50, which for a PC title is exepnsive, so far i think it is, i mean i havent encountered any bugs, its very polished, its interesting and not once so far have i felt bored or fustrated. I guess my opinion might change if i complete the game within 15-20 hours and come to the conclusion that there is no replay value but so far i havent reached that point.\n\nMy only concern is the DLC. It would be nice if the dev's would add some more content to the vanilla product first before rolling out expensive DLC.","November 5, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

After I played Anno 2070, the AI was very bad but the new features that were added, like pollution and energy, made it balanced. I rated it 9/10. Now I played Anno 2205, they cut out a lot of cool stuff, like randomly generated islands, coops, trading routes, etc... But they added very detailed building models and nice graphics plus two new locations (Moon, Arctic). Though that’s not enough to cover everything they cut out; the things the previous games had. So, my rating would be 7/10. I really hope the DLCs will add some cool features from the 1404 and the 2070.

However I'll get to that afterwards.\n\nLet's get one thing straight, I do enjoy Anno 2205. The big complaints from people seem to be that it departs too far from the typical Anno formula, however I'm perfectly fine with that! I'd rather we get big changes than see the exact same game with a new coat of paint every few years *cough*2070*cough*. The game does lack the same freeform gameplay of the previous Anno's, this time focusing on 9 pre-determined sectors that you can switch to at any time (assuming you've unlocked them). So no more settling islands and exploring the world. Is it a little disappointing? Sure. But being able to get right into the game without too much hassle does help.\n\nI don't want to spend too long talking about how I feel about the game as whole. Many of my thoughts are shared with other people, excluding the fact that I enjoy the more efficiency based gameplay over resource management. The big thing I've noticed however is game saving.\n\nThis game does use UPlay. And thankfully it doesn't seem to rely on it too heavily. Or so I thought.\n\nAnno 2205 does NOT have manual save functionality. It is entirely reliant on UPlay Cloud Saving. I was however unaware of the save failing after my Internet went down as I was closing the game. I started up the game today to find over 4 hours of work had vanished.\n\nSo the question is, do I recommend this game? Yes, but ONLY if you have a stable internet connection AND you have enough room on your hard-drive for the game saves. Otherwise you will lose progress seemingly without warning.\n\nSCORE: 7/10\n\nTL;DR: This game is in my opinion a worthy successor to Anno 2070, however its issues with saving and very linear gameplay prevent it from getting a higher score. Wait until it goes on sale.","November 6, 2015","true","20.3"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

Highly enjoyed both.\nAnno 2205 has some ups and downs, but overall I do enjoy the game.\nIt's far less reliant on tedious micro management of resources, supply lines, and trade routes between islands, which is nice.  You're not counting farms and calculating production based off eco rating to determine how many sushi joints you can build without running out of rice.\nYou build a farm, it makes 5 moon rocks, you expand it, it makes 10. End of story. Simple.\nWhich allows you to play across multiple maps, (which probably sucks for loading time on lower end systems) which is really cool.\nExpansion into space was a neat feature, as well as the costly trade routes to get out there.\nNot too many complaints; the questing is more like an annoying side-track quest, I'd like to see a return of underwater construction, and the game feels very linear. I'd like to see scenarios and open build again.\nAnd then there's the combat; although the new system is interesting, it's also fairly.....disconnected. You fight on one map, build on another, the two never touch. There are no military threats in your own seas, which is odd. But your ships don't get better via tech, but rather by the number of battles you fight and money.\nNot as many interesting ships, either. Like; there's no submarine that fires nukes at people.\nPersonal preference rules on the combat system, I like both, but kind of prefer the anno 2070 system.\nOh and also, no major world event vote for crap every 15 seconds bullcrap. Anno 2070 was clearly meant to be play at least once every 2 days, I do like not having my notification bar filled to the bring every time I log in lol\n\nIn the end, still like the game, still looking forward to DLC and how patches change the gameplay.","December 8, 2015","true","34.2"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

For years I imagined game where you run your own corporation in space and mine resources, what I did not imagine was little bit simcity elements mixed in but guess what it makes it even better.  This is just perfect game for me. Liked everything I have seen so far and I made it to the moon and my corporation is just starting. I see hundreds of hours gameplay in this. I liked Anno 2070 but I love Anno 2205! I love to concentrate on optimizing supply chains and manage my cities and bases to look gorgeous.\n\nFor hater reviews... There are still management and trading just different kind. You just need to play the freaking game, there are lot of depth in this game. Kinda overwhelming  actually towards endgame. There is ofcourse not actual end to this you can keep upgrading your corporation as long as you please. Game is pretty darn streamlined at beginning but gets to the point I believe even hardcore Anno fans should be satisfied but at same time makes for new comers easy to step in. Did you expect mechanics to be clone from Anno 2070 when there are now multiple planetary bodies involved? And isn't it good there will be loads of more Anno fans because start isn't complicated?\n\nTemperate, Arctic and Moon give game lot of variablity to game. Totaly different settings on all of three places and different tactics. I bet new DLC's will make this variety even more versatile.\n\nBTW runs well on high settings 1920x1200: Intel G3258 @4.5Ghz, 8GB DDR3, HD 7950 3GB.\nNo lag at all! After filling one region and being kinda on end game with easy mode still no lag to be seen. So if your PC is equal or better than mine you are good to on high settings!\n\nPrice is salty but game is sugary. Personally I can recommend Gold pack because it will add two whole new regions to play in game. I am truly awaiting orbit dlc to come because I wan't to already expand my corporation to space station/s. If its done such good quality as rest of the game it will be totally worth it. Keep in mind I am scifi fan who truly likes idea of colonization and space stations.\n\n+ Awesome graphics. This game makes me calm just by looking at it and there are good amount of detail in every building and almost everything is moving. No dull just standing buildings.\n+ Sounds are equally amazing. Awesome music and pretty good effects.\n+ Multiple region gameplay is very well done unlike some other city builder game.\n+ There are tons of stuff to do. I can say from my experience loads more on one gameplay than Anno 2070.\n+ So much Scifi awesomeness!\n\n- Carbage battlemechanics but makes good minigame when waiting resources to add up.\n- Loading times between regions. Nothing too bad but very noticable (~5-15 seconds in my case)\n- No multiplayer but there is resource trade system implemented and .

While it may be rather different from it's predecessors in the franchise, what it adds is more than enough to counter what it takes away in my opinion. Whilst I don't think it's worth spending the £54.99 on the gold edition (price at 20th January 2016), it's certainly worth picking up and giving a go if you were a fan or the previous games or city builders in general.\n\nCombat was moved to specific locations in Anno 2205, and so they have specifically designed maps which sort of have a story built into them. It's not a very good story, but it's something. At times, having to defend against attackers in the building regions would be fun and prove rather challenging, but sometimes I find I just want to focus on building without having to worry about being attacked.\n\nManaging multiple different building regions in different climates (Temperate, Arctic & The Moon), and having to transfer goods between them constantly creates an interesting challenge as you'll find that in order to advance in one region, you need to supply it with goods that can only be made in one of the other regions. Expanding to moon bases is an even bigger challenge than just the regions on the planet, as it needs a lot of materials from the other regions to operate and is massively expensive to the point where it could completely ruin you in-game economy if you aren't prepared for it or don't act quickly.\n\nThe main story is sort of average, with no huge twists or suprises. However it is a city builder / strategy game and so it was never going to have an amazing story like an adventure or an RPG game would have. It does the job good enough and introduces you to each new region type effectively.\n\nThe side-missions (or quests) that you get in each region can be rather repetitive, they're usually "go find these things (and bring them back to us)" or "Use this drone we've given you to destroy some things." Also, the game kind of forces you to do them if you want to build modules (upgrades) for you buildings or even some certain buildings themselves. You can buy the resources thaat you need to do this, but it sometimes proves to be not enough.\n\nEach sector has it's own string of major side-missions that usually consist of 3 parts, with each part having 5 missions to complete. Some of these are like the other side-missions, like "go find these things" but can be a tad more complex, like having to drag around a kind of drone that tells you the direction you need to be heading in. However, there can also be tasks like towing things to a certain point, or the miore challenging "maintain a certian population" or "maintain a certain surplus of goods or power" or "have this number of service buildings".\n\nThe optimal inputs and outputs are now listed in the description of each building, which I think is better than the guessing game that it used to be. The optimal inputs & outputs did exist in previous games, but you weren't told what they were.","January 20","true","20.8"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

The only things I don’t like about this game is that you don’t get to play with others and you don’t get a lot of land or a big enough map. Honestly, I would rather have all the maps combined into one super map than play in slices the way it is now.\n\nNow, to the things I really like.\n\nBuilding upgrades. You build something, then you can spend more to add upgrades to it so really, it’s like building several buildings yet it hardly takes any space! I mean, eventually you’ll have to build others, but you build fewer than what you had to do in the other games.\n\nMoving buildings. Holy potato this saves time! I mean, I don’t have to destroy whole swathes of buildings just to switch stuff around!\n\nI like how they added bridges and things. All the visuals are fantastic, a feast for the eyes.\n\nWhat I wish…\n\nHonestly I would love for them to make a game that goes from primitive to futuristic. A game that combines all their games into one. Something that allows you to truly grow a world and the people in it. Dawn of Discovery is still my favorite out of all the games. I do recommend Anno 2205, because it’s still a great game, I just don’t consider it in the same league as DoD and 2070.\n\nThey could do a whole lot MORE with this game. It’s like they took the idea of the future and took it too far, leaving behind everything that made their other games so good. If you’ve not played any of their other games, you’ll like this game. If you have played their other games, you’ll find yourself returning to those and only playing this one sometimes.\n\nI’m not satisfied, but for what it is, I like it. I just won’t play this one much till they give me more than boring single player in bite sized maps. I yawn at the whole corporate buying and politics, I liked how things were done in dawn of discovery. Maybe they are building up to something like, but I doubt it.

It's a great game!\nI don't play Multiplayer so this isn't a problem for me.\nThe combat system is fine for a single player game. Reminds me of C&C. I can see why it's done this way, It's a bu8ilding game at heart.\nThe maps are vast, the cities are vast. I'm having to manage 3 zones at once. Thank god im not having to micromanage trade fleets like previous games. Which i suppose is right, I'm the CEO of a company why would i care about logistics?, I tell some pleb where i want certain goods to go, and they get on with it. I can focus on building, meeting demand and not going bankrupt.\nI really like the relocate building feature, I'm not stuck with a building i've positioned only to find after modding it a little, I've run out of room and have to delete it like previous games.\nGraphics are really nice, gets a bit laggy if you play for a few hours, there seems to be some issue with it holding onto irrelevent data and hogging system resources, Just means after a few hours I'll have to quit and reload to keep it smooth.\n\nIf your playing it on easy and blasting your way through it in 10 hours thats your problem. If you take your time to meet demand, mod your buildings to make them more efficient, do side quests, do up your ships and make your cities and industrial areas look nice, the main campaign is easily as long as the other games. I'm guessing there will be future DLC with new senarios and expanded gameplay, but as a base game I'm really happy with it. I'll look forward to seeing where they go with it.","February 12","true","75.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

A lot of effort has been put into the design of the buildings and sector landscapes.\n-	Many hours of gameplay.\n-	The module system, which allows you to upgrade your production facilities.\n-	Three sectors in each of the three game regions providing plenty of room to build.\n-	No longer have to manage eco balance.\n-	User interface is clean and simple to use.\n-	Trade routes are simplified, but still remain a key gameplay element.  Eventually, you can transfer energy.\n\nCons\n-	No multiplayer.\n-       No manual save (cannot revert to earlier save game).\n-       Simplified trade routes (compared to Anno 2070).\n-	Load times can be a little slow, but generally there is no issue here. Note: I do have the game installed on an SSD (see below for further detail).\n-	Game crashed on me twice in first 27 hours of play.\n-	If purchased via Steam, Uplay is still required. Although my experience of Uplay has been positive.\n-	Conflict zone gameplay becomes repetitive.\n\nSummary\n\nThis is not Anno 2070. Yes, this is a good thing.  It is, however, at its core, still Anno.\n\nThis time around, you are in control of your own corporation with the aim of reaching the Moon.  Once there, you can mine Helium-3 and produce vast amounts of energy that you can transmit to your cities back on Earth.\n\nAs was the case in Anno 2070, you build production facilities to supply the needs of your inhabitants.  Once certain needs are met, you can upgrade residential buildings, which introduces the need for further goods and services, such as intelliwear and androids, security and transportation.  You carefully balance the supply and demand of these goods and services and watch your metropolis flourish.  The sectors look amazing, and as your corporation level increases you receive additional rare resources with which you can purchase modules for your facilities.  Trade is conducted between sectors, once your spaceports have been upgraded.\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my first 20+ hours with Anno 2205, and I look forward to many more! (8 / 10)\n\nAdditional Comments\n\nI do not understand all of the negative comments that are being made in other reviews. As another reviewer has suggested, perhaps those with more positive feedback are too busy playing and enjoying the game.\n\nI played the game on the Advanced difficulty level, and I had bought all sectors, reached 150k investors and built my corporation HQ after approximately 27 hours of play.  I have not fully developed my cities/settlements in the other sectors.  I look forward to many more hours of gameplay.\n\nI have spent over 80 hours with Anno 2070, and I can honestly say that Anno 2205 does become just as complex as you progress further into the game.\n\nOthers may disagree, but I believe the game is far from over once you build your HQ.  You can really begin to optimise and expand your cities.  You can even add modules to your corporation HQ.\n\nI have also tried the Asteroid Miner companion app.  This is not simply a Bejeweled clone as others have suggested – it is similar, yes.  Transfer of rare resources requires that you sign in to your Uplay account with your registered email and password or Facebook credentials.  It is worth noting that after just 15 minutes of play the back of my handset did feel quite warm to the touch – I can only assume this is due to heavy use of the phone’s resources.\n\nPlease Note: Although I have completed the main objectives, reaching a population of 150k investors and building my corporation HQ, I still continue to play.  This may result in updates to the content of this review.\n\nPlayed on the following hardware/software:\nAMD FX8350 CPU\nCrucial M550 SSD\nCrucial 32GB RAM\nGTX 660 2GB GPU\nWindows 10 Pro OS","November 7, 2015","true","95.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

This got things going for me after hours of updating drivers, restarting, etc. but the game now works fine, although a little laggy given I have 12G RAM.\n\nThe first few hours of game play have been fun thus far and I have just reached the moon stage.

I do like the interrelated biomes that send and recieve goods to create a complete production web. The gameplay is a bit different from previous Anno titles, but I actually prefer this approach. You still have your different factions to keep happy, but they're split out across the three biomes, so you only have to worry about one at a time, which I like. They're not the same factions (eco/industrial/scientist -> temperate/polar/lunar, plus maybe tundra/orbital in future DLC).\n\nOf course, as you can see from the screen shots and videos, the game looks fantastic. It's graphically very detailed and polished. The UI is also very solid. The tech is there.\n\nThe combat missions are... off-putting. I wasn't able to figure out how to create command groups, which is frustrating. In general, the combat left me feeling a bit 'meh'. Fortunately, you don't have to do them apart from two or three mandatory missions (maybe fewer - most of the story battles can be skipped just by gaining a corp level, which is pretty easy).\n\nThe tutorial NPCs are very naggy. Like, seriously obnoxious. If I have to listen to 'Time to upgrade your factories' one more time... Anyway, there's an option to turn those off. I am trying to hold off until I finish the story quests to do that, just in case I miss something, but it's getting harder every time the npcs remind me about an unfinished combat mission or to upgrade.\n\nThere's also mini quests? I guess that's what you'd call 'em. Basically, you have a little boat or buggy that's your avatar in the colony that you can run around and do errands for people to get the 'special resources' that you cannot acquire on your own. You can minimize the need to do this if you select the sectors that have rare resources as their perk. I did that on all three biomes, as I didn't find the mini quests enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying the game. It feels like an Anno game, but different enough to be interesting to me (and apparently to anger some Anno fans ;oP There's some real vitreol in the reviews here). For my money, I found it worth it enough to by the Season Pass. Thumbs up!","December 14, 2015","true","32.9"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

SO glad I did. Once you get past the first starting area everything starts opening up. It's missing some features we all have come to love/hate, but it's definitely Anno.\nAfter playing Anno Online for awhile now, the move function is quite handy and familiar for me. "I knew I wanted to place that building but this is a much better spot!"\n\nI'm hoping it becomes even more "Anno" in style as we go along. Things like Discovery, Co-op/Multiplayer...not there at the moment. If you are concerned about UPlay, don't be. It now uses Steam to connect. Although, you do have 2 clients running and Steam can get a little hefty on resources if you are running a PC like mine that meets the processing requirements at a bare minimum.\n\nThose are minor things, in my opinion. Sure, I'd love continuous build modes, etc. However, I have other Anno games to do that stuff while I take a step into the frontiers of Space for once.\n\nAll in all, a BEAUTIFUL game.

I played the heck out of Anno 2070, and this new version holds up. It's certainly different - the scale is much larger - but I actually really appreciate that they down play the fidgety clicking for fetch quests and make information about your economy and city much easier to access and understand. It's also interesting how they're replaced the automatic placement of farm components with a more intentional customizable system. Combat is more interesting, for certain, but no where near on-par with a real strategy game like StarCraft or Command and Conquer. I'm still learning a lot about how to lay out my cities and keep everything balanced. My only concern at this stage is wondering if I'll be able to advance the game to a point of being able to sandbox with more custom world settings. Not sure if that's after you beat it or something they'll make available through DLC.

I've played previous Anno's and have both city games and this is what Sim City should have looked like graphically.\n\nNow, as for my previous Anno experience: I came from the camp that never played Anno all the way through because I get tired of managing EVERYTHING.  It becomes really tedious and a very difficult balancing act to enjoy.  I also didn't like that resources ran out, meaning at some point the game was going to end even on continuous to make people happy....Or I'm missing something that would allow iron, coal etc to exist forever.  On top of that, other islands eventually become unhappy if one side is prospering in new food/technology etc.\nI learned that while a great game, that level of micro managing makes playing like a full time job and things can go really south if you lose track.\n\n\nI know some people love that about Anno and that is mostly why they dislike this game.  Its much easier to get started, not as complex planning is needed right off the bat, it is much more forgiving and changes have been made to remove a large portion of micro managing.  When I say a large portion, consider any previous Anno series game is entirely micromanaging comparatively....so I welcome the break.\n\nSo ultimately it comes down to what you liked about the previous Anno's or if this is the first time you've run into an Anno game.\n\nIf you like micromanaging everything to the T and enjoy tedious planning, then the previous Anno's are for you.\n\nIf you like a slightly more casual gameplay that escalates in a controllable manner without feeling like a second job and like to spend the time watching things grow instead of checking your inventories regularly, boat schedules/transfer rates, trial and error etc, and are looking for something a little more involved than Sim City or Skylines, this is probably going to be a Good - Great game for you.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify some of the mystery.  I haven't played long enough to go into full details but it is really hard to get a reading for this game from some of the reviews...especially ones that say "this game is crap, refund" or "not like anno, the others were so much better" without the discussion of what the difference really is or which camp they're coming from.\n\nAlso for hardware specs sake, I am running an i5 Devils Canyon at 4GHZ and a 980 TI at 2560 x 1080, 8GB 1600mhz Ram, 512GB SSD on Ultra - 8x AA max everything. Some studdering in the cut scenes which may be normal, plays perfect and looks stunning. Almost as good as real life.\n\n","November 5, 2015","true","5.4"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

It is similar to the Settlers series and the old Sierra City Building games in that on top of the city building elements, you have to develop a balanced economy to ensure that goods and services are available for its citizens.  If you compare this series to a game like SimCity, Cities XL, and City Life, the focus is less on the individuality of the buildings.  Instead, it is solely on the ecoomics of the town.  While the city feels more alive, the one downside of these games is that unless you can develop a sound strategy for trading, your city will always be stunted and never grow.\n\nSpecifically on Anno 2205, the most recent in the series, it is very much a refined experience.  Compared to the freemium game, the game has no microtransactions and you do not have to wait for buildings to be built.  Compared to the previous game in the series, Anno 2070, this game is definitely more accessible.  Rare resources are not has impossible to find as you can win them in simple combat missions or fetch quests.  The basic economy, which has less granular information and no tutorials, is at least easier to understand.  With trading between cities (one of the biggest strengths IMO), your cities feel important.  I constantly find myself going between the different maps in the game to build up my economy so that I have more money for other cities.  Oh yea, your balanced check book is based on the combined value of all of your cities.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game for anyone who like city simulation games like Settlers, Caesar series, SimCity, City Life, and Cities: Skyline.\n\n\nPros:\n-Graphics\n-Music\n-Performance\n-Quest System\n-Combat Minigame\n-Generally Fun Experience\n-City Networks that actually make sense\n\nCons:\n-Less Granular Information\n-Season Pass","November 5, 2015","true","6.6"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

Anyone who is a fan of the franchise should know that each game has changed considerably with each iteration whether it be the use of community centres, what resources you will need and where, what sort of factions you will build... 2205 is just the same. Whilst I agree mildly with some reviews which says certain features have been removed for no reason like having a warehouse with goods in that you can trade for profit and not knowing how many of each production building you will need for optimum output, once you put some time into the game you realise that it's very much an Anno game at the core.\n\nI am at the point in the game where you first start to colonise the moon which was 5 hours of casual play. When I first started the game I was a bit worried. It didn't seem like it had the same production managment that you did previous. I loved optimising farm space and working in little tight production trees which use as little space as possible and once you start on the later goods you realise that it's still there in the module system. I'm loving modules and figuring out how much space I need to optimise the production factory to maximum. It's just done in a different way.\n\nAs for rare materials, I remember that 1701 did a similar thing with resources like Jade? And lets not forget licences from 2070. You get them from completing quests, you don't have to do the combat minigame.\n\nAs for the combat minigame, I agree there needs to be more maps. But I feel that maps will be added to the game as it moves along and I don't think that's a bad thing. It's keeps interest. I like the combat as it gets rid of a bit of monotony, though the people do start bugging you about completing and then suddenly another will be available.\n\nWhen reading reviews bear in mind the amount of time the person has played they game as like any Anno game it's a nice relaxing start that suddenly becomes too much to bear. And whilst I believe I'm a player that will figure these problems out quite easy (Watching youtubers play this game is rage inducing.) I'm still not worried about longevity.\n\nIf you must. Give it time, wait for people to get over the rage of how easy 1 hour of gameplay is and then come back and see if opinions change.\n\nAs an Anno Veteran. I am very pleased.","November 3, 2015","true","17.1"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

Isolated maps, isolated game modes or missions. Anno 2205 is about continuous gameplay, development, integration and blending of systems. Elegant game design is the core here. Its like previous games of the series where cake ingredients and this edition finally mixed and taken then together to the oven.\n\nLong Version:\n\nAnno 2205 mix in a very interesting way the concept of endless mode and campaing of most city builders. The improvements and streamlining of user interface and gameplay are notable and really make the game more enjoyable to play than previous titles in the series.\n\nThe use of more than one "biome" really put more emphasis on interconnecting the economies of different regions and the little changes in gameplay between this biomes are a nice little change of mood.\n\nBattles still feel like a inadequade guest in Anno games, but at least this time they are more well constrained to a side mission structure, making them easier to ignore if you like or more like a small lite action romp to briefly easy your mind.\n\nA big notable change to gameplay is the fact that now you can change the position of previously placed structures. At first this seem like a way to make placemant mistakes less of a nuisance, but on long term has few interesting repercussions on gameplay. For once, previously planning placement of everything on the map is much less important, but at same time you have much more room for constante tinkering and optimization city of layouts. A feel that, for the proposed structure of continuous gameplay and multiple cities, this is a welcome change.\n\nA nice first impression from this strategy/builder. It is familiar but not afraid to change core aspects of the genre design and I think mostly well succeded in doing so. If any impression changes in the long term gameplay I'll update the review again.","November 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

The only thing that's changed in this game from previous games is the fact that the goods are now a production vs consumption ticker, versus a stockpile. The stockpile is still available, but it's for emergency use, when you run low on production. The reason for this is because you are playing multiple zones. When you are away in a different zone, the time in other zones still progresses. If they were to have a stockpile type of model, you would have exubirant ammount of resources stock piled in other zones when you eventually return there, and it would make the game pointless and without a challenge.\n\nThe supply chains in this game are complex and involved. If you loved managing production, supply, transportation, etc.. from the previous titles, you will absolutely love it here. It's even more involved.\n\nA lot of care went into the world. As production grows, on screen traffic of supply and cargo ships expands. The traffic is very dynamic and you will see your city and zones change over time as you put work into building your world. It's amazing how much care went into this game.\n\n","November 4, 2015","true","28.4"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

I think a lot of these reviews came from people expecting something different from this game, so make sure you know what you're buying before you spend your money.\n\nI have not played the previous Anno games, so I don't know how this game compares. I have loved the Sim City games for a long time, though, and was very disappointed by their most recent game (Sim City). This game feels a lot like what I would have liked to see instead. It's smooth, it's not filled with pointless micro-managing, it's pretty, and it's fun. If you want a game that makes you constantly play catch-up and worry about your citizens dying, then I wouldn't recommend this game (get something like Banished, which is also an awesome game, instead). If you want to build cities and watch them grow while building towards a goal, then definitely buy this game (if you've got a bit of extra money).\nA lot of people have said that this game is oversimplified. Although it's true that more depth and freedom would be nice, they've also made the game significantly less annoying than many city-builder games. Also, the longer you play the game and the more you branch out, the more complicated and involved the game becomes. It's really up to you how simple things are.\n\nPros:\n- Pretty\n- Relaxing (potentially, if you're not pushing your company forward quickly)\n- Loyal to the city-builder genre\n- Fun combat\n- Storyline\n- Starts simple, becomes complex\n\nCons:\n- Not very challenging at first (again, it's possible to challenge yourself with this game more and more as it goes on)\n- Might be a bit too structured for some people\n- Not a huge amount of content (yet?)\n- Expensive\n- Repetitive combat","November 6, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

The only things I don’t like about this game is that you don’t get to play with others and you don’t get a lot of land or a big enough map. Honestly, I would rather have all the maps combined into one super map than play in slices the way it is now.\n\nNow, to the things I really like.\n\nBuilding upgrades. You build something, then you can spend more to add upgrades to it so really, it’s like building several buildings yet it hardly takes any space! I mean, eventually you’ll have to build others, but you build fewer than what you had to do in the other games.\n\nMoving buildings. Holy potato this saves time! I mean, I don’t have to destroy whole swathes of buildings just to switch stuff around!\n\nI like how they added bridges and things. All the visuals are fantastic, a feast for the eyes.\n\nWhat I wish…\n\nHonestly I would love for them to make a game that goes from primitive to futuristic. A game that combines all their games into one. Something that allows you to truly grow a world and the people in it. Dawn of Discovery is still my favorite out of all the games. I do recommend Anno 2205, because it’s still a great game, I just don’t consider it in the same league as DoD and 2070.\n\nThey could do a whole lot MORE with this game. It’s like they took the idea of the future and took it too far, leaving behind everything that made their other games so good. If you’ve not played any of their other games, you’ll like this game. If you have played their other games, you’ll find yourself returning to those and only playing this one sometimes.\n\nI’m not satisfied, but for what it is, I like it. I just won’t play this one much till they give me more than boring single player in bite sized maps. I yawn at the whole corporate buying and politics, I liked how things were done in dawn of discovery. Maybe they are building up to something like, but I doubt it. Maybe their next game will go back to the things I loved best about the series.","January 22","true","28.2"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

I mean: Yeah! That's the thing! It's another game! If you want a game that is 100% like Anno 2070, then play Anno 2070?\n\nI like the new system, really streamline, and feel like it becomes really interesting when you unlock the artic colony, then the moon colony.\n\nSome stuff are a but boring, like some mission you can do to get some rare products (iridium, ...). One mission is like "Find 5 barrel on the land". And you basically have to find 5 barels, then click on them. Don't really see the point.\n\nBut appart from that, the upgrade system for production building is awesome. You can product more for cheaper. And makes your plants quite lovely.\nThe logistic system is brilliant: A logistic center gives you 25 transport unit. And the further a factory is from a logistic center, the more transport unit it takes to move the goods around. But of course, placing a new center cost money...\n\nAnyway, I find the gameplay refreshing, and the game is pretty.\n\nWorth notting (even though it should be pretty normal): first game published byUbisoft I've seen in a while that is bug free from launch!","November 4, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

Most of the negative reviews are from people that have not played the game long enough to really get into the meat of the game it seems. Don't be fooled by my gametime, I played it elsewhere and instantly bought it afterwards for myself.\n\nThere is also an iOS / Android game (match-3 type game) that allows you to transfer extra resources to your game. I'm not a candy-crush fan, but I really enjoy the idea and it allows me to make some progress on the way home from work.\n\nAll in all, I'm thoroughly enjoying the game. It's decidedly different from the Anno games before it, but I do enjoy the improvements. If I want to experience the previous gameplay I just fire up 2070 or 1404!

But whether or not it is still an Anno game depends on your definition. If you want a game about city building, supply chains, logistics and economy management then yes this is still Anno. Some of the complexity of these fundamentals may have been lost but sometimes that can be a good thing.\n\nThe scope of thsgameworld feels much bigger than any Anno game before it, Blue Byte Mainz (not Ubisoft, they were the PUBLISHER, not the developer) has created a game where I truly feel like I am creating a transnational logistics network with goods being shipped from around the globe to supply a colossal metropolis. Cities feel huge and vuibrant, especially in the temperate zones, the whole scope of the game feels like a dial had been turned up considerably. You may be running island chains a fraction of the scale of the previous games but in all honestly save for some really massive islands in Anno 1503, most of the games made it seem like the entire world decided to settle the East Indes. So I'm glad that even though there's only one city map that's joined to a continent. It feels more varied overall. I am still going to miss the random island system though.\n\nThe world itself feels distinct compared to previous ones which is always a plus with a new instalment of a franchise and there are a ton of visual and backstory cues to 2070 and if you're an Annoholic like me you may get a smile if you spot them. Even when cities get enormous they feel busy: In 1404 and 2070 whenever your city got to a certain size the crowd sizes would drastically drop; emptying entire districts of walkers. So far I have yet to see this kind of depopulation in 2205 as far as car traffic is concerned so that's a big plus.\n\nCOmbat has been overhauled to be confined to Crisis Zones that are all about combat. They're a very different feel to the rest of the game and feel much more involved than combat in previosu games. Though the tactic of "lump all ships together and plow through your enemies" is still somehat effective, a good commander will use all tactical advantages at his disposal like a missile strike, calling submarines or activating shields. It does beat the feeling of sicking your ships on a hostile mob and waiting for them to all die from Swiss Cheese Hull.\n\nI won't lie, the game does feel a little lacking in places. Random events like fire, illness and crime are gone, your competitors are mostly background features and the Crisis Zones, while offering a nice break from city building, can feel repetetive. Not helped by the providers nagging you saying "please get this job done" every 10 minutes when the only reason to do them is to get rare resources or kill time for your money supply to build up. One of the crisis zones involves lifting a blockade, but does it affect your supply chains in any way? None whatsoever and that feels like a missed mechanical opportunity. The supply balance mechanic as a UI element goes either way for me; its nice to know where I'm encountering shortages and quickly fix them but when it came to oversupply I enjoyed the feeling of loading up cargo ships and selling any overflow I had to my neighbours. Unless there's a feature I'm missing, the local trading posts from each sector only sell you things and don't buy anything.\n\nThis game has potential with expansion. The story ends with ambitious implications and Ubisoft has already announced two upcoming zone types which by the looks of things will be just as distinct as the three zones we already have. And there might be more coming down the pipeline as for 2070 Ubi we had host of small new things within the first 12 months of a release, with a fully-blown expansion when the period approached a close. We might see the same for 2205 but the inclusion of a season pass implies we have more to come beyond two new maps.\n\nI still consider it a positive experience though. It's a solid and relatively bug-free game that feels like a smooth continuation of the series and when it comes to issues Ubisoft's technical support have been very active and helpful on the Steam forums. So I will probably be playing it for a while.","November 23, 2015","true","91.2"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

I say that because of the space management involved and not just micro managing multiple different resources. I found that the longer I played that more complex the game became and it increased the difficulty, at least in my own opinion it felt that way. Making sure your other colonies had sufficient power, materials, and consumables were a constant that had to be monitored often, Otherwise, your credits would start plummeting because your population had grown too big or you weren't producing the optimum amount of resources for your citizens. One thing I would like to have changed is the time control.

I'm not going to give some hefty review as it's not really needed when you have throngs of 30 paragraph posts; the game itself is fun if you enjoyed the last few games to come out and if you're already using Steam or Origin in the first place you probably don't care about Ubisoft's little system.\n\nThe gimmick for this Anno is the multiple colony system. You build up not just island to island but to other sections of the full map itself, after that you can tap into the moon for all sorts of odd resources and what not. Ocean combat got brought back in from Anno 2070 for some reason but it's about as smooth as it should be.\n\nPros:\nExact same game everyone expected it to be.\nUPlay doesn't do anything but sit there quietly and let you sneak in little perks as you level up.\nIt's a pretty game, nothing Earth shattering but it looks good.\nThey didn't change much other than some of the lesser systems.\nYep, still the same build 20 buildings that feed into 20 buildings that feed into 5 buildings game we've loved for 10ish years.\nLots of banter making fun of the Tycoon faction from 2070, pretty sure nobody actually played them because they were bad...\n\nCons:\nVoice acting kinda sucks for the character that introduces you to combat. Pretty sure they actually brought in a boatsman.\n$60 is a bit much unless Anno is one of your favorite series. Money well spent for me but maybe not for everyone.\n\n\nTl;dr: Moderate bashing for no reason from others, but the game is rather great and pretty darn fun at the moment. Only bugs was some of my buildings randomly turning blue and some weird shimmering while zoomed out; minor stuff.","November 2, 2015","true","14.2"," 10 of 31 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","10","31","0","0"

This game is a big improvement over Anno 2070, no longer do you need to spend hours making trade routes and optimizing them constantly, which was about 40% of the damned gameplay in that game, it is now replaced with you needing to do that same thing, but faster, in world view.

It runs fine on my mediocre PC (R9 280X/i5 4690k @4Ghz) without any issues. No crashes, audio is not missing. On the dumbed down part, sure it starts out simple, but in a few hours you'll unlock production factory upgrades (eg: fields in previous Anno games), and arctic region. The game is not overly easy on medium, you actually have to watch your resources otherwise you are going to run into problems. There is one big issue though: the crisis sectors. They are horribly implemented, boring and long if you do the sidequests for the extra necessary resources. Also they are part of the story, I had to complete two up until now. Let's hope that one of the DLC sectors will provide an alternative in acquiring the rare materials.\n\nVerdict: the game is good, looks nice, plays nice. The price and the crisis sectors are big negatives though. If you just want to play an Anno game, buy 2070, it's cheaper and more fleshed out. If you ran out of Anno games to play and have enough disposable income (or not interested in) to buy Fallout 4 then this game is a good choice.","November 2, 2015","true","18.9"," 17 of 48 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","17","48","0","0"

I simply didn't give this game a good play through. I have 200 HRS of Anno 2070 game play, and 120 HRS were spent dealing with the logistics of shipping what product where and what ship to put it on, and end game is maddness when something breaks in this shipping mayhem. So when I read reviews upset that the logistics is not the same I can't relate at all! I find it as the best remake and difference in the game and something that needed to be changed, and I am not a newby. I find the game submersive with the sound track and amazing...I mean amazing graphics and that is on high settings. I have a Geforce 980 and on ultra settings my frame rate drops in the 20's and teens in some places. I have always enjoyed Anno for the things they add into the appearance of the game and didn't have to..it just speaks excellence to me when someone pays attention to the perfection in the details. Every model in this game will make your jaw drop. It is so well done you could kid your eye into thinking you are looking at work being done on the Moon. I applaud the people at Anno for there dedication to the series...well worth my time and money!","November 2, 2015","true","62.6"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","0"

If you played 2070, you'll be able to jump into the game without hesitation. Basic UI and controls are the same, as are the game mechanics. If you are new to Anno, you may have a little trouble as the tutorial is rather basic and not all together intuitive. I liked the fact that you get to name your corporation and pick a logo, a neat little spin on things. The unique materials are an interesting idea, and so far haven't shown themselves to be a hassle. EDIT: I should add that one game mechanic is pretty different. Instead of having a stockpile and warehouse, its simply and up or down consumption rate. I honestly didn't notice this, as the rate isn't displayed by default. But you know what? I like the change. Instead of building more warehouses or turning off producers you can say "oh, Ive got plenty of construction bots. Neat" instead of "♥♥♥♥ EAT THE FISH ALREADY YOU DAMN BOTTOM RUNG ASSES"\n\nI just unlocked the artic zone, but haven't played it as of this writing. The combat oriented mission was a little disappointing, but the gameplay otherwise is great. I can't wait to see the changes that the Artic and Lunar zones are going to require. I also hope we see some DLC letting us work underwater like in 2070, that was a personal favorite of mine.\n\nAs I said, so far, so good. If you enjoy city builders, Anno is a great series for that kind of fun.  If you enjoy putting together Rube Goldberg machines, this is the game for you. You enjoy things working together as a well oiled machine? Look no further. Anno rewards players for good management, and this addition to the series is no different. As far as gameplay, I noticed no bugs, played well on my machine (a modest rig). Time to get my money's worth before I get sucked into Fallout 4 for weeks/months.","November 2, 2015","true","1.4"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","0"

Looks cool, yes, this is obvious. BUT, the last anno that i played quite alot was 1404, and was really amazing, everything. But with this i feel that everything is easier, not really challenging and quite guided every thing. So the game ends up being boring =/. Its super sad for me to say this, but its exactly what i feel. And also that the planning and building feels that it goes super fast, like clikc click, done. I payed 70 bucks for the gold edition, and in my opinion is not worth that money. To sum up, i'm disapointed with the new Anno, because the lack of challenge or motivation when playing it.
