The mechanics are simple.  The purpose is clear.  There's no confusion as to what you are expected to do and what tools you have to do it.\n\nIt's diabolical.  The puzzles are sometimes bananas, requiring some pretty twisted logic and lateral thinking.  While you strive for a solution, there's a constant nagging feeling that sometimes your solution is just inelegant and you need to do it better.\n\nIt's oddly darkly humorous.

Don't let the Early Access tag scare you, because it's pretty far off, and it's already worth every full-priced penny in it's current state even if the developer decided to walk away tomorrow (which I'm sure Zach will not do)\n\nThe best thing about this game (and SpaceChem before it) is the awesome feeling of "♥♥♥♥ yeah, I'm such a badass for doing this ♥♥♥♥", that you get after each level completed. And in a way you are, as this game is a lot harder and smarter than most games out there.\n\nPros:\n- "I'm such a bad-♥♥♥" feeling\n- Great tutorial/intro\n- 3 solution slots per level\n- Spacechem pyramid dangling in the rear view mirror in the intro\n- Learning curve is very well balanced\n- Stable and polished\n\nCons:\n- No in-game recording and sharing tool (ok, this shouldn't be a Con, but we got spoiled...)\n- No or too few data points to compare performance (this will turn into a Pro later, as this feature is awesome)\n\nGraphics are functional but nothing to write home about, neither Pro nor Con, but certainly good enough.\n\nI recommend you pick this up at full price if you can, as this is one developer that deserves more money so he can make more good stuff like this.

It's very polished. Puzzles are start out easy enough and involve some that are easy but not obvious (a thing that is missing in A LOT of other games) until they get harder and harder.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/recommended/300570/","stubar","stubar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/","1648 products in account","I should've made a review for Infinifactory some time back but I kept putting the time off, waiting for the time when I could make a review worthy of such a fantastic game.  I fear I will never be able to do the game justice, so here goes with a short review as ideas simply pop into my head!\n\nAs you can notice from my first parapgraph I think extremely highly of Infinifactory.  For some time I was searching for a puzzle game with great replayability.  I heard about and played Spacechem, which is an impossible game not to mention when reviewing Infinifactory.  Both are developed by Zachtronics and both employ identical mechanic, but Spacechem is in 2D and Infinifactory is 3D.\n\nThe essence of the game is to take some materials as an input and manipulate them via building a machine/factory from different types of blocks to conform to the required output.  So you may have to rotate and weld two different types of blocks together or receive a broken item, remove the broken parts and replace them with good parts.  The variety of puzzles is very good and you don't feel like you're repeating the same processes during your progression.\n\nThe beauty of both games is that each puzzle can be solved in maybe an infinite variety of ways, so once you have made a solution you can go back and attempt to streamline various factors of your machine : footprint, cycles and blocks used.  Very similar to engineering projects in the real world!\n\nHopefully some of your friendlist will also play the game as in game leaderboards are included for each puzzle to further the replayability.  There are slots to save three of your machines for each of the puzzles, so you can purpose build a machine for each of the scoring criteria e.g focus one machine solely on having the smallet footprint possible even if it is at the expense of being less efficient and having an increased cycle count.\n\nI'm approaching 60 hours into the game and I am half-way through the second campaign of the two.  I've gone back and fine-tuned a few of my older machines and completed a couple of the community made puzzles.  There are literally hours and hours of gameplay available.  I'm generally not a "sandbox" type of guy either so Zachtronics have definietly managed to include the magic ingredient with this one.\n\nA lovely feature of the game is to be able to export animated gifs from a static camera point of your working machine, which will loop infinitely.  It can be very satisfying to construct a particulaly nice process within your factory and watch it loop over-and-over.\n\nThe game has a slightly comedic and quirky story that holds the levels together and they progress in difficulty at a nice rate.  The levels get a bit easier when you start the second campaign and then begin to ramp up again!  There are some tough levels which may put off a few people that don't enjoy a mental challenge.  I found myself trying to solve some of the puzzles in my head whilst at work!!\n\nThis is one of my favourite games of 2015 so the question of whether I recommend it is not a tough one at all!!  It's easily worth the full price, I bought the game in a sale and feel a little ashamed for doing so!","December 5, 2015","true","60.8"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","75","86","6","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masem/recommended/300570/","masem","Masem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masem/","3952 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe best way to describe Infinifactory is that it is a more accessible version of Zachtronic's previous SpaceChem. It's still about using tools to assemble and disassemble block-based assemblies, but because it is in 3D, and is much easier to visualize the pathways things will take, it is much easier to grasp how to construct machines to do the various tasks.\n\nThe puzzles currently included in the game are still hard - this is not a walk in the park and once you get past a half-dozen puzzles, the challenge bumps up greatly.  However, the game gently introduces new block types - with minimal instructin but obvious application, so getting your mind around these puzzles can be easily done.  And like SpaceChem, all you are trying to do is get a working solution to start, but then using the histrograms of friends and other players, try to go back and improve your scores. And as you process, you'll learn new tricks and means to tighten up and reduce production time on earlier puzzles.\n\nAdd that, like Spacechem, the game includes user-made puzzle support through Steam Workshop, and this has a very long playability. The price might seem a bit high compared to Zachtronics' earlier games but it definitely has great value for that.\n\nFurther, one should not be afraid of this being Early Access. Zachtronics has polished this entry to be near-final form, planning on only updates in user experience, content, and other non-essential but beneficial features to be added with Early Access feedback.","January 24, 2015","true","22.7"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","37","40","4","1"

It's all the programmy goodness of Spacechem (and Zach's earlier browser games) but in a beautiful 3D environment with some cool storytelling mixed in.\n\nInfinifactory is a puzzle game, but different than what you may be used to in this genre. You're given a set of input blocks, and must maneuver, combine, and reconfigure these blocks to match a specific output on the other side of the map. It's incredibly open-ended in how this is accomplished, allowing for some brilliantly simple, or horrifyingly overly complicated solutions to the same problem.\n\nDifficulty curve is nice and smooth, reaching a peak difficulty that will require some serious time and thinking to work through, but was never hard enough to get me to give up entirely. Adding a bunch of folks to your Steam friends to compare scores with adds an extra level of replayability by giving you the opportunity to optimize your solutions to get a few cycles under your buddies.\n\nInfinifactory was further reviewed by myself and my good friend Gary in episode 38 of our podcast Check it Out, Comrade!

It takes something truly compelling for me to spend hours, sometimes days at the end, perfecting a single puzzle, and yet I have never felt frustrated.  This is a game that truly earns the description 'engaging.'\n\nEverything that happens in this game is because you made it, and you need to have your brain firing on all cylinders to make it through. But fear not, any new players considering this game: the mechanics are easy to approach and you'll be hooked in no time.  Players who have enjoyed any other game by Zachtronics (like Spacechem or TIS-100) or who like similar games with similar mechanics (Factorio, Big Pharma,  even the city-builder games by Impressions) will absolutely love Infinifactory, but I think anyone willing to giving Infinifactory a chance will love it too.\n\nIn this quick review, I'll discuss the gameplay of Infinifactory, it's aesthetics, and try to answer why I've been unable to put this game down.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: from a certain point at the start of each stage, a series of inputs regularly pop out a component-usually a single box, but other times a more complex shape.  From there, the goal is to simply combine these inputs to meet at the output area, and repeat this ten times.  The player has a number of tools at their disposal, from simple conveyor belts and welders, to parts that push and destroy.  With these parts, all sorts of advanced operations may be performed- advanced techniques even allow players to build 'circuits' from these simple parts.  A later level may resemble a factory made by a mad scientist, full of pipes and blocks, with piecies whirring and whizzing by, only just avoiding disaster.\n\nInfinifactory has pleasing visuals, notable for its sturdy blocks and the orange and blue color scheme of its factory parts.  The environemnts are colorful, vidid, and distinctly not of this world. The screen shots do a better job describing what it looks like than I can, but as you can see, there are a great number pleasant and varied stages, and for the most part, there feels like a good variety of factory components, too.\n\nThere is an interesting story being told, usually through voice logs and a handful of scripted sequences that set the stage for Infinifactory's otherworldly visuals. In many puzzle games, even those that do try to tell a story, the gameplay has no relation to the story. Here, there's a reason why you're building things- and you may not exactly be doing it of your own free will. The story's tone is quirky, with a grinning undercurrent of black humor.  There are a few twists and turns along the way that delighted me.  I found that a nicely written story like this helped ground the events and kept me interested.\n\nPuzzles in this game have a wonderful quality where the final output seems simple, yet constructing it from its individual components can be deceptively challenging.  There's a smooth difficulty curve, with tools introduced gradually and new techniques being learned organically as more challenging puzzles are introduced. By the time I'd beaten the game, I found that I could go back to puzzles that took me 90 minutes to solve and beat them in 20 minutes, with a much better score as well.\n\nAt the end of each puzzle, the player is ranked according to three criteria: how fast the puzzle was, how many blocks it took to build, and how much space it took up.  I like the way that this scoring encouraged me, because it was rare that I hadn't done well in at least one category.  This system encourages different styles of play-those who (like me) enjoy sprawling, messy solutions that strive to be as fast as possible, or those who favor a more restrained, elegant design.\n\nThe game comes with a capable level editor that's integrated into the Steam Workshop. Already, tons of user-made levels are available for play. In my experience, though, few have stacked up against the levels in the campaign.  Most are based around gimmicks or some other novel use of the mechanics.  Sometimes this is successful, but overall I haven't found it as satisfying. That said, I can't claim to have explored the workshop throughly, or to have attempted to create any levels of my own.\n\nThe true joy in this game comes from the sense of owning each solution you make. There's no single way to solve each puzzle-there are hundreds.  After completing a particularly challenging puzzle, I've often looked up how others have solved theirs- not once has my solution resembled someone else's.\n\nI never had the feeling, like I often do with puzzle games, that I was fighting with the developer to find the 'right' way to solve the problem.  Instead, Infinifactory simply gives its players a handful of tools and asks, "Why don't you build something interesting?"\n\nI think it's the mark of a great puzzle game that I have enjoyed my failures as much as my successes.  I have looked back at puzzles that took me hours to solve, and even though the final result was a swollen, creaky machine, I can remember all the hurdles and struggles it took for me to create my solution and think, "Yeah, I built that."","August 30, 2015","true","250.0"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","27","27","3","2"

And the steam workshop integration means there's practically endless puzzles to play.\n\nIf I had one complaint it would be that there's no way to increase the fast-forward rate.

If you follow the indie scene even slightly, I'm sure you heard the ample praise and acclaim for Zachtronics' chemical puzzler. After a foray into card-game strategy with Ironclad Tactics, the developer has returned to  the world of meticulous planning and systematic construction with Infinifactory. You might have heard it described it as "SpaceChem in 3D", and while that's an apt description, it doesn't exactly detail what makes Infinifactory an awesome evolution of the SpaceChem formula. Infinifactory takes everything you loved about that game, on a grander scale and with new depth, wrapped up in an alien industrial aesthetic.\n\nForget about bonding elements and creating molecules. Infinifactory leaves the microscopic world of SpaceChem behind for the world of alien engineering. The enigmatic story puts you in the shoes of a person captured and forced to build extraterrestrial constructs. Audio logs and notes allow you to gradually piece together the overarching tale, but let's be honest: you're here for the puzzles.\n\n"SpaceChem in 3D". Introducing the third dimension adds so many tweaks and new complexities. Having to remember that items take time to fall when you're trying to sync up blocks across multiple levels. Working out how to maneuver pieces across multiple axises so that they all eventually meet. Having to build objects with height and width and depth. Getting the mess of energy conduits and welders and pushers to work and timed correctly...all without Spacechem's sync command to fall back on. On top of all that, Infinifactory has the most seamless, intuitive, user-friendly control scheme and interface I've seen in a block building game. You can effortlessly rotate and place blocks, easily create long conveyor belts or delete unwanted sections in seconds.\n\nIt's the meticulous construction and pursuit of perfection and optimization you love. The hypnotic rhythm of seeing your complex sprawling mess of moving pieces and parts actually work properly after countless failures and tweaking. The challenge of learning how everything works and functions, and using that knowledge in new ways that makes you feel like a damn genius when it all comes together in the end. It's all that, in a 3D world of sky docks and armories and spaceships and missiles. Six hours in, and for me, Infinifactory has already eclipsed SpaceChem, due to the presentation and polish and the spatial depth that offers new challenges in ways that SpaceChem never could. The price may seem steep, but for the amount of polished content already here, and the content to come, it's well worth the asking price. While Infinifactory may be in Early Access, the current version is literally the 1.0 release version, with a feature-complete finished main campaign. Mini-campaigns and new blocks and mechanics will be added in future updates\n\nIf you enjoyed SpaceChem even in the slightest, you won't be disappointed by Infinifactory. It's everything that made that game great, on a grander scale and literally with new depth.","January 22, 2015","true","12.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","23","25","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evanbgood/recommended/300570/","evanbgood","SketchyGalore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evanbgood/","843 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSpacechem was my favorite puzzle game of all time - Infinfactory ties it, if not beats it.\n\nThe game is conceptually similar to Spacechem: You're given a goal to construct, you're given a supply of various parts, and you're tasked with making a contraption that can mass-produce the intended product. Both games share a similar creative element that makes them great. Since there is no "right" way to solve a puzzle, every solution you come up with feels like it's uniquely yours, and you get a massive sense of satisfaction from seeing your creation in action after a long period of head-scratching.\n\nDifficulty wise, I found it slightly easier than the previous game, but still an extremely challenging puzzler. I've heard complaints about it being too obtuse, with tutorials too hard to understand, but I found that the game had a great sense of discovery and experimentation that would have been ruined by less subtle guidance. The puzzles themselves offered some great brain-straining, though I ultimately found myself running into less frustration and fewer dead-ends than I did with Spacechem.\n\nThe scoring system deserves mention for being unusual, but brilliantly designed. In addition to the obvious scoring of solutions based on how fast and efficently they complete the goal, the game also scores you on your "footprint". What this means is, looking on the solution from the top down, how many squares are covered by machinary or have moving parts passing over them during a run of the solution. So, ten machine parts only count as one footprint if they're all stacked on top of on another. This is different than Spacechem's scoring of how many parts (symbols) are used to make a solution. In addition to creating a different way of thinking for those looking to get the best possible score, it allows a surprising amount of creativity that would have been lost if it simply counted the parts. For example, a large assembly can easily be moved by one conveyor belt, but it looks quite strange. A floor covered in multiple conveyor belts would look better, and would have the same footprint score as the more basic solution. This even allows some artistic freedom, as you can construct roofs and other shapes above your moving parts without penalty.\n\nThe game features a humorous, but very dark story of alien abduction and enslavement, most of it told through audio logs found on dead bodies, holding their last words before they died trying to solve the very puzzle you're trying to solve. They range from funny to heart-wrenching, and I found myself getting far more invested in the lore than I expected to. Cool-looking factories would have interested me enough, but instead I was making cool-looking factories at the behest of my evil alien captors and questioning just what I was making and why. Even the puzzles themselves had humor and personality, eventually making me feel like I was constructing actual products, not just assemblies of cubes. If I had one complaint, it was how the ending left me hanging. Obviously I don't want to spoil anything, and this may be the only "Early Access" part of the game, but it seemed like there was a LOT more story to tell after the last puzzle.\n\nSpeaking of Early Access, this game is probably the most complete early access game I've ever played. I ran into absolutely no bugs or crashes, no missing or placeholder content, and a campaign that lasted me well over a dozen hours. Infinifactory could have easily been released as a finished game and I'd have no critisism about its current state. I hope for and look forward to the potential additions in its early access development, such as new parts, continuations of the story, and of course, new puzzles.\n\nI'd highly recommend Infinifactory to anyone who likes a challenging puzzle, as well as those who like creative production games like Factorio or automation-based mods for Minecraft. And of course, for people who liked Spacechem, I would call this a 100% must buy.","February 9, 2015","true","34.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

It's not a AAA game, but it has a crisp, clean look to everything.  It looks amazing.  Then I started the gameplay - it's rock solid.  I've played about 1/4 of the puzzles in a 4 hour binge on the game - it reminds me of spacechem but it's got completely different pieces and rules/limitations.  It also has the humor of Spacechem - when you are reviewed by your alien overlords, and they give you some food pellets and some kind of reward it's epic in it's own way.\n\nIf you liked Spacechem or modded industrial Minecraft, you'll love this game.  You'll also like it if you enjoyed Factorio.  I'd say this game is more challenging than Factorio because the puzzles are more constrained.\n\nI don't know why this game is listed as early access - the day 1 release version is rock solid.  It would be perfectly acceptable as a full retail release.  So far, the only negative is that for some inexplicable reason you can only put 6 blocks in the hotbar instead of using all 10 keyboard keys - I suspect the developers will be fixing this promptly, I just wonder how they ended up with this limitation in the first place.","January 20, 2015","true","21.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","15","17","6","0"

Period. In my opinion, a good puzzle needs to meet three conditions:\n\n1. It must require hard thinking to solve\n2. It must not be frustrating when no immediate solution can be found\n3. it must make you feel smart when a solution IS found.\n\nThe first point is pretty obvious, since most people play puzzle games  in order to think. point 2 is the reason I don't like puzzles as a genre; almost all puzzles can only be solved in one exact way, and if I am not thinking in the super unorthodox and particular way the author deems to be correct, I cannot solve it, and that is frustrating to me. Point 3 is the most important. I can accept some frustration if I end up feeling good when I finallly solve the puzzle. However, again almost all puzzles I have tried make me feel like an idiot for not seeing the solution quicker, when in fact the solution was by design arbitrary and for the lack of a better word, "stupid".\n\nEnter Infinifactory. 1. Infinifactory is hard! I have sat at a single puzzle for literally 3 hours scratching my head trying different solutions only to be foiled by something. It requires three-dimensional visualization and thinking. It requires both hard thinking and creativity in order to solve.\n\n2. The aforementioned puzzle I tried for 3 hours didn't feel like 3 hours. I decided to play the game for 20 minutes one night before bed, and 3 hours later I realize it has not been 20 minutes. I then continued for another 3 hours (I didn't need sleep *cough*). Infinifactory lets you constantly make progress towards a solution, even when I largely have to start over and delete what I did. It does this by naturally building off of previously done things, and requiring you to combine many small solutions into a coherent whole.\n\nFinally, 3. Infinifactory makes me feel like a ****ing mastermind mechanical engineer and PhD in quantuum mechanics that just solved nuclear fusion when a factory I built works and works beautifully. I have  never rage quit this game once, since even failing is fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltzer/recommended/300570/","waltzer","Acatinabox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltzer/","158 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI must point out, if you don't enjoy difficult problems and solving those problems, this game probably isn't for you.  It's not instant gratification, it's grueling visualization and planning, only to watch your brilliant idea fail miserably and need many revisions and modifications before even working correctly, and then further modifications to actually optimize a build.\n\nStill, it's not nearly as difficult as making a real assembly line, but that's basically what this game is, assembly line simulator.\n\nThat's not why I am giving this game my recommendation though.  While it is a great assembly line simulator, it goes above and beyond that in thoughtful design and detail.  It could have easily been a game that was purely solving puzzles, but they instead opted to include a story line, one with many subtle implications, both dark, terrifying and humorous.  These story parts are sparsely distributed between small cutscene like performance reviews by terrifying and confusing aliens, and other dead humans that came before you.\n\nProbably the most intriguing thought that came to mind for me was after the story picked up a little, and after thinking for a bit on how the ones before you dealt with their predicament...  I thought it was funny how many of them saw their prison as horrible torture, and how the charcater you play is obviously some sort of engineer.. I had a good laugh at the idea that it was torture for everyone but an engineer, who must surely find it to be the greatest thing to ever happen...\n\nNo intrusive troglodytes to obstruct your work, no bosses that don't understand engineering, no stupid monetary constraints.  Just you, the problem, and the machine.  An Engineer's wet dream really...  Also abducted by a giant Alien mega-empire...  Just to stroke the Sci-fi fanboy deep down inside every engineer.\n\nI love these little touches, it brings the game to life in a way that a menu and empty room never could.  And the game could have easily been just menus and bland puzzle rooms, but instead you are transported to various alien worlds...  You see the failed attempts of those that came before you, and you listen to the intriguing storyline that plays out as you play the game.  It gives reason to the puzzles, and that makes all the difference.\n\n\n\nAll that being said, it is a fairly difficult game.  I don't think I've played a game before that required this much cognitive excersize in order to advance...  You really have to be able to see the machine working, step by step, in your mind, long before you place the blocks...\n\nFor me personally, that's one of my greatest joys of being a sentient being.  I love using my imagination to create working devices, and I especially love it when I finally manage to bring it into the game world, and it works perfectly...  Brings a tear to my eye...\n\nSo if you're up to the task, pick up this little gem and see if you can get a better cycle score than me...  Just remember, I pretty much start all the puzzles now by switching input to max and working it out from there first, and taking away input as needed.  I've noticed it actually doesn't make much of a difference, and in many cases makes it much easier, to just do max input.  It's a bit overwhelming at first, but all the same rules apply, just with a much smaller range of error...  But often times I can make it work with very few sensors and a few well placed conveyor belts...  Definitely much easier when you're thinking about the whole thing moving and going at the same time...\n\nAlso it's quite deceptive... You'll get most of the way through a problem, switch the machine on, and realize that every 7th manufactured part causes the whole assembly line to back up because one block moved into the right place at the wrong time....\n\nSo... be ready for ragequit.","March 6, 2015","true","14.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Because of this core theological stasis that relies in this game. There are so many ways to do the most minute of processes, and sometimes, you can get crazy overboard an make crazy factories. But its even more extreme when the thing you took the whole room the game gave you, you see someone else do it in 2/10ths the space. But then you go back to your giant factory and see it working, and remember you made it. And this repeating satisfaction factor makes you never lose fuel on this game. Its fun until the end.

(from looking at current reviews, looks like it's mandatory to point that out).\n\nTL;DR - If the idea of the game interests you (and/or you're a SpaceChem fan), you're going to love this thing to death.\n\nAlthough the game is (as of this writing) Early Access, it's not EA in the usual sense. Zachotronics has mentioned that this is actually what they would normally have released as a first full version, but they decided to go the Early Access route so that they can take player feedback to fix any critical issues that crop up post-release. A prime example is the game not having view inversion support for the mouse on launch but being added just hours later.\n\nThe production ready quality really comes across in the game. Except for the button to record your solution (as you could in SpaceChem) being disabled and marked as "Soon", the game does not come across as a work in progress at all. Everything works fluidly and smoothly, and looks great (or as great as something in this visual style CAN look, at any rate). No blocky minecraft textures here. It's simplistic, but somehow exactly what a game of this nature needs.\n\nThere are a couple of minor issues with the controls currently. You can't scroll through the hotbar with the mouse wheel, and the number of slots is not big enough, but these are apt to be coming in a very near update.\n[EDIT: The day after release, an update was pushed that makes the hotbar bigger, although you still can't scroll through it with the mouse wheel (yet)]\n\nGameplay wise, the game is (as mentioned) similar to SpaceChem, with the exception that instead of programming a reactor with constantly moving Waldoes, the inputs come out at set intervals and you must use a connected sequence of things like conveyor belts, welders, sensors and so on to shuffle things around and attach them as appropriate. The different elements are introduced slowly before being combined to help you come to grips with how to use everything. I would say that in this regard the pacing is spot on.\n\nThere is a built in level editor, although there is no access to it until you finish the main campaign. Steam workshop support allows you to share your levels with others, which is a great thing for the longevity of the game. Only a day after the initial release, new levels are already showing up in the workshop.\n\nThe back story of the game is handled well, and the setup for the story as a whole (being abducted by aliens so that you can build factories for them) is used as the setup to  explain the core mechanics of the game, which works very well. The initial levels start with simple puzzles to get you used to the concepts needed before starting to get dastardly. As mentioned, the pacing seems to be spot on (thus far).\n\nWith this being an EA (for now) title, there is a small survey at the end of each puzzle regarding whether it was fun to solve and how hard it was, allowing for them to tune things if needed.\n\nI leave you with this: after initial training, you get dumped into a cell and are provided with some food pellets to munch on while you ponder your next move.","January 20, 2015","true","38.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The game was a lot of fun, about the only downside was that I felt the official "campaign" felt a bit short. However, the number and more importantly, the quality of the puzzles being posted in the Steam Workshop has more than made up for this.\n\nThe following was posted Jan 26, 2015\nI'll throw my review of the early access version of Infinifactory in here as well. If you've looked at the other reviews you'll see that pretty much everyone is very positive about the game. I agree with those folks. However, a lot of people have been saying that this is SpaceChem in 3D. I played a lot of SpaceChem and I have to say that Infinifactory is really a lot better than a 3D version of SpaceChem.\n\nPrimarily, the reason Infinifactory is better is because SpaceChem was always rather space limited in it's format. There was only a set amount of 2D space to work in and once you got past the early SpaceChem puzzles I would be conscious that I was having to compromise my creativity to keep my designs in that rather small space. While there are limitations in the 3D space available on some Infinifactory puzzles, I've felt that I'm really being able to be creative (and perhaps a little sloppy in my designs) without that constricted feeling I would get in SpaceChem. Certainly, you can tweak and tune a solution in Infinifactory to get it as near perfect in Cycles and Footprint, but it's not required. And that makes it fun.\n\nAnother reason Infinifactory is very good is how the 3D environment is structured. Except for a few folks in North Korea, pretty much everyone has at least tinkered a bit with Minecraft. Infinifactory uses the same presentation so you can start solving puzzles right away without having to understand how all those nodes worked like you did in SpaceChem. Blocks stack together, right click removes, left click adds, it's all very straightforward. Most folks will be able to grasp the concepts pretty quickly.\n\nThe final reason Infinifactory is so good is another fallout of the 3D environment, specifically that your avatar is actually inside of the game. Want to know why your conveyor belt doesn't seem to be doing what you want? Walk or fly over to it and look. Want to be sure that there's clearance when your swinging around a large assembly through a gap? Move your viewpoint into position and fire up the process, then observe. You can start and pause at will, so you can actually look at what's going on at any point at any time during the process. It's amazing helpful when you're trying to troubleshoot.\n\nOK, there's another reason I can really recommend this game as more than just a 3D version of SpaceChem. Infinifactory is fun. There's so much satisfaction and enjoyment when you can build your own assembly line and watch it work. And, really, there is just as much satisfaction and enjoyment trying to figure something out, being stymied, scratching your... head, looking at it from all different angles, starting, pausing and restarting... then suddenly getting a true epiphany on how to make it all work. It's a great feeling.","January 21, 2015","true","47.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I've purchased a large number of lemons and found only a few gems. Of those gems only a small handful make it through to final release. It's very much a buyer beware market at the moment.\n\nThat being said Infinifactory is worth every dime. It's given me more than 20 hours and I'm not finished completely. The puzzles in this game are unrivaled by any game produced in recent memory. It feels full featured and well polished. You will struggle but almost cheer at your monitor on completion of the later levels.\n\nOther games should take note of how well they implement complex mechanics and logic.\n\nAll of that is without noting the story of this game. While it isn't my cup of tea you can see the effort put in by the developers to make a mildy amusing story arc to pair with a game whose main focus is the factory building. They give you a humorously dark narrative that I've yet to complete. The voice acting is about par for the course and not terribly noteworthy but adds a much needed bridge in this genre from the levels and plots.\n\nEverything considered this is a fantastic game and if you have any interest you would be a fool not to give it a try.","June 27, 2015","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I loved Space Chem, but struggled with a lost of the puzzles because of the space requirements to solve them in. Infinifactory takes the idea of SpaceChem and moves it into 3D space and largely removes the space constraints on solving puzzles. Each level has the player place blocks in a desired arangement into a goal area. The blocks come through from block shoots or spawners and it is the player's job to move the blocks into the goal arrangement, and then move the arrangement of blocks to the goal with the use of very basic, translate, rotate and switch blocks. This is a game you can take your time with, and solving puzzles feels very pragmatic and craft based (you get better at solving them over time). Arriving on a new level to find something new and different was always delightful.\n\nOther than the ending, I loved the subtle story, even though that isn't the game's main focus I found it very intriguing and left me wanting more.\n\nIn its current state Infinifactory feels like a complete game and I will gladly play through it again when it is complete if only to improve on my previous solutions to puzzles.\n5/5","January 27, 2015","true","25.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The part that I love about Infinifactory is that I can imagine, in my head, the parts of the output contraption coming together in a certain way, and then eventually getting all the movements timed and positioned correctly to make it happen. Or whatever gets the job done.\n\nOn the more difficult puzzles, the magnitude of what is required by the puzzle can make solving it take over an hour, easily. There is a certain threshold of patience, that if you can commit enough time and thought to that problem, you should be able to get it done after a while. Once you get the mechanics of the game down it's just a matter of that. I find that sometimes I am in that mood, and I'll solve a couple more problems, but most of the time it's hard to get motivated to solve some of those problems.\n\nThe game doesn't require you to solve every problem as you progress, however, so it's a blast as you're first going through it. I think that's a sufficient offset to the inherent difficulty of Infinifactory that I'll recommend this to the puzzlers out there. Due to the spacial nature of the game, if you like manipulating things in 3D, this is much more likely to arouse your interest. Of all the Zachtronics releases, I feel like this is probably the most accessible.","November 1, 2015","true","45.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite the Early Access tag, it feels fully fleshed out, I have not yet found a single flaw or bug and I've been enjoying Infinifactory with every new puzzle being thrown at me.\n\nYou get a few blocks as inputs, you rotate them, stamp them, weld them and do other stuff to get the required output. When you get 10 outputs, you complete the puzzle. It sounds simple, but as the later levels introduce new mechanics, blocks and other stuff, the game becomes a thousand times harder, but in a challenging way. You try your best to solve the puzzle, you fail, you modify your design, fail again, try to change things up and voila! It works! And it's extremely satisfying to see your contraption work flawlessly after you're done. I found myself looking at every single block in my factories for at least a few minutes before moving on to the next puzzle. What I absolutely love doing is just randomly picking one block and looking at where it'll end up in the finished object.\n\nFrom the start of the game to about its half, I went through each puzzle in about 15-25 minutes, so it wasn't hard. Right now I'm at the last few puzzles, and I just can't solve them! I manage to solve one a day, and even then I realise that there must be a better solution! It drives you to improve, optimize your factory and just look at the mechanisms doing their work, slowly combining little bits and pieces into one cool-looking object.\n\nThere was one time when I built the complete factory for a puzzle, then I see the very first finished 'instance' of the output making its way to the finish line, and then suddenly the game yells at me. It says that I have a hole in my object that shouldn't be there! I look at the object that arrived, I look at the needed output... and then I realise that it's true. I made such an easy way of solving the puzzle at the start, then I just had to add a few small pieces and ship it to the output point, and now I have to come to the very beginning of my solution to try and change it to fit what is required, and I have no clue how to do that. I spent approximately 15-20 minutes just trying to fix the flaw in my existing design, but it was really satisfying to see it work in the end, and have another 'puzzle completed' tick in the menu.\n\n80% of people have already stopped reading this, but I'd like to add just one more thing. Since I'm a person which absolutely loves sandbox games, unlocking the Level Editor after completing a bit more than half of the game was a "♥♥♥♥ YEAH!" moment for me. I instantly jumped in and saw that there were two options: "Simple" and "Advanced." I went for Simple first, it gave me an open hangar and a few blocks to build my puzzle with. I built something, solved it to be able to upload it to the Workshop and then uploaded it. However, there were barely any blocks from the full game that I could place down, and the space in the hangar was still limited. I wished I could build in other environments from the game and add features that you come across in certain levels but never do again. I became really sad, and I was going to find a suggestion thread for the game to ask to improve the Level Editor by adding more stuff into it. However, I completely forgot about the "Advanced" mode of the editor. After I quit my custom puzzle, I glanced at the menu, saw it and remembered that there was another mode! I hastily clicked on it and what I saw completely blew my mind! It was a genuine Level Editor, it had all the different environments from the game, EVERY single block type, EVERY feature that the game had and slightly modified and expanded puzzle options! It felt more like a genuine developer editor than a small thing for players to build their own puzzles with. There were special blocks like invisible conveyors, invisible blocks, level borders, a starting position block, the map origin and so on and so forth.  In the block menu, all the blocks are labeled with text instead of icons, that's because there are hundreds of available blocks. At first it's a bit hard to navigate, but after you get used to it, you start finding all the blocks you need in no time. Granted, this kind of editor would not suit every single player, and it's good that Zach seperated the two editors, but for players like me, which are really into game design and understand how developers actually make their game, it was really easy to get used to and I'm really glad that it's possible to create the same environments as the actual game instead of sitting in the same hangar with the same blocks and very limited options available to you.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing, if you like puzzles, buy it right now. You get your money's worth completely, if not more than what you've actually payed for. The game is interesting, it has a very good difficulty curve and is worth playing until the very end. Now, the game was developed by a single person, and seeing how great and flawless everything in the game is, it's more than a huge achievement for the developer, Zach. I'd say that puzzle-lovers should definitely buy the game even in Early Access because it's as good as the consumer version would be. It's great.","June 27, 2015","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But there's another old, free Zachtronics game that's even more like Infinifactory. It's called Manufactoid, and if you don't mind some ugly graphics and (very, very light) programming, then you should absolutely check it out if you're on the fence about Infinifactory.\n\nThe goal in Infinifactory (and Manufactoid, and SpaceChem for that matter) is to build specific objects from the inputs you're given. You have conveyor belts and rotators to move blocks around, sensors and pushers to move them around in a smarter way, welders to fuse blocks into the larger objects that you're tasked with building, and some other kinds blocks that I won't spoil.\n\nIn Manufactoid (seriously, go Google it if you like this sort of thing! I'll wait...) you had to write tiny little "programs" to run your factory. For example, you might have to write some code that said (translated to English), "anytime sensor 5 is activated, also activate pushers 3,4, and 7". In principle you could write much more complicated programs (the language is Lua), but in practice this is what it ended up being. Infinifactory takes out the programming completely, but the third dimension makes up for it by giving us much more flexibility to hook up our sensors, pushers, and so on without them interfering with one other.\n\nAs others have said, this isn't your typical half-baked Early Access title. These guys are doing it right. The graphics are appealing, performance is good, controls are tight, and there are 30 well-designed puzzles already. Anyone who has played SpaceChem knows that 30 puzzles (okay, maybe 20 since the first few are necessarily easy) can last you a long time. And there'll no doubt be a lot more coming along soon.\n\nJust buy it. You'll get your money's worth, and Zach deserves to get rich.","January 21, 2015","true","104.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Essentially, you have a Minecraft-style building interface, except instead of using blocks of raw materials the blocks represent machinery, and the goal is to build a factory to transform inputs you're provided with into specified outputs.\n\nWhile the building interface can be a bit fiddly from time to time, the puzzling is fascinating and addictive. The only concern I have is that some of the later puzzles can be HARD - it may take an hour just to build them, let alone solve them. At that point I was sometimes left wondering why, if you would want to play a programming-style game this hard, you wouldn't just actually program - especially since there are games online based on real programming which don't leave you cursing that there isn't room to build the function you need!

Its a sweet premise: Design the factory that machines the goods, and does them perfect again and again. You get a real sense of process and possibility, coming up with an A.) succesful and B.) efficient conveyer belt and fusing and manipulating path to achieve this. I wish more games could offer an emotive, plot-logical place of real, creative problem solving. It seems alien invaders like Vogons have kidnapped you and many others. You are crowd-sourced for the automated, efficient assembly of machinery, perhaps for the invasion of your own planet. It bares some similarities to this project, harnessing the human brain for a problem computers can't figure out: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/09/19/pc-gamers-save-the-world-a-bit/\n\nYou encounter the remains and optionally the audiologs of the failed characters left behind on most jobs. Once the cat is out of the bag they seem mostly to only be able to add texture to the story, but its a great story anyway.\n\nPlaying it, I use parts of my brain that are hard to tap. The puzzle game genre doesn't otherwise offer this kind of thorough, creative satisfaction. When learnt your creations can really come alive, consuming and outputting. Its like a language, like you've absorbed some spirit of programming by stealth. I think the design is splendid on all the levels, and when I think of the choices made to make such complexity intuitive and inviting it seems genius. Its so unlike the many degrading, addictive games that tempt us to distraction and numbness. I don't regret time spent with Infinifactory, and Its not like having my head buried in the sand, rather I come away feeling somehow better equipped to deal with life's problems.\n\nThis opens the door of gaming for so much more, and at the same time as this innovation its definitely a game in the mechanical sense of a voluntary ruleset, manifestly challenging, that you struggle to perform better in, like a living parable. Unlike some missed opportunities nowadays which seem to dismiss this element as beneath them, or just not them (unworried by the essential concept of false advertising). Its something of a masterclass in that regard.\n\nI imagine it could be an amazing layer or part of the loop in something larger. Civ or Eve or Besieged or Kerbal Space Program or PlanetSide 2 or even Minecraft. Though I know its rude to state such things, crafting everywhere else seems really lacklustre, pithy and abstract now. This would have to be late game, jetpack-fuelled crafting in most settings, but my god! But then I think this with some action stage would EAT MY LIFE. As it stands, and if what you've gathered appeals, its a great investment. Well executed product too, for instance making resolution and graphics adjustments is so immediate and smooth and uncrashy it puts many big releases to shame.\n\nSee youtube for various super-efficient solutions to aspire to.","November 23, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's no right answer, just whatever produces the desired product without causing a broken pileup along the way. You are then given a numeric breakdown of your carbon footprint, blocks used, and cycles (length) taken, on a bar graph showing average global player scores for that level. I think that's also brilliant, because you aren't competing for any specific "S Rank" conditions (although there are some achievements to that effect), you're just shown how you stack up to the player average and left to decide for yourself if you want to try to go back and optimize things just that little bit more...\n\nLevels often look daunting at first glance, but as prodded at will usually unravel gradually as you work out where to put piece buffers, delay gates, and so on. Failing that, you can always go look at some other player builds, which in recreating you will come to understand the fundamental components thereof. Even by cheating you're learning to play the game better.\n\nThere's also a more sandboxy set of levels available, and a built-in GIF recorder for showing off your solutions. Fantastic puzzle game that basically does everything right.","December 24, 2015","true","29.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, a big different between them is the extra dimension: it gives more freedom for arranging your factory, but also open up many possibility of verious kind of chellange. And like Spacechem, it also have "Test zone", kinda like Sandbox in Spacechem, where you can build whatever you cant as long as it can fit in :)\n\nOverall, I recommand this game. If you enjoy Spacechem, other Zachtronic's game or somthing similar, you will also love this game.\n\n","May 29","true","56.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, the openness and creativity given to the player is incredible.  The game is challenging.\nThere is nothing to brag about on a technical level.  The graphics are sufficient, though capped at 60fps.  The music is very dull, unoriginal, and boring.  Even the game's aesthetic is tedious and boring; it looks like it was designed by an engineer.  The system of letting you save and compare 3 solutions on each puzzle is wonderful.\n\nThis is certainly a fun game if you really enjoy building systems.  If you are the sort of person that enjoys building a daftly-intricate redstone line in Minecraft you will be right at home.  You will get a brain workout.  I felt like an engineering genius after solving the first 3 puzzles; then things started getting much much worse for me.  I can't for the life of me figure out how to delay one conveyer belt by one turn when needed.

This is the best puzzle game I have every played!\n\nLike many have said, this is, in a lot of ways Spachecm in 3D.  However there are some fundamental differences.\n\nI am NOT a Spacechem Mozart.  Some of you guys make me feel like a complete idiot.  I'm the player that is simply happy to find a working solution, optimization (largely) be damned.  And in this game I feel the spatial freedom is the ultimate thing that makes finding any solution that much less challenging than in Spacechem (not that it is not challenging!).  I am sure many of my solutions so far use 3-10 times as many blocks as are necessary for the perfect solution.  But I don't care!  After laying down a few hundred blocks, correcting my logic and paths hundreds of times, and wanting to throw my laptop out the window, it is just as rewarding as when I managed ANY solution later in Spacechem.\n\nSo that being said, I can't speak for the depth of the challenge here being satisfactory for the Spacechem geniuses out there.  This game is much more accessible and beautiful, and I have already gotten much further than when I basically decided to give up on Spacechem.  If you gave up on Spacechem, and was disappointed in yourself for doing so like I was, you should ABSOLUTELY play this game.  If you are a Spacechem Mozart, you will have to rely on other reviews.  But then, you've probably already beaten this game......\n\nTwo things must absolutely be done though to make this game perfect.  Although, even without them, I still give this game 10/10.\n\n1.

Then the next level involves almost the exact same thing but turns out to require a totally different solution and you have to go back to the drawing board and start building a new thingamajigger. And after you finish it and fix all the "bugs", your magical spinning pushing pulsing factory of doom starts purring. It's mesmerising to watch.\n\nIt's not (yet) as hard as SpaceChem, I suspect because there's a lot more open space to work in, or perhaps because some of the "tricks" for optimizing in SpaceChem work fairly well here too. (or I got smarter :D?) That said there's plenty of new ideas here - you can tell it's related, but it's also a whole new bag of tricks, surrounded by the great infrastructure of histograms and "hacks".\n\nI recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles or making stuff or tinkering about, though I warn you, you might start dreaming of conveyor belts and wondering why your food doesn't slide out the fridge and cook itself when you open the fridge door.","May 21, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the best puzzle game I have every played!\n\nLike many have said, this is, in a lot of ways Spachecm in 3D.  However there are some fundamental differences.\n\nI am NOT a Spacechem Mozart.  Some of you guys make me feel like a complete idiot.  I'm the player that is simply happy to find a working solution, optimization (largely) be damned.  And in this game I feel the spatial freedom is the ultimate thing that makes finding any solution that much less challenging than in Spacechem (not that it is not challenging!).  I am sure many of my solutions so far use 3-10 times as many blocks as are necessary for the perfect solution.  But I don't care!  After laying down a few hundred blocks, correcting my logic and paths hundreds of times, and wanting to throw my laptop out the window, it is just as rewarding as when I managed ANY solution later in Spacechem.\n\nSo that being said, I can't speak for the depth of the challenge here being satisfactory for the Spacechem geniuses out there.  This game is much more accessible and beautiful, and I have already gotten much further than when I basically decided to give up on Spacechem.  If you gave up on Spacechem, and was disappointed in yourself for doing so like I was, you should ABSOLUTELY play this game.  If you are a Spacechem Mozart, you will have to rely on other reviews.  But then, you've probably already beaten this game......\n\nTwo things must absolutely be done though to make this game perfect.  Although, even without them, I still give this game 10/10.\n\n1.

Takes the best aspects of Spacechem and solves its failings (e.g. the spacechem's ridiculous difficulty curve). It's, for all intents and purposes, a fully formed release quality game.\n\nWhat makes it so brilliant is that the pacing means you're solving simple puzzles (e.g. how do I queue up blocks?) and then you realise you can reuse your solutions to those puzzles in later, more complex puzzles as part of a more complex machine. The feeling of having your machine pump out the perfect item with no waste is just amazing, and having the graph of how you did compared to other people really makes you want to go back and try it again.","February 9, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Constantly challenging, the curve in this game is very solid. Whenever a new block is introduced it gives you a rather simple puzzle in order to learn how it works, and then in the next level you want to scream at the game because that new block is making this already puzzling game even more puzzling.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing puzzle game. Open-ended solutions allow you to brag to your friends that your solutions are faster then theirs'.\n- Fitting and varied graphics. Every major "section" has a different planet design, and they always look great. Amazing skybox/background images and looming ships watching you really fits with the 'story.'\n- Story. Speaking of the story, there is one. I haven't finished the game so I don't know what kind of ending there is (or if there is one) but various elements in the levels (which are totally optional as to whether you investigate them or not) reveal how you got to where you are.\n- Almost a full fledged game already. Even though this game is in Early Access, it is basically a full game. Even if it was released this moment, I would not regret buying it.\n\nCons:\n- No graphical settings. This will hopefully change since the game is still only in Early Access, but this is big for me since my computer isn't that amazing, and the game feels sluggish for me because of the various effects that are rendered (completely playable, I just feel like I'm snail in neck brace).\n- Some of the puzzles can be a good bit more difficult than others in that same section, but since you don't have to complete every single level to progress to the next section (in the first few sections you can do all but one to progress) and since the Early Access features a mandatory feedback system on how difficult and fun the puzzle was, I am sure any overly difficult levels will be reworked as the game improves.\n\nOverall, this is a gem. Who knew building factories on alien planets could be so fun, even if it makes your brain melt.\n\nMy score for Infinifactory as a Factory building and Puzzle solving game - 9/10\n\nOh, and I can't leave out the best part...\n\nMy score for Infinifactory as a Food Pellet eating and Memorabilia collecting simulator - 11/10","January 21, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll find often that half the challenge is working around the limitation of the tools provided to you; but it's satisfying to see a complex process finally come together. It has a surprisingly good plot/story as well, where aliens abduct humans to be forced intellectual labour.\n\nIf you liked Spacechem and/or have a head for puzzles, this is worth a buy even in Early Access state (which will only get better) - I haven't come across a single bug or glitch yet.\n\nUnless you count smashing your head against a desk in frustration when you cannot figure out a puzzle to be a bug!\n","January 23, 2015","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really is an amazing game.\n\nInfinifactory is the successor to Spacechem, but this time in a first-person 3D environment.  Although I don't see Inifinifactory matching Spacechem's elegant simplicity, it is a very interesting game on its own.  The addition of a 3D environment both enhances and detracts from the puzzles.  On the plus side, 3 dimensions to work with mean you can create some very intriguing solutions.  On the minus side, navigation in the 3D world can be a headache sometimes.\n\nWhile there was a storyline in Spacechem,  it almost felt secondary to the game, and you could easily ignore it if you chose (although it was interesting to read).  Infinifactory's storyline seems to be more integral to the game.\n\nInfinifactory has a dark sense of humor, which I enjoy.\n\nIt is also still a work-in-progress, with many changes and enhancements having been added since I first purchased this on Early Access.  However, even in its early-access state, it does not disappoint.  The puzzles have been fun and challenging (some more or less than others), and the game has a lot of potential that, as the updates show, is being actively realized.\n\nI will say that since Spacechem was so fantastic, purchasing Infinifactory was a no-brainer.","March 18, 2015","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy if you like puzzles or making things that make things!\n\nThis game is a lot of fun. It's a series of block-building puzzles, in 3D, where you're building an assembly line to produce a specific end product. It starts you off slow with 'move these objects to the recepticle', then 'fuse these objects and move them' and before you know it, you've got an assembly line stripping the broken bits off of a tank and fusing on replacements.\n\nThe game shows a lot of promise. Many of the existing puzzles are still being improved, and some of the story elements seem to suggest that this is only the beginning of the campaign. (There are also a number of concept puzzles mixed in with the others that give me high hopes for what's coming down the road.) For now, other players are already designing new challenges and putting them in the Steam Workshop, so it should be a while before you run out of new puzzles to play.\n\nThe developer is open and responsive to criticism, and has a dedicated subreddit for discussing feature improvements. Every level ends with a short 3-question survey soliciting feedback. If you do buy the game, please help them make the game better by giving them feedback!\n\nThere are a few shortcomings (e.g., no copy/paste, no crouch key, and the labelling on some of the blocks is a bit hard to make out) but they're all minor nitpicks, and haven't kept me from finishing all the puzzles. These are all things that have been brought up with the developer, and I expect at the very least copy/paste will be addressed at some point. As alluded to earlier, the story is unfinished (though a rough sketch of at least the first half of gameplay is readily apparent!) and the puzzles don't go vertical in the difficulty department (unlike some of the later Spacechem levels). It's my guess that they have, at most, about half of the puzzles they intend to add to the base game. (And there are still at least two block types that haven't been revealed.)\n\nI heartily recommend this game if you like puzzles, or ever wished you could get something a bit more sophisticated out of Minecraft in the contraption-construction department. If you love programming, there's also a good chance you'll love this game. (I've seen way too many other programmers I follow on Twitter raving about it.) And lastly, this game is a must-buy for people who loved any of Zachtronics' previous puzzle games--but then, you've already bought it, haven't you?","January 24, 2015","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked the idea of SpaceChem but didn't play it much in the end as aspects of it seemed unintuitive to me. (I meant to go back to it, and figured I just needed to learn how to play it, but never did.) Not so here. Everything is clear from the start and I was instantly hooked.\n\nThis is one of those puzzle games that gets inside your head and makes you start interpreting other things you look at as if they were in the game. Like how Tetris makes people dream about blocks, or instinctively work out how to slot everything they see in the real world together, just in case, because part of your brain has started doing that automatically.\n\nI am not usually a fan of Early Access but it's fine in this case. I can see there are some slight UI improvements that might be added to the final version (already being discussed by the devs) but that's about all you might gain by waiting. I usually dislike EA because I only want to play most games once, so I'd rather play them in their best form, but with this game you're solving puzzles which are so open-ended and free-form that you can solve them again another day in a completely new way, using new techniques you've learned and pieces you've unlocked, and still have a blast. And the game is already in a very good state. So this is a rare case where I can recommend an Early Access game.\n\nInfinifactory doesn't suffer from the problem of some "build a thing to solve a puzzle" games where the solution is either so simple or so restricted that you are not really having to think, only to work out what the designer wanted you to put where (except one or two levels which are obviously tutorials on new pieces, which are understandable a bit like that, but even then encourage experimenting). It's very open and you're generally given a large 3D canvas in which to invent methods of solving things. You can go for elegance, simplicity, or audacious complexity. Whatever you choose often turns out a lot more complex than you thought, which is part of the fun.\n\nPrice wise, it seemed a bit high at first for what I thought might be a simple puzzle game. Having played it and become hooked, and seen the depth and replayability it has this has, the price is well worth it. I have spent literally hours on some puzzles, and even once they are finished the desire to improve the solution or just experiment remains. You will more than get your money's worth with this game.\n\nCongratulations to the devs, you knocked it out of the park and created a classic. In a world where "puzzle game" has started to mean "match three in a generic grid of gems", a game like Infinifactory is refreshing and inspiring.","January 28, 2015","true","230.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though there's not that many maps in the game, I've managed to spend 18 hours before I completed the game. For the small amount of money you pay, that is a lot of game for buck ratio.\n\nAnd if you get stuck or can't solve a puzzle, hundreds of people on youtube have a solution ready, and you will certainly learn something from their build style as well.\n\nThe only down side I can think of is that falling blocks move in the same speed as a block on a belt. This creates some irritating desyncs in the factories you create.\n\nThe game can also be played how you want. Make the most efficient and smallest amount of cycles as possible, or make the fastest factory with less material. After each map completed, two graphs are shown with how you compete against other peoples' solution.\n\nThe developers of this game is also the developer of Infiniminer, one of the games that inspired Notch to create Minecraft.\n\nApart from being an addictive and satisfiying game, the game engine is Unity. Ever since Kerbal Space Program released, I've never really had good performance in Unity with my computer. I'm not going to blame the developers, but I wish they could fix the small fps drop everytime I stop the preview of the factory.","January 29, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really is an amazing game.\n\nInfinifactory is the successor to Spacechem, but this time in a first-person 3D environment.  Although I don't see Inifinifactory matching Spacechem's elegant simplicity, it is a very interesting game on its own.  The addition of a 3D environment both enhances and detracts from the puzzles.  On the plus side, 3 dimensions to work with mean you can create some very intriguing solutions.  On the minus side, navigation in the 3D world can be a headache sometimes.\n\nWhile there was a storyline in Spacechem,  it almost felt secondary to the game, and you could easily ignore it if you chose (although it was interesting to read).  Infinifactory's storyline seems to be more integral to the game.\n\nInfinifactory has a dark sense of humor, which I enjoy.\n\nIt is also still a work-in-progress, with many changes and enhancements having been added since I first purchased this on Early Access.  However, even in its early-access state, it does not disappoint.  The puzzles have been fun and challenging (some more or less than others), and the game has a lot of potential that, as the updates show, is being actively realized.\n\nI will say that since Spacechem was so fantastic, purchasing Infinifactory was a no-brainer.","March 18, 2015","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game developer deserves to be REWARDED for his effort and development style. Game developers that stay in  Early Access until they are truly satisfied with the game, who listen to the gamers, who make changes, add and improve constantly -- these people are rare. And so I write.\n\nIf you have a very inquisitive mind, the type that likes to solve puzzles, then this game is for you. If you are the type of person that plans intricate redstone+piston systems in minecraft, this game is for you. If you are the type of person fascinated by machines, cogs and how things work, this game is for you. This game truly caters to the "Inventor" in all of us.\n\nThis game took to me so hard I lost myself during the entire play duration. It is very beautiful and clean. Complex, and yet, straightforward. What makes this game so great is that it can be incredibly complex, but the rules are quite simple.\n\nWhile at the time of writing the game is in Early Access, this does not lessen effect the review (if not strengthening it), the game has far passed the point where it could be called done.\n\n10/10 All the way.\n\nThank you Zach for a wonderful game!","March 19, 2015","true","28.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel that this game is either slightly easier, or more engaging (probably this) than Spacechem. Something about being able to walk around your factories, watching how stuff gets transported, rotated, and welded makes it very engaging.\n\nThe campaign is surprisingly long and varied. Lots of different tactics go into play. Whenever I thought "oh, I'll just solve this the same way I solved that other puzzle", I ran into a unique challange.\n\nThe production value seems pretty high. Every block, scene, background, cutscene, and sound has a lot of polish to it. The background story gives the game a pretty amazing feel to it. There's a lot of flavor to the game, from the cutscenes between puzzles, easter eggs that can be found on each puzzle scene, and even the products that your factories are supposed to make fit into the general lore of the game.\n\n10/10, you can't go wrong with it.","March 10, 2015","true","57.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main difference is that Infinifactory is a bit more straight forward, the puzzle solution does not need to effectively "reset" after each completed item becasue there is no waldo equivalent. This means there is less need for cicular thinking, making the game arguably easier overall. The only criticism I have is that it would be nice if there were different speeds available instead of just "fast forward." Sometimes it would be helpful to be able to bring the entire operation to a crawl to watch the action in slow motion. But then, of course, this is still in early access, so that may be comeing yet.","March 10, 2015","true","129.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So many times I've thought a level is impossible, managed to solve it anyway, and got a decent score on the leaderboards - such an amazing feeling.\n\nIt can be tough, but it wouldn't be nearly as satisfying if it wasn't. Many puzzle games repeat the same challenge with slight variations, but here, every puzzle requires a new leap of reasoning to solve. No hand-holding - beyond the basics, you have to figure-out for yourself how the blocks interact, and what mechanisms can be created. And then, with the histograms comparing your solution with everyone else's, you could potentially play this game forever, tweaking your factories and solving the same puzzles in new, better ways.\n\nProbably my favourite game this year.\n\nEDIT: Having finally completed it, it's definitely my favourite game this year.

If so, then this game is for you!\n\nInfinifactory is by far the best puzzle game I have played in years, though it can be very tricky at times. Since you are basically creating a space factory of sorts, you have to pay close attention to the timing of every individual part of your machines. Having one single element of your design slightly off in timing can throw the whole thing out of whack, and will cause you to loose levels. Fortunately, the machine only runs when you tell it to do so, and you can pause it in action for a closer look at what exactly is happening at any time.\n\nThe learning curve is decent and starts out fairly simple, but it does ramp up the difficulty quickly. Infinifactory gives you just enough hints to get started, and leaves the rest for you to figure out on your own. This is the sort of game that will force you to think spatially, and have a tendency to throw complete curveballs at what you though you knew about how to complete a level. Later in the game, when you start unlocking new components, you can return to your previous levels with the new components, and try to improve your score using them and any new techniques you have figured out.\n\nAs an added bonus, the music is very well done. It is very relaxing, but not to the point that it will put you to sleep.\n\nOverall, If you love challenging puzzle games, then I absolutely recommend picking up Infinifactory. It is very challenging, but also very rewarding, and should keep you busy for quite some time.","June 19, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Starting off with simple puzzles and working up to more complex ones, the learning curve is gradual, and it soon gets complicated.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack are splendid.

There isn't really that much of a story here per se, but the puzzles are challenging (after a gradual ramp-up, then a steep jump after you've gotten the basics), and the concepts in the game are unique.  I really enjoy playing, and I would recommend everyone at least try this out.  I'm sure it will only get better before it leaves Early Access status and is released Gold, but frankly, the core mechanics are solid in this game.\nI have found that some puzzles were rather challenging later in the game, but I prefer my puzzle games to challenge me to think creatively instead of being a snore fest.  I really liked the Portal series as well, but those puzzles were WAY too easy and linear.  This game requires you to think ahead, and can be especially challenging if you are trying to find an optimal solution in terms of cycle count and foot print.\nThere were quite a few that I completed thinking "Wow, I think I have this just about perfect" only to find that many people found MUCH better solutions! It makes me feel like I have much to learn, and at the same time enjoy the learning experience.\n10/10, would buy again.","February 20, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

A simple but wonderfully effecive way to cut down on the keyboard punching.\nThe game permits you to find your own effective designs and favoured ways of going about taks as more components are unlocked and you will feel like a mechanical genius each time you find a new way to use them.\n\nIn short the game combines the free form building of mine crafts sandbox mode with challenging and intriguing puzzles of portal and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a building or puzzle game.","February 22, 2015","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's just a testament to how well designed the game and puzzles are, that you can spend more than an hour on a single puzzle (the hardest ones), without feeling frustrated.\n\nGiven, it's still a very hardcore puzzle game, which is really not for everyone.\nBut if you're a fan of hard puzzles, like thinking, and want something to challenge your mind, you definitely wanna buy Infinifactory.

If so, then this game is for you!\n\nInfinifactory is by far the best puzzle game I have played in years, though it can be very tricky at times. Since you are basically creating a space factory of sorts, you have to pay close attention to the timing of every individual part of your machines. Having one single element of your design slightly off in timing can throw the whole thing out of whack, and will cause you to loose levels. Fortunately, the machine only runs when you tell it to do so, and you can pause it in action for a closer look at what exactly is happening at any time.\n\nThe learning curve is decent and starts out fairly simple, but it does ramp up the difficulty quickly. Infinifactory gives you just enough hints to get started, and leaves the rest for you to figure out on your own. This is the sort of game that will force you to think spatially, and have a tendency to throw complete curveballs at what you though you knew about how to complete a level. Later in the game, when you start unlocking new components, you can return to your previous levels with the new components, and try to improve your score using them and any new techniques you have figured out.\n\nAs an added bonus, the music is very well done. It is very relaxing, but not to the point that it will put you to sleep.\n\nOverall, If you love challenging puzzle games, then I absolutely recommend picking up Infinifactory. It is very challenging, but also very rewarding, and should keep you busy for quite some time.","June 19, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Infinifactory is a well-made, fun, and challenging puzzler.\n\nThe real challenge comes not from solving the puzzles once through (though that can also be difficult), no, but from beating your orginal score (measured in the number of blocks you use and the speed of your completed contraption).\n\nThe game is well tutorialized, but it does not hold your hand. Starting off with simple puzzles and working up to more complex ones, the learning curve is gradual, and it soon gets complicated.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack are splendid. Not mind-blowing, but who needs that anyway. They work for the game and the genre, and make solving the puzzles relaxing.\n\nThe narritive elements are like icing. It adds something but is not the real substance of the game.\n\nAnyway, this is a really good puzzler and I enjoy it alot. hightly reccomend.","June 18, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is in a way like Minecraft.

I'd just refund it if it was bad, right? Well after two days i already had 32 (out of 48) hours of gameplay (when i ate dinner i left it on so it might "only" have been 30 hours)! That leaves 18 hours. Minus 14 for sleeping (7 hours a night) and we have 4 hours for 6 meals. You could say i had a blast playing this game...\n\n+ Superb game idea\n+ Unbelievably satisfying to solve a puzzle and watch your factory working so perfectly (seriously this is a huge plus. every gamer will get a boner from watching this)\n+ Creating your own level is so abnormaly easy that it takes you about 3 minutes to create a level you can then solve yourself (and share in the steam workshop)\n+ the story makes it even more fun (not that the story would be good but it gives you a "reason" to build the factories and makes everything funnier)\n+ Everything else\n\nthe only negative thing:\n- there are no upward welders (and generally the welding of large objects) (you'll understand when you've progressed a bit into the game).

Just skip the rest of this review and buy Infinifactory now, you can thank me later.\n\nEverybody else: this is a game for programmers, engineers, puzzle addicts, and generally anybody who enjoys using logic to solve, or create, problems. Kidnapped by a Vogon-like race of aliens, you will be forced to create machines that automatically assemble (and sometimes disassemble) an increasingly complex variety of objects. Your tools are a collection of cube-shaped building blocks - conveyors, welders, pistons, sensors, etc. - of which you have an infinite supply. There are no time limits or resource limits, just a set of inputs and a target output. The feeling of satisfaction you get when one of your creations finally works the way it's supposed to is only matched by the feeling you get when you suddenly realize how to get it working even better; shaving a few cycles off your assembly time or eliminating a handful of extraneous blocks. And if, sorry, *when* you get frustrated, there's something oddly rewarding about deliberately monkey-wrenching the works and watching the garbage output pile up to the sky. In the end, you're free to settle for hackish stupid-but-it-works solutions, or to go full ASME and devise mechanical logic gates and suchlike to produce fine-tuned precision assembly lines - each level has three "slots" for you to work in, so you're free to copy over designs or work on alternative solutions without throwing away work you've already done. There's even a Steam achievement for creating exceptionally inefficient solutions, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, is mostly there for seasoning and is at first just dribbled out in the various atmospheric touches like your spartan quarters (containing only a bed, a food pellet dispenser, and a bathroom-like facility clearly designed by somebody who didn't know much about human anatomy, and didn't care to learn more) and the aliens' curious and misguided attempts to provide motivational rewards. Details start to emerge as you progress, mostly in recorded "failure logs" hidden throughout the levels, and finally things start to be spelled out in considerably more detail, after a plot twist which I guess I shouldn't give away here. There's humor, tragedy, and intrigue, all of which is really just a bonus as far as I'm concerned - like any good puzzle game, the puzzles themselves provide all the motivation needed to want to press on, and I found the difficulty curve to be just about perfect.\n\nThere's a few glitches in the version I'm currently playing - occasionally you'll fall through what appears to be solid ground, for example - but fortunately your character is equipped with a jetpack so this is merely an annoyance, and not really game-affecting. The graphics are simple and clean, and this should run fairly well even on low-end or outdated PCs. I should also mention the ability to automatically record looping GIFs of your creations, which is a nice touch.\n\nThis is definitely not for people who prefer their games to mostly consist of problems that are solved by shooting at them, but if the concept behind Infinifactory appeals to you at all, I can all but guarantee you're going to have a lot of fun here.","July 17, 2015","true","94.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed coming up with and improving upon my solutions. The controls for placing blocks are a bit clunky. It feels like there is a lot of possiblility for making cool logic circuits from conduits, but the levels never really seem to need logic gates and building logic with conduits is way clunkier than it should be which reduces the fun. Independent wires cannot be adjacent or they merge and there are no built in gates like AND, OR, NOT, which makes anything of even minimal complexity take way too much space and effort to bother with.","June 3, 2015","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's rock solid stable, looks good and has lots of content as well as an interesting storyline. If you liked SpaceChem then you'll love Infinifactory.\n\nAs others have said It's basically SpaceChem in 3D, concepts of reactors and piping are more or less combined, with conveyers taking the place of the latter, and the entire level being the reactor. The same concept of optimising cycles (time), number of components used and now overall footprint of components is present.\n\nFinding a solution, and then tweaking to optimise is a dream come true for us OCD types out there! The game will rank your solution for a given challenge against the population playing the game, so that you can see where you score. It's difficult, and sometimes impossible to rank highly in each area. Decreasing cycle time will increase block count for example. Improving one of the three scores will usually come at the cost of one or both of the others.\n\nZachtronics stands out for me as a real leader in modern puzzle games. Great challenge, lots of replayability, user created content and a sandbox mode!

For more details, please see my Spacechem review.\n\nI still think Spacechem is the best puzzle game ever made. I haven't played enough of this to decide if this ursurps the puzzle game throne, but it looks like a good possibility so far.\n\nThese games are hard to describe and intimidating to watch without having played (especially Spacechem since its just a bunch of weird lines and symbols). The best way I can think to describe it is, think of programming a loop or a method. You know what the inputs and outputs need to be and you know a few other functions/methods that you can use to take the inputs and make the outputs. These games are all about designing a repeatable process that won't fail under a heavy load.\n\nBesides the 3D, one of the main differentiators Infinifactory has is a humorous storyline that follows the "Show, don't tell" school of writing. I remember Spacechem being pretty wordy and not funny, but Infinifactory is the opposite!\n\nBuy Infinifactory.\n\n...or Spacechem.\n\nUPDATE: Holy ♥♥♥♥ the difficulty escalates pretty quickly.","June 30, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Infinifactory is WAY more fun than SpaceChem. I'm not sure whether to attribute that to its satisfying 3D Minecraftesque environment, or the story with all its food nuggets, VHS tapes, and trucker hats, or the wide variety of blocks that such an environment allows. Really, it's all of the above and more. Here is a game in which the developers applied all that experience and feedback from SpaceChem and applied it in a way that manages to be equal parts difficult, frustrating (in a good way), fun, funny, and oh-so-deeply satisfying.\n\nWithout ruining everything, I'll say I came to what I thought was the final "mission" of the game and found it an appropriately complex and large build that took a good amount of thought and planning. As I watched the last completed unit pass into what we'll call the recepticle, I thought "this was money well spent, and I'm going to go through and optimize all my earlier builds. Moreover, this was so good that I'm going to go write my first Steam review to send thanks to the devs and recommendations to other logic gamers." That was my thought at that point in the game, and then I found out there's more. More compelling, more complex, and I figured I'd stop here, write that review, and only then get back to the next build.\n\nI've already spent a lot of extra time rebuilding machines that passed but didn't satisfy me, satisfy in the sense that maybe they wasted blocks that could have been put to better use, or managed to build the prescribed number of objects but would have broken had it been asked to cycle endlessly (just one there) without any bugs. Feels good to come away with instant feedback that tells you that you've built something as efficiently as anyone else has been able. Many won't want to strive for that type of perfection, and the truth is that I won't for all the puzzles, but the point is that they've produced an environment and the tools that make you enjoy what would under normal circumstances be a chore and not a game.","July 5, 2015","true","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then the next level involves almost the exact same thing but turns out to require a totally different solution and you have to go back to the drawing board and start building a new thingamajigger. And after you finish it and fix all the "bugs", your magical spinning pushing pulsing factory of doom starts purring. It's mesmerising to watch.\n\nIt's not (yet) as hard as SpaceChem, I suspect because there's a lot more open space to work in, or perhaps because some of the "tricks" for optimizing in SpaceChem work fairly well here too. (or I got smarter :D?) That said there's plenty of new ideas here - you can tell it's related, but it's also a whole new bag of tricks, surrounded by the great infrastructure of histograms and "hacks".\n\nI recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles or making stuff or tinkering about, though I warn you, you might start dreaming of conveyor belts and wondering why your food doesn't slide out the fridge and cook itself when you open the fridge door.","May 21, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Infinifactory is a well-made, fun, and challenging puzzler.\n\nThe real challenge comes not from solving the puzzles once through (though that can also be difficult), no, but from beating your orginal score (measured in the number of blocks you use and the speed of your completed contraption).\n\nThe game is well tutorialized, but it does not hold your hand. Starting off with simple puzzles and working up to more complex ones, the learning curve is gradual, and it soon gets complicated.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack are splendid. Not mind-blowing, but who needs that anyway. They work for the game and the genre, and make solving the puzzles relaxing.\n\nThe narritive elements are like icing.

If so, then this game is for you!\n\nInfinifactory is by far the best puzzle game I have played in years, though it can be very tricky at times. Since you are basically creating a space factory of sorts, you have to pay close attention to the timing of every individual part of your machines. Having one single element of your design slightly off in timing can throw the whole thing out of whack, and will cause you to loose levels. Fortunately, the machine only runs when you tell it to do so, and you can pause it in action for a closer look at what exactly is happening at any time.\n\nThe learning curve is decent and starts out fairly simple, but it does ramp up the difficulty quickly. Infinifactory gives you just enough hints to get started, and leaves the rest for you to figure out on your own. This is the sort of game that will force you to think spatially, and have a tendency to throw complete curveballs at what you though you knew about how to complete a level. Later in the game, when you start unlocking new components, you can return to your previous levels with the new components, and try to improve your score using them and any new techniques you have figured out.\n\nAs an added bonus, the music is very well done. It is very relaxing, but not to the point that it will put you to sleep.\n\nOverall, If you love challenging puzzle games, then I absolutely recommend picking up Infinifactory. It is very challenging, but also very rewarding, and should keep you busy for quite some time.","June 19, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's rock solid stable, looks good and has lots of content as well as an interesting storyline. If you liked SpaceChem then you'll love Infinifactory.\n\nAs others have said It's basically SpaceChem in 3D, concepts of reactors and piping are more or less combined, with conveyers taking the place of the latter, and the entire level being the reactor. The same concept of optimising cycles (time), number of components used and now overall footprint of components is present.\n\nFinding a solution, and then tweaking to optimise is a dream come true for us OCD types out there! The game will rank your solution for a given challenge against the population playing the game, so that you can see where you score. It's difficult, and sometimes impossible to rank highly in each area. Decreasing cycle time will increase block count for example. Improving one of the three scores will usually come at the cost of one or both of the others.\n\nZachtronics stands out for me as a real leader in modern puzzle games. Great challenge, lots of replayability, user created content and a sandbox mode!

Infinifactory is WAY more fun than SpaceChem. I'm not sure whether to attribute that to its satisfying 3D Minecraftesque environment, or the story with all its food nuggets, VHS tapes, and trucker hats, or the wide variety of blocks that such an environment allows. Really, it's all of the above and more. Here is a game in which the developers applied all that experience and feedback from SpaceChem and applied it in a way that manages to be equal parts difficult, frustrating (in a good way), fun, funny, and oh-so-deeply satisfying.\n\nWithout ruining everything, I'll say I came to what I thought was the final "mission" of the game and found it an appropriately complex and large build that took a good amount of thought and planning. As I watched the last completed unit pass into what we'll call the recepticle, I thought "this was money well spent, and I'm going to go through and optimize all my earlier builds. Moreover, this was so good that I'm going to go write my first Steam review to send thanks to the devs and recommendations to other logic gamers." That was my thought at that point in the game, and then I found out there's more. More compelling, more complex, and I figured I'd stop here, write that review, and only then get back to the next build.\n\nI've already spent a lot of extra time rebuilding machines that passed but didn't satisfy me, satisfy in the sense that maybe they wasted blocks that could have been put to better use, or managed to build the prescribed number of objects but would have broken had it been asked to cycle endlessly (just one there) without any bugs. Feels good to come away with instant feedback that tells you that you've built something as efficiently as anyone else has been able. Many won't want to strive for that type of perfection, and the truth is that I won't for all the puzzles, but the point is that they've produced an environment and the tools that make you enjoy what would under normal circumstances be a chore and not a game.","July 5, 2015","true","40.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The easy early ones give you a chance to develop generalized techniques to apply to the later ones, as it should be in a good puzzle game. Unlike some games, the puzzles don't rely on "gotchas" that only the developer would think of (i.e., I've been able to solve all of them without spoilers so far).\n\nThe levels tend naturally to break down into clearly divided sub-puzzles, so it's easy to jump in and start making progress. But you won't get bored, as there are frequent twists that can wreck your initial plans and make you consider a reset; sometimes the pieces don't fit together as you expected. When a new mechanic is introduced, expect to spend some time figuring out the nuances. Best of all, as you solve the sub-puzzles of a given level to your liking, your sub-solutions will play and re-play in the background as you continue working on the remaining pieces, which can be oddly satisfying. The score statistic histograms add some replay value for optimization.\n\nYou can't die. Timing matters for machines but not player actions. Small mistakes are easily fixed for no penalty. The UI is nicely polished. There's a darkly comedic backstory that intrigues without getting in the way (warning, includes mentions of harm to animals). It's got very well thought out voxel editing tools (I never expected to see a usable drag and drop in 3D). It might be my ideal puzzle game, and it's making me want to try Infiniminer.","December 29, 2015","true","60.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You essentially create a machine out of blocks/parts that each do a different thing, one block might be a conveyer belt while another is a sensor that can be connected with yet another block that pushes blocks in front of it whenever the sensor activates.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are simple and very easy to understand. But to create a machine that produces the goal product can be very hard and requires both logic and intelligence. You will feel very rewarded once you finally succeed. But don't think it is over yet, you will be scored and compared to other players based on how small your machine is, how fast it can build and how many parts/blocks you used for it. You will feel an urge to go back and improve upon it if your score is not to your satisfaction.\n\nDue to the nature of the game it means that for each puzzle there's basically an endless amount of solutions. This gives you a lot of freedom which many other puzzle games lack. In fact, you can save up to 3 machines for each puzzle, this way you can experiment with your current machine without losing anything, you can even try and optimize it for production while neglecting its size and parts.\n\nI'll definitely recommend you pick this up if you enjoy puzzles and logical thinking.","December 26, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd like to say it gradually introduces things and builds you up to complex solutions, but it's a bit of a steep learning curve.  Once you realize 1 key concept though, it's all a matter of how to implement that concept for each puzzle. However, that will just get you through the puzzles. To truly complete them in the most efficient manner possible is very much an effort akin to Sisyphus. Either way, it's a great game.  The puzzles are all wrapped around a story told through audio tapes found on others that have come before you.

Do you like MineCraft (appropriate give Zachtronics' Infiniminer being its forebear)?\n\nThen you'll love Infinifactory. It's like SpaceChem, but in 3D, and yet surprisingly accessible. You'll be building crazy 3D contraptions with ease. If anything I'd say it's a fair bit easier than SpaceChem, given a larger working space and lack of meta maps where you need to string together multiple machines. And there's no boss fights.\n\nThe plot is a lot simpler here, but it's a case of a little doing a lot. Maybe even more than the creator expected, in that it leaves a lot up to you to interpret and question. It also has a few surprises up its sleeve. The progression of things you create is also a big part of this - from mundane to the militarstic.\n\nI haven't finished every puzzle yet, but whilst a few may initially look daunting, a bit of thinking usually reveals a solution. You'll also learn new techniques as you go (many you'll invent yourself), and some will also be revealed that open up new avenues of production line efficiency. I don't find myself ever really stuck. Break a big problem down into smaller parts and work on those. Then you'll realise, oh wait, you need to refactor this bit because of some reason. And when you finally figure it out, it's really rewarding.\n\nGreat soundtrack and nice, simple, effective graphics (and some quite interesting environmental design later) contribute well to the overall game.\n\nHighly recommended :)","January 4","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is in a way like Minecraft. And i mean not because it is block based but much more because its built around a genius idea and delivers this incredibly fun and immersive game experience.\n\nIt was a boring summer morning when i decided to give this game a shot. I'd just refund it if it was bad, right? Well after two days i already had 32 (out of 48) hours of gameplay (when i ate dinner i left it on so it might "only" have been 30 hours)! That leaves 18 hours. Minus 14 for sleeping (7 hours a night) and we have 4 hours for 6 meals. You could say i had a blast playing this game...\n\n+ Superb game idea\n+ Unbelievably satisfying to solve a puzzle and watch your factory working so perfectly (seriously this is a huge plus. every gamer will get a boner from watching this)\n+ Creating your own level is so abnormaly easy that it takes you about 3 minutes to create a level you can then solve yourself (and share in the steam workshop)\n+ the story makes it even more fun (not that the story would be good but it gives you a "reason" to build the factories and makes everything funnier)\n+ Everything else\n\nthe only negative thing:\n- there are no upward welders (and generally the welding of large objects) (you'll understand when you've progressed a bit into the game). The problem is that you have this genius idea in your head that you want to build and then you realize that you have to rebuild everything just because you need upward facing welders.\n\nIS THIS GAME FOR YOU?\nDid you not hate Protal / Protal 2?

Many people are calling it "SpaceChem in 3d" which is a fair description, but doesn't really capture the fun of finally guiding your blocks through twists and turns to get them synced up and in the right position at exactly the right time to have your construct output correctly.\n\nThe overarching storyline is a bit minimal, but the real fun is in solving the puzzles in new ways. There's that sense of accomplishment when you see your machine completing the task, especially when your results compare favorably with the global statistics. There are audio logs from previous solvers scattered throughout the levels which add to the world, but are not needed to enjoy the game.\n\nAs with SpaceChem, on occasion, I find some puzzles to be immediately obvious even at later levels, while others I sometimes have to think about for a while before a possible solution emerges. There are also some quirks of which control block takes precedence that you will have to work around and/or exploit to get the jobs finished.\n\nCommunity created puzzles are available in the Steam Workshop, but prepare to be challenged by them.

The building blocks you have are simple with no special tricks, yet you can build some very elegant yet complex solutions to each puzzle.\n\nEach puzzle gives you a rating comparing how you've done with everyone else who's done the puzzle too on a nice bell curve. The farther to the left on the curve you are, the better. There are three different metrics too (cycles aka time, blocks used, and footprint (how much horizontal space your blocks and the materials need to move to reach the goal). All of these metrics are only governed by what you've built, so you are free to try to improve your score, and often improving one score may come at the expense of another. However you have space for three different solutions to each puzzle so you can try multiple approaches to try to improve your best score in different areas.\n\nThe game feels like programming/engineering where you need to test your creations at each step of the way to make sure that they are behaving as you expect as well. You can adjust some input parameters like how often materials are provided to you (and at various speeds different materials may come out at different rates, changing how you need to build your solution).\n\nIf you liked Spacechem (by this same developer) you'll love this game!","January 10","true","68.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's rock solid stable, looks good and has lots of content as well as an interesting storyline. If you liked SpaceChem then you'll love Infinifactory.\n\nAs others have said It's basically SpaceChem in 3D, concepts of reactors and piping are more or less combined, with conveyers taking the place of the latter, and the entire level being the reactor. The same concept of optimising cycles (time), number of components used and now overall footprint of components is present.\n\nFinding a solution, and then tweaking to optimise is a dream come true for us OCD types out there! The game will rank your solution for a given challenge against the population playing the game, so that you can see where you score. It's difficult, and sometimes impossible to rank highly in each area. Decreasing cycle time will increase block count for example. Improving one of the three scores will usually come at the cost of one or both of the others.\n\nZachtronics stands out for me as a real leader in modern puzzle games.

For more details, please see my Spacechem review.\n\nI still think Spacechem is the best puzzle game ever made. I haven't played enough of this to decide if this ursurps the puzzle game throne, but it looks like a good possibility so far.\n\nThese games are hard to describe and intimidating to watch without having played (especially Spacechem since its just a bunch of weird lines and symbols). The best way I can think to describe it is, think of programming a loop or a method. You know what the inputs and outputs need to be and you know a few other functions/methods that you can use to take the inputs and make the outputs. These games are all about designing a repeatable process that won't fail under a heavy load.\n\nBesides the 3D, one of the main differentiators Infinifactory has is a humorous storyline that follows the "Show, don't tell" school of writing. I remember Spacechem being pretty wordy and not funny, but Infinifactory is the opposite!\n\nBuy Infinifactory.\n\n...or Spacechem.\n\nUPDATE: Holy ♥♥♥♥ the difficulty escalates pretty quickly.","June 30, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The building blocks you have are simple with no special tricks, yet you can build some very elegant yet complex solutions to each puzzle.\n\nEach puzzle gives you a rating comparing how you've done with everyone else who's done the puzzle too on a nice bell curve. The farther to the left on the curve you are, the better. There are three different metrics too (cycles aka time, blocks used, and footprint (how much horizontal space your blocks and the materials need to move to reach the goal). All of these metrics are only governed by what you've built, so you are free to try to improve your score, and often improving one score may come at the expense of another. However you have space for three different solutions to each puzzle so you can try multiple approaches to try to improve your best score in different areas.\n\nThe game feels like programming/engineering where you need to test your creations at each step of the way to make sure that they are behaving as you expect as well. You can adjust some input parameters like how often materials are provided to you (and at various speeds different materials may come out at different rates, changing how you need to build your solution).\n\nIf you liked Spacechem (by this same developer) you'll love this game!","January 10","true","68.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't force you to beat the puzzles with record breaking efficiency - so long as you complete it, that's fine. What gets to you is the knowledge that if you'd just tried a little harder, you COULD have built a better machine. So you go back, and retry, rebuild, refine. Over, and over. Your machines become much more complex, yet more simplistic as you chase the ever elusive Most Efficient Path.\n\nIt's like Tetris; you can always make it that little bit neater, just those few blocks more efficient. If you rebuild that subsection 2 blocks to the left and link those push blocks with that sensor over there, you could even aaaand it's 2am.","February 9","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, that there is not one, but endless possible solutions and it's up to you how much you want to optimize yours (once you have one working) before moving on to the next level.\nIt's addictive.

You must get blocks from point A to point B in a specific configuration. It's your job to figure out how to do that with the blocks given. Creating assembly lines that will move your pieces around and assemble them into the finished product.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, and enjoy building things, then this is a game you would likely enjoy.  Construction is reminicent of minecraft and other sandbox block building games, with a lot of trial-&-error required to get to the solutions.\n\nPros:\n-Fun, unique, and clever. Well designed game\n-Promotes thinking outside the box\n-Easy to learn, hard to put down\n-Steam Workshop, so you can pit your brain against other people's creations\n\nCons:\n-The "campaign" is a bit short and completed easily\n-Often a single solution works for most puzzles with a littlte tweaking\n-Puzzles weren't as challenging as I had hoped. Looking forward to playing with community content.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game an easy 8/10 for fun, unique, puzzle play.  If you like puzzle games and block building sandbox games, buy this. It's a great sort of fusion of the two.\n\nI hope to see further development of this game, adding more challening puzzles and other fun and silly rewards to decorate my little hole in the wall.\n\nAlso, please add additional flavours of food pellets. A diverse and delicious meal breeds productivity!","May 11","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's essencialy Space Chem meets Minecraft.\n\nI'm not too far into the game and the puzzle are starting to get tough, the though process to solve each puzzle is really rewarding, thinking  how to build the differents bits of the target piece, making a quick proto, then integrating it in the chain,  synch with the other line, weld together and BAM!  level is done! No wait I'm sure I can tune a bit to save blocks, or footprint.\nAnd all of a sudden you have the breakthrough about that previous puzzle you solved in a wonky way, you want to go back to redo it with this new elegant chunk of production line that avoids that very long winded triple rotation and pushing module you were proud of but was, admit it, massively ineficient.\n\nThe handling is A-OK, it works, does what it says on the tin but sometimes the ergonomy is not as good as it can be.\n\nThe efforts for the story telling are nice, small "easter eggs" etc.\nAs for most Zachtronics puzzle the difficulty increase quickly, so don't get scared once you finish the tutorial.\n\nI wish there was a way to capture in game video / sharing on social media, some pieces of machinery are just so satifying I wish I could show them around.","May 31","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It presents you with a simple input/output problem to solve, and gives you tools to solve it. And while the game starts you out with basic routing problems, it eventually has you creating complex production lines that require multiple actions to run harmoniously in parallel. The challenge is in how you abstract and breakdown the problem in to managable pieces, which is vastly more similar to most kinds of real-world problem solving than what is presented by most puzzle games.\n\nAnd I think that's part of the satisfaction that Infinifactory provides, is that it tests applicable problem solving -- it stretches your brain, creatively, and not just on arbitrary game logic (though, let's not kid ourselves, this is not a "realistic" game).\n\nOn top of the really excellent puzzles, Infinifactory is also coupled with an absurd but engrossing little narrative, presented (at first) through mostly environmental details. It leaves you scouring each area for audio logs for a little more insight -- and when that reaches a natural plateau, things really take off.\n\nInfinifactory is truly masterful gamedesign; a must play.","June 3","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
