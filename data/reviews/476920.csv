Just a great story about a boy that is Allison's best friend who has to save her in a parallel world and thwart the evil Ashton Thorne. The scenes are bright, beautiful and cover many locations. There is a variety of puzzles that keep oneself busy, none of them to difficult to figure out. There is a globe (map), which comes in handy for traveling between the different worlds. The hint recharges in a fair amount of time. I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good all around game.","June 4","true","3.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/476920/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser â™”","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","In this Hidden Object/casual adventure game you play as a boy, Aiden, who wants to rescue Alison and to do this, you have to solve various kinds of puzzles in multiple worlds. The puzzles range from object combining to hidden object to some simple logic puzzles.\n\nThe various locations are beautifully illustrated with limited animation on most screens, and in the hidden object parts everything is correctly labelled and can actually be found.\nThere is some voice acting, which is reasonably well done. It's not professional but doesn't distract either.\nRounding out the presentation is a relaxing music soundtrack and some effect sounds.\n\nThe major downside of this game is that it relies on 'moon logic'. On multiple occasions I had absolutely no idea what to do or where to go next, even with the assist of the in-game map. At these times I simply had to use the built-in help to proceed and even with this, it wasn't always clear exactly why something worked that way.\nMaking it worse, a few of the puzzle solutions do not make any kind of sense. Why can't I cut vines with a sword I already have in my inventory, for example, but I must use another cutting object found elsewhere?\n\nThere is quite a lot of backtracking in this game, even across the various worlds, so you'll either need to be very persistent in trying every single object everywhere, or regularly rely on the help function like I had to.\n\nThere is also some inconsistency in the story. Aiden and Alison are referred to at friends at certain points, and as siblings at other points. The story also ends rather suddenly without any epilogue or other kind of aftermath.\n\nThese gripes do not make it bad game, though. The overall experience I had was a good one, and the game does not contain any scary moments so it is also suitable for very young players.\nHowever, since it does rely on a lot of obtuse logic in places, I can /only/ recommend this to die-hard Hidden Object / Casual Adventure fans who aren't annoyed by getting stuck,","June 6","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
