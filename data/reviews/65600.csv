It is a quickly produced and shoddily written expansion that improves little to nothing about the game. This is the product that forced the developer to leave their publisher and start the Risen series, so I guess in that regard it could be seen as historical.\n\nThe script is BAD even for a Gothic / Risen game. Some of the dialogue is like a bad english puzzle. Even in its native German I can guarantee you the script was garbage because if you take away the poor grammar and apocalyptic voice acting, it's still boring and uninformative.\n\nThe map is the same as in Gothic 3 they just lock off Varant and Nordmarr. Pretty lazy. The quests are WoW type "go and get this" or "go and kill this".\n\nI loved Gothic 3 but I can't play this POS for more than 15 minutes. I've tried 3 times.","June 2, 2015","false","0.8"," 107 of 139 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","107","139","7","2"

The UI for inventory, trading, crafting, and skill development remain the easiest to use that I've seen in any RPG. Especially love how the inventory is automatically categorized. The soundtrack is pretty good too. I also like that you have a choice in combat as whether or not to kill an NPC or just vanquish him/her. Yes it has bugs, but not to the extent where I can't enjoy the experience.","July 4, 2014","true","73.3"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","44","61","3","0"

It uses all the assets of the original to do something new - in this case to continue the story after Gothic 3 ended. To me it shows all the characteristics of user made content. All, except the love for the original game.

It has everything you would see in a good rpg. The bugs can be pretty bad though, like you can skip entirely to the end of the game without completing the story line and you can do it on accident, which is what lead me to quit playing as once i did this i couldnt go back and finish the story line. I like how it is open world, full loot, and open dialouge even though the choices made doesnt affect much. Overall it is a good game and should atlest be checked out but beware, the gamebreaking bugs and flaws may turn some gamers away.

I played Gothic 2 and, though I found the game difficult, ended up enjoying it greatly. I anticipated Gothic 3 would be another open-world fantasy game with better graphics that would, like the prior game, rise above its flaws. I was mistaken in my anticipation. Unlike Gothic 2, which was greater than the sum of its parts, Gothic 3 is merely the sum of its parts, some good, many flawed.\n\nThe graphics are nice, but the animation is bizarre. The game writing and voice work is poor, resulting in real problems with immersion. The game doesn't telegraph well what you are supposed to be doing and how to interact with the world and the various items you'll pick up. These are all forgivable and leftovers from the previous game. Worst of all, however, is the combat mechanic. Gothic 2 was a little wonky in combat, but it all worked out. Gothic 3 does not work out. Combat is how you advance your character and interact with the world, and it is the most distancing and alienating part of the game.\n\nAlso, I didn't read well enough and picked up both Gothic 3 AND the Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition. That was pointless. They're both pretty much the same game, with the latter being slightly upgraded. Thank goodness for massive sales. I would otherwise have been pretty angry.\n\nIf you like open-world fantasy games and have run out of entries from Bethesda, this game might be worth trying on a major sale, but chances are you'll end up disappointed. Sure, the lack of polish is annoying, but the actual gameplay mechanics themselves are just not there, leading, ultimately, to little desire to keep playing.","January 18, 2014","false","5.8"," 35 of 62 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","35","62","2","2"

I remember playing the original Gothic 3 throughout 2007 so now when purchasing the Enhanced Edition of Forsaken Gods my main interest was to find out how well it has held the test of time. Verdict: it has. Design is something that fails first when games age, but G3:FG still looks great compared to other fantasy RPG's. The gameplay seems fun, the open world is rich in variation and places to explore, the missions are interesting, though I felt like there was too much running back and fourth between two characters to complete a mission. One place where they overdid it were the follow/ escort missions. NPC's did not run as fast as you, which caused a lot of pointless waiting and they tended to get stuck behind stones, corners, inside walls. This brings me to the most burning issue of the game: the bugs. Though the Enhanced Edition was supposed to make the game playable, there were still so freakin' many of them. Bugged missions, NPC's inside walls, weird sounds, crashes - it was all there and made the game feel unfinished and unprofessional. It could have been less painful if the procedure of saving game progress would have been fast but it was a slow and tedious process.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nI got the experience what I sought, I was not disappointed but maybe it's time to lay this old game to rest and move on.","August 18, 2014","false","23.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

That is the "Story" of gothic 3. Thats the target you see for the first 97% of the game.\n\nThe game is now playable. Patches and users fixed the massive technical problems (the "enhanced Edition" just added more of them). Although technically reviews are for the game as you buy it on steam. Be aware that you have to apply at least the community patch to get it even WORKING properly.\nTo make it clear: When G3 was released, it was a absolute catastrophy, an annoying, unplayable bug orgy.\nI played it offline a bit, I played the (somewhat) patched non steam version a bit more (in god mode, the only way back then, to deal with the buggy wolves and boars and spammy fighting system). But i'm not up to date with the latest user patches.\n\nThey (to my knowledge) didn't  fix the fundamental gameplay problem. Gothic 3 is pure EXP and Faction-Points farming, to get access to the next area, where you do the same. Quests consist entirely of kill/gathering quests with not even an attemp to wrap them in some kind of narrative.  If you're fine with this, go ahead. The world at least is nice. The relatively open gameplay of the gothic series is still there a bit.\n\nI loved Gothic 1 and 2, despite the very rough edges.\nGothic 3 has an impressive and beautiful (by then standards) world, Completely let down by the way it was filled story-wise. That's what's so sad. It could have been an amazing game.\n\nEven most MMOs have better quests and storytelling. If thats, what interests you in an RPG, gothic 3 isn't youre game. It is the worst farming/grinding-feeling i had in a SP RPG.\nSkyrim, not a storytelling masterpiece by all means, blows Gothic 3 out of the water in this area (and all others). Two Worlds 1&2 have better story telling. (DON'T buy the horribly DRM'd versions on steam though!!)\n\nBut getting Gothic 3 recommended "because i play The Witcher 3" is an affront to me and that game and ABSOLUTELY ridiculous!","May 14","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

These people saying that the game is bad,okay it might have been quite bad in terms of bugs and glitches before the enhanced edition,but one thing i CAN say is that with the enhanced edition it is probably ALOT better now and definitely worth your time. It's obviously not the best game out there,but it's quite fun to play,however unless you're one of those people that can really get the best out of a game that has a worse storyline than pac man and the graphics of a potato (not reffering to the game) , i wouldn't recommend playing this game all the time,as it might get to your head since the combat system isn't the best,and just a warning before you play the game,when you are still kind of a noob when it comes to the combat mechanics,it WILL punish you for it,pretty badly,so practice alot on that,unless you're one of those people who get the hang of things pretty easily,oh btw i'm not exaggerating,when i first started the game i had to quicksave before every single fight because i died like once or twice each time i fought something,luckily i quickly got the hang of it after like an hour or so but,that does not mean that enemies won't crush you if given the chance,and i mean ANY enemy,obviously enemies become a lot easier to kill once you get to a decent level and you have a decent health pool.\n\nTip:when your stamina/endurance bar is gray instead of yellow,it means you have a disease,you can cure this with a spell or with a potion,i think you find potions randomly and for spells just search for shrines,there should be one right next to the stairs in the room you start in. Trust me,you'll thank me late for the tip,it took me and quite a bunch of other people several hours into the game before we realized that we had a disease >.<","July 16, 2015","true","39.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ever. So I have nothing to compare it to. In light of that, this game is really fantastic. It has a good degree of realistic difficulty( i.e no hovering arrow to show you where to go, minimalistic map, ANY enemy in the game has the potential to destroy you, wide variety of magic spells that do things other than directly hurt your target, etc.), and what I like most is that it's very well optimised for PCs that can run it. Suck it Windows 8.\n\nNow, from what I've read, the game's story isn't actually Canon, and a little force-fed to both the player and the character. Speaking of, your character is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but hey, I would be too if I had to be the one and only guy that can help anyone with pesky problems like fetching mushrooms, collecting taxes from townsfolk, and facilitating communications between two neighboring towns.\n\nAll in all, I'd rate this a 7/10. There is alittle room for improvement, the difficulty system is something to be desired, it only really changes the amount of enemies in their groups found around the world, and little else. You can probably steam-roll through this game and finish it in about roughly 5 hours, excluding exploration and side-quests.","February 7, 2015","true","10.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","12"

You need to invest more points in getting your stats higher or learning a skill (points for a skill can vary from 10 to 20). Some spells require a previous spell to be learned, even if it's not useful.\n*You gain less points from reading books/tablets.\n*Quests yield a lot of experience points. Most, if not all leveling ups will come from that.\n*Unique and powerful weapons can be found pretty easy.\n\n-Quests are boring: go there and fetch this, escort/follow that person, go kill that and so on...\n-The personalities of the hero and characters have been altered.\n-Voice acting isn't the same for some NPCs.\n-Weird hitboxes.\n-Varant desert and Nordmar are no longer accessible area. You're stuck on the mainland.\n-Some important characters are missing (Lester, Lares, Diego).\n-Once you get your hands on some good armor and weapons, it mostly becomes a fight with the weird hitboxes.\n-And the cherry to top it all: A wolf can still kill you!\n\nVerdict: I only played this because I got it bundled with the other Gothic games. If you're getting this like me or for free, then go for it if you have the time. Otherwise, ignore it.","May 7","false","18.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Having discarded the dev team, the publisher hired a foreign dev team that was barely familiar with the code and tasked them with an expansion. The result was an even greater mess than Gothic 3 itself had been at launch, and everbody recommended skipping the expansion entirely.\nYet, the community came to the rescue again. The same fan devs who had created the community patch set forth to make another one for the (standalone) expansion. I must admit that I have yet to play it, but this effort alone is worth having at least a look. Sadly, all Gothic games have deteriorated somewhat from the very first, but it is easy to fall in love with the unique setting and characters. And once you love it, you want to see the whole story.

Where should I start? With the first episode (feels like a thoudand years ago) I was okay. I loved the second episode - still one of my favourite games. I didn't like the 3rd, however, I played it until the end, and I didn't buy this, until I saw it for just 1 Euro. Then I said, why not? And I don't regret it. I didn't play with such a good RPG for a long time. The conversations many times funny, you can go whereever you want, and it's not an easy game (but don't expect it as hard, as the 1st or 2nd episode) - and this is, what I miss from the games nowadays. So if you like hard games, you should give it a try, othervise avoid it.","May 31, 2014","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is great, graphics are superb, and is worth $10. 100+ hours of great RPG= great times. Another great plus is that you don't have to do any type of conserved 1-mission of the game. You get a cutscene, some dialouge, then BAM! You become exposed to the great and immersive world of Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods.","December 26, 2012","true","77.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason was simple. I had to know what events followed when Gothic 3 ended.\n\nA lesson learned in humility. So many people simply cannot be wrong.\n\nThe negative reviews hold true! This game was a major pain to play.\n\nFor starters, the whole world of myrtana is pretty much the same , minus the varant and the nord regions.\nThere aren't any new opponents except for the troglodyte. They should have made more new opponents.\n\nThere is not much meat in the main story. You are stuck doing some really lame and senseless quests just trying to get to meet the main characters who are Gorn, Thorus and Lee.\nThe end is not at all satisfying. It didn't feel as if it contributed anything to the story.\n\nThe voice acting is the worst. Simply horrible.\nThey introduced a new battle tactic. While encountering an opponent, if you double-tap the direction key, your hero will perform a hop in that direction, which didn't help. It actually made things worse.\n\nThis really feels like some unpolished attempt made by some wannabe game designers who simply made it because they had nothing else to do.\n\nWith the enhanced edition, you wont find the game play buggy and as such if you forget about the story and quests and just play it for the sake of the Gothic 3 world and the graphics and the character building aspect, then it might get through the game.\n\nMy suggestion. Spare yourself of this one, jump on the next game in the series. Arcania.","June 2","false","78.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
