You sucked me in late at night with your pretty colors, challenging gameplay, and awesome upgrades. I loved you until I loaded what I thought was my save with my high score I was working on to find me back at an earlier level 3000,000 short of what I was. For now I must give you up because I am hurt and sad but will comeback one day to complete my challenge of moving up the leaderboards.\n\nUltratron is a fantastic old school style twin stick shooter from the guys at puppygames. They also made other great titles like Revenge of The Titans and Titan Attacks. Your mission is to avenge the human race by killing the titans.\n\nYou do this as a little robot who you can upgrade by earning money which is dropped when titans die. Upgrades come in the form of the power of your gun, adding little pets who each have a different weapon, and defensive abilities like an EMP shock when you get hit. To keep these upgrades you have to get past a checkpoint which is every ten levels and a boss.\n\nGameplay is best done with a controller in my opinion since one joystick controls movement and the other controls your gun. Each stage is done in a somewhat oval shaped stage where a variety of titans appear to bring a stop to your destruction. Each time a titan is killed money appears and you have to collect it before it disappears.\n\nThe main game plays through 40 levels then after that it's just hitting checkpoints every ten levels to try and fully upgrade everything and get a higher score. You can also save where you’re at and quit the game to come back later to keep going. It's a fantastic game with tons of value that can last you a very long time.\n\nBear Rating 10/10","November 20, 2013","true","6.6"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/219190/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a rather long review, so if you want a short summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.\n\nWell it’s time for PuppyGames to shine with Ultratron. It is not the best game out there, but it’s by no means the worst.\n\nStory:\nUltratron is a pretty simple game; you play a little robot that must defeat the many foes and their leaders ahead: Bellum, Lues, Leiunitas, and Letum. The protagonists’ goal in this epic is to get revenge for the fall of earth by the evil forces of robots. As you fight further through the epic campaign you defeat the evil leader robots that destroyed the great planet you knew to love.\n\nCampaign:\nThere are forty main levels and with each level the enemies become slightly stronger, although not to the point where it forces you to select specific upgrades. The game isn’t too difficult and you can get through the first 39 levels without too much effort. As you progress through each subsection (10 levels) you must fight one boss and this creates a save, which you can reload and play even after creating the next save ten levels later. You only get one save for each ten levels; this means if you start again you will overwrite your previous character saves.\n\nGameplay:\nSimilar to Revenge of the Titans you cannot buy all the upgrades within the forty levels, before fighting the main boss. Your cash is limited and you must choose which upgrades you want and which ones you don’t. In order to take more hits you must purchase shields, which upon being hit you lose. This means some of your money goes back to buying defense mechanisms to make sure you do not die in one hit. Although, after fighting your way through the main 40 levels the campaign unlocks and allows you to keep playing. One major benefit to this game is that by clicking escape it saves your progress and quits. This means you can be half way between checkpoints and decide you want to take a break without losing a beat.\n\nResults:\nUltratron is challenging and fun with a lot of variation between rounds because of the upgrade variety. Most of the achievements can be earned by playing the game only a short amount of time. If you ever played geometry wars this is a similar type of game. If you’re fan of arcade games that are in bird’s eye view and are arena shooters then this is the game for you.\n\nHints:\n->To beat Letum you need to purchase the speed boost upgrade, preferably with Quantum Shift so you can run through his bullets. [I also beat him when playing with near maxed out bullet upgrade which made it a bit easier]\n->If your find a turret from a spider drop you can pick the turret up and move it by not firing your main gun.\n->By purchasing the droid level-up upgrade this will allow your droids to level up based on their kill count. This upgrade is only useful if you decide to not fire your blaster and let the droids level up. (I played a play-through using only the lowest level droid and even at level five and fully upgraded it still was weaker than my level two blaster).\n->You will make your money back if you buy the dot slurper upgrades, as the benefit of the farther reach is incredibly notable.\n\nResults:\nI recommend this game. I personally wouldn't purchase it for $9.99, but if you're a fan of the genre then $9.99 is a good price. If you are not a fan of the genre and can get a coupon or it is on sale for about 75% off then this is a great buy. The game is entertaining and rather simple. It doesn’t require too much time to become good at and is fun to compete with against friends.  The checkpoint system makes it rather entertaining and stops you from having to repeat the whole game over again.\n\nPros:\n+Different upgrades which you cannot purchase all in one play through of the main forty levels.\n+Checkpoint system, so you don’t have to restart at the beginning if you lost by just a hair.\n+Easy controls with simple gameplay logic\n+Simple enemies and fun to battle bosses\n+High replay value\n+Save and quit option allowing you to stop playing at any point without losing progress.\n\nCons:\n-Some upgrades seem rather worthless.\n-The final boss, Letum, is ridiculous in difficulty curve.\n-There doesn't seem to be any tutorial or hints pages between levels.","March 3, 2014","true","4.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

This applies to certain genres more than others, but it certainly can be used to describe twin stick arcade shooters, where without a story, expansive world, or other conduit typically used to draw you to the experience, it all comes down to getting the core gameplay right. Ultratron gets it.\n\nMaking no false claims as to what it is, Puppy Games's twin stick shooter drops you into a level and asks you to kill everything that moves. As you destroy enemies they drop credits which you can use to upgrade your bot, replenish your shields, or adopt an array of gadgets to help you stay alive. It's intentionally uncomplicated and that is what makes it so freaking fun!\n\nGliding around in your little homicidal robot feels like an extension of yourself, and the resistance put up by your endlessly spawning enemies coupled with the ensuing explosion when they bite the dust is absolutely perfect, and never stops being satisfying no matter how many times you repeat it. Enemy patterns are varied just enough to keep the experience fresh, and  over the game's 40 levels various levels are sprinkled challenge events and boss fights that become increasingly challenging the further in you get.\n\nAlthough I've never been known to suffer from epilepsy, I appreciated that the developers didn't go as crazy as they could have with the visuals. There is a lot of graphical flair going on at any one time, but rarely did it become detrimental to the gameplay by obscuring enemies, and is actually used as a clever way to increase difficulty as later levels are darker lit and require a keener eye to pick out enemies (but never to the point of being unfair).\n\nFor pure arcade shooting I've rarely had the pleasure of playing one as fun and well crafted as Ultratron. While it may lack content up front, it makes up for it by being replayable just for the sake of revisiting the game (with the added benefit of local co-op, which is a literal blast). As a fan of the genre I found it an absolute joy to play, and am sure to be comparing similar games to it from now on. If you are in the mood for an easy to pick up but hard to put down bit of robot blasting carnage, I think it would be hard to do much better.","December 29, 2013","true","2.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

You are controlling THE LAST humanoid battle droid, slaying the endless hordes of mechanized beasts!\n\nThe fighting is very fast paced and explosive arena styled shooting, where the enemy comes after you in waves. Occasionally you encounter a bigger, more difficult boss droid. You can upgrade and fix your droid between waves, boost shields, buy various pets with different weapons etc. There's lots of cool stuff you can buy - if you have the money. I found myself being in constant lack of it and never really managed to unlock everything.\n\nIt's a fun game with a lot of hectic action. Sometimes I lost myself under all the light effects, explosions and enemy swarms and it felt like I was watching an ant hill under attack. But in game's defense, I've never been good at this type of games so someone with more 1337-powers surely saves the humanity in no time.\n\nIt's a very easily approachable and entertaining "Puppy Game" that doesn't disappoint.","September 25, 2014","true","2.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

This is action-packed arcade game you will be shooting non-stop while moving to dodge their fire.   I made it all the way to level 40, 4th boss, before dying but it was enjoyable experience for me.    In the game, you shoot to destroy robots and each of them drop a coin from 10 to 100 value where you have to go over them to pick them up. At end of each level,  store page comes up and you can purchase anything from health, ammo, combative companions, upgrades for them and yourself as well.   The pace of the game increase as levels progress (and difficulty too).\n\nIf you are looking for shoot em up action-packed arcade game,  you could not go wrong with this game.

It will seem easy at first but will soon become alot harder to dodge bullets and stay alive.\n\nGood Points\nThe grathical style of the game looks amazing. Its very unique and has its own feel to it. Becasue of this it will grab your attention and keep you playing to see what the next level will look like.\n\nThere are tons of diffrent upgrades you can buy once you have finished a level such as more health, more powerful guns, pets and grenades. This keeps you playing and keeps the game challenging because you will want to pick the right upgrade.\n\nReplayability in Ultratron is its shining point, there is Leaderboads which will keep you playing the longest but there is also lots of Steam achievements and once you completed the game you will start again but harder and keep your score. So there is no reason not to finish playing.\n\nThe music works well and fits in with the game. Because of this it will draw you in more. The music becomes faster the more you play so you feel pressured to not die. This works well in the game.\n\nControls for Ultratron are simple yet good, they work well and im sure most people will be fine with them. Because they are simple you won't be finding it confusing or hard to play. You can change them in the menu if you feel dont like it.\n\nThe difficulty is great! It always keeps you on the edge since you wont want to die. Thoughout the game you will have to be 100% focused in the game because if you are not then you will die quickly.\n\nThe enemie types are very diffrent and unipue thoughout the game. Almost every level will have something diffrent for you to kill. Lots of diffrent bosses make things alot better diffrent.\n\nBad Points\nThe length of the game is only about 2 hours but becasue its an arcade game it will be a miner complaint. But its still short and you will complete it since its not to hard fist time round.\n\nAfter a while you will feels a bit bored since there is only 2 modes and that single player and Local Co-op. It gets a bit repetitive after a while.\n\nThere is not much to show thats diffrent compared to other new arcade games. There is the grathical style but thats about it. Because of this the game feels abit the same, but only a tiny bit.\n\nOverall\nOverall I think That Ultratron is a fun challenge to play if you are bored. Its fun to get high scores and complete but since thats all there is I will rate Ultratron a 7 out of 10. Great fun while it lasts. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes arcade games and highscores.","February 18, 2015","true","9.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I never heard of this game until I saw that the soundtrack was recently released. The story concept and art style was really appealing and I read some good things about this developer, so I decided to pick the game up. I was pleasantly surprised. This game is a really fun throwback to retro arcade games from the 80's. You play as a 'good' robot that must avenge the human race and kill all the 'bad' robots in increasingly difficult levels, with a few boss battles in between. The gameplay is easy to get into, but difficult to master like any good retro-style game. The graphics look great, and successfully blend in some nice modern visuals into its retro style. The powerups are really cool and make you feel powerful. Good play will reward more currency and you can buy upgrades. The user interface is easy to navigate and looks really nice. It's very simple to upgrade your robot, and not confusing at all. The audio fits the game's story very well -- the sound effects and robot voices are perfect and the music is really awesome too. The music ramps up in intensity as you progress through each level, and it really fills you up with a sense of impending doom as you blast wave after wave of evil robots. I bought the soundtrack too. Seriously, thumbs up on the audio design. It really lives up to the art style. This game is all killer, no filler. There is zero fat on this game. It's one of those gems that you are glad to find and have in your collection.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/219190/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","Recommended: Puppy Games does one thing, and it does one thing very well: retro arcade games.  If you're looking for a very highly-polished arcade game experience that both feels retro and benefits from modern conventions and fidelity, Ultratron won't leave you disappointed.\n\nUltratron is a retro arcade shooter developed and published by Puppy Games.  It features top-down shooting with a very highly-stylised retro aesthetic.  While one can expand on those two points, that's about what there is to it.  It's a pretty simple game, and if you're looking for complex gameplay this isn't the place to look for it.  What is here, however, is very highly-polished.\n\nThe game progresses through four coarse stages of a few levels each, culminating with a final boss at the end of each stage.  The modes are kept varied by throwing in different stages that are essentially different game modes, for example, a "Dodge stage" whereby you must dodge away from a bunch of enemies without shooting them.  The level variety does some way make up for the lack of enemy variety, but not quite.  There's only a handful of true enemy types, although the actual number could be filled out somewhat since there are successive upgrades of others with minor cosmetic changes that mark their more powerful status.\n\nLongevity is added by having an item shop in between levels, and the "pet" small robots you can get along the way are both useful and kind of cute, in a small robot sort of way.  The game has a lot of character to the visual style in that way.\n\nThe look of the game itself is what I would describe as pleasantly retro.  It has that 8-bit look, but uses a full colour pallete and a variety of modern visual effects to add some jazz to the aesthetic.  It comes together quite well, and with a complimentary retro sound design and chiptune-style music, the production oozes 'retro' from every pore.  It's brilliant if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, though there are some that may be put off by the simplistic gameplay.  If I had one complaint about the visual style its that sometimes the visual effects make it very hard to tell what's going on in the game sometimes.  These distortion effects can be disabled in the options though, so it's not a big detriment to the game.  If you have trouble with them as I do, you can just turn them off.\n\nUnfortunately, for all it's polish it's still a very simplistic game.  No doubt if you like the genre you'll get your money's worth out of the game, and I know that's how I felt as I played it.  At the same time, however, I feel it won't be sticking with me as much as other games such as Thomas Was Alone did.  Its claim to fame: a highly-polished retro shooter, is also what kind of makes it wane in interest with time for me, as it's a very saturated genre indeed.\n\nNonetheless, if you are indeed a retro shooter fan, you'll greatly enjoy this game while it lasts, I think.  At a low price point, it's worth picking up.\n\nPublished: http://www.highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/91-review-ultratron","April 26, 2014","true","13.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Trying to get the high score is a challenge that will suck your life away.\n\nThe enemies and pets are all cute and nicely designed but they soon turn into things that can kill a man in half a second.\n\nPuppygames did extremely well making this game and deserves a lot of respect for this gem.

It's suprisingly addicting, and the way the upgrades system works it gives you a lot of customization options to get through the levels. It is so satisfying collecting upgrades, power-ups and boots that enhance the play style of this game. It's not only great for its many challenges but also for all the different improvements you can buy with the money accumulated by killing the enemies. In fact, it doesn't get boring for ages. It's good to see that you get so engrossed in a game that you actually feel frustrated when you see that "Game Over" screen come up in front of you.\n\n10/10 Highly recommended.","February 24, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After you beat the game the cycle begins again, conserving your upgrades but with more tougher enemies and chaotic situations.\n* Have local, friends and global highscores.\n* Have local coop.\n\nFor my, $10 dollars can feel a little of expensive if you are not really fanatic of the genere.

It starts out slow but gradually builds speed and difficulty as you go on. After a while, this game turns you into a f***ing ninja. Make sure you're constantly moving and always watching the entire screen, only focusing on a single area for 1, maybe 2 seconds. When starting out, this advice sounds idiotic, but once you get up to the higher levels, especially 3 and 4, you'll understand.\nIf you're trying to get used to (or better with) the keyboard and mouse, trying to amp up your reaction time, or just want an awesome twin-stick shooter, definitely pick this up. Fast-paced insanity in a small, compact area at its finest.\nAlso, once you get to more difficult levels, try to stay near the middle as much as possible. Yes, pick up the money, but once the difficulty begins to curve up, enemies can spawn and shoot from off-screen.

It doesn’t deviate far from the standard formula, but it’s so well done that I’m not complaining. I absolutely adore Puppy Games’s design aesthetic, and the gameplay is simple and fun. You know the drill, one joystick moves your character while the other shoots. Avoid projectiles, destroy all robots, upgrade, repeat. Along with upgrading your robot’s own abilities, you can purchase and enhance several “pets” that will automatically fire at nearby enemies. It takes quite a few upgrades for the pets to feel useful, but I loved the way they were implemented. Each one tags along behind you in a line that acts as a secondary shield. If one of them is hit, it is dropped in place where it will wait patiently for your return. Balancing upgrades can be tricky. I realized a little too late that I had pumped all my money into the wrong upgrades, because the boring-sounding ones ended up being more useful than I anticipated. The game is fairly forgiving, though, and it’s unlikely that you’ll upgrade yourself into a corner. Ultratron is a great addition to any shooter fan’s collection.","February 10, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ephewe/recommended/219190/","ephewe","ephewe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ephewe/","229 products in account","I've had quite a bit of fun with this game. I can't really say that it brings anything new to the table, but what it does bring is absolutely top-notch. The gameplay is that of a standard directional-stick arcade shooter and the controls are tight and natural-feeling. The graphics are simple with a retro aesthetic but they come off as fresh nonetheless. It's got a decent techno soundtrack salted with synth sound & voice effects which really serve to ease you into "the zone". At no point does the sound become tiresome or overbearing. The action steadily increases in difficulty until it reaches a fever pitch; full-on "bullet hell" status. When you're frantically running from 571 on-screen projectiles while simultaneously lining up your shots and reaching for currency and power-ups, you'll find yourself transported back to the arcades of yore, standing in front of a Smash T.V. cabinet (well, if you're old enough, that is). The insanity is mitigated somewhat by the many offensive and defensive power-ups which you can buy at the shop-screen between levels. You can also have up to 3 minions which follow you closely and can be separately upgraded (each minion carries its own distinct weapon too!). Every 10 levels or so, you'll encounter a gigantic boss which is standard in games of this genre. To give you an idea of what they're like, picture a massive screen-filling robot porcupine but with various cannons, lasers, and rocket-launchers instead of quills and you'll have a pretty accurate mental picture. The boss battles force you to change up your overall strategy and they go a long way in terms of mixing things up and staving off monotony.\n\nUltratron is a worthy distraction. Being an indy game, the price is low. Being a *good* indy game, the pay-off is high. You'll definitely want to give this game a shot. An Xbox 360 controller, with its dual analog sticks and native Windows support, is *VERY* highly recommended if you really want to replicate the arcade-type experience.","April 18, 2013","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally find this game so visually attractive as it invokes a new, bright atmosphere. Controls are easy and over all a good game, I enjoyed it a lot!","April 28, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like it despite the flaws listed below (read them!).\n\nCool stuff:\n\n* Good controls (if you're using mouse/keyboard - I see complaints about controllers and rebinding).\n* Your skill comes into play quite a bit.  You usually die because you made a mistake, not because of some random reason.\n* How you load out your character is fairly important.  Choices you make early on affect how you play later.\n\nFlaws:\n\n* Often it is hard to distinguish enemies from the background.  Easy fix but they never did.\n* Enemies, including bosses, could have been more unique / interesting.\n* Some upgrades just don't seem useful for what they cost.\n* Fruit?  Coins?  They don't belong or fit the theme of the entire rest of the game.  Should've kept with the theme.\n* Character loadouts should have been differentiated and tested more.  I'm not sure some loadouts are even viable.\n* Challenge levels should have awarded coins on a percentage instead of only based on perfection.  As is if you get hit once in a challenge level (or miss once) the entire rest of that level is pointless as far as earning money goes.\n* Kind of short.  I "beat" it in about 9 hours of play.\n* Arenas are just recolors.\n* There's too much crap on the screen.  It looks like someone just learned how to use sharders and went wild with filters and lights.\n* Save system is bogus.  If you miss a boss you have to play a ton of levels over.\n* Upgrade system doesn't reward exploration.  Choose a dud upgrade and you're screwed 10 levels later.\n* Story?  What story?  Why am I shooting things?  A story is hinted at but never told.\n* $10 is high for what you get.  $5 is worth it.  Look for sales.\n\nI still recommend the game because it's fun overall, but note the flaws and see if any of them kill the game for you.","March 13","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gets pretty frantic early on, but there is a method to its madness.\nI'll tell you right of the bat that YES, it can often occur that you simply have no idea what's going on because the screen is just a mass of flashy neon colors exploding everywhere. It's super-distracting, but you do kind of get used to it after a while. Kind of. The graphics are gorgeous, though, with some really great color work. There are some nice touches like your avatar and pets changing appearance as they get upgraded.\n\nThere's a great balance of risk and reward. If you want to power up as much as possible you're going to need to pick up the money dropped by enemies, but approaching it might put you in harm's way. It's still generally worth it to be greedy as the purchasable upgrades are a lot of fun. You can choose to focus on your own offensive capabilities or on droid helpers, or even on additional special moves, all with multiple tiers. Yes, it is possible to max out all your upgrades, but it probably won't happen on your first game. It's really satisfying, though.\n\nIn fact, once you get over the leaning curve you can snowball your way through the game and make it a marathon. I got well past level 100 and had to play my game in 2 sittings. I don't know if that's a fair complaint, since I had a lot of fun while doing that. Even after the game got repetitive there was more to learn and exploit, such as a tricky manoeuvre where you can dash into fruit to make it explode, or fighting multiple bosses at the same time.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to fans of twin-stick shooters. If you're patient enough to deal with the very distracting graphic style, you'll find a game with some meat on it.","February 6","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you had the option to save after each stage, it would make the game much more enjoyable. But, if you make one bad mistake in one stage and die, you will have to repeat all 10 stages all over again just to reach another checkpoint. Again, it would be a solid game if not for these 2 major issues.","March 15","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty good.\n\nThis is the direct sequel (at least in spirit) to the famous Robotron 2084 arcade game (which I used to play extensively on my Nintendo 64). Ultratron is harder and more complex than Robotron 2084 in every respect but despite its many differences, such as the presence of weapon and character upgrades, better graphics, more complex arenas and the music (Robotron 2084 had no music at all), Ultratron still somehow manages to feel very nostalgic. Despite its high difficulty and despite its initially clunky looking graphics (reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games), this is a seemingly simple but extremely fun game with absolutely no bugs (other than the intentional warping and flipping of the screen).\n\n++++\n+This game is pretty inexpensive.\n\n+ The controls are highly responsive and generally outstanding.\n\n+ The sound is highly reminiscent of 1980s arcade games. Still, this game's intentionally nostalgic sounds are extremely well done and hearing all the nifty computer sounds this game makes is a lot of fun. Despite how nostalgic the sounds are they will not make your speakers pop. The sounds in this game are high quality. They don't come through as fuzzy, grainy or full of static. Every single sound in this game also tells you something important.\n\n+The graphics, while reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games, are actually quite a bit more complex, including some pretty lighting effects and little spotlight rays which follow your character around. The lighting creates a wonderful techno-menacing ambient feeling which goes far to create this game's atmosphere. The overall atmosphere seems to be halfway between a 1980s arcade, a techno rave dance club and a weird, futuristic computer factory. Indeed, the levels all sort of look like they take place in a 2D dance club of some sort which is at once funny and fitting for this game. The high-contrast graphics also helped me concentrate even better than I otherwise would have. The intentionally strange screen distortion effects helped increase the atmospherics of this game still further without significantly distracting from the gameplay. When playing this game it almost looks as if your own computer monitor wants the machines to win but can't really do much about you.\n\n+The overall game design and object of the game (destroy everything on the screen) is simple but extremely well executed. Levels are divided into 4 sections, each of which has a boss fight at the end. Once a boss has been defeated you can jump to that section at a later time using the extremely easy-to-use game menu. Between each level you can upgrade your character with little monies you earned while you were destroying enemies during each preceding level (or you can save your little monies for better upgrades later. The boss fights are challenging but only the final one is potentially frustrating (I defeated it on my third try but then I currently hold the 5th highest score in the world). After the final boss, you can continue playing even further to get an even high score. The furthest I've gotten is to level 60 but I think I heard somewhere that there are 100 levels in all but I'm not sure. The designs of all of the smaller enemies are also very, very good, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\n+/-+/-+/-+/-\n+/- Asides from the good main theme and the excellent music which plays during boss fights (the same song which plays on the Steam store's Ultratron page), this game's music is largely mediocre and tends towards an overly complicated and chaotic musical style (that oftentimes would sound more at home in a Unreal Tournament game rather than a little arcade-style game like this). The music can, at times be distracting but the music can be easily turned down.\n\n+/-This game gets very difficult very quickly. This is essentially a dual analog game. (I play it with a mouse (to aim and fire with) and keyboard (to move)). If you do not have a background in playing other dual analog games I'd recommend playing some other dual analog games first to get used to the fundamentals of the controls before diving into something as challenging as Ultratron. Playing the original Robotron 2084 (if you can find a good version of it these days) will help you to be better at this game too.\n\n---------\n-It would have been nice if the difficulty ramped up more slowly (so the game would have more stages to play through).\n\n-This game could use some additional gameplay modes of some sort to add variety and increased replayability. (For example, a mode where you must fire as little as possible, a time trial mode, a boss rush mode etc. would have all been nice additions) As it stands, this is a fairly bare-bones arcade style game with just one mode.\n\n-It would be nice to be able to play a cooperative mode with AI's if you don't have any friends who also play this game (like me).\n\n-The game needs more variety to its arenas. It needs more traps and physical barriers etc. Maze-like arenas would have been cool too. There's a whole lot more than could be done with this game.","April 24","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have always wanted that perfect twin stick shooter that would out-do the original Robotron. I had come close with Nuclear Throne, been disappointed with the doge-roll mechanics of Gungeon, and still feel on the fence for Neurovoider.\nNothing captured that pure feel Robotron. Super fast, super responsive, incredibly tough and unpredictible, and just plain kick-♥♥♥. Quite possibly in my mind the greatest game of all time. Then I happened upon this game.\nTake everything I mentioned above that I loved about the original and add everything to improve upon that formula. Power-up's, minions, sentry turrets, kick-♥♥♥ visuals, a rocking soudtrack, super tight controls, a talent tree system thats based on coin collecting (some what risky at times), and OH MY GOD, fruit prizes! Classic gamers rejoice!!\nYou can choose between controller or mouse-keyboard gameplay. Something that Nuclear Throne does but there is a massive advantage to using the later. This game feels and plays great with either. I still cant decide which I like more, they both rock. Oh and theres no real engame, this one is forever, and I'm pretty sure this game will be on every pc I will ever build.\nIf you are even remotely a twin-stick fan, I urge you to get this game. I have played a ton of them. This one rests firmly in my top spot. This is the new standarrd. Robotron has been usurped.
