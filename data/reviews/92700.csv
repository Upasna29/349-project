"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/92700/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops is your typical first-person modern shooter game. The gist of the game is you work for the United States Army and you have your enemies that are fringe organisations. You, the player, play as both Cpt. Myra Lee and Cpt. Aron Alvarez and switch between them in the later stages of the game, but mainly switch between both in solo missions.\n\nWell let's get straight to it. The game isn't very good. This game isn't an AAA game, but not being AAA does not mean you can't have good games. It does have its positives in a above-average storyline that covers a wide variety of settings. I will admit that due to how bad the game is performence and gameplay-wise, I did not finish the campaign. However, I finished about four hours of the campaign, with How Long To Beat.com noting the length of the campaign is seven hours. Again, the campaign isn't that bad. I will note that I had not played this game in many months and coming back to this game, I remembered why I never finished this.\n\nThe main issue is the UI and graphics, performance and the gameplay. To begin, I don't find the gameplay to be appealing. The default control layout is odd to a normal typical first person shooter, but regardless I don't like how the mechanics work. The mechanics include running into cover to go into the cover system, which is annoying, the AI is odd, and the choice of weapons in the game is poor. Also, the graphics are bad for a 2011 game. The performence is very poor. With my specs listed on my profile, I can't get a stable 60FPS with max settings on this game, which is appalling. So mainly, the graphics, performance and gameplay was a major turn-off for I. The game has its fair share of glitches too.\n\nOverall, I'll be blunt, I do not recommend this game. The gameplay is poor, the graphics are bad, the game is unoptimised, but the story is above-average. If you do wish to get the game, get it at a very steep discount, otherwise do not bother as their are other great games worth your time. 2/10\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

SHPO is an ambitious game developed by a very small studio. It's not a horrible game as other reviews might make it seem, but it could probably have been so much better if the developers had more resources. The game has a lot of potential, and could have been a hit if not for its failings. It's challenging and entertaining at times, and has a decent albeit somewhat unrealistic storyline. I would recommend this game only if you're willing to understand that there are flaws. Some of these flaws are just personal nitpicking, but I'd say the other flaws are fundamental issues. A perfect example of the latter would be the enemy AI's uncanny ability to detect and shoot you from seemingly out of nowhere. Another example is that even though I enjoyed the stealth missions, I could not successfully complete the later missions without cheating. Perhaps a more skilled gamer may have done better than me, but I was too frustrated by that point. Here's a breakdown of some of the points that stood out:\n\nNot Bad\n- story\n- stealth missions\n- co-op play\n- character models\n- weapons/technology\n- menu interface\n- sound/music\n\nNot Good\n- virtually all enemies (Somalis, Cubans) look/sound like American soldiers\n- inaccurate details in the aesthetics of certain levels\n- audio & video glitches\n- random slow load times\n- cannot adjust gamma levels\n- cannot adjust sound vs music levels\n- not enough ammo/health/etc in certain levels\n- certain levels designed with unnecessary and useless rooms/dead-ends\n- cannot skip cinematics\n\nThe bottom line is that I would generously rate this game about 65%. It enaged me enough to want to complete it, and I was content when it was all over. I bought the retail version of the game as part of the Action Strategy 4 Pack (Stalker Call of Pripyat, Storm Frontline Nation, Grand Ages Rome, Shadow Harvest) for $5, so if you can make a stand-alone purchase of Shadow Harvest for a low price then I'd say take a chance and try it.","January 2, 2015","true","29.8"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","0"

Should be rated at least 60 easily.  Definitely not 34.  Not an AAA grade title, so don't expect CoD and you'll enjoy it. Single player only. No achievements. Good story and ending. Voice acting is good but lip synch not so much. Graphics are good once you switch OFF Bloom and Ambient Occlusion. Controls are fine.\n\nSo why all the rabid nonsensical reviews?  Well, the game makes a very revealing and unfriendly observation on the real world US involvement in global terrorism as its ending, which I guess explains most of the smear campaign leveled against it by the establishment controlled mainstream reviewers and army of social media manipulation commenting staff.  It is telling that all the major review sites harshly pan this game while almost all the minor lesser known sites are fair to favourable.\n\nThe real score for this game should be 6/10, and in my personal opinion 7/10. To sum up, I would say worth 20$, and definitely a must have on sale for 5$ or less.","August 14, 2013","true","64.6"," 37 of 61 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","37","61","5","0"

I went in with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhile this is not a AAA title, it is nevertheless a good game. The low budget does show sometimes (copy paste environments, and typos in the subtitles), but it also does many things right. There are some interesting gameplay mechanics and it does a very good job of changing the pace up. Sound design (especially explosions) is solid, and the gunplay is also quite good.\n\nI also had some graphical problems at the beginning, with my framerate jumping between 30 and 60 (and this on a 4790K and GTX 970), but after some tweaking in nVidia's Control Panel, it sat at 60 all the way through. This was on Windows 10 Pro x64.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy on sale.","October 4, 2015","true","10.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/92700/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","I often factor metacritic scores and user reviews into my game purchase decisions. Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops is one of those games I put off buying because it was hard to find anything positive about it. To me a 34 metascore means this game is absolutely atrocious, something that isn't even ready for public release. I have to testify that isn't the case. That's not to say the game doesn't have faults. I have yet to find a game that doesn't have faults--ok maybe Call of Duty 4. But I've played some pretty bad games in my time and this one comes nowhere close to rock bottom.\n\nIt's a traditional cover shooter, but you get to play two different characters, similar to Conflict: Denied Ops. There's a run and gun rambo character and a sneaky, stealth character. Both have their uses in each mission, but the stealth character is by far the more fun of the two for gameplay. Her crossbow works very well and was enjoyable taking out unsuspecting AI from distance. Now there are a couple areas where the run and gun guy gets to control a battle mech which was pretty fun as well (kind of FEAR 2 style). Overall I liked the shooter elements and thought they were good.\n\nThe story is okay, but feels like it should have been longer--almost like they just had to get the product out the door and kind of wrapped up all the loose ends in a nice bow rather than finishing it properly.\n\nMany of the negatives don't even have anything to do with the gameplay. Stuff like separate volume controls for voices, background, and music don't exist. And you can't turn the music off. This makes it hard to hear voice dialog during some of the missions. The graphics and graphic controls are also bad--lots of tearing and jagged edges. There is a bloom option and when it's on, there's too much bloom where a lot of scenes are just a white blur, but when it's off, the environment is so dark, it's hard to see. The framerate gets pretty bad when a lot of things are blowing up simultaneously as well.\n\nThe cover system is decent, but annoying. It's automatic and you often end up in cover when you don't want to be. The voice acting is obviously not top quality, but doesn't stand out as being bad.\n\nAll in all, most of the elements of Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops are average or below average. I had fun with it and would recommend it as a bargain bin shooter. It's right in line with bargain bin material like Sniper: Ghost Warrior. I'm glad I looked past the bad publicity and gave it a shot.","December 29, 2012","true","9.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracael/recommended/92700/","dracael","Dracael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracael/","112 products in account","The "stealth-action" game "Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops" is a technical mess and hard to recommand, but I have to admit,  I liked some ideas of the game. The stealth and the action component is (strictly) splitted between the two main-charaters. Usually you have them both and can switch between them at any given time. You play from the third-person perspective. The game machanics have some flaws, but the core idea is not that bad.\n\nIt is hard to recommand it, because it is more between "Yes" and "No". From my perspective now (2014), it is old (game performance is still bad; it crashes a lot on several systems), buggy and outdated, so no recommandation. From the perspective of 2011, I would say "yes" with some "constraints". It brought back some "oldschool" mechanics like med-kits (no regenerating health), it was quite difficult, if you died (or get seen in some missions) you had to restart the complete level again, etc. And this before Dark Souls (and others) was released that made "harder/frustrating" games popular again.\n\nAnother problem is the execution of most elements of the game. Animations, graphics, coding, qa (a lot of bugs, bad performance, crashes), story aren't all that great. I would say, I can forgive bad animations and graphics, especially if it is a game from a small studio, but a lot of small indie devs right now, are doing a far better job here. Admittedly they also often avoid genres like stealth action (like in this case). And this is most likely the reason why this game has a lot of problems. The developers wanted too much. They wanted it to look and feel like a "AAA-Title", but this is very hard with a small team, a small budget and right on the first game they've ever developed.\n\nIf you are looking for an "old-schoolish" stealth game with a cheesy story, some nice ideas (here and there) and you can ignore animations, bugs, bad performance and some design flaws, maybe pick it up, if you see it cheap. $7.99 is maybe borderline ok for it, if you are into those games and you know it will work on your machine. Don't expect patches, the Studio was closed, as far as I know.\n\nSo from the 2011 perspective and with a warning (flawed game with tons of bugs and problems, but for cheap maybe give it a try), I give a semi-recommandation.\n\nDisclaimer: I played through it when it was released in 2011, but Steam hasn't tracked my game time on it back then. Also my english is bad, sry =/","June 22, 2014","true","0.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I have a feeling that all the development team were busy with making the female, rather than the game. But I can't complain, she's easy on the eyes.

How this game got the greenlight might be a mystery akin to the Loch Ness Monster, UFOs and who killed JFK. The graphics are OK. Lemme rephrase that. The graphics you can SEE are OK.

If you die, you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you will be going way, WAY back. Oh, and remember those dark interiors? I got stuck in a corner between a barrel and some crates? Jump out of it you say? Nope, no jumping. Get behind cover and return fire? Nope. This a shooter with cover but it's not a cover shooter. That's right. Once you get near a wall you go into cover mode. But guess what? You can't shoot anything from behind cover. Yes, really. Artificial Intelligence? An insult to the word. There were instances where I was right freaking in front of the enemy. Couldn't get me. Thank goodness for the hedgehog barriers defelecting every bullet when the AI DID try to engage me. Sorry for the longish review but this game is just bad in every way. Why I bought this, I'll never know. I don't drink (anymore) or do drugs but maybe I did when I bought this POS (for $2.00 it appears). That's too much. Stay away. STAY FAR AWAY from this game.","May 30, 2013","false","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

A stragic game!!! AAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Run away, run away, run away! That was my first response when I found out that this was in my own view a true first person shooter. I like mindless running and gunning like Serious Sam or Unreal. This game fits a little too well into reality which I dispise and am stuck in. This rating completely falls into personal tastes this time and this is very likely a very good if not awesome game but not for me. It's more like a nightmare for me to play. I didn't realize what type of game I was buying when I was looking at the game screen shot at the store. If you like stragic games, disreguard this review but if you are like me don't even look twice at this title because the sweet graphics they are showing are real and you might think twice about buying it and find out you don't like playing it sweet graphics and all.","July 19, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
