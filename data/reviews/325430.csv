It has the *potential* to be something interesting, but you can get the full current gameplay experience by watching the 8:32 video in the description. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO YET.\n\nTL;DR it's currently a tech demo for the "convert smooth terrain to blocks" idea. Which is, admittedly, a pretty neat idea. But that's not a game. Keep an eye on Cubic for when actual game-like features appear...\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n* the walk speed is SLOOOOOOOOOW. We're talking "20 seconds to walk across your 'lair'" slow. Holding down Shift to run makes the speed tolerable, but then you get a continuous loop of heavy breathing after about 10 seconds.\n\n* the fabricator GUI *desperately* needs better camera controls. This becomes obvious in the tutorial, when you have to stick a button on the back of the door you've just created. Good luck panning, rotating & zooming until you finally get UNDER the object.\n\n* thin circular bands of light in the lair: can you say ALIASING, kids? Unless "dancing jaggies" is actually the decor, this is gross - and totally voluntary. I can understand that the engine is still being tweaked, but what about just not *doing* things that look terrible?\n\n* meaningless placeholder content is annoying. As far as I can tell, the different "elements" in the fabricator don't DO anything different. Most of them don't even have block icons. And then there's the black-text-on-dark-grey UX.\n\n* speaking of meaningless, let's talk about the "embarcation level". It may do something someday, but all it does now is add clicks + animation cycles to getting into and out of the lair. Oh, and sometimes you get stuck UNDER the elevator and get to reset the game...","October 5, 2014","false","2.7"," 105 of 146 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","105","146","6","14"

Its something that most voxel games dont have... a purpose. there is a story behind this game, which makes it fun because it still is an open sandbox. The crafting is a lot more intricate than other games and thats also adds a lot of character to the gameplay.\n\nI definitley encourage people to check it out, but keep in mind its still early access and has its share of bugs when signing up for this, but like I said earlier, definitely a lot of potential!","December 6, 2015","true","1.8"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/torbray00/recommended/325430/","torbray00","torbray","http://steamcommunity.com/id/torbray00/","85 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCubic is a voxel sandbox game. From the trailer, it seems very much like Minecraft and, to some extent, it is. That's mostly at the moment because Cubic is very early alpha (0.0.2.9 in this review) and contains breaking, placing, jumping, crafting and storage. From what Cubic promises though, it has the potential to be much more than any voxel sandbox game.\n\nIn particular, there is a "building fabricator" which I originally thought was a remake of Minecraft's crafting recipes. In reality, the building fabricator promises to be a powerful crafting set-up to create a variety of interactive objects. At the moment, Cubic offers a button and a hinge which you can use to create your own doors in any shape or size. In the future (and I cannot express enough "in the future"), Cubic promises to add a variety of materials (which I assume will have different properties) and different components (like potentially levers, wheels or pistons). Don't get me wrong though - in 0.0.2.9, none of these have been added just yet.\n\nThe game is also clearly going to be more adventure-based. In the tutorial, you are assisted by a flying companion named Corban which gives you the tutorial via story-based lessons. Later, there's a story quest involving Corban. For starters, I liked the voice-acting of Corban but he could've talked less. Cubic looks to be planning more quests which opens opportunities for other NPCs, monsters, weapons, vehicles, worlds, modding opportunities, trading or side quests! Again though, Cubic has none of these just yet.\n\nIn brief though, the sandbox, features, quests, block types and others are very limited due to the early alpha build + there are a lot of bugs. Would I recommend it currently for $25 USD? No. Could it be worth it in the future? Yes, and it's worth following its development.","October 6, 2014","true","1.6"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","0"

Nicely done. Secondly, I admire the innovation on the player menu (tab). As far as similarity to minecraft; You can steal blocks from anything (4), trees are much easier to take down, you start with a gun (5), and the crafting system seems much more complex and customizable. The graphics are by far superior and I'm impressed by their ability to translate that into modular crafting.\nThis game is indeed in alpha state, there are many glitches and I actually found them rather excited. I play many styles of games and frankly find little to be surprising these days. However, I was very surprised and even thrilled when I glitched into the bottom of a lake, climbed my way out by removing blocks, and discovered the interesting way in which they simulate being under water. I probably would have never jumped into the lake right off the bat, had that not happened.\nAll in all, I'm excited to see where this games goes and how the developers evolve their wonderful ideas.

Voxels are pretty hot right now, nod to Notch, but this has the capacity to become something much much more.\n\nCubic is currently PRE-ALPHA (0.0.2.9), so it's still an infant, but a beautiful one. Still has a few bugs but look at the dev activity on the forums.  (Just saw in the forum that there's an update coming tomorrow!) Basically, right now, there's a PLAYABLE INTRO and sandbox mode. (Fingers crossed for next update!) I'm more of a multiplayer kind of guy myself, and the devs said that is also coming soon!\n\nThe thing I am most excited about is the fabrication aspect of it. This is going to be fantastic, there's just so much potential. And there's a ton of cool ideas that folks have been mentioning on the forums that have really gotten me excited. Catapults, mech-suits, all types of vehicles, big-ole swords, the possibilities are literally endless. (The devs mentioned that multiple worlds are comingâ€¦ Does that mean that we can make spaceships??) (or a stargate!?!?) ...I just started sweating.\n\nI want Cubic to get popular because there really is a ton of cool innovations that I hope are soon realized.\n\nOf course, all early access games are somewhat of a risk. Will this ever get off the ground?\nFrom the forums, I've learned that:\nThis has been the devs baby for two years.\nThey have answered EVERY post on the forums.\nUpdate coming soon. And they've said they hope to keep cranking them out.\n\n\nShould I buy this game?\nUltimately, yes.\n\nIf you're squeamish of anything in pre-alpha, you COULD wait it out.\nBut for every early adopter, there's a higher likelihood that we'll get everything we want from this game.\nEither way, you should at the very least follow it.\n\nCubic is so full of POTENTIAL.

This game has already become better then most sandbox games in my opinion. I look forward to the many feature updates to come but as is, the game is worth the money. People tend to forget that this is a early access game and they expect it to be a finished product ( which it is not). Early Access games are more for the hardcore gamer and developers that like to see the game evolve and the most important part of that is playing the game as is and letting the developers of the game know what you would like to see or about a bug/glitch that is unfound and needs to be addressed to make the game better. If you want a game that is finished then just stick to minecraft untill this is finished but expect to pay more for the finished game, I love early access games and this one is at the top of my list due to the many features that i already see in game that are being developed. For being soo early access as this game is it has very little bugs and FPS is fairly constant.

The description for it is very interesting. Anyway, here are my pros and cons to it.\n\n\nPros\n-------------\n- The tutorial was helpful, from what I've seen it covers what's currently in the game.\n- I liked the fabrication area and though it took me a bit to figure it out controls for navigating around when creating objects I liked the bar at the bottom which had the "pan, zoom, rotate" down there until I learned the controls.\n- I enjoyed the idea of going out to collect things such as dirt, stone, etc.. then de-composing it into different ingredients and such.\n------\n\nCons\n----------------\n- The sprint speed was a good normal speed, but the walk speed was so slow. Besides this it would be perfect.\n- I found a weird glitch with 'climbing' things... for example the giant mountain you find somewhere around the end of the tut that you should go and climb... you can just hit space a whole bunch of times and if you hit it's surface you can keep jumping. Same thing happens if you dig a hole straight down into the ground.\n- Since there is currently no menu at all I'm not going to say much about it as I'm assuming it's still in development. But, some things I'd like on it is for the tutorial. Currently, the tutorial although perfectly good (as said above), if you miss something he says that you're supposed to do, you lost it, and have to reset the whole thing. I know you can completely exit the game and re-open it, and it will take you to the last checkpoint.. I did this while inside the fabricator machine making the first door because I missed what I was supposed to do.. closed down the game and re-opened, and did it. It didn't keep my backpack in that one area in the lair though, so I couldn't move the door into it.\n\n----------------\n\n\nCan't wait to see how this game turns out!","November 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

This game NEVER runs at a good framerate for me, even though my graphics card has a GTX750ti and 2 Gb of VRAM. The game has a fairly short render distance, yet still lags this hard.  Not to mention the only graphics setting which can be adjusted is the game resolution.\n\nThe main level or your base in Cubic is a very cool idea which I like a lot.  The whole method of refining blocks, creating recipes and fabricating blocks to use is an interesting and satisfying process.\n\nThere are 2 things this needs to add to be worth playing:\n1:  Multiplayer.  If I can't play with my friends, I might aswell just play minecraft, as it is more advanced.  I can imagine having a lot of fun on this game with my friends, but playing it solo would be about as rewarding as playing a flash game.\n2:  The world of Cubic requires some additional depth, litterally and figuratively.  The caves in this game arae more like holes in the ground, which once you get into, you don't discover anything cool or interesting, and immediately turn to the exit again.

Dev's are friendly , eager and working hard to keep the updates comming. They listen to and quicky responded to my feedback. That's something not all dev's do, sadly.\n\nI can't expect much, the game has only been in Aplha stage a month or two.  Game is somewhat stable. Little laggy, Sometimes fall through the world. Holes in the ground that show sky.  Block placement needs a little tweeking. Refining can be a little buggy if you attempt to move blocks in que.  Multiplayer isn't functional for me yet (on Mac?). Jumping up from block to block needs a little work. Tutorial is disabled, story line disabled. Not much you can "currently" do at this time, except dig, refine, shoot  and build. I can't wait to play it in it's final release.","September 12, 2015","true","17.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","4"

I might be able to recommend it later, but not yet.\n\nYes, it's another not-Minecraft.\n\nCons\n- I couldn't even finish the tutorial. I tried twice. It hung up somewhere after getting coloring ingredients, and then I had no idea what the tutorial wanted. Sometimes there were quest waypointa and next steps, sometimes not.\n- There's a miniature CAD program inside. That's cool, because someday that's a huge customization opportunity. But the internal  CAD program completely sucks right now. Come on, this is very early access; just write an importer from Sketchup or Solidworks.\n- Graphics performance is horrible. I have a mid-range machine, but even so, the frame rate is just a slog.\n- The rendering algorithm uses a standard rendering-distance-to-object measure, and so giant trees just pop into view. I climbed up on one of the giant bluffs in the tutorial map. It was a nice view, insofar as it went, which was hardly at all. The horizon line was there, but  my direct view ended in a nice spherical intersection with the desert floor. (Hint: convolve the view of distant objects with a Gaussian blur and cache. You don't need to recalculate if the angle doesn't change much, which it doesn't if you're far away.)\n- Why couldn't I harvest the trees? Point gauntlet, click, nothing. or rather ofter something behind the tree.","December 19, 2014","false","12.4"," 11 of 31 people (35%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","35","11","31","5","1"
