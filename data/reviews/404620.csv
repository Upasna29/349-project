Why not make a way to customize the money, population, electorial votes, ect, of all the states?\n\n-Third Party system.\n\n-Debates. How about a Debate system where every few turns or so, you and other candidates take turns not just making statements about different issues, but also engaging with each other on the issues? Perhaps each candidate could have another stat determining how well they can do in the debates.\n\n-Third Party system.\n\n-Primary elections anyone?\n\n-WHERE THE HECK IS THE THIRD PARTY SYSTEM?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sherlockhound/recommended/404620/","sherlockhound","Sherlock Hound","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sherlockhound/","530 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's the same exact game as the Political Machine 2012. Same graphics. Same music. Same random events. Same glitches.  Same *everything*. Stardock slapped a 2016 sticker on the previous game and decided to charge people $10 for it.\n\nA bit of history: TPM2008 was notable for bringing the series into 3D. It featured a mode where you'd face former presidents (from Nixon and Kennedy to Lincoln and Washington) to unlock more playable characters. It even had different election year scenarios, allowing players to run for President during the Civil War (among others) and to formulate a campaign to win voters during that time period. It was educational and fun. TPM2012 stripped away these modes, and only allowed players to run the 2012 campaign.\n\nTPM2016 is literally the same exact game as 2012. Swap out a few uneletectable presidential candidates and a few issues (instead of running on a platform based on reforming the economy, you'll be basing it on national security, the environment, or Black Lives Matter) and you have TPM2016.\n\nThe same glitches are still there from previous versions. Every few games, I'm randomly blocked from using Political Capital (to hire more staffers). When attempting to select my veep, constant pop-up messages come up telling me that my opponent got endorsed by a political group. After a campaign is over and I'm reviewing the map one final time, music from the “results” screen and the “map” screen play at the same time. Bottom line: Glitches are fine and are to be expected, but not when the SAME glitches have been in your game series for over *eight years*. It's clear that the game hasn't been tested, or that Stardock just doesn't care.\n\nThe voter demographics are still wonky too. Republicans can easily win Vermont, Connecticut, and Oregon (Dem strongholds), but rarely win New Hampshire (tossup state). Democrats can easily win Tennessee and West Virginia (GOP strongholds). Little things like that, turn what could be a (somewhat) educational game into a free-for-all with no redeeming values.\n\nAs I previously said, this game is the same game as TPM2012, right down to the main menu and graphics. I couldn't imagine another strategy game (like Civilization) repackaging the same game every four years, changing a spreadsheet or two, and tossing it out into the market. Don't support Stardock and this lazy money grab.\n\nTL;DR: Avoid this game. If you are a political junkie, pick up TPM2008 off Amazon or eBay for a few bucks. There are guides online on how to mod the game to your liking. It's really easy to add more characters and modify the current-day issues. You'll get twice the game for half the price.","January 4","false","4.7"," 132 of 143 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","132","143","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DigitalZiggurat/recommended/404620/","DigitalZiggurat","Richard Nixon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DigitalZiggurat/","396 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPretty much the same as the last two, with updated candidates and an improved user interface. However, it's a pretty good game. It's much simpler than 270soft’s President Forever, which is now called President Infinity, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. President Infinity can feel bogged down; the game can sometimes feel like a chore, and little mistakes like barnstorming with low stamina in a key state can ruin you instantly (I’m looking at you, Ohio and Florida). TPM is quick and fun, but there are certain strategies which will assure victory on all but the highest of difficulty settings. After TPM 2012 came out, I was really hoping they would include primaries in this one, but I guess not. Where President Infinity is more realistic, TPM can be more fun. There’s no happy medium.\nIf you’re a political junkie or *gasp* want an insight into how elections break down, I’d say that this game is definitely worth the asking price. The past version saw a small free expansion pack released partway through its lifecycle which added in historical candidates like Richard Nixon… I mean… me. Whereas that hasn’t been confirmed for this release, I have seen Marco Rubio pick Abraham Lincoln (an unplayable character right now) as his running mate, so I assume it’s coming.\nPick it up and give it shot.","November 18, 2015","true","12.6"," 79 of 89 people (89%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","89","79","89","15","0"

And yes its early access, but really that does not mean that much, they’re going to add a few issues as they arise throughout the next year probably, and yes it does have the current political heavy weights, but that does not change the gameplay in any significant way.\nIt lacks depth, depth I’m sure the audience this game appeals to would not be turned off by. On top of that the game does not have primary debates, or presidential debates, the most exciting/significant aspect of the political season is simply omitted. Basically this game amounts to a low effort money generator for the developers.\n","November 25, 2015","false","18.8"," 75 of 90 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","75","90","5","0"

There are some UI differences and the issues and candidates have changed, but its still not recommendable at this point (particularly if you've played the previous games). One area its weakest on is on the answers republican candidates have during interviews. Republicans have plenty of talking points they could be repeating (however correct those points are) but instead they get stuck with answers that don't fit the candidate at all. Answers need to be written so that they fit the candidate saying them (even if they are stupid answers).\n\nOther areas they could have improved (but didn't) from the previous game include\n\n- Your Running Mate: Your running mate is still useless. They can't hold any rallies or do anything more than what they did in the last game (give you more awareness in their state).\n\n- Radio: They've actually outright removed this. But didn't bother to replace it with anything so now you just have newspapers (very cheap with limited outreach) and TV.\n\n- Internet/Social Media: There is no internet/social media component to the game. Even though this has played a huge part in this election.\n\nOverall it seems like Stardock only put the absolute minimum amount of effort required into this release.","November 21, 2015","false","3.6"," 58 of 67 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","58","67","0","0"

Actual gameplay additions.They basically just changed the year and canidates thats it same everything. The long time fans of this series have seen little to no change. The biggest disappointments which the community has been asking for are primaries and 3rd party runs also the ability to even create your own party as a third party and run. Those 2 little additions would of made this game so much more replay-able I've  only done one election so far and it felt the same unfortunately. Hopefully they end up adding third parties and primaries with an update when that happens I'll change my review and rate it 10/10! But as it stands it is a 6/10 but if you are a long time fan i wouldn't recommend this because of the lack of new features if you are new then give it a shot!

You have a higher chance of winning the game if you play as someone like Hillary or Bernie, while this is true in real life, it turns people off from playing as Republicans. The custom character customizer could also be better. The game is fun, but also lacks a lot of features such as debating. You also shouldn't be able to change you're politican of picks stances on the fly. For example, I could go into New York playing as Donald Trump saying that I support illegal immigration, but can then go into Texas and say I do not support illegal immigration without any consequences.

The only gameplay chnage is the consolidation of "radio" and "newspaper" ads into a single categry called "ground game," which is the only option for advertising besides television. Meanwhile, there are only about ten candidates to choose from on each side, almost all of whom are candidates actually running in 2016 (the exceptions are on the Democratic side: Bill Clinton, Al Franken, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren). This removes a major element of the fun of the games: the ahistorical match-ups. Could Barack Obama win a third term in 2016? Would Mitt Romney beat Hillary Clinton if he were running? This game can't answer these questions, though I assume it would have been easy to throw these characters in as well - they were already in previous games!\nThat brings us to the problems with the game. Historical Candidates are listed as a feature on the Wiki, yet I do not have the ability to choose to play as any of them. However, I have seen both Lincoln and Nixon selected by the computer player as running mates. What gives? Most egregiously of all, when I have played online multiplayer with a friend, the games appear not to have been synched properly. We both thought that mismatches in polling between games (he had D's winning Iowa 48-45, I had R's winning 52-44) were a feature, albiet a lazy one. However, the synchronization carried over into the actual results! The game listed the results for three different states on the end map as being wins for the Democrats (one a substantial win), yet the game colored the state red and counted it toward the Republican total. Furthermore, both the winning player and losing player were each told that they had won the popular vote, and each game had a completely different vote count.\nIn summary, this game clearly had little effort put into it, and I hope some free patches will be forthcoming to fix these issues. I would love to see patches re-adding the candidates from previous games as well, but that's just wishful thinking on my part.\n\nEDIT: The game is still in early access mode, so hopefully some of these features will be added and bugs will be tweaked before the finalized version.","January 16","false","6.9"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","40","47","0","0"

I'm impressed with how thorough and expansive this game is. I'm not here to criticize this, as in my almost 20 hours this week of this game I have only found one pressing issue. I just want to give some suggestions to potentially better the game. Pretty fantastic idea, having custom characters btw.\n\n1. Add the option for a third-party candidate.\nMaybe create a conglomeration of parties for this? Libertarian, Green, and normal Independent. This could add an interesting and fun alternative to the normal process.\n\n2. Add debates! This would add such a fun and potentially game-changing aspect to the election cycle. You could put the option on the game setup screen, where you could set the number of debates from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of say, 6?\n\n3. I don't know how practical it would be so this is a tentative suggestion. Maybe add an option for a three-way election? Pit all three parties (assuming you add a third party) against each other! Or two of one party against one of another! Or three people from the same party! Just a cool thought, if you couldn't implement it that's understandable.\n\n4. Make the point system for issues better. This is my one issue with the game. When creating a custom character, there are 20+ issues that you only have 100 points to spread over. Maybe lessen issues, or add more points, or make it require less points to strongly be for or against an issue. It's not game-ruining, but it can get a bit frustrating when trying to truly customize a character.\n\n5. This is to potentially help diversify gameplay even more. Maybe, when you get the option to randomize issue importance, have a customize option? I'd understand if you don't allow games with customized issue importance to go on leaderboards or something (too easy to tailor issues for you to win) but I think it would add a cool element to elections. For example, I made an Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis character and have been trying to randomize issues to include Ending Human Trafficking, BlackLivesMatter, and Confederate Flag Display, or issues related to the civil war. Obviously, with the depth of issues in the game it's nearly impossible to get the election centered around exactly what I want, and it made me think of adding that kind of option.\n\nSo that's it. I think this is an amazing game, and I'll be playing it a lot in the months to come. Hope my review and suggestions helped!\n\n9.5/10 stars from me","April 13","true","41.6"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","35","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/404620/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1183 products in account","The Political Machine 2016 is the fourth game in the series (the earlier three being The Political Machine, The Political Machine 2008, and The Political Machine 2012) and I'm sorry to say the game hasn't matured much, if at all, since it's original incarnation back in 2004.\n\nTPM2016 is a turn-based strategy game where you play a candidate running for the office of President of the United States. You can adjust the game's length, difficulty, and starting wealth, but assuming you're aiming to play a full run for POTUS, you're looking at 52 weeks (or turns) of gameplay.\n\nYou can choose from a mix of recent politicians (from both the Republican and Democrat parties) and even choose historical presidents, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt. You can also create your own character, which is nice since it allows you to tailor your candidate's political attributes, as opposed to using whatever was preset for real politicians.\n\nWhen creating your own politician, I would've liked the capability to choose "independent" as my party choice, instead of being stuck with either Democrat or Republican. Granted, someone from one of those two parties always wins, but part of the fun of video games is seeing what you can do, even if the end result is hardly realistic.\n\nWhile playing you can establish various offices, hire operatives (some of whom boost your own ratings and others who reduce your opponent's ratings), gain endorsements, have print or television ads made, and give speeches on numerous subjects. In addition to promoting your own platform, you can also attempt to discredit your opponent.\n\nYou might also gain some operatives (none of whom you could hire normally) through special events, and get invited on to TV shows. The news shows are parodies of real political talk shows and require you to answer questions within a set time limit.\n\nAs a light-hearted attempt to portray the mad rush of a presidential campaign, TPM2016 succeeds nicely. Unfortunately, that's where the game's positives end.\n\n1. The graphics are atrocious, although this has been a problem since TPM2008. All the characters look like deformed bobble head dolls. I realize that's to keep the overall theme jovial, but it ruins the immersion. This is made worse by the character creator being absolutely awful in how it integrates the characters, so instead of the game realizing that hair needs to adjust its height and depth based on head shape, the player has to do it all manually. It's tedious and completely unnecessary.\n\n2. Certain actions, like giving speeches, inexplicably fail after a while. At first your speeches will probably net you a small gain in state approval (something like 2% or so), but as time goes on, you'll get stuck at 0%, regardless of how much the voters agree with you.\n\n3. Certain operatives, like the Fixer (who is supposed to remove a targeted opposing candidate's operative in that state) doesn't work properly. The instructions say to left-click the Fixer and then right-click him on an opposing operative to remove him, but all it does is move the Fixer around. That's it.\n\n4. TPM2016 is very black or white in its approach. You're either a full-blown Republican or a die-hard Democrat. There's no room for anything in-between. Admittedly, politics in the US can be like this at times, but nobody is 100% one side or the other. Perhaps if an independent option were added this wouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, would I recommend The Political Machine 2016? If it were just a case of "I don't particularly care for the game's design," then I'd still vote yes, but it's more than that. The game seems broken in some ways, so I can't recommend a product that doesn't work like advertised. Maybe a few patches will be released and if that happens, I'll amend this review, but until that occurs, I'll have to say "no, I don't recommend it."","March 1","false","3.6"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","24","31","2","1"

Not bad.\n\nWeek 6: I got invited to go on The O'Malley Scenario. I went and I got a pretty good rating, which won me Wisconsin.\n\nWeek 8: I have almost got the entire Southeast in my back pocket. Week 7 I pretty much finished Central US.\n\nWeek 10: It's Running Mate time! I made a character some other guy who reviewed made (Polibot) so Credit to Him for that idea. But of course that is who I picked.\n\nWeek 11: All hell is breaking loose. New York is a battleground of Politics. Vermont, taken by me, Pennsylvania, taken by me (by one speech!). I have him surrounded. New York will be mine.\n\nWeek 15: It's been a while, but I got on 60 Seconds in week 13, it went really well. The whole Western US is mine. My power ever grows stronger, waiting to take New York.\n\nWeek 18: I've done it! I did it! New York is finally mine!... Oh wait what's that? I still have to take Hawaii, Michigan and West Virgina to clean sweep? Crap.\n\nWeek 21: Last week guys. I took West Virgina... However Bernie went to Michigan and gave a speech on Student Loan Reform and took it back right after I got it... if I say he was opposing it... Maybe I could take it back... OH... OH ♥♥♥♥ HAWAII! I've gotta get down there!\n\nWeek 21, Day 4: I am in Hawaii. Tomorrow I give a speech on how I oppose Securing the Borders... I hope this does it.\n\nWeek 21, Day 7: Tomorrow night is the Election.

Wish me luck... I will report back after this.\n\nDay after Election: I won! Woohoo! Alright.. it was really intense going through the states...

The game has a sliding scale for difficulty during single player games and also offers online multiplayer election battles. It's a tidy and fun little game about the election process and it's pretty fun considering the subject matter can at times be very boring.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nTime is of the essence – You can set the length of your games to be very quick or extremely long and drawn out. I really enjoy when I can play a quick game of something but also have the option to sit down for a lengthy campaign. This was one of the first things that I noted as a real plus since people with busy schedules can get a quick game in on a weeknight; but then spend a rainy weekend day playing a few hour campaign.\n\nTopical relevance – The topics in the game aren't thing's like "my opponent prefers orange juice and I am the apple juice candidate". They are "fighting ISIS" and "legalizing marijuana" or other very current hot button issues.  I found this to be refreshing as many developers stay away from any issue that might raise feathers. This covers the entire political gamut and seems like a relatively balanced and good set of reactions from each State and it's populous.\n\nEducation funding – It's a good thing to bring attention to the political process, as voter turnout is a real issue and most people are inherently sick of politicians in general. There isn't really a good one answer to most National problems. They are multi-lateral and require deep thought and consideration. That being said, anything that brings attention to the process is good and people participating in the elections of their leadership is a right more citizens should take advantage of. A game about that process is positive, this game is quite educational in terms of the basic process and overall understanding of electoral votes, and most of all, MONEY.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nVague plan – I know spending more time with the game would solve some of my planning woes but I felt like there was very little guidance in terms of a full plan based on what was happening on the map. That is one aspect where I felt there could be some improvement but ultimately playing the game more should lead to better results over time.\n\nRepeating myself – The best option was and continually seemed to be tlaking about fighting ISIS. The developers may have a keen sense of just how much fear seems to dictate behavior and more so seemingly in the U.S. This was an area where I felt torn because I want to win but don;t think that Bernie Sanders would use that to hammer home his point. The bit about taking on wall street and big corporations whom dodge taxes would be my platform for him but it seemed unavailable.\n\nSimulation games can often be boring or have aspects that are very mundane. I found The Political Machine 2016 to be very fun and fast paced especially considering the subject matter. I really enjoy that they game makes clear how important raising money is and how much time political candidates waste on just getting money to keep trying to be the next president. It's a solid experience and has some educational value. It's also pretty darn fun to run a political campaign with your candidate of choice or even yourself.\n\nScore: Buy it now","December 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

Below is a short PRO's and CON's with the game, as well as a tl:dr\n\nPROS:\n* Though satirical, the strategy is very deep\n* Cartoonish presentation is eye-pleasing\n* Character Creation\n* Great chance to Role Play as Trump/Sanders etc.\n* Playing on either political side feels different. You won't be exploiting the same political strategy as both a Republican and Democrat\n* Fun Multiplayer\n* Devs are adding additional characters to the game (eg. Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi) as well as new game features like Random Events\n* Able to randomise political issue importance, state wealth, voting power etc. = Great Replayability\n\nCONS:\n* UI Bugs (This review was published in the final days of early access so they may be gone by the time you read this)\n* Those who played TPM 2012 say this is a lazy reskin (I never played 2012 so cannot comment on that)\n* Inconsistent Difficulty for beginners- Bumping up the difficulty on games slightly (eg. Challenging -> Tough) can make the game very difficult\n\nThe Political Machine 2016 is a greatly enjoyable strategy/simulator of the trainwreck that is the Electoral College. Many of the negative reviews are from those who played the 2012 Political Machine where not much has changed in this version. Though this is lazy, the developers are adding new content in the form of updates. I reccomend the Political Machine 2016 for those who are new to TPM series and those who have an interest in basic US politics.\n\ntl:dr\nFun, strategic reskin of the Political Machine 2012.

I can't stress how annoying it is to play on normal and get my head shoved up my @ss everytime I play. Most of it is realistic, except for how the states play. When I'm playing a campaign, there are states in every election that will always basically vote for your party like Kansas for Republican. In the game, there is a constant need to drive attention away from the battleground states, just to save a state like Texas from ever falling to the Democrats. Really, I see what they are doing in trying to add diversity, but it takes away the feel from fighting neck to neck in a state like Ohio or Pennsylvania. Instead, we are given an AI that will always convince natural conservative states easily by visiting them once or twice. I just don't feel the need to campaign in Oklahoma to regain the vote when there are swing states I need to win. Also, the game lacks diversity in terms of creativity. There is a limited character creation process that only includes a small amount of features; as well as creating your own party or running as an independent. Yes, the game is $10 and it is pretty decent for $10, but the game doesn't have much to offer than running against an Democrat AI who can somehow win Texas even though they always vote conservative IRL with little campaigning. Basically, the game lacks some balance issues with the AI and how the function of the states play out as well as creativity. I wouldn't recommend this game to others, due to the fact that I'd rather pay an extra $10 or $20 for the game if it was improved upon compared to what it is now. I hope this was helpful in your guide for trying to recreate the 2016 Presidential Election.","February 19","false","13.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The art is suitably fun and light-hearted.  The game's mechanics are light as well, but they are more designed with a strategic game, rather than a more authentic political simulator.  Indeed, the game's mechaicnes are more ofo a generic strategy one on the gameboard of a USA map rather than a poltical one.\n\nNow havign said that, the game is still fine.  I've owned and played every iteration of the game.  I've never asked for my money back or anything.  And this time, there is an addition of multiplayer for those interested.\n\nBut the game's engine lacks a lot of depth, and more importantly, very little change.  The first version of the game had the same basic graphics, engine, concepts, and such.  You spend your time colelcting various currencies you can use for purchasing things.  Dollars and political capital can be spent for ads and endorsements as such.\n\n\nBut I'm going to leave the franchaise alone, barring major changes in the game of a deeper level.  I don't need a new skin every few eyars with a new group of candidates that are currently in teh news.\n\nLet me give you an example of one game mechanic that's simple, but could have been more.  Endorsements:\n\nIn this game there are 11 endorsements.  Ten are nromal, and one is a pseudo-endorsement to invest in your campaign structure that you can do later on after the ten are gone, so you won;t waste your points.\n\nFive endorsements are related to each party - Republican and Democrat.  If you have a Democrat candidate, then you have to spend double the capital to purchase a Republican affiliated endorsement, and vice versa.   A simple game develops where you race your opponent to collect endorsements, and try to get them first.  Simple mechanics result - you look at the map to figure out where the best endorsements will help you pull states, try to bring those in from your foe, and then hold serve on your own turf.  But the concept is very simple, pure strategy.  You could easily reskin the concept to anything else and it's have the same depth.\n\nBut you could flesh it out a lot more:\n\nTake Jim Webb as an example.  He's nnot a normal Democratic candidate.  He's pro-gun, and he was an Under Secretery of Defense under Reagan for 3 years and Secretary of the Navy under him for another.  However, in a debate, he stated that he was more "all lives matter" than "black lives matter".  So you could give him teh Republication bonus to pull the gun lobby, but give him teh Republication penalty to pull the minority/black lobby.\n\nAnd you could do this with others.  Ben Carson could be easier to grab the black/minority endorsement, Rand Paul the civil rights one, and so forth.  You could layer them in, and have more than just normal cost or double cost.  Maybe it's 50% harder for a Rand Paul to get the Christian Confederation, or perhaps Bernie Sanders needs a 2.5 cost for pulling the US Chamber of Business rather than the normal penalty.\n\nThat would help.\n\n\nAnd that's just one mechanic.  You could similar flesh out the others.  If this game had been really pushed between releases A(nd there's a lot of time between them, so that'd have been very likely) then you could have had a game that evolved with the times and was a real nice game today.  But nope.  It's the same game, but now with Donald Trump.  Does it have 3rd parties or Independant folk?  Nope.  Does it have debate mechanics where you can try to go after your opponent live?  Nope.\n\nHopefully you get the point.  It's a quick game that you can pick up in a few minutes, win on your first go through, win one or twice more, and then put it down and finish with, "Is that all there is?"\n\nYes, that's all there is.\n\n","February 15","false","2.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Good political simulators are rare to find, and Stardock's Political Machine series does a good job of creating a casual political simulator game that balances complexity, statistics-driven turn-based strategy, and fun.\n\nAs it is currently, I cannot give the game a positive review. For those who have not played any of The Political Machine games (specifically 2008 and 2012, as I have), this is a good game for you and you should check it out. For those of us who have played the previous Political Machine games, there is really nothing new here besides updated candidates and updated issues.\n\nThe gameplay and the gameplay mechanics are solid, and they have been since the inception of this series. For the price of a movie ticket, I know I personally will get at least several hours of enjoyment out of this over the next several months...

(In progress to add more topics in future dates of the development cycle)\n\nYou can create your own Candidate and go Head to Head battle against other Candidates, which has some cool comic figures in creation center.\n\nAlways wanted to see Hulk Hogan or Ronald Lee Ermey  as a president of United States , here you go in  the political machine 2016 you can make that dream come true.\n\nWhat about Texas? Why not painting it all blue? Annoy the hell out of the republicans and make a great home run? Well , you can do that in Political Machine 2016 .  It's all up to your skills go blue or go red :)\n\n\nGood Fun overall and challenging by increasing the difficulty or when able to play against others in multiplayer for sure.\n\nIf you want some laughs and laid back political arcade board game with less seriousness , then this is your game.\n\nEspecially when the multiplayer option comes, i can't imagine the laugh and hours of fun with a friend.","November 18, 2015","true","12.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I found myself desperately wanting and trying to convince myself to like the game. But, I didn't.  The gameplay is extremely redundant and tiring. I think the developer missed alot of wonderful opprotunities to insert funny political humor, puns, and comedic bits and pieces into the game. Everything about it just falls flat.\n\nAs a strategy game, it is extremely one dimensional. I didn't find any of the candidates to be particularly challenging or their personas even somewhat clever. This game as a whole just seems like a regurgitated rehash of previous Political Machine games. No thought or really any care went into making this. All that was done was new candidates added. All of which, are so bland and dry, you don't really care if you win or lose against them.\n\nThis is basically a regurgitated version of Political Machine 2012 with new "skins" aka the candidates.

Other than new candidates there is not much that is fresh and new about the game.  My main critique is that more nuances could be added to the actual campaigning process and less attention paid to how many different issues one could campaign on.  The endorsements seem to be almost non-consequential.  I feel like there should be more that have varying levels of effect and/or some that can be claimed by either party and have a positive effect for that candidate.  Further, the primary process and having independent candidates are a mainstay as what could be added.  Also, i'm on board with a presidental debate(s) which is a larger version of the interview questions.  Which leads me to my next point.  There needs to be some sort of way to see how the interview either hurts or helps the candidate.  Currently it just seems very abitrary.\n\nOn the positive side, the interface is much improved and there a fewer glitches in gameplay.  The game is always enjoyable but it needs some new, fresh, and innovative ideas to keep me wanting to buy future versions.  Since the game only has to be refreshed every 4 years, it doesn't seem like it would be hard to add new features and tweak things.","November 27, 2015","true","26.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

DLC would also sell very well, in my opinion. Imagine the opportunities for timely, relevant DLC during a real-life election cycle. Maybe there aren't enough customers, but perhaps new players could be drawn to play a full-fledged election simulation with The Donald as the star. I am sure there are factors to which I am not privy, but it seems like a good idea from the player's point of view.

The new update of candidates is great - any game which allows for you to beat Trump as Nancy Pelosi is definitely a must buy.\n\nThere are, however, a few recommendations to make it even better:\n\n1. Third Party Candidates/Parties/Run as Independent. This is spoke about quite a bit and would fully transform the game. It would obviously be brilliant as you wouldn't be forced into just a two party route, but more importantly it would be great online. Currently, it is far easier for Democrats to win than Republicans, which is not great for multiplayer as one person has a lot more good candidates to choose from than the other. This leads to point No.2...\n\n2. More Candidates! Now there has just been a great update, but the GOP side is still fairly weak (probably due to the necessary inclusion of the many 2016 candidates). Ideally there should be more ex-Presidents and ex-Presidential candidates from the past and far past, but really just some C20th ones will do e.g The Bushes, Reagan, Nixon, JFK, FDR. Maybe even include some First Ladies or notable VPs in there too, it would definitely add more range and keep the game dynamic.\n\n3. Set the Agenda. Now whilst this is a 2016 simulator, it would be great if you could set which issues you wanted to be the most important in the election (this would also help remove the bias against the GOP, as the Dems do far greater with Independents on issues such as Gay Marriage and Marijuana). Also, this would be great to simulate PAST elections (e.g Bush vs Gore, Obama vs McCain), which would be extremely fun and great for online play.\n\n4. Music. This is a minor issue, but sometimes the music loops poorly or barely loops at all.\n\n5. Workshop? Not as necessary as the ones above but the addition of the Workshop would be great to share Custom Candidates with other people. For example, fictional Presidents such as F.Underwood or real political figures that the creators of the game might not have time to make but the players could share. in fact, this could actually solve the need to spend time making new candidates all the time when really the public could make them.\n\nAt the end of the day it's a great time and none of the above issues will stop me from playing it, they would just take it over the edge and turn it into an even greater game.

A fantastic addictive game for the money.  Money well spent.  I am perhaps bias here as I like watching the political intrigue unfold in the media.  If you're half interested in politics, strategy and seeing what it takes to run a campaign across one of the biggest countries in the World, get this game!\n\nLooking forward to getting the achievements in this one, I only wish they had trade cards too.\n\nPositives - fun, addictive, some detailed strategy, all top politicians of 2016 represented, good selection of characters available including presidential candidates, running mates, helpers - PR support, speech writers, political activists, story tellers etc., you can gain support of lobby groups for bonuses (tea party, gun lobby, environmentalists, etc).  A good selection of campaign buildings to build and develop in strategic locations. You can go on TV.  Game made me laugh in the interviews at some of the responses you can put.  My partner wondered why I was chuckling!  Not many games can achieve this for the right reasons.\n\nNegatives - very few for me.  Perhaps game is bias to republicans on the first try through as Trump won way too easily in my view.  But you can randomise the states opinions. I'm not sure if I can bring myself to play as Hilary.  Perhaps next I'll make up my own avatar :) .  And NO TRADE CARDS - Big negative for me.

What with the whole Donald Trump scandal of last week, the game is becoming increasingly on-topic. Trump’s brutish and brash approach has shaken up the contest for the Republican nomination, and Bernie Sanders is doing a similar thing for the Democrats, by bringing the lingo of socialism back into US politics for the first time in decades. Next year’s election could be one of the most interesting we’ve ever seen.\n\nIndeed, The Political Machine 2016 features most of the candidates on both sides, including Bernie Sanders and the now infamous Donald Trump, plus a few extra. Alternatively, you can create your own candidate – there’s a decent bit of variety in terms of customising your character with hats, hair and accessories. Having chosen your candidate as well as your opponent, it’s time to set out on the campaign trail.\n\nThe game begins with a handful of states leaning towards either the Republicans or Democrats, although most states are still undecided, and thus up for grabs. The player travels across a map of the US, using political speeches and advertising to convince the population to vote for them. Speeches are cheap, but use up a candidate’s stamina quickly; advertising expends less stamina, but costs more money in the long term. Building campaign offices in each state can ensure a steady flow income, or can provide points each turn that can be spent on endorsements, which earn a nationwide boost for your campaign, or operatives.\n\nOperatives come in all shapes and sizes, and perform all manner of tasks. For example, a spin doctor will improve your ratings within a state, while a consultant will boost awareness of your campaign. Alternatively, you can use operatives to actively derail your opponent’s campaign. For example, an intimidator reduces awareness of their campaign within a state, while a fixer will remove an operative working for the other side.\n\nEach campaign lasts for a set number of turns, and at the very end the votes are counted, and whichever candidate has gained the most electors wins, becoming president-elect. The most exciting part of the game comes when the results are announced, and you get to watch each state turn either blue or red.","February 20","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

As an example, say you're in Oregon, and you're a Democrat, but most of the population is Republican. While it might seem like a good idea to reduce gas prices because that benefits Democrat and Independant leaning voters, it is actually a much better idea to increase gas prices, a more Republican leaning option, as the Republican leaning voters will say "Hey, these Democrat guys are actually pretty cool!" and decide to become Democrat leaning voters.\nOn an unrelated note, it is a sad, sad day for the world when Donald Trump becomes president (Good bye, Russia, China, South America, Canada, Africa, UK, Germany, Korea, and Japan.

I love politics, and this is a great way to see how broken the election system really is. I spent my first few playthroughs as Dems, and my last few grinding out a few achievements.\nPretty good game, but there are a few things I would love to see implemented\n\n1) More points for choosing issues depending on difficulty levels. If I'm playing on cakewalk I get the same amount of points to spend as if Im playing on the hardest difficulty setting. Maybe adding in a setting when building your candidate that may effect polling or something, but I would like to have more points to put into issues.\n\n2) Primaries. This may be coming or not, but it would be something I would love to see. The election by itself is great, but since we are in the primary stages right now I would love to run my candidate against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and see if I can win in the primaries, and then go up against Trump or Carson or whoever won the Republican primaries.\n\nThose were my main 2 issues with the game, the second one more than the first one. The first one is just an annoyance thing for me, because I spend all my points early and then I dont get to put as much into things I like, I usually end up with + or -10 on each issue. Overall a great game, would highly recommend for anybody who likes politics and hasn't played one of these games before.","November 28, 2015","true","28.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/titothemidget/recommended/404620/","titothemidget","Tito The Midget","http://steamcommunity.com/id/titothemidget/","132 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is fun and humorous, but also pretty basic at the moment. Given that it's Early Access, I expect more features to be implemented. I know multiplayer is on the horizon, and it seems like it'd be a fun way to kill an hour or two with a friend, since it has a board game type of feel to it.\n\nMy wishlist for the full version:\n\n1. Some sort of primary season. It's probably a lot of work to incorporate the full primaries, but I think having some sort of national debates that behave similarly to the way the game handles media interviews would add another layer of fun to it. Maybe break it down into "Early Primary States," "Super Tuesday" and "The rest of the primary season" as a way to avoid feeling dragged out. I just think it'd be fun to have to simulate a campaign against the other members of your party, then shift back to the center to win a general election. And really, the primaries are where candidates say the most outrageous things anyway.\n\n2. Related to the above, debates. The debates are among the most attention-grabbing parts of Presidential campaigns, but they're omitted entirely from this game.\n\n3. Slightly more interactive fundraisers. Right now, you just click "fundraise" and get some cash in your campaign. Something as simple as selecting "Exclusive VIP fundraiser," "grassroots fundraiser," etc. and then selecting the target demographic to make fundraising more dynamic than just "Go to California if you're a Democrat, go to Texas if you're a Republican, click the button and get money." At the moment it just feels more like a stamina bottleneck than a real mechanic.\n\n4. The ability to raise issues from your platform. Right now, you can only give speeches and create ads about the issues that are important to the state you're in. You start out with access to just the state's top 5 issues, and then that gradually expands as you build awareness and campaign infrastructure. It makes sense, but it also doesn't allow much of an opportunity to introduce niche issues to the campaign. In real life, Donald Trump made immigration a major issue, Bernie Sanders made income inequality a major issue, etc. In the game, if your candidate has a more niche issue in their platform you'll probably never get to actually give a speech or make an ad about it. If I want to create a candidate with "fixing infrastructure" as their main issue, it should be an uphill battle to make people care about that issue while my opponent is talking about things like Obamacare and unemployment, but in the current framework of the game it's virtually impossible to even talk about the issue until the very late game when you're not going to be able to build your campaign on it. Some of the issues that never come up aren't even particularly niche - things like global warming, Planned Parenthood/abortion rights and fighting ISIS rarely come up, but they're major issues of this campaign season.\n\n5. The ability to have your running mate do something. Right now, you just stash them in a state and they provide an awareness boost, basically making them just a beefed up consultant. Given that, choosing a running mate is pretty meaningless. In real life, running mates are used to balance the ticket - a more hardline candidate chooses a moderate running mate, a more moderate candidate chooses a hardline running mate, etc. A running mate should be a meaningful choice, and they should be able to bring some kind of boost to your campaign.","November 28, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's not a whole lot you can change in the series, though I think that the bobble heads are a bit worn out now, and there could have been better graphics in the design of your own candidate.  It's a bit cartoony the way it is... but it is what it is.\n\nI played 4 short games of 26 week turns.  I played them pretty much the same way to see what sort of results I would get.  3 of the games I ran as Republican and lost all 3 games by slim margins.  When I played the game as a Democrat it seemed to me that the states fell in line with the Democrats much more easily, i.e., the states would react more positively to a speech by the Democrat than by a Republican.\n\nKnowing how the electoral votes works is key, and you can of course campaign the big states of California, Texas, Florida and New York and then work some of the mid-west and southern votes.  Hawaii and Alaska are pretty much swing states, and it would not make much difference.\n\nA longer game could allow you to do better in terms of election, because with just 26 week turns you can only have enough time to focus on the larger states, and that's probably why the swing was more in favor of Democrats, so I will likely play longer games to see if longer strategies work better.\n\nOverall it is a fun game and worth the $20.  It would be great to see better graphics of the map and especially the candidates, perhaps be able to re-play in other past election years, create new parties would be an awesome improvement so you can run as Independent, Tea Party, Green or just make one up.  Lastly, I wish there was some way to add more issues to the game, and create a different political environment.  Perhaps an editor???   And it would be great to have a version that plays not the final election but getting the parties nomination with primaries, and other such features... IF that could happen you would have a truly awesome game, though now I'd give it a 6 out of 10.","February 13","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also you can make your own canidate, thats really good considering many people probs dont like the canidates we currently have. Its worth the 10 dollars, trust me. Hang on cat needs food................................................... ok sorry bout that. Anyway its worth 10 bucks. Its the funnest experience ive had in a while. Playing with friends and their wacky characters is the best. Even if you're playin with a random person. In conclusion its an amazing game so buy it.

On sale for two bucks and fifty cents, I couldn't resist goosing the economy and picking it up. For that price it is a fun little game.\n\nIt is a turn based strategy game where you pick from existing candidates who are represented by bobble head dolls or create your own candidate. Once in the game you are presented with a map of the 50 states that shows the states who are locks for one party as either blue or red and the states still in play as grey. You can easily filter the map to show rich states for fund raising or take a look at the map by electoral college votes. Your candidates move between the states launching ads, giving speeches or establishing campaign headquarters.\n\nThe headquarters are interesting as they come in three types. The traditional one is good for fundraising and increasing awareness of your candidate. The other types give you currency to get endorsements from say the gun lobby or operatives who can increase the effectiveness of your speeches or your advertising.\n\nThere are also random events that can hurt or help your campaign. The most interesting of these is the chance to appear on national TV shows and answer two questions. The biggest missing item are any form of debate between the candidates and independent candidates. Still it is fun this time of year to pick from the various bobble headed candidates and try to win the voters over to your side.\n\nQuick, clever and fun this is a nice cheap game for those who like politics and light strategy.\n\nRating: B-","February 17","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

He started out a strong ability to command birds and racist white old men (the real 1%). From there, the political career was a piece of cake.

That was me two weeks ago.\n\nThe Political Machine 2016 is definitely a novelty for the politically inclined. In the game you have the option of living out a political fantasy to run for President or you want to see how your candidate fairs against opponents with you as ytheir mastermind, or you just like simple simulators. It is no doubt with the selection of candidates to choose from and create that you have a multitude of ways to play the game.\n\nThe game works by choosing your candidate and who they are matched up against. You have the option to randomize populations and issue importance as well as set the pace of the game and dictate starting funds. The beginning of the game starts wit ha rush to score endorsements then transistions to building up funds and political capital (which allows you to buy cronies that can affect yours and your opponents ratings in a state as well as cut advertising and gain awareness). Then you use a strategy of setting headquarters and making ads as you go across the US winning states favors.\n\nTo gain the support of the public you have to talk about the issues with the five starting issues being centered around the perceived importance (by the devs) from the state. To expand your talking points you have to lay down a headquarters in the state. You can run advertisements on if you favor/oppose or if your opponent favors/opposes the topic to sway opinion. The more you talk about an issue in the state, the more important it can become.\n\nTypically, the candidate who has the most votes, wins the game.\n\nSo where are the games faults? For right now it would have to be a lack of features that could make it a truly interesting and engrossing sim.\n\nFeatures that should be added:\nDebates\nPrimary Season\nRandom Events that Dictate Public Opinion on Topics\nA main issue thats available to a candidate for each state (Bernie Sanders - Income Inequality, Donald Trump - Immigration)\nMore varied questions during talk shows\nDifferent types of talk shows\nSteam Workshop\n\nOverall, I think its a decent game worth the $10 you pay for it. It is a bit lacking in features but I have put 10+ hours into it and will probably play out my Bernie Sanders campaign fantasies until the election is over.\n\nFeel free to add me for a try on multiplayer if you can't find someone.","December 16, 2015","true","16.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Want to be a strong proponent of the military?  Well, that's all you'll be because you use your points up and that one topic. Which leaves you with "no opinion" in every other category.   You might have enough points to feel strongly one way or the other for one more issue, out of the dozens that are left.\n\nThat's the essential game mechanic and it's poorly done.\n\nWant endorsements?  You build up political capital and then "choose" an endorsement.  So, while running against Hillary Clinton. I watched her get the "Pro-gun," and "tea party" endorsements.  Even if I could figure how to build an outreach center (which you need to get endorsements), that's just so unvbelievable it's laughable that she would get those endorsements.\n\nThe "tutorial" is just a book of directions in tiny font letters.\n\nOut of 10, I would probably give this game a two.","February 11","false","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, I was very interested in this game when I first heard about it. I thought, "Oh wow! A simulator of the road to becoming president! That sounds fun!" Well, it really wasn't.\n\nThe game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, I carried on to see what I could do.\n\nI will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally.\n\nIn the game, it gives you certain issues to deal with, which are understandable, and you decided how you feel about them. This part was ok.\n\nAn issue, however, was that it's a 1v1. There are only two competitors, 1 republican, 1 democrat. There was no mention of having multiple campaigners at the same time.\n\nAnother issue was something probably not intended, many times I experienced bugs which disabled me from continuing my turn, requiring me to leave the game and then reenter in order to continue.\n\nAnd the last and final issue: the game just doesn't seem that interesting. Sure, I bet some people love it. Myself, I could only contain my excitement for one game. After that, it's easy to lose interest.\n\nIt is notable that I may be a LITTLE biased because I lost the election by electoral vote, not popular vote, to Hillary Clinton (Screw you Hillary) because of California (you too, California, you traitor) which switched on me at the last minute, but all in all, I don't recommend this game. If you enjoy it, sure, go ahead and do so. Just beware those purple states. Those will hit you hardest.\n\nDon't buy this game, it's not worth it in my opinion. Use that $10 on what's really important:\nBuying electoral votes.","March 15","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would also like to see head to head debates, and a third party option on the ballot for the general election. I would like a third party option to play as, as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donniepcgames/recommended/404620/","donniepcgames","Beach Head","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donniepcgames/","130 products in account","The game is a lot of fun. You can be Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, Chris Cristie, Ben Carson, among many other modern popular candidates. You can also create your own candidate, which can be interesting, if there is anyone who you ever thought should be president it can be fun.\n\nThe game is lacking one thing, which I hope comes in the future. That is a primary system where you have to win the nomination for your party. This would give the game more depth. I would also like to see head to head debates, and a third party option on the ballot for the general election. I would like a third party option to play as, as well. It would be fun to try alternatives.\n\nThis is a really fun game, completely worth the price it is being sold for. You should check it out. Even if you do not like politics, it can be amusing trying to win over states and traveling around.","March 23","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Give option to run as a third party candidate. This would completely change the dynamic of the game and could potentially make it even more competitive.\n\n2. PLEASE ADD A PRIMARY MODE. It would be so fun to take your candidate throught the primaries and then eventually to the general election if you win. It would add more playing time a more of a randomization aspect to how the game plays out. If you were just to have a simple delegate system that would work in a certain way to where certain states are proportional and some winner take all or just make it all winner take all.\n\n3. Workshop support would make this game better because people could possibly come up with different maps or add custom candidates to the workshop.\n\nOverall its a really fun game if you like politics and live in America.

You can make yourself like Donald Trump, or a super-mecha-death-Christ. The problem with it is, you can't customize your party. You can only choose either Republican or Democratic. Even candidates who are 3rd party that art running are shushed into other parties. For example, Gary Johnson, the front runner for the Libertarian party, is a Republic candidate.  Gary Hasn't been part of the Republican party since 2011.","May 12","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are alot of things wrong with this game, but more things that are better. Overall, this game I think is worth the $10 price and is overall pretty enjoyable. I just hope for next time, we could have third parties and debates. However, the custom candidate maker is pretty cool. Just for those looking to get all the achievements, there is one achievement that you have to win the game on real life's election day. So you have to wait a while in order to get that achievement. Anyway, I reccommend this game to an American gamer because of its large amount of candidates and candidate maker as well as a simple yet fun game for the race to the white house\n9/10","May 22","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
