From the main menu you're already being put at a slight bit of unease from the sounds; once you get into the game things are both eerily calm; yet will with a sense of dread.\n\nI simply cannot praise the great atmosphere enough. The games have never been about action, or junk scares. Instead you set off as an agent to always solve the strangest and most mysterious of cases. As such the game might seem slow paced, and it certainly takes some time to get into the thick of things.\nDespite that though, they never disappoint, it always feels like you're playing the paranormal version of the X-Files. You're on edge, surrounded by the complete unknown, and seemingly impossible at times; and yet you need to keep going forward to try and find the truth.\n\nIn a strange sense, it's almost like a Point n Click adventure, but that's a gross generalisation. Sure you need to find clues, and items to aid you; and you do spend a heck of a lot of time simply looking at everything and trying to see if you can interact with it. But that's simply because as an investigator you Have to, how else will you find out just what's afoot.\n\nHere and there you find notes and files, and the narration for these are simply well done. The voice actor chosen does a great job, and certainly fits with the surroundings and feel the game goes for.\n\nAlso it won't be a horror game without some heart pumping moments, and while some are a little jump scary ( namely the flashbacks/projections ), the game does well at making things feel more urgent and tenser as you delve in deeper.\n\nQuite early on you meet a rather nasty creature. It's just lying there, and due to the music and ambient sounds it's simple twitching and later movements certainly gave me a little start.\n\nWithout those it would have had little effect.\n\nThe story is very interesting, as all the Doorways games I've played are. If you do like things similar to the X-Files, and like a slow to moderately paced horror mystery game this is certainly a game, and series you should not miss out on.\n\nPC Gameplay of the start\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IUhnccwyN8","August 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

Lack of breasts aside, the perversely tragic story of the Torres family is incredible, and incredibly disturbing. A dark, frequently unnerving and occasionally terrifying environment serves as it's perfect match. Doorways has an excellent concept and offers plenty of e̶n̶t̶e̶r̶t̶a̶i̶n̶m̶e̶n̶t̶ heart stopping, panic stricken moments. Everything from the atmosphere, graphics, and puzzles are great. The story is disturbing and unpredictable.

After playing through a bit of the game by myself I started playing in tandem with a friend and we both more stumbled our way through solutions to the crazy puzzles(?) and survived encounters more by accident than on purpose. The end encounter particularly was a bit silly as your survival really depends more on your means than your solution. The important question: "Was I scared?" Oh yes. Several, several times and the atmosphere was in places well done. The design overall was remarkably a bit too dark, possibly, but that, I imagine, is more a preference. Ultimately I bought this game well understanding it was early access and for the decent price and the updates to come if you understand the circumstances it's worth an experience - just make an educated purchase.","October 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

I'm pointing this out because Steam doesn't reflect the amount of time that I've actually put into this game.\n\nUnlike a lot of the indie horror games hittting Steam these days, this is done by a real studio. The graphics and mechanics are very solid (especially considering it's early access), and I personally haven't run into any bugs yet. It could stand to be a little better optimized, but I'm sure that will come.  Also, the voice acting when reading letters and such is very polished.\n\nThe story itself is fairly deep and interesting, but you have to go after it yourself. In other words, you need to pay attention to the notes and things that you find in the game.  It's not all handed to you in cutscenes.  Think Amnesia or Outlast.\n\nThe animations and sound design is good.  The atmosphere is definitely scary.  What jumpscares there are (there aren't that many) are very well done, and the enemies are quite creepy.\n\nIf I have any complaints at this point, I would say that the interface is a little clunky, though that may be improved through the early access period, and there is one point in particular where you have no opportunity to see the enemy approaching.  Again, that is something that can be addressed.  Also, the autosave feature is pretty robust so even when you die you don't have to go back that far.\n\nAll in all, I would say this is a very good game if, like me, you are a fan of good horror.\n\n","August 20, 2015","true","1.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

I know this because as I enter some buildings my ability to control the character is reduced as I'm forced to listen to something. which is really quite annoying, though is something quite usual in horror games for some reason. any chance of an "Immersive" story is immediatly taken away at this point. the town splits off into a few different sections, which quietly attribute to the thought of being in someone's mind in their own little way. quite a difficult thing to pull off.\n\nthe game really begins once you've reached the school and you meet the monster, or at least the first one that will appear in this title. the introduction to the monster is done horribly, it's something that will only appear in darkness to attack you, but first appears half basked in the light which lead me to quite a bit of confusion until I figured out how this monster opperates exactly. immediatly it would have been better to have this monster appear in the players vision in darkness, only for it to disapear when some light randomly turns on. from here on out it's "be afraid of the spooky scary dark" as the player goes through several different light puzzles in order to safely navagiate a room.\n\nINCOMING SPOILERS:\n\nthe final nail in the coffin comes from the fact that the school itself is, well, a school for schoolchildren. whereas the final sequence involves a lot of dismembered adult body parts strewn around everywhere and the player running through many racks of cages with adults slamming on the bars as a spooky darkness approaches. did the school change to a high school or college at some point? is this really how they advertise their early access product with such an inaccuracy? this is proof of concept stuff right here, not anything which actually indicates any amount of development, usually I would overlook something like this given that it is early access, but... the assets used look as if they were placed there to stay there, with no intention of changing it later\n\nthere are many things about this game that show promise. the animations are great, art is great, modeling is great, sound is not the greatest but is definetly at a level I would call highly passable, but it looks as if the designer is quite heavily asleep at the wheel and has little concept of what horror is or how to actually implement it.\n\nmaybe I'm wrong and this game will turn out great, but initial impressions aren't great.","December 3, 2015","false","1.7"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","1"

This is the last episode of the game series.  Besides that it's the last episode, the game follows up with a deep and horrorfying ACT, that scares you to bones since you have to face the darkness and evilness that hunts the school. There is objects to find to get pass different levels of the game, aswell for notes to follow up on the storyline.\n\nThe monster is incredible creepy with the games current atmosphere of abandoned and destryoed school, which, makes my hearth beat too fast till i can play more than 45 min at a time. (I still have pain in my chest while writing this review). Besides wet pants and a sensitive hearth beating, the game lets you face the evil before moving on.

For a low-budget horror game, it was basically flawless.\n\nIts sequel, Underworld, threw away every ounce of ingenuity and decided to copy all the other horror games - we had a bunch of Slenderman-esque chaser sequences and that nightmare 'maze' which might go down as some of the worst game design I've ever suffered.\n\nUnfortunately Saibot just ignored any critical comments from those who'd been disappointed by the sequel, and provided no support or answers.\n\nErgo I was wary about going anywhere near them for Holy Mountains of Flesh, especially after the early access version had been merely 'ok' and had failed to actually follow on from the previous game at all.\n\nI needn't have worried - I took the risk on this, needing something new to play, and so far it has erased the memory of Underworld, and while not quite reaching the heights of the original, comes pretty close.\n\nOnce again you are private investigator Thomas Foster (brilliantly voiced I have to say) of the psychic detective agency Doorways, and once again you are in the mind of serial killers to find out what really happened. Sort of - that part of the original game doesn't seem as well fleshed out (pun not intended) and you don't really feel like you are in their mind now, but more an observer looking into some parallel dimension where these crimes and their echos still exist.\n\nBut the horror, feel, look, and general psychological immerson from the original games is back, and while you will rarely be terrified here, you will find yourself engaged. Everything Underworld got wrong is erased here, and there are some really good moments in this, with the feel of the mountainous village of hell really working well - you feel like you're in a hell, and it's intense.\n\nI have not finished the whole game, but thus far I'm pretty impressed by what I'm seeing here.\n\nSaibot's customer care could be a lot better, and their consistency is lacking, but when they get it right, it really is worth your time.","May 4","true","5.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

That's great, Latin America needs more game developing in general.\n\n**You can change mouse sensitivity and turn off smoothing in the controls.**\n\nI haven't played much and I don't have much experience with horror games, so I'll stick with the overall experience.\n\n- I don't know why, I liked the intro menu? The colors of the cave/hole are nicely balanced.\n- Well as for the story I may try to grasp it sometime but it's very alien to me. It sounds interesting nevertheless. Looks like there are 3 other games, I'm not sure if they are heavily connected.\n- The hell scenery was nicely done. Very very organic, good use of texture maps. But performance-wise is disappointing. Not sure whose fault is, but I'm getting frequent (and I do mean it when I say frequent) fps drops to 30-40 either when I'm on Medium or Very High quality. I was starting to feel dizzy.\n- When crossing a gap with one of those floating stones the game purposefuly changed my view so I could look to the other side and see where I was previously falling into the lava. I'd rather have the game not doing this. Bring attention to the player, be it with an explosion that illuminates ahead, a strong sound effect, or both. Anything that makes me curious to want to look back.\n- While I didn't see enemies, I did enjoy the... ghost flashbacks? Kudos to whoever recorded the audio, It really felt that it was in the same ambient. Correct echo, correct direction. Bullseye. It gave me shivers.\n- There's a gate that I don't know how to get across. There are no instructions whatsoever. Most doors are locked anyways.\n- A mouse cursor is really lacking when I pause. I get that this game is controller optimized but I really don't know how to play FPS on a controller. But that's just me. Actually a way to know where I'm aiming would be nice. But if disorientation is a principle for this game, it's fine. (no I'm not being ironic)\n\nThat's it for now, I'll update if and when I get to know more of this game. Thumbs up, looks like it wants to be something.","November 14, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It`s still early access, so there isn`t too much content. Act1 has a playing time of ~ 2 hours depending on gameplay style. But what you can see in this game will already make you want more. Personally I think the atmosphere is better than chapter 1 + 2, but Underworld is the best part of the Doorways chapters by now.\n\nI have also noticed two negative things, one of it is a bug:\n\nFirst, the game is extremely dark.  Increasing the brightness to higher levels will only influence the lights, while very dark areas remain dark out. The lighting conditions at the transition from outdoor areas <-> indoors isn`t fluently enough.\n\nThe Bug:\n\nAt the very end of act 1, there is a door that can no longer be activated after your first death in this sequence (the latch does no longer lights up). Says: autosave was created (indicated by short flickering of the screen), you play the sequence and die, after that no matter how often you load the autosave, the door is no longer usable. To fix the problem, you have to exit to the main menu and  reload the autosave from there.\n\nI can recommend the game because it shows potential and I think it could deliver what is promised by the developer.","August 20, 2015","true","8.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","2"

And this is the first Doorways game series that I'd play.\n\nDoorways: Holy Mountains of Flesh is First Person Horror Adventure games. And for an early access games, this game is good so far. One thing that I like, this game is more focused on Psychological Horror with a good story. It is different, when most of horror games focused on jump scares or eerie atmosphere to scare the players. And one thing I didn't like in this game is the whole area is too dark. Maybe in next update the dev can fix this in graphic setting.\n\nSo, this game has a promise to get better game when it had a full release.

Unfortunately after I finished it I discovered it was the 4th one in the series! lol Woops! Anyway, on to the review.\n\nAs I said, it's a strong game. It has amazing atmosphere and a pretty good story to go along with it. There were a few parts I really dreaded going in to (especially when you figure out the gimick of the monster) and that's part of what makes a horror game exciting.\n\nThat being said, as it sits right now, there are a few puzzles that are vague or have parts that seem like they should work right away but don't actually work except in a certain order. The game is also way too dark in some parts to see what you're doing or see where you're supposed to go.

It was refreshing to have a latinoamerican setting since this side of the planet has plenty to offer in gruesome legends and sheer horror. The english voiceover, however, felt a bit forced and artificial so that could use a little polishing. Although the game's graphics seem outdated, they do not affect the immersion which soon after you start playing will have you searching every room of the withered building in search for clues while something else might be looking for you.\n\nOn an age where Adventure games are struggling to make themselves a room in the videogame industry games like these are always welcomed by the likes of me, whom are looking for compelling stories and challenges to the mind and why not, sanity as well.\n\nIt may not be for everyone, but for those seeking adventure where the rest look away this chapter may be just what you are craving for.","September 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I can't find the Dagger at all or the other items you need to open the first door. So I'll give a review of my first impressions of the Early Access version of the game.\n\nIt took me a while before I figured out how to make the video actually work for me. At first it was going at 25fps but now I've got it going at a solid 60fps, most of the time. Whenever I walk into a building it seems like the game has to load the new rooms, because it freezes for a second and then lets me move again, it's only a minor annoyance but it happens at each new building. And the framerate drops significantly in tight areas, not to mention the game gave me hell (no pun intended) just to get the video to run so I wouldn't have flashing lights on the borders.\n\nBut this still doesn't matter when everybody else seems to playing a different game. They start out in some sort of building when I start out in the town, I don't know if this is a glitch in the game but it's something you should really fix as soon a possible because it makes looking up a walkthrough or expriencing the game to it's fullest much harder to do.\n\nSo right now I will not be recommending this game. Once they've fixed it, or finished it I'd suggest it, but not now.","October 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Sure, the atmosphere is great, especially at the end, but the setting looks bland most of the time (despite the devs changing to a better engine) and I found the monster to be more annoying than scary.\n\nThe first time I saw it in the shadows, it seemed to be promising. And it certainly looks better than the actual setting. But then I got killed ... and killed ... and killed. And then it wasn't scary anymore. Sure, it took me a while to notice that I had to go somewhere else first, as neither running nor sneaking could get me past, but every single time you encounter the creature, it always does exactly the same thing. Except for at the end, that is.\n\nI also would have preferred the more linear nature of the previous installments, especially since it isn't always clear what you need to do next. There was a room I needed to light up, but since the game is really dark (and seems to fade out distant light sources, which might seem neat but annoyed me more than anything), I didn't even notice the cord I needed to plug in for quite a while. And then you need to climb towards a ventilation shaft, which should be easy ... if not for dozens of small objects that act like waist high fences and won't let you jump onto them (the worst of which can be found in a room full of benches that might as well be walls). And neither can you pull yourself onto the object that needs to be climbed ... despite the character then pulling himself into the ventilation shaft.\n\nChanging how the monster acts, or at least adding some variety, could certainly improve how I see the game. But if it keeps on doing exactly the same thing in every subsequent act, I'd rather not continue playing, as the atmosphere alone is not enough to keep my interest. And neither is what little I've seen of the story thus far.","August 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

"Doorway: Holy Mountains of Flesh" doesn't offer anything new in terms of mechanics. Its your typical linear horror aventure where you walk through an area and figuring out where to go next. I wouldn't really call them puzzles, but rather finidng out how to move forward to the next section.\n\nWhile I haven't experienced the previous Doorway series Doorways Holy Mountains of Flesh by itself isn't anything that I would find memorable. It's not to say its a bad game just isn't anything people haven't already experienced in these horror type adventure games.\n\nThe gameplay for some reason is extremely lagging and choppy. I was able to max the resolution on all the other horror games and Doorways: Holy mountains of Flesh was the only game that lagged sometimes making it game unplayable.\n\nSo, the verdict is if you're able to get it at a discounted price like I did 50% off, it yields decent atomsphere like most of the other review suggest as your exploring. Its not scary by any means even though I think the developers added a few jump scares however they were by no means scary in my opinion after playing some of the other horror games.\n\nIf your looking for something new in terms of mechanics this game isn't it. If your just looking to pass some time and enjoy the decent atomsphere at a bargain price. Sure, well worth the $4.99 early access.\n","December 21, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now would I buy this title at full price? well I never buy anything full price but if I had the money I would of.\n\n10/10","November 13, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not very far in.. but it just seems puzzly. I was waiting to be scared out of my ****ing mind right off and was kinda disappointed.. I hope if I play more I won't be disappointed. Nothing scares me anymore. I mostly play horror titles/watch horror movies.. so I have high hopes for this.","November 14, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
