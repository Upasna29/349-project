"http://steamcommunity.com/id/superbunnyfromcomics/recommended/61520/","superbunnyfromcomics","Grunkle Stan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/superbunnyfromcomics/","171 products in account","One of the best strategy games of all times if not the best. A turn based game that is nearly perfect at all levels. The game conquered my heart with its great ambiances and environments, magical songs, beautifully animated 2D units, great scenario, original playable races, badass characters, well-made dialogs and difficulty level. I consider this as the hardest strategy game that I have played. Custom scenarios were amazing and the editor tool was so easy to use. I ended up crating new maps although there were no one to play with. Imagine Warcraft III and Civilization IV combined.. No you don't need to imagine, because this game exists!\n\nCat humanoids called Tigrans, out of this world creatures Syrons, Dragonians, Arabian and Turkish inspired people Nomads, arctic hobbits, evil bug like creations Shadow Demons... Even goblins had their own race... All these original races are so remarkable and unforgottable and playing with them is still fun and intense even after a total of ten years.\n\nBe whoever you want to be, add a character bio, put your photoshopped picture on it, create new heroes and lead them to fight... Fight aganst good or evil, it does not matter, because you don't always get to play with good leaders. Be an evil Elven wizard or be a heavenly good Orcish shaman. Summon beholders, elementals, dragons and crack the earth under their feet while you separate their army with your tornados.\n\nGo deep in the woods, find camps and ask them if they want to join you. If they answer "No" then kill all of them and take their money. Get ready for more adventure, visit old ruins that are full of zombies and skeletons, steal baby dragons from their mothers, hire a drunk Dwarven engineer from tavern to protect you and improve their fighting skills in arena. Explore sunken shipwrecks and kill pirates, or just simply be a pirate!\n\nVisit beautifully made underworld to catch some outlaws and find new allies, like Goblins, Tigrans and Dwarves. Trade spells with their leaders and expand your empire. Banish terrestrial beings from their homes and get extra money from it. Be a bad person for once in your life! They'll hate you, they'll talk about you and they'll fear you and your undead champions! Raze cities and loot them! Destroy empires and rise yours!\n\nOpen the doors of engineering schools and buy some flame throwers and baloons to fly over the mountain. Order them to build up a tank for you! Move your army into the tank and raze enemy's wall and ruin their buildings over their head, because you know that they deserve it!\n\nTeleport to the Shadow world, exterminate all evil and good spirits! Stamp big insects, larvas and feel the beauty of this place. Help Syron giants and occupy demonic cities with their power. Enjoy the game, enjoy the gameplay, enoy the song, enjoy every step you make, every unit you kill and every hero you hire, every city you conquer, every mountain you climb, every cave you explore, every turn you make... Enjoy it!","October 4, 2013","true","74.4"," 107 of 114 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","107","114","5","0"

As a long time fan of Heroes of Might and Magic 3, as well as other less well received TBS games, this one continues to shine and take up space on my hard drive. This purchase marks the 3rd time that I've bought the game. One hard copy, once on GOG, and now the steam version, almost soley so that I can review this bad boy. First of all, forget the campaigns. Games like these were MADE for the random maps. The campaigns, while entertaining, are really just long tutorials to ready you for the random map generator, which is where this game shines. 12 races, multiple combinations of magi, and a multitude of play styles lay before you. That enemy city before you just a little too tough to take? Scorch their lands and transform them to deserts and watch their populace riot from their discontent at their new, inhospitable world. A mountainrange in your way? Level the terrain and march your troops across it, backdooring your opponent into new depths of discontent.  That being said, play it with your friends to elevate this game to the height that it deserves. This is the ultimate multiplayer strategy game. Get your friends together and LAN this game. You won't regret it.\nAfter purchasing AOW III, I have to admit, while that game IS awesome, I still make time in my day to go back to Shadow Magic. It's well worth the time. Every ♥♥♥♥ing time. Stop reading this now and go buy this game. If you're a turn based strategy person, or just a strategy gamer at all, you owe it to yourself to play this game. Good luck, and may your wizard towers provide you all the spell range you require!\n\nDisclaimer: I have literally played hundreds (and I don't mean one or two) of hours of this game and expect to play hundreds more.

It is a of game that superficially seems rather simplistic with its movements and hex board, but upon closer inspection a plethora of various elements are revealed. This game can give several tactics, such as creating an amphibious army of dwarves, a flying army of leprechauns, and explosive goblins. The balance between unit production and economic policy focus is just right. The only downside that I could say about this game is the possibility that, due to how attacks and damage rolls are done, luck can ruin your day. That and heroes are arrow and bullet magnets because of how powerful they can be if they aren't restrained. Needless to say, these do not detract from the possibility of fielding an army of flying hobbits that can rain havoc and drop flaming meteors on fiendish skeletons. If that has any sort of appeal to you, pick this game up. And do note that there is a sequel, Age of Wonders 3, in the works.","January 17, 2014","true","40.8"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","41","45","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 4\nAge of Wonders - Shadow Magic\nPurchase Date: 5/22/2014\n\nI got this game, along with the original Age of Wonders in a Humble Bundle.  I didn't warm up very well to the original, so my hopes were not very high for this one.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find that none of the things that annoyed me about the original game are present here.\n\nI jumped right into the tutorial.  Compared to the original, the tutorial in this game is vastly improved.  The tutorial, like the original, starts by covering the basics of movement around the map and claiming resources, but then proceeds into a lot more detail.  I felt like I had a much better sense of what my options were and what I needed to be doing.\n\nWhen I played the first Age of Wonders, I actually had to restart the tutorial because I died.  What I appreciated about Shadow Magic is, it gave me a good sense of the difficulty right off the bat, but I didn't have to start the entire tutorial over.  The very first fight I got in, a giant beetle ended up stomping my entire party.  But the tutorial was written to expect this, so rather than having to start over, the tutorial used this experience as a teaching lesson on what to expect.  I really appreicated that.\n\nThe graphics in Shadow Magic are better, but that is to be expected given the length of time between the games.  I didn't care for the animations in the original, but here the units move more naturally.  Also the game provided all the resolution choices I'd expect to see.  I played at 1920x1080, and didn't have any problems with menus or reading text.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself seemed much like the same turn-based strategy from the original Age of Wonders, which itself brought back memories from the old Heroes of Might and Magic games.  I have a feeling that I'd probably enjoy the original more now that I've played this tutorial and have a better grasp of the game.\n\nThe only thing that really annoyed me about Shadow Magic happend when I was trying to back out of a command that I was issuing to my party by hitting the escape key.  This brought me out to the main menu.  I then hit the Continue button, except this command will actually load your last saved game.  I didn't have any save games yet so it ended up not doing anything.  I wanted to resume my game, so I hit escape again thinking it would close the menu and take me back into the game, but instead it dumped me out to the desktop.  And thus, my review ended about 8 minutes early.\n\nI really didn't expect to like this game given my impression with the original.  So in this case I am glad to be wrong.  I'm looking forward to coming back and spending more time in the campaign.\n\nOverall Recommendation:  Keep","June 15, 2015","true","0.9"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","33","43","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bishmanrock/recommended/61520/","bishmanrock","Bishmanrock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bishmanrock/","743 products in account","A Civilization type game with Tolkeinesque races, such as Elves, Dwarves, Undead etc. Despite being ten years old, I still find it to be the best of its type.\n\nVery similar to most other turn based strategy games, although the difficulty can be a barrier for new players. You control a race, build\control cities, produce armies and buildings and spend time either allying or destroying other races.\n\nYou control a Wizard on the map who acts as the races leader. Should the Wizard die without any means to revive, your race is defeated.\n\nYou can take over mines, mills, farms etc on the world map to give you gold per turn. You can use that gold to build and train units, however you have to be aware of how much your spending. Once you've trained units, you also need to pay them a wage per turn. If you don't have enough gold, they may get disgruntled and leave you - possible joining up with your foes! I like this because, rather than just duking it out on a battlefield, you can work on removing your enemies resources and forcing his army to dwindle without ever facing open war.\n\nBad points: the AI often makes nonsense moves, and the diplomacy towards AI is irrational - often they will offer an alliance, before instantly breaking it and declaring war against you. The Steam edition doesn't come with the MASSIVE manual that came with the CD version, so it's worth flicking through an online wiki to get to grips with the game. A tutorial is there, but it's pretty brief.\n\nBest played against humans. There's online options, as well as a play by email function which I prefer and tend to be quite active on. The community is still going strong after so long, and maps can still be downloaded. Age of Wonders III is due in 2014, so if this looks too dated for you, might be worth holding out for that.","August 18, 2013","true","216.1"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

I'm actually going to make this review for Age of Wonders II, and this game as well...\n\nThe Age of Wonders series is a classic all-time favorite of mine in the case of the two, a challenging and enchanting strategy 4X game with spells, dragons, warriors, armies, everything. It allows you to personalize what kind of wizard you want to play as, how hard the enemies are, the setting you want to fight in, etc.. Haven't played through the campaigns fully for either, though.  Nontheless, Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne, and it's expansion-turned-sequel, Shadow Magic, are games that Fantasy and Strategy fans alike will be spellbound by. Shadow Magic also definately took what AoWII had, and did some improving touch ups on it but still made sure not to fix what isn't broke. But still tried some different things with new additions for bonuses and tactics. Such as looping the limited production queue if you want to build an army even when it's filled.\n\nFor both nostalgia and quality related reasons, an impressive 9/10 to both games.","May 27, 2014","true","35.0"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","2"

The entire game is turn-based, with the action happening at the strategic and tactical levels.  As was normal for games of years past, this is a game where you will spend the vast majority of time poring over the hex-based maps; this holds true at the "world" level as well as the "battle" level.\n\nA few things make it stand out of the pack.  At it's core the Strategic level plays out VERY similar to a "civilization-lite" style game; establish cities, build and upgrade various structures, research "tech" (in this case various spells), and expand your empire across the map.  On top of that, your faction leader can direclty influence gameplay through the casting of spells; some of these are "global", affecting the entirety of the map (or targetable upon an opponent), others are "permanent" (enchantments upon units), and yet others are direct-combat use (more on this later).  Adding to this is a (VERY LIGHT) diplomacy and alignment component that can affect your race's interaction with other races; some races will ally with, some will tolerate, and others will outright rebel.  The resoureces are limited to two; gold and mana.  Both are generated through your settlements as well as from capturable nodes.\n\nOn top of a pretty good strategy-level is the tactical battle level.  Rather than moving a stack of your units into a stack of enemy units and hoping you win (by the way, auto-resolve is available, but NOT recommended), the battles take place on another hex-based map.  The terrain of these battlefields is directly based on the "world map" terrain as well; one of the weak points is the limited amount of maps that are available (a city map is the same for each person, with cosmetic changes based on the race of the owning city).  However, environmental factors can impact the battles; for example, fire nodes will inginte all units dealing damage over time.  Army stacks are limited to 8 units (8 individuals) per stack, but with proper placement (FLANKING) you can bring 2-3 stacks to bear at at time.  Once the battles start, they play out very similar to a game of chess (or Final Fantasy Tactics, if you prefer).  Each unit has movement allowances and various actions.  Hero units up the ante on this with additional abilities, and ALL units can advance with experience earned (a couple racial units depend on levelling to "grow" into stronger units).  Additionally, once engaged in battle, you can cast spells directly against units (or on your units to heal/buff/etc).  Ultimately rather than relying on abstract stacks of units playing number wars, this game allows for a player with small unit tactical proficiency to shine.\n\nThe game comes with several campaigns, a couple dozen one-off scenarios, and the gem of it all; a pretty customizable random map generator.  One can make an extremely large map with nothing but deserts and mountains (if so inclined), or a small forest map, or anything in between.  Additionally, the random map allows for additional "layers" (underground and shadow realm) that maximize on some of the races' inherent abilites, adding more options and replayability.\n\nAOW:SM is an older title, and one that will probably slip into obscurity.  However, if you see it on-sale give it a go; for 5-10 bucks, you could do FAR worse and get MUCH less playability from a title.","February 14, 2014","true","221.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

At the time it looked great and in my opinion it has aged well. However my biggest gripe is that missions can end up long. Very long. That's not so bad except that's mostly due to grind. Defenders advantage is really damn strong so it often feels like trench warfare. You can't attack because you have to build some units, and others have to take 10 turns moving across the map.\n\nThis is also just more Age of Wonders 2.

Well, if you love Kings Bounty and Heroes of Might and Magic and even Civilization games then this game is right up your alley! It has TONS of factions to play as, tons of spells to learn and research, and tons of interesting map objects to claim and interact with.\n\nThe combat is based around heroes and the troops they bring into battle and is a turn-based affair. Its simple but deep enough to hit all the right places for fans of such combat systems. As heroes level up they gain new spells and stats and even the normal units and power up through 3 ranks of veterancy.\n\nAnd I can't finish this without mentioning the magic system which is crazy important.

Always giggling, like their hiding something...\n\nBut somehow this game is like crack. It aint good, it aint pretty and it's defiantly not going to do you justice in the long run, but its simply amazing.\n\nReally subtle and smart game play mechanics, you've got to prioritize early on what you want to do, to get the edge over the AI. Really got to understand what each unit is capable of and what all the different status perks mean (there's one dude who can just phase himself out of the games material plain... makes no sense but meh!). Also the Hero system is done really well. They appear kinda randomly and you can give them war gear to basically help you're armies achieve victories on the battlefield. Some of the hero profiles are very humours as well. We once had a guy called bromon or gromos, dude was death in one ear, ♥♥♥♥ing useless dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But after a lot of TLC (Tender Loving Care) he became the stallion of the land and once took on a whole cities defence when his whole platoon died (he was up against 13 units and ♥♥♥♥ me I nearly had a brain aneurism).\n\nAll in all, this is a really gay/happy fantasy, with an awesome soundtrack and in depth game play mechanics for its time.

If you want to play this game I recommend you stock up on the pizzas and soda because you aren't going to want to leave this game for a long while!\n\nThe only thing I would have against the game is a slight glitch with the A.I. . For some reason when we play against the computer to get the AI to function properly on the hardest difficulty 'Emperor' we found that at least one AI's needs to be set to 'King' the second hardest difficulty. Don't ask me why but it seems to make a significant difference to game play.\n\nFor getting a feel for the story and getting a love for the characters in the game I would also recomend Age of Wonders 2 as well for it's sheer amazing story line.","March 15, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
