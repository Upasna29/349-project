It's fairly simple to play, no complicated controls (I use mouse and keyboard, but I understand it's designed for controllers). I've only played single player so far, but I'll let the kids loose on this tommorow for some local coop and update review then. So far so good.","May 27","true","4.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Lovely hand crafted stylish art that all works together beautifully. The top-down look brings me back to the Amiga days but with a much more modern look that takes advantage of modern computers. Personally I don't have much experience with game play in the genre so I can't give too much helpful feedback on difficulty or progression. I first played arcade mode and it felt like the pace and increase in difficulty was well thought through not engaging the player in too long sessions so it's fun to chase new highscores. I only had time to quickly try story mode so I'm looking forward to play further into the story as soon as time allows. I was playing with mouse and keyboard but I think I'll have to bring back my controller that my friend has borrowed so I can test it out with dual stick =)","May 29","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
