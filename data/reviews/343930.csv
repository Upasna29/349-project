I really enjoy the pirate/nautical theme; I actually think it is a much more appropriate theme for a tower defense game as a waterway could require attackers to follow a set path at times and defensive towers could easily be constructed to hinder them.  In most tower defense games I always wonder why the attackers would only follow the roads, and why the defenders would rely on ranged stations rather than, say, an entire hoard of military units advancing on the invaders.\n\nThis game does have the same unit types as its predecessor, Royal Defense, but with different maps.  So if you enjoyed the first game you will enjoy this one, as it is another just like it.\n\nThe graphics have a vibrant, painted look to them and the art style is very pleasing with a degree more polish than some of the other tower defense games such as Kingdom Rush or Garden Rescue.\n\nThe music is pretty standard battle fair.  Decent enough background music for any military skirmish game, but I do wish they had included more of a jaunty pirate shanty as the mission music with a few more nautical sound effects for a much richer pirate-themed immersion to set this game apart from the other games of its genre.","May 28, 2015","true","32.5"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vincentimus/recommended/343930/","Vincentimus","Vincentimus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vincentimus/","977 products in account","This is a great game however it is lacking two very important things that a lot of tower defense games have. If you can get past those two things than this game is really great.\n\nThe first problem with this game is that it's a tower defense with no endless mode, and - to make things even worse - very short levels. Everytime I feel like I'm really dominating the attacking enemies the level is over and I go to the next one and start building again. Not ever have I felt like the enemies were really requiring to use or upgrade even half of the map, no matter what difficulty I play on. The levels are simply too short to ever be really challenging after a couple of waves (The first few waves are often challenging though.).\n\nMy second problem is that a new wave cannot be started untill the last one is completely defeated. I've seen a lot of tower defense games and this is not something that every tower defense game has but since the game gets really easy after a couple of waves it would give players an option to make things more difficult at times.\n\nThe game is simply not challenging enough after a couple of waves in a level and there aren't enough waves in one level to actually require you to use and upgrade the entire map, meaning that you'll dominate the enemy since you'll have enough gold to actually place and upgrade enough turrets to fill the map after a few waves.\n\nApart from those two points the game is really good, but it just isn't a real tower defense without some kind of endless mode.","July 27, 2015","false","8.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

I picked up the game and without much trouble I beat all easy levels with 3 stars and went on to play on medium, but after a few rounds it still felt a bit too easy, so I played through on hard a bit better but still not that hard. So I immediatly started the next world on Hard, and the difficult level was more enjoyable. about 3 levels requires a good really good start.\n\nSo if you have played TD games before and want a bit of a challenge, try it on a harder level from the start. After playing through world 2 on hard, you have earned lots of "barrels" (the ingame currency) and have unlocked multiple powerups.\n\nPro:\nEasy to pick up and from starting the game to be ready in a level in takes around 5 sec.\nNice graphics\nNice levels\nQuick rounds\n\nCon:\nNo "nightmare" levels to spice up the difficulty a bit. Generally to easy.\nSpells not that well balanced. Most of the time not needed at all.\nOnly 4 tower types, of which 2 is used a lot, 1 a little bit, and the last can mostly be ignored.\n\nConclusion:\nFor that price it is absolutly worth it. Even though it lacked a bit in difficulty it was a very enjoyable experience. And I am looking forward to the developers next Tower Defense game.\n","October 4, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Though it's not adding anything new to the genre and is kind of generic, it's still fun enough and worth playing if you are into tower defence games. You get to play through 40 levels of naval battles. Build giant crossbows, cannons, and other mounted guns to take down pirate ships that are coming at your base kamikaze style.\n\nThe variety in enemy ships is quite big and each one has its own distinct weaknesses which you have to exploit via certain towers. The towers mostly come in 4 basic types, which in turn can be upgraded into other types. You have crossbows which are fast but weak. Cannons which are slower but strong. Artillery which are very slow but can hit groups. And finally the support buildings that generate you money on a regular basis, which I think is a pretty cool idea in a game like this.\n\nThe levels are divided into 2 acts: Caribbean Sea (first 20 levels) and Arctic Ocean (last 20). When you beat each level, you get a rating out of 3 stars. Not letting any enemy attack your base grants you 3 stars. If, however, some did manage to damage it, you get only 1 or 2 stars. Unfortunately the stars do not mean anything in this game. In other tower defence games the stars act as upgrade points of some kind, hence incentivizing the player to replay missions and do better. But this game doesn't do that and collecting stars is only there for boasting.\n\nThe upgrades are instead handled via collecting barrels, which randomly drop from destroyed enemies. There are tonnes of upgrades for each tower and magic spell, and you're unlikely to upgrade everything by playing through the game once. This means you might occasionally have to grind for barrels by replaying earlier levels, which is a bit of a bad design in my opinion (when in doubt, keep replaying level 20 of Caribbean Sea; it gives A LOT of barrels usually). What's worse about this design, some of the tower spots on each map are locked and require you to spend several of your barrels before you can build anything on those spots. Those are usually good, strategic spots, so you have to either waste some of your precious barrels on one map, or compromise on your setup.\n\nVisuals are very beautiful and shiny. Sound effects are nice, and the music is all right, although you pretty much have the same short track playing in every level, so a bit more musical variety would've been nice.\n\nOverall this is a fun TD game. There are better TD games out there, but if you're looking for a new one that you haven't played yet, then this one is well worth a try, since it's very affordable and will entertain you for several hours.","October 8, 2015","true","6.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The visuals are nice while the music is just about OK. Difficulty is very front-loaded on each level - if you manage to get through the first two waves with a decent insfrastructure (ie. protected key points, 2-4 money generating towers), then the remaining waves are way too easy. The entire game is very easy - until you start the second campaign, which is more challenging even with all the upgrades in place. So it's fine, eventually.\nMy only serious gripe is unit diversity - cannon towers and money towers are way more efficient than anything else.\nEven so, I can recommend this game.\n","October 11, 2015","true","21.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In second "world", i.e. Arctic Ocean, "the party begins". With - let's say - the 10-th map in Arctic it becomes quite difficult to finish a map with all the 3 stars (meaninng: none enemy ship passed). If you want to finish the game anyway, i.e. nevermind the stars, that is maybe easier. If not... From now on you have to play the maps for a few times, over and over, which for me is... great. Allright, and now the pros and cons:\n\nCONS:\n1. this one music tune makes you go crazy after 10 hours ;)\n2. there could be a little bit more waves (of enemies) on each map; I guess 6 waves is not enough\n3. maybe a little bit too difficult in the second half of the Arctic Ocean\n4. you can see it is a port from mobile devices, but that is not such a problem for me\n5. 13-th and the last map on Arctica - way too difficult, even on Easy\n\nPROS:\n1. good, cheap, nice looking tower defence game\n2. just as good as - for instance - Kingdom Rush (also: ocean, ships - what not to like? ;))\n3. ...and much better than many, probably too many, "regular" tower defence games with 2D graphics\n4. the core mechanics work just fine!\n5. gets diffcult after a while\n6. good development of towers\n7. enemies becomming tougher and ougher, cool\n8, ideal for short sessions after work or school\n\nVerdict: Recommended!","March 30","true","24.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Everything is so repetitive, from the towers, the boards, even the music is the same five notes played over and over and over again.You can't see the icons for the tower bonuses, so it's all pretty much guesswork.
