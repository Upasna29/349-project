It can appear deceptively simple at first, but as you begin to chip away at the abilities and magic system, you realise just how important deeper knowledge of the game mechanics can be.\n\nA lot of the game has been covered by other reviewers. Essentially: turn based fantasy strategy game with empire management. Unlike the sequels - and many other games of its type - in Age of Wonders if your leader dies, you lose the game. This adds an extra layer of risk - your leader is powerful and can take down many basic units, but one wrong move and the game's over. It can sound cheap, but it really puts the stress on in major battles, something other strategy games miss out on. There is an option to remove this for the skirmishes, if you're not keen on it.\n\nTHE WARNING: this game, as it sits on Steam, is faulty. It crashes a lot - A LOT. Some people are fine, but looking at the reviews and the forums, it's wide spread enough for it to be an issue. You can fix this with a Hex editor. Now, I know some basic fixes are acceptable, but having to use a hex editor to fix the game is not. I imagine a lot of people out there don't know what a hex editor is, or how to even use one. Furthermore, I don't see any reason why this can't be done on the developers end - it took me two minutes, and would save everyone else a lot of headache.\n\nAnyway, if you know what you're doing, this thread has the instructions: http://steamcommunity.com/app/61500/discussions/0/864973123853580717/\n\nI very nearly put this as a thumbs down, but the cheap price, brilliant gameplay, and the fact that a fix is available - courtesy of the fan base (which, by the way, provide more maps and content than you'll ever manage to get through), I really can't bring myself to do it.\n\nThumbs up, only just, though.","December 5, 2014","true","130.6"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","45","47","0","0"

The game has a number of races to play, two campaigns with branching points, tactical combat, magic systems and customizable characters. Its citybuilding is simplified, however. I'd recommend it and the rest of its family to people looking for a fantasy 4X style game though at this point they are all a bit dated and are not without frustrating gameplay aspects. But they are inexpensive and still enjoyable. I'd recommend this until something newer comes along to topple it, and so far nothing that I've played has.","November 26, 2013","true","25.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

I knew beforehand there would be some frustration thanks to lacking quality of life improvements we are now accustomed to in modern games.\n\nI gave it a shot nevertheless and I'm happy I did it. Sure, it can at times be cumbersome and tiring, especially when the enemy AI sends a lone dwarf across the otherwise impassable mountains to conquer the gold mines in your backyard. *shakes fist*\nBut the gameplay overall was fun. Leveling up your heroes, selecting their new skills and equipping them with loot from the dungeons and haunted ruins you occasionally encounter is what made me love this game all those years ago. And it's still great.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, I know, and it might be an acquired taste.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrapmusket/recommended/61500/","scrapmusket","ScrapMusket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrapmusket/","119 products in account","TLDR: Get it.\n\nMore specifically:\n\nI'd never heard of Age of Wonders before getting this game with AoW 2 and AoW: Shadow Magic during a big sale not too long ago.  For $2, I was not expecting much - and was absolutely blown away when I started it up and discovered an enormously complex and well-developed game hidden behind such a low pricetag.  The dated graphics might be a turn-off to some, but unjustly so; the game itself holds up masterfully against its current-gen counterparts.\n\nSome might be tempted to call this a 4X strategy game in the vein of Civilization, but that was not what I personally found to be the case.  Yes, you're on a tiled map with cities and armies marching around, but that's about where the similarities end.  Things like city management and upkeep are extremely reduced: cities provide you with money and can build units, and you can upgrade them to unlock additional tiers of units.  No city upkeep, no taxes, city size doesn't change, and happiness is basically a factor of whether you're playing as a "good," "evil," or "neutral" faction (good likes good, evil likes evil, neutral's indifferent to everyone).  It's simple and keeps the focus on what the game is really all about, which is capturing territory.\n\nHere the game starts to feel like Starcraft or Warcraft, but turn-based.  Each turn, you get a certain amount of gold, and you have to decide how you're going to balance spending between teching up (unlocking better late-game stuff), fortifying cities, and producing armies.  Exploring the map is a necessity; that's the only way you'll find mines and farms to supplement your income and acquire more cities to boost production.  Fighting happens when one player moves an army onto the same hex as an enemy army, at which point not only those two armies, but all adjacent armies as well, get ported to a small-scale tactical map.  Tactical combat is fun and, at least agains the AI, smaller companies can take down big stacks if they're managed properly.\n\nThe major drawback some people might find is that certain units are absurdly strong relative to their counterparts in other factions (the Orc Red Dragon, for example).  Much of this strength comes from the fact that hitting units is RNG-based.  For lower-tier units, there's very little unpredictability, but when archers are shooting at a dragon, it can take a long time before one of them lands a hit - or it can happen right away.  High-level hero units with high defense present a similar problem, and going up against them usually requires some contingency prep work in case RNG is unkind.  It's manageable, but some might find it a turn-off.\n\nThere's much more to discover in the game than what I've laid out here, but hopefully this gives people an idea of what to expect.  All in all, it's fun to play alone, the campaign is massive and satisfying, and there's hot seat and play-by-email multiplayer for those who want more.  Highly recommend this game.","January 11","true","113.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sylxeria/recommended/61500/","sylxeria","Sylxeria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sylxeria/","132 products in account","Age of Wonders is a fairly old game, but I still very much enjoy its simple yet complex gameplay. While its sequels improved vastly on some aspects of the game, I still feel that combat was the most entertaining in the original.\n\nThe story is fairly straightforward, and unlike the later titles, allows you to play as the "Good" faction or the "Evil" faction for the story. At several segments, you'll be presented with a decision to make, but only the second and third decisions will influence the Campaign any. These two decisions will also alter the ending sequence.\n\nThe combat is one thing I enjoy the most in the original Age of Wonders. There's only a few voices for when units take damage (Most use a halfling-esque gasp or wail, even the orcs and dark elves!) but after a bit of fighting the battlefields truly begin to look like a battlefield  -  blood splatters onto the ground every time a successful attack is landed, and spills out when a unit is killed. These remain until the battle's ended, and really make a long difficult battle with several large stacks look so much more 'epic' to me personally.\n\nThe map editor isn't much to look at - every piece of decoration and every tile has to be placed manually, and there's no Random Map feature. However, it's still capable of making extra maps to enjoy after the built in scenarios are exhausted, but some effort will have to be put into that. The sequels refined the editors quite a bit, making detailing and carving out a map much more efficient.\n\nPower Nodes and Altars and Dungeons... I really enjoyed the dungeon maps when you explore a location, even if they were a bit tedious at times to explore. The sequels replace these with simplified terrain maps, which are much quicker to engage in at the cost of being less aesthetically pleasing in most cases - the same with city sieges. As most of those expansive detailed maps went unused in most cases, this isn't really all that bad gameplay wise.\nPower Nodes in the original only provided Magic Income if your leader wielded a sphere of magic of that element. Thus, a leader using just Death and Fire magic would receive no income from owning an Earth, Air, or Life node. In the sequels, you recieve reduced income from opposing nodes.\nAltars are a feature that were removed from the sequels. They were map locations that allowed you to cast powerful AoE spells onto the world map, just like the Divine Storm and other similar magics.  Either for free after a long charge period, or immediaely for a cost - and a very steep one if you're impatient.\n\n\nThere are a few minor tidbits I fount interesting that don't really affect the gameplay or rating any. First, in the flavor text for the Elementals (Fire Elemental, etc) they are stated they can be called at Gates - but no such locations exist. In fact, it's not until the sequels that you could hire troops from On-Map locations.  The Sea Serpent monster also states that they can be coerced into serving via powerful Water Magic, but no spells of this sort exist. In the sequel however, the "Great Wyrm" is indeed a Level 4 Water spell.  Finally, some units claim that they will only serve 'Good' leaders, but they themselves are of a Neutral or Creature alignment,  the latter meaning they'll get along even with Evil and Pure Evil leaders!\n\nI also very much loved the portraits that map locations and many creatures had.  Some of these were re-used in the sequel (Like the generic Human Soldier portrait) but others weren't.\n\n\nI really loved this game and the series as a whole, hopefully others may also find enjoyment in this title.\n","December 30, 2015","true","267.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

One of the bests for me. Great strategy game with fantasy and rpg themes. It has singleplayer/multiplayer/singleplayer-campaign and you can play "classic style turns" or "simultaneous". You are represented by the lord of your people and can not let him die.  Your character levelup like any good RPG, and his people too.  You can choose abilities and powers from a big list to customize your character and make him a good fighter, mage, or ranged attacker... This game offers 12 fantasy races really cool to play. The look is clean and simple. This comes with a map editor too for those who like it. Also this game has female portraits for girls. Negative side: AI is very stuppid and need to "cheat" to be challenger! It has few official big maps with only "after the fall" really nice for 12 players.  Some units are unbalanced and schools of magic too. The cities do not have many improvements to make. And the worst is: the game crashs some times. For me the downside does not overcome the positive. Sadly games 2 and 3 of this franchise does not have the same qualities. I support a remake of this game with modern graphics.","October 6, 2014","true","105.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They only let you get 3, 5, and 6 for whatever reason.\n\nStill, the economy is very basic.  The campaign is very weird.  The AI suffers from either having an abundance of spammed units, or having a large economy that lets it spawn more spams.  I don't know why people think it adapts to upgraded tactics at all.  The game seems to succumb very easily to upgraded spells and units unless it just has a ton of units or premade units to counter with.   Often, the easy way to win is just raze a ton of enemy controlled cities so they can't spawn spams anymore since they don't have cities to build with or afford upkeep.  Thankfully, despite the morale system, there's also a race system.  That means the enemy will usually contain races that you don't contain, so when you raze their cities, it doesn't impact your own troops' morale.\n\nI basically just played this game like Atilla the Hun, and it never really got challenging.  The only times you don't raze cities is if the computer was dumb enough to not conquer them in the first place.  Then, you just amass troops, and rush the enemy capital.   There's no need to bother with attacking independents if they just slow you down after you accepted the independents you're compatible with.\n\nHonestly, Battle of Wesnoth is better... and it's free.","November 3, 2015","false","7.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

They are probably all from people who don't know the original games this one is a pale copy from. If you want some good turn-based strategy, stick to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or try Masters of Magic.\nOk, now, what is my problem with this game? It really doesn't take long to explain: it just lacks content. It gets boring after few hours. Not only is there nothing I haven't seen before in other games, there are also missing many elements that make other games interesting. For example, there are only two(!) ressources, mana and gold. All upgrades to your cities only produce units, there are no other boons (like, gaining items, some ressources or boosts to hero stats). The AI is rather stupid, even after a few hours of playing it's totally simple to win fights with few losses even when you're outnumbered. The diplomacy screen is a joke, you can't even trade technologies (i.e. spells).\nI have to admit that I haven't played long enough to see even a fraction of the spells available, those might still cut it. I'll play on a bit (though bored already) and if they do, I might change my review.","April 16","false","2.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 3\nAge of Wonders\nPurchase Date: 5/22/2014\n\nI'd never played any of the Age of Wonders series.  This one I picked up as part of a Humble Bundle last year.    Humble is one of the reasons I ended up with as many games as I have, as they are a great excuse to donate a few dollars to a good cause and pick up a bundle of games while you are at it.  I get a lot of of games I wouldn't otherwise try this way.\n\nAs soon as I got into the game, I was immediately reminded of Heroes of Might and Magic.  Anyone who has ever played any of those games will be familar here.  I saw a lot of the same concepts here, with an emphasis on tactical turn based combat, along with exploration and town management.\n\nEven though it's an older game, it ran absolutely fine on my system, and I could run at my native 1920x1080 resolution.  The text is a little small to read at that resolution, but otherwise I had no issues.    I had recently played Age of Empires II, and like that game, I found myself wanting to use the scrollwheel on my mouse to zoom in and out of the map, forgetting that scrollwheels weren't used in games back then.  Graphically speaking, the maps looked good, but I wasn't as impressed with the units, particularly the animation.\n\nI started by going through the tutorial, which is pretty basic.  It covers the basics of getting around and how to issue commands to your party, but when it comes to actual strategy you are on your own.  It doesn't give you any sense for what you are about to get yourself into.  And I say this because this is not an easy game for someone just starting out.  In fact, I actually managed to die during the tutorial and had to start over.  It was my own fault, I sent my party leader to the front lines and he got himself killed, which immediately ended the game.\n\nOnce you finish the campaign, Age of Wonders offers you a campaign mode, which you can play from one of 2 sides, either the elves or the goblins.  The game also comes with a number of scenarios that you can play as well.  Since this is only an hour review, I did not look at any of the multiplayer, but I did find it interesting that the game has a play by email option.  I'm not used to seeing that in a lot of games.\n\nI played a quick game though each side of the campaign.  I say quick game because Age of Wonders is not a kind game, and you can get yourself killed very quickly.  I did a little better when I played a scenario, but even then it wasn't terribly long before I was wiped out.  This is a game that expects you to learn from your mistakes, like any strategy game.\n\nUltimately I don't think this is really a game for me.    I didn't really see anything about this game to make it stand out.   Playing this just made me think back to playing the old Heroes of Might and Magic games.\n\nOverall Recommendation:  Pass\n\n","June 15, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","1"

These steam ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s destroyed it. The AI is now ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lifesteal is now a waste of time to get, and theres all sorts of strange bugs that cause the game to pull a derp and shutdown like when you scroll across the map when you have fog of war disabled. Say you want to see how far away the next city is, games gonna pull a derp and shutdown.\nThe AI in this game used to be fun. There was squire (easiest) and lord (hardest). That's what i remember, good AI even on the squire setting. I tried it out with the new hardest AI setting which is something called Emperor. Turns out all that does now is make their leader level up faster. Doesnt do ♥♥♥♥ for strategy or anything of that sort. The old ♥♥♥ game that i played i gave a 10/10. It was amazing. This steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ i give a 4/10 simply because it seems they kept most of the music and lore from the original. At least you can still edit and make your maps though that's pointless now since the AI is absolute fail.","January 21, 2014","true","35.4"," 0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","11","0","0"

Simply restart your game and you're set. With that addressed this steam version is worth your money if multi unit turn-based strategy is your thing. You can find items in dungeons, caves, and castle ruins and level your heroes. Upon leveling you can pick new talents making this game rather customizable.

Sure, your guys can automatically duke it out in a boring little window where all that is displayed is their health, but that's no fun. What's great is when you select the "tactical" combat option. That allows you to control each individual infantryman/dragon/hero (who can also cast spells!) and position and manuver them however you so wish. There's even terrain on battlefields such as fortifications, pillars of rock, houses, etc. If you're clever, a hero and supporting units (cavalry usually in my experience) can outmanuver a much greater force and wipe them out.\n\nIn other words, buy this game.

Perhaps it's because this game was a part of my youth growing up. I remember playing hotseat multiplayer games with 4 or 5 friends and being captivated for hours on end. To this day; albeit relegated to single player matches only, does still prove quite the enjoyable experience.\n\nFrom an era before DLC, this game is jampacked with tons of lore, and a large number of factions to choose from outright. Featuring two lengthy campaigns and a multitude of scenarios, Age of Wonders is sure to keep you sated for hours on end. This truly was the first game I felt that "just one more turn" feeling that many people yearn for.  Both the campaigns and the scenarios offer a lot of replayability, due to the choices you make in the campaigns, as well, via the numerous factions avaliable in the scenarios. Last thing to note is the beautiful music, one of the few PC games to my mind that features many memorable tunes.\n\nAge of Wonders seems to run very well in 1920x1080 16:9 resolution on Windows 8.1.

The RPG elements are stronger in the first part and in my opinion the balance between the races is better too (halflings and frostlings are a playable choice in multiplayer, which they are definitely not in part 2).

The "classes" are useless too as you need your heros to be able to cast mighty spells, especialy in the mid/late game. A "fighter" hero has no chance against a sorccer.

But the first game of the AoW series still has his moments, the story is more beautiful, the races are rich in variety and the music is my absolute favourite video game soundtrack ever made. Of course, I put on rose-colored glasses, because one of the first games I ever played makes me nostalgic, but I recommend it not just to the few original players, but also to the people who love turn-based strategy fantasy games with role play charakter. Have fun with an old classic.","April 17","true","86.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Incredibly solid game with tons of content and beautiful music.\n\nThe simplistic artstyle is really pretty and much nicer than the sequels. If you choose to manually fight the battle you get a huge battlefield map where you can position your units and the environment of the battlefield map changes depending on where you picked the battle in the over-world. For example if you engage another unit on a bridge the battlefield map will be a huge bridge etc.\n\nThe sequels removed the big battlefield and carefully positioning your units. It made the battles faster but also not as engaging. I would recommend this original game over the sequels which I don't like.","November 27, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm trembling from desire to play the following titles!!!","April 27","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
