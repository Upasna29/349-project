Your character can walk, run, slide, jump, double-jump, wall-jump, climb walls and even hang and move on ceilings. This variety of movements opens up to a lot of exploration in the levels, and such exploration is rewarded with lots of in-game money and hidden collectibles. The in-game money can be used to buy upgrades and costumes.\n\nThe levels are huge, with plenty of side-corridors or side-paths where you can find items. Since I wanted to explore every inch of each level, I often got tired before reaching the end. Slightly shorter levels (i.e. splitting each level into two) would be good.\n\nThe combat has a fast short-range attack (which you will end up using almost all the time) and a long-range attack, as well as a couple of gimmicks (left-trigger + short attack, or right-trigger on top of an enemy) that are a harder to pull off, and slow down the action as the camera freezes in a bullet-time fashion. This kind of effect gets old very quickly and breaks the flow of action.\n\nThe character has a stamina meter (for stuff such as running) and a health meter. The health regenerates when not taking damage.\n\nDue to the amount of buttons used (4 buttons and the 2 triggers used as digital input), it might be a bit cumbersome to play on keyboard. I can't say about it, because I used a controller.\n\nAlthough each level is huge, the game is a bit short, as this was meant to be the first episode in a multi-episode saga. And the storytelling in this game is not very good, I had the impression the levels did not follow any logical order, I haven't seen connection between most levels. (For comparison, "Sonic 3" storytelling is perfect!)\n\nOverall, this game is okay. Between "Yes!" and "No!" I give this game a "Meh".","October 8, 2014","true","8.9"," 66 of 76 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","66","76","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/9940/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Blade Kitten is a charming game when you first start it up. The main character, Kit Ballard, is a spunky cat-girl who happens to be a bounty hunter with a new rival in town. The look of the game is cheery and bright, and the promise of a fun rivalry-based adventure sets the scene nicely. Although they say first impressions are generally the most important, this rule doesn't really apply to Blade Kitten. The game starts strong, but fizzles quickly due to some awkward mechanics, technical issues, and a paper-thin story.\n\nKit Ballard, as a main character, is interesting enough, and certainly fills the cat-girl "moe" archetype satisfactorily. However, the story, which starts off strong, falls into the "chase" trope fairly quickly, and becomes no more than snippy remarks and chase scenes during cutscenes. Although the lead and her rival certainly have their personalities, they just aren't enough to keep you engaged in the story.\n\nHowever, since this is a relatively cheap game, a lax story might be forgivable. What isn't, however, is bad gameplay mechanics. The game's world is futuristic, and characters seem to hover around on a lessened gravity planet, which sounds cool in theory, but in practice proves to be quite frustrating. The game's levels feature platform-based gameplay, which means precision-based running and jumping is a must. However, the low-gravity properties of the game mean that there is a lot of skidding around, and you can't stop on a dime or take off at full speed. Though this isn't much of an issue in the beginning, you'll find the sliding mechanic increasingly annoying as the game progresses and you encounter "trap" levels that require precision button pressing and obstacle avoidance.\n\nAnother aspect of the game's mechanics that gets agitating quickly is the swordplay. Blade Kitten’s weapon of choice is a big, floating sword that can attack enemies near and far with quick or ranged attacks. However, the problem with the sword is that it only works half of the time. For instance, sometimes I would target an enemy from a distance, and when my ranged attack was unleashed, the enemy would still be standing there. Even the quick attack was flawed, and hammering on the swift attack button when encountering several enemies at once never yielded the results that I hoped. The floating sword mechanic could have really been cool, but with the lack of precise targeting, the sliding controls, and the lack of consistency in battle make this weapon more of a chore to deal with rather than an exciting gameplay component.\n\nThe game's mechanics really handicap this title and cause it to fall short of its potential. And the real tragedy of this is that the level design is actually quite good. Though the game takes a traditional approach to the side-scrolling aspect, there are multiple paths you can take through each level, and there are tons of bonus areas with treasure chests to explore. However, these areas are normally hidden behind puzzles and switches, which can be difficult to hit because of the wonky controls. On more than one occasion, I passed by treasure-filled bonus areas because I simply wanted to finish the level instead of trying to suffer sliding around trying to hit switches in a precise manner.\n\nBlade Kitten's level design is also a missed opportunity in the visual area. Though there are plenty of hidden areas and things to explore, none of it looks particularly interesting. Levels generally find a comfortable color scheme, insert a few new elements, and stretch these few elements into an overarching world. This type of visual scheme is not only boring to look at, but can also be disorienting, as backtracking to similar areas can get you seriously lost if you are trying to find a certain area that looks like another part of the stage.\n\nThe only aspect of Blade Kitten that is consistently good is the animated cutscenes. Although most of these are brief with forgettable dialogue, the cutscenes are animated in a very high-quality cel-shaded style. All the animations are fluid, and the game really hits all the right notes for the anime style they wanted. The main characters feature some fun facial expressions and lightning-fast movement. However, even the cutscenes are hampered by poor voicework, which often comes across as wooden and completely unemotional.\n\nAs far as replay value is concerned, Blade Kitten definitely doesn't have much going for it. Although the game has several unlockable items, including new weapons, costumes, and battle-enhancing consumables, the game's currency is dispersed a little too liberally, and it is very possible to unlock all of this content before you've even reached the halfway point. This might be a good thing if you are just trying to run through the game, but if you are looking for a game you can play and then explore, Blade Kitten doesn't have much for you.\n\nBlade Kitten certainly could have been a good game. It started out promising, and I was excited to experience an old-school platforming title with fun characters that played off the anime/manga tropes we've all seen over the years. However, what I got was a game with bad mechanics, repetitive level design, and little incentive to keep playing past the first few levels. Overall 6/10.","August 16, 2015","true","10.4"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","37","41","2","2"

After 5 years Blade kitten has gotten it's episode 2 and conclusion. Was it worth the finish though? One way to find out, isn't there?\n\nBlade kitten is a Platformer developed by Krome studios and released by Atari in 2010. If you're familiar with either, you'd know that Krome Studio's made a previous platformer game on the Gamecube and other consoles called "TY: The Tasmanian Tiger." which is a game that personally I've had a lot of good experiences with when I was younger. Sure, the voice acting was cheesy and some game mechanics were irritating as sin. But it was a fun game. And if you know about Atari, you know they went bankrupt some time ago, but I'll get to that later.\n\nIn Blade Kitten, you play as Kit Ballard. Essentially a catgirl with an interesting hair genetic, but realistically she is part of a rare(?) alien race called the Felion's. It looks like "Felines" but is pronounced differently, get it? Anyways, her job is to be a breaker; which is the game's essential equivalent of a Bounty hunter. Hunts targets, get paid. Usual stuff. First person she runs into is her soon to be rival but not main antagonist; Justice. Blonde woman working for an evil-ish military group known as the Sollers.\n\nGameplay is simple stuff. The game runs entirely on a 2.5D plane. 3D models but the game always sticks to it's camera angle; and the game's entire system runs as a platformer. Kit's attacks focus on a hovering "Breaker Blade" which can be swung at melee range, or sent out at a distance. You can hold RMB to spear people's armor or shields, or just to yank them in. There's also special attacks, like a Q to mount and throw soldiers by the head.\n\nThere are a few kinks to work out though, that's unusure if they'll ever get fixed up. First off, Episode 1 was originally designed for consoles. It shows when the "how to play" is just a bunch of symbols with no real display on what you're /supposed/ to press. The only one that does show this is the loading screens, and if you have even remotely decent of a computer it wont be around long enough to read. The Enemy AI can also be seen as unfair at times, countering hits from you are most of the basic enemies 90% of the time.\n\nWith Atari closing down in a later year and stopping development of Blade kitten Ep2, there was a pretty long hiatus. But now we have it. Episode 2 has nicer animations, a more consistent 60 FPS and a rather shiny level design! Plus, all the original characters voice actors and new content to boot. It's fun stuff, and was a nice wrap-up for the series.\n\nPro's\n------------\n+Decent Level design\n+Lovely world-building\n+Slipped in references of older games\n+Level keeps up with you, allowing the player to go pretty damn fast at times.\n+Slippery, almost wild yet usable controls.\n\nCon's\n------------\n-Some enemies are downright irritating\n-Climb command registration can be sometimes odd\n-Some map bugs\n-Enemy's can be expoited using Wild controls, making bosses rather easy.\n\nVerdict: Buy it if it interests you. There /is/ a demo, so try that first.\n\nThanks for the efforts Krome Studios, I'm glad you didn't leave the game for dead.","March 18, 2015","true","18.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","1"

Blade kitten on PC used to be pretty bad when it first came to PC, with some kind of stuttery frame rate limiter which made me feel nauseous playing it.  The dev though NEVER GAVE UP!  Just like Blade kitten the dev not only stayed active on the forums, but kept updating the game for PC to resolve these issues.  The voice acting in the game is really awesome with lots of costumes to unlock and powerups to buy.  A simple platformer game, probably one of the few ever made where the controls WORK!  Crawling up walls, makes exploring the levels pretty fun, like any platformer its not the combat that makes the game its the controls, the feel, and the exploration.  From having a little pet to the animations in the game, all of them are awesome!  Replay value is high since the controls are simple, even if you forget them like I did there isnt any move that complex like other games, this game you can pick it up play it, quit anytime, then go back and BOOM right back at the checkpoint.\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $14.99","June 4, 2014","true","28.7"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","1"

There. I said it.\n(Bonus points for the additional gothic dress for our cat girl heroine. Me-ow!)\n\nBlade Kitten is a 2.5D, action-platforming game starring Kit Ballard, a cat girl (in an optional gothic dress) who controls a levitating AI sword and is followed around by some weird flying pet... thing, as she does battle against various factions out to get her while she tries to reclaim a data stick stolen from her and get payback for her destroyed ship. Or something. The whole story is a bit of a mess. There's very little real explanation for who anyone is or how they're all connected or ultimately what's going on. The story and apparent goal seems to shift dramatically from one level to the next with little real sense of focus for anything, just a vague over-arcing narrative that's sporadically dropped then brought up again at whim.\n\nI presumed there was more to this than meets the eye and, indeed, found the game to be based on a web comic of the same name. It looks like it's been going for quite a while, but despite an intensive Google search for what must have been at least a good minute and a half, if not two whole minutes, I still couldn't really find out much about the material it's based on. The lack of explanation (aside from a brief in-game glossary) would suggest it's aimed at established fans, but if it's as obscure as it appears to be then that's a huge misstep and is essentially shooting itself in the foot from the start. The story elements aren't offensively bad or anything, and I guess you'll get the basic gist, but I just wish it would've kept its attention on one thing rather than feeling like it was cramming in every feature of its universe to appease fans who the developers probably thought would be annoyed if their favourite parts weren't included. The mostly useless pet, Skiffy, being a pretty glaringly obvious example of something from the lore being shoehorned into some kind of role in the game.\n\nBut despite the way it was presented, I did still really like the universe that we're shown (and the gorgeous art style in particular) and would be happy to learn more about it. I want to know more about this flying, AI sword, dammit! The lead is very well written and acted, and I never felt like the game was talking down to the player and treating us like idiots. In fact, the game, and Kit herself, come across as somewhat self-aware without ever breaking the fourth wall, and as a result feels far more inclusive and engaging. But as for the supporting cast? Mmm, not quite so much. They're more standard, video game fare.\n\nThe actual gameplay is far more successful, though. You'll run, leap and hack your way through 13 stages, searching for secrets, unlocking costumes and buying new swords and upgrades. But the main appeal of the game comes from Kit's agility and dexterity, as she sticks to just about every surface to climb along walls and ceilings, opening up huge potential for exploration. That's something that might actually throw some players, in fact. Most platformers are about running a gauntlet as you overcome obstacles of one kind or another to reach the finish. But in this one you'll spend far more time roaming the occasionally labyrinthine stages, sometimes wondering whether the path you've taken is where you're supposed to be going, or if you're unwittingly making your way towards the dead end with the collectibles. But once you know your way around and how to best deal with enemies (jump over them, innit), most of the stages can be speed run in around about five minutes.\n\nWhen you are engaging in combat, you'll probably have a little less fun than when you're running around. There aren't a great deal of enemy types, and the majority of them will be dealt with in largely the same manner; either rush up to them with a flurry of light, but fast slashes, or send your floating sword off to deal heavy, ranged strikes. You can also jump on some enemies and toss them around, or do a jumping ground stomp attack for crowd control, but from moment to moment, you'll mostly just be cutting up the waves of fodder then running along. It's pretty trivial stuff for most of the game, thanks largely to your regenerating health as well. But, to be honest, I'd rather them be easy than have them kill the pace and become tedious roadblocks every time they're encountered. Also, the controls aren't quite tight enough for anything too challenging, either. Most of the time they're fine (I played it entirely with a game pad), but every so often it felt unresponsive and I'd suffer because of it. Was never too major, but enough to be a noticeable annoyance.\n\nSo, it's not perfect. The story is muddled, the combat and enemies are kinda uninspired and some more moves or combos would've been nice, the levels can sometimes confound, and the controls could be improved. But even so, I did still really enjoy this one and felt the fun and easy-going positives far outweighed the negatives. Especially the price. It's kind of a steal how much game you're getting for so little. So if you like platforming, exploring and cat girls in gothic dresses, then this has your name writing all over it. Well... at least if your name is Blade Kitten.

Kit Ballard is funny, smart, cute and badass kitten with really sad past; and when I play fun-to-play character with actual character, game is always better for me.\nHollow Wish is world we play in and is lovely to look at, but dangerous to explore because of various enemies that makes your life harder. Some of them are really easy to get rid off, but you will find some tough and annoying mothereffers here as well.\n\nEliminating single targets, or smashing thru hordes of enemies is fun and enjoyable; but sometimes it is really far from it, because when you find yourself in siege of enemies from left and right and they are upon you, closer then you wish, and it is really difficult to get out of their deadly grasp. And besides few glitches events, this is probably my only complain for this game.\n\nAs story goes.

Some of the puzzles are okay, the rest of the game is not. Even with a gamepad, platforming basics like double-jumping or long running jumps are hampered by the game thinking it knows better than you and auto-aiming jumps. Combat is clunky and it is easy to get stun-locked to death by enemies. But by that same token, there's no challenge, as you respawn with no penalty and checkpoints are incredibly common. The sword selection is passable, but the only other upgrades are HP and Stamina ups, and nothing really unique. You CAN dress your character in a selection of very stylized japanese costumes if you like, but once you realize you're playing in pajamas and bunny slippers, it loses its appeal. The worst part is the voice acting, however. The protagonist never misses a chance to spout squeaky cutsesy dialogue in a voice that grates on the ears. I stopped hunting down treasure chests because I couldn't stand to hear another "Win Get!" or "Awwwwwlright!" It even does it when auto-aiming your jumps for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/9940/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account","Blade Kitten is a platformer based on a web comic about the adventures of Kit Ballard, a bounty hunter. You will run, jump and attack through the 14 levels in this game in your quest to hunt down your current target.\n\nStory\nWhile this game is based on a series of web comics, knowledge of them isn't required, as the game is set three years before the events in the comics. Good for me, since I've never read the series myself.\n\nThe game has several in game cut scenes within most of the levels to bring the story to you, but it isn't anything that interesting. Come to a planet to receive information on your current target, get attacked by a rival bounty hunter, and start chasing after her. Other events happen later after you have caught her, including missions to help random people which just happen to be connected to your target. Rather poor in my opinion, and not likely to get me to read the comic at this point.\n\nPresentation\nWhile not to the level of a professional development company, the graphics of this game are beautiful. The levels have plenty of detail in the background and the characters themselves all look great. The style is well suited for the characters, looking like what you would hope for from 3D versions of comic characters. Certainly a high point of the game.\n\nThe music itself is less impressive. At best, it is forgettable. Fortunately, it never got so bad that I wanted to mute it. Regular sound effects are better. You have attacks, grunts, breaking items, jumping and even some calls from wildlife.  Certainly some hard work was put into these. Lastly, we have the voice acting. More good work here. The voice actors actually used emotion while doing their lines, and the voices were well suited for their characters.\n\nControls\nThis game is most certainly made for a gamepad. Don't even think about trying it with a keyboard. Assuming you own a gamepad, the controls works fine. You have movement on the left analog, some camera control with the right, a jump key, both melee and ranged weapon attacks, defend, dash and interact. Everything you need for this adventure.\n\nGameplay\nNow, this will have a fair bit to chat about. As a 2D platformer collect-a-thon, this really is an enjoyable game, with plenty of secrets to hunt down, earning you the dosh to unlock extra content like weapons, costumes and health / stamina boosters. Getting into the combat, it's not quite so great, but it does the job.\n\nThe levels are mostly linear, with a range of hazards to traverse and plenty of coins lying around for you to grab. But if you are willing to go out of your way by climbing on every surface like this catgirl is capable of, you will find a number of chests, discs and animals around the levels to be added to your inventory. This game tugs at the strings that had us old timers spending hours in titles like Mario or Sonic, and doesn't disappoint here.\n\nNow for the fighting. The basics of this are simple button mashing. Most enemies will present little challenge. However, there will be a few tricky opponents that will require you to use other techniques like blocking or ripping their equipment from them. Those are used so little though, you might just forget you have those skills at the times you do need them.\n\nLifespan\nAs you can guess from a collect-a-thon type game, there is plenty to do after you have beaten the story. Trying to find every item to unlock 100% will take a good while, and completing this task will unlock the remaining costumes that money alone can't purchase. As well as that, there are several achievements to work on, like completing a level without a scratch, taking out 5000 enemies or  having the best time for the levels total 90 minutes or less. Getting all of those should help boost the playtime if you are a completionist.\n\nClosing\nWhile I felt the story and music were near failures, the rest of the game pulls this up to being a title I would recommend to a platformer fan. Unfortunately, sales for the title seem to be uncommon, so you might be looking at full price if you wish to pick it up on Steam.\n\n---\n\nUpdate time\n\nThe devs recently got this series back from Atari, so after some new work, this game has returned to the Steam store. Now featuring some new costumes, cleaned up controls, more challenging AI opponents and even the bonus feature that is Steam trading cards. Even better, Episode 2 is on the way, and the game is now much cheaper. I will heavily recommend people give this a purchase.","July 30, 2013","true","6.8"," 44 of 68 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","44","68","0","0"

It has creative and fun gameplay, and a good and extensive backstory. Plus, now that it is once again under Krome Studios' control, it is no longer a dead title, and is once again actively maintained, with a sequel that is now actually on the way.\nSometimes, the characters can be pretty annoying.

I put off buying it for a long time despite very low price because of a few negative reviews on game mechanics. Turns out those reviews dont know what they are talking about.\n\nYes this game has a few kinks that you should know about combat. There for instance is a kickback during which time you are stunned. This kickback+stun can be stacked on you by multiple enemies resulting in unexpected beatdowns and deaths. We are not talking about La-Mulana type of kickback here that defines the whole combat system but it's significant enough that it should be taken into account. Melee enemies dont let you go once they connect with their blows resulting in half your health going away. You regenerate fast but sometimes its not enough.\n\nAnd what about your weapons and moves? Standard sword slash works well on 1-2 enemies but a group of enemies all at once? your DPS is not fast enough and you dont hit them all so the enemy will retaliate so adjust your tactics accordinly. You CAN take them out most of the time. but not always.\n\nEnemies deliver their blows once they have progressed on their move and some of them are non-interruptible even if they die. The long range sword throw does not connect every time as it works bad in close range. In addition it consumes stamina which is important when you jump around trying to do your moves so it's better to be used when skirmishing or as an opener.\n\nUse your head - your character can easily in normal situations just spam on the normal attack and win. But sometimes even the basic grunt can kick you down from a ledge if they have the height advantage or form a tag-team with another one to beat you up if you fool around too much.\n\nUse that shield of yours.  Jump on top of enemies and throw them. Their bodies trigger doors, switches and even crumbling walls.\n\nAnd what about platforming and levels? Well it sure is overdone. Just the start screens of levels, you can basically just spend 5-15minutes clearing the opening screen. See a ledge? there is a secret there - there always is. Every. single. time. at least money if not a chest or a teleporter to some other area.\n\nArrows tells you to move forward? nope. go back, there is still a ton of secrets or there is a alternative way forward with loot on the way.  I dont recall any other game overdoing secrets the way this game does. A typical level has the arrows pointing where to go but you must do the traditional 'uh-oh, game wants me to go here - i need to go back' -routine as much as possible and instead look for walls and ledges where to jump. or just hang from walls and make your way to seemingly impossible places - where there is a huge section of the level and here you will spend the next 5minutes. In another game called Limbo you got an achievement for 'going left'. this game takes 'go everywhere, there are so many secrets it will take time'  to a whole new level. On average levels last for a very long time so there is plenty to do.\n\nTo sum up the good this game has weapons, upgrades, costumes, nice artwork. good responsive platforming controls and easily learnable combat with small details that you can learn if you like but it's not mandatory. To get ahead in the game you dont need to learn all the details but it sure helps a lot.\n\nI am very entertained this far. Unique game for me. Good looks and interesting stuff to do.\n\n9/10.","January 14","true","10.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The game's fallen on hard times but it's finally getting back up on its feet. It was originally supposed to be an episodic game, which explains why it's so short but problems arose with the crew and budget and the rest of the game was put on hiatus for a few years with only a skeleton crew to slowly move things along. Well, the wait is finally over and soon we'll be getting the next episode in just under a month.\n\nBased on the dev's very own webcomic series, Blade Kitten stars a quirky young intergalactic bounty hunter catgirl named Kit Ballard. The game itself is pretty great if not short and sweet, with classic platforming elements akin to games like Crash Bandicoot. You can also get alternate costumes for your kitty throughout the game without any need for DLC. The game is set in a pretty, alien landscape and the cel-shaded 2.5D artstyle itself is pretty charming and somewhat anime inspired and it all blends together very beautifully.\n\nIf you love platforming/hack 'n' slash games with cute girls, then I definitely recommend this game.

What got my attention was that the character was a feline/human mix (instead of fully human like most action games), the world it took place on, and the overall combat.\n\nI gotten the game few years after watching his videos and enjoyed it myself. However I was having a few tehnical issues but that's due to hardware limitations on my end (shadows hurt my FPS greatly, and have to keep turning them off whenever I start the game).\n\nSometimes the controls would get a bit sticky or respond oddly, and sometimes the collision detection bugs out or has Kit perform a different animation. The combat was overall okay, was difficult to trigger some of the criticals on some blades along with the head-swing attack but takes practice and precise timing and aiming.\n\nThe story is... there but doesn't always transition smoothly as you progress through the game. Not a bad story, but has a few plot holes that may go unnoticed in the first playthrough. The Episode 2 DLC wraps up the story very well, though.\n\nApparently, Blade Kitten was a comic before this game was made. Some parts are mentioned in this game regarding Kit's past but give little detail. I'm not sure what they're like though. I've read some of it after playing the game... seems to be alright.\n\nI'd get this and the ep. 2 DLC in a bundle than separately, save you some money.\n\nAlso, some of the outfits are so darn cute! ^_^","May 2","true","24.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It would be so much better if the collision detection was loosened up, because it feels more jarring like a 2D Sanic Hegehog game in that you can perform all these incredible moves but get stopped up every few seconds and it takes longer than I appreciate to recover.

Side-scrolling platformer with blade fighting. Nice graphics that don't try to be too realistic keeping it's own colorful, animeish charm, a few characters, lots of different items to collect, 5-8 hours to play (takes a lot more if you are trying to find and buy everything) and the best; a bounty hunter Kit Ballard, the nekomimi and main character of the game. After the game got back to Steam, many things changed from the first release. Controlling Kit is better and the game got a little bit harder. Especially at the beginning you notice that if you aren't prepared, you find yourself dying many times in a row. But, after you get to know the controls, know what attacks work best for different enemies and buy yourself new blades and extend your HP and stamina, you will beat the game pretty easily. The soundtrack and levels were nice and I loved the hints of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger.\n\nThe shortness of the game made me pretty sad and the ending just wasn't right (Episode 2 is seriously needed). Also the story... Okay, it was something that you couldn't understand that well if you hadn't read the comic (wink wink, you can read a little bit of it in BK's official site). Sometimes there weren't actual story going on, you just killed enemies and tried to proceed (and find stuff maybe). But that didn't really matter. I just kept playing.\n\nOtherwise I enjoyed the game. I loved how Kit could climb almost everywhere and the humour of the game was something that got me. Even after beating the game I'm still playing it trying to find and buy all the stuff. While the game may not be the best platformer and especially not the best game of Krome Studios (I've been always a huge fan of Krome's games). It still has it's own charm and fun. If you are a too serious gamer with picky and hardcore taste, this isn't for you. Nekomimi girls can be pretty cruel 'ya know, but if you really don't like cute-looking catgirls, stay away if you aren't into the platforming part of the game. My score for the game would be 7/10.","May 25, 2014","true","41.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As someone that grew up with the likes of Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, and Ty, it took me back to my PS2 days in terms of gameplay.  It's a fun hack n' slash that takes you to Hollow Wish as a bounty hunter Felion (cat person-y...thing)  Since its re-release, the controls have gotten tighter and the AI responds better.  One on one, most enemies will pose no major threat.  In fact, many are susceptible to one certain type of attack or another. But when you are swarmed with Darques, trying to get that last fragging item you need and you keep dying to sludge projectiles and you break two keyboards in a blind rage because THEY ARE EVERYWHERE...you'll understand the difficulty isn't in just completion.  It's in the 100% completion.\n\nThe story itself may be lost on those that haven't read the comic by the same name, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying it any less.  (If anything, I went to the Blade Kitten site and read what Space Captain Steve had up there.)  For fans of the comic, there are plenty of costumes to giggle over, and enough cameos to make a fun episode.  Sadly, there was no Alamo or Gatty in this one, but you can unlock Justice, Lucy, Sun Dae costumes.  Through the game, you avoid deathly lasers, noinks in red suits, and the occasional visit from Cthu--FALDERDAN, RUN!  The goal is to wander through this planet, beat up the crook, and make a nice profit while you are at it.  But our protaganist, Kit Ballard, finds that she's taking jobs and not asking enough questions.\n\nThe world is bright and colourful, with a lot of fast paced action and some precise jumping.  It's cartoony, which I like and is rare to find in a market over-saturated with hyper-realistic FPSers, Racers, and Sports titles.  The background/foreground interplay give the platformer a sense of added depth and deception, as many of the goodies are stashed in places you'd overlook or not even notice.\n\nThe sound quality is pretty crisp and clear.  The music is upbeat, which I like, and lends to the overall cartoony world.  Every so often, you'll hear someone screaming, "Situation: Oscar Mama Golf" and get a cheap giggle.  They also have some sound queues, hinting at certain items being in the area.  The voice acting was okay, but a lot of the voices were re-used, making the few NPCs you get to talk to sound flat and dull.\n\nThe game is by no means the best of its genre.  At times, you can glitch through certain walls and fall into puddles of toxic waste causing insta-death.  Other times, you may get annoyed at the sudden white distortion splashed against your screen.  And some of the cutscenes (in my experience, the final cutscene) begin playing the audio before you even complete the fight, so you had two sets of audio playing when the scene actually starts.  I had a few crashes after hours of gameplay.  And in one cutscene, Kit glitched out looking something akin to the Ben Drowned statue.  But you aren't spending $60 dollars on this title.  For the price, I would definitely recommend this game.\n\nWith the return of control of this title back to Krome Studios, there are plans to release the second episode of this bright story.  Do not be fooled.  The game is -not- dead.  It was just sleeping for a long time in AtariLand.\n\nTLDR:  The game is fun, hack'n'slash goodness.  A little glitchy in unimportant places.  For $6 bucks, it's worth it.  Even moreso if you can snag it for $3.  7.5/10","May 25, 2014","true","26.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I dig the quasi-JRPG style and a lot of the game design is actually rock solid. It has good platforming elements, good exploration, secrets to find, weapon upgrades, costume unlocks. The combat seems a little sketchy at first, but it makes more sense once you realize that the game expects you to take a more leap-and-dodge, hit-and-run approach to combat (especially don't forget about that slide kick!) instead of  running in with blade swinging like a berserker.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't feel like I can recommend the game because the controls are just way too sketchy. Controlling the character does not feel as responsive as it should, which really detracts from the fun of playing an ultra-agile type character. There are also a lot of buggy behaviors with walls and floor when you move the character eratically. For example, Kit is supposed to automatically cling to walls and climb them as easily as walking, which she normally does. But sometimes you'll attach to a wall and kit will automatically start climbing down and will keep climbing down even though you're not pressing the controls, and will keep climbing down even when you press up to get her to go the other way. I also experienced a situation several times where, if you throw up her shield/hold move where she stabs her blade into the ground, but you do it around an edge coming out of a fall, she will sometimes fall halfway through the floor, so only her head is sticking up out of the ground. Also, within the first ten minutes of playing, I somehow managed to get kit stuck in the shield/hold position where she would default back to shield/hold every time I stopped walking, and I had to leap around like a crazy monkey for a minute to get her to stop doing it. These are but a few of the "buggy but passable" behaviors you may experience.\n\nThe aesthetic is great, the attitude is great, the game design principles are rock solid. Really the only thing that truly hurts this game is that the character controls do not feel very tight. They are aaalllmost there. It's so close that some people will consider the other positives enough to overlook the loose and shaky controls, and if that's you then buy it up. But I think for a game that is supposed to be an action platformer with hit-and-run combat and ninja-agile character, the controls should be super tight, and they very simply are not.","August 22, 2015","false","1.0"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

If you're not invested in the Blade Kitten webcomic, then the story is going to make almost no sense to you whatsoever, as it assumes almost full knowledge of who its characters are and what exactly is going on on the part of the player. That said, at least most of the dialog is snappy and Kit is definitely a fun character to see interacting with everyone.\n\nThe game itself is sort of a Strider-lite, padded out with "COLLECT EVERY SINGLE THING EVER" elements. Attention was paid to making sure Kit was as agile and zippy as the game's title might imply, and stages are huge enough for you to explore around in for quite some time.  Combat however, is largely unsatisfying and the simple weapon upgrades are hardly distinguishable from one another other than attack power and their various special attacks, which all do the same thing anyway (one-hit kill normal enemies).\n\nThe real bummer is Blade Kitten has a ton of technical issues including terrible framerates, dodgy input detection, and Kit getting stuck inside geometry, forcing checkpoint and stage restarts. The technical issues are common enough to become a hindrance, and there's not really anything you can do on your end to fix them.

In fact, a few of the hours I've logged in this game have been spent on the pause menu as I got so bored I started doing other things instead.\n\nThe music is pretty good, and level design isn't half bad. At times it feels like a (good) Crash Bandicoot game, even to the point I'd call it fun! However, that's about all this game does well.\n\nThe game has a currency/upgrade system, which is fine until you realize there's only one weapon worth getting. Most of your money goes into stamina upgrades, as the alternate costumes are bland and uninteresting. Health upgrades should normally be as effective as stamina boosts, but the only times your health hits zero are instant-death situations.\n\nMost of the combat in this game revolves around hitting the attack button until something happens. If you don't have the (very inexpensive, you can get it during the first level) final sword, almost every attack will bounce off and you have to use 'special' attacks which consist of swinging your sword out a bit further and sliding. There's also a ground-pound attack that takes far too much stamina to use.\n\nPlatforming in this game relies mostly on physics. That's not a good thing. You often find yourself stuck on a wall, pushed through the level, or outright unable to run and jump. The game has an aspect of velocity to it that doesn't make much sense in an action platformer. The entire game feels like a poorly programmed ice level with a stamina bar.\n\nNitpicking time? Nitpicking time. There's a section at the end of the game where you're forced to climb long sections of walls while flying bugs attack you. Being attacked while climbing makes you fall. There are enemies with shields that can deal minor damage while stunlocking you, and if there are two surrounding you then you'd better hope you didn't buy any health upgrades. It's best just to run past them as you need to use a special grab attack to take away their shield. Special attacks take stamina, also known as the make-the-game-go-by-faster meter.\n\nThe final boss is well designed. Brings together a culmination of the game's essentials: climbing, running, jumping, and attacking. However it's heavily dampened by the horribly annoying four or so lines of dialogue being constantly spewed and the fact that all of the things I just mentioned are broken. I ended up exiting the game and watching the ending on youtube for a sense of finality. The plot's not even that great, considering you have to read the (not so good by any means) comic series that the game neglects to tell you about.\n\nOverall it's a good port in terms of additional content and playability, but you can't just paint a brick wall red and call it art.","January 12, 2015","false","7.4"," 30 of 53 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","30","53","4","0"

Kit is a breaker, which is a bounty hunter, I don't know why they didn't just call her a bounty hunter, maybe due to her close resemblance to Dog the bounty hunter, they wanted to avoid a lawsuit. Kit is also apparently a comic book character, I have not read the comics, but they are probably a treat But they're not as good as Marmaduke\nLook at you sitting at the table, Marmaduke. Who are you to do that? You're just a dog.\n\nIn Blade Kitten, Kit arrives on the planet Hollow Wish in search of a bounty, go figure. But unfortunately, her bounty chip (card?) is stolen by a rival who is, sadly, also not my girlfriend, and Kit has to get it back. What happens after is a journey across Hollow Wish to both get your stuff back, stop the Sols (I think they're called the Sols), and track down your bounty.\n\nThe game uses a typical side scrolling jump and fight collectathon style. Kit, being a cat girl, is very nimble and can move around the terrain easily, and probably do that think where cats lick their legs and it sticks out all weird and stuff. The animations themselves are rather basic and stiff, though they're not offensive enough to ruin the experience. Kit also has what you call a hover blade, which she can use to fight enemies up close or at a distance.\n\nThis is the part where I talk about the environment.\n\nThe game, althought colorful, has rather generic set pieces for you to prowl along through. See what I did there? Cause she's a cat.\nIt almost looks like a cartoon movie from the 90's actually. You have a city made out of some sort of stone substance that isn't brick, you have a sewer level, some cat walk levels (haha), and an open plain level where you can ride around on a weird raptor horse thing.\n\nSpeaking of 90's cartoon movie, the voice actors themselves don't seem all that into it. Kit's manages to get her personality across, but other than that, a bunch of her lines seem ham fisted or half heartily delivered. Much like the gameplay, it is stiff like the whiskey I fix myself every morning to help me forget. Why did I let them die?\n\nAnd further mo- Wait, that's it? It's over? That was like... Two hours. Oh, there's an episode two coming soon, when did this game come out?\n2010? Get out of here.\n\nI guess you can say this game is short of purrfect. It's nothing to write home about, but it's also nothing to hate. If you can get this game for...Three dollars or so, you'll probably be good to go.\nBlade Kitten: waifu wars: the reckoning: HD Edition: Third Strike, only on PS2, gets two kitty claws out of a possible four.\n\nMy favorite mythological creature is the pregnant Chinese woman.\n\nThe Curator, a place where I speak about my deepest and darkest secrets:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","February 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","9","14","12","0"

I don't know if later it will say I have more time or whatever, but yeah.\n\n\nSo Blade Kitten. This game costs around 6 bucks on steam I think. The game is about a teen catgirl in between cute and sexy who uses a floating blade thing to beat the crap out of enemies. The game has some charm and I'm going to come out and admit that I'll be a little biased in it's favor since I adore catgirls <3. With that said the game is pretty average. It doesn't stand out a lot and it has a somewhat generic plot. The game is actually based on a comic or something (which I couldn't get into).\n\nThere are a lot of 'quirky' lines in the game that border on beng the kind of memes I dislike with the soldiers saying things like 'lima oscar lima' which translates to 'LOL' . For some this is comedy. For me it is another reason to not be immersed. Also the phrase 'falterdan' is essentially the ef word for anyone curious.\n\nThe game is pretty silly and mildly comedical, but tries to pull a little balony out of it's butt with a sudden 'seriousness' which wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't find myself sympathizing with the soldiers more than the main character. The soldiers also could make cool characters because they are silly. I guess what i'm saying is that they make bad bad guys and the main bad guy is...lame and generic. Also the final boss is a little bit of an 'i don't care, why am i helping' sort of moment.\n\nThe music is ok, but there isn't a lot of variance. The environment is actually pretty nice and the side scrolling is done pretty well. Platforming isn't really frustrating and the controls work well for what it is. I like the concept of the game and would love to see more catgirls, but I think this game either needs to go full wacky or take a step back and reconsider having the enemies shout 'get her you noinks!' (it means noob for those who don't know).\n\nOverall the game is just a little above average. I like the main character's design and her personality has at least a little depth to it. The game itself is complete and fairly polished. The game runs well, just fails to stand out. Worth 6 or 7 bucks? Debatable. I'd say grab it somewhere beneath 5 bucks though, but it really isn't all that bad.","June 19, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Just don't. The protagonist may be a catgirl and the story definitely sounds like some 14 year old's favorite fanfic, but somewhere beneath the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting and the vainness behind buying costumes for Kit that do nothing but reveal slightly more of her unmentionables lies one of the best platformers to come out for the PC. Although some of the physics can get wonky, especially when climbing up walls, the controls never feel like that big of a burden. The soundtrack is surprisingly great, fusing traditional East Asian rythms and instraments with Electronic music. Graphically, the game is above average for an indie game, but the animations are some of the best I've ever seen; AAA title or otherwise (eat it, Bethesda.) The combat does have a steep learning curve, but where this game really shines is in the exploration.

Oh, and did I mention that the price has been reduced to roughly 1/3 of its original cost with Episode 2 planned to be released at around the same price?\n\nGameplay-wise, Blade Kitten is a solid 2D Action Platformer with tight controls, good physics, decent combat, fun level design, and enough optional exploration/collectibles to appeal to folks who are into that sort of thing.\n\nGraphics-wise, Blade Kitten looks good. The graphics are by no means ground-breaking or cutting-edge, (this is a game from 2010 by a rather small developer, after all) but they serve their purpose by illustrating a colorful and interesting world.\n\nSound-wise, the game is average but adequate. The voice acting is decent and the music (while somewhat forgettable) is by no means unpleasant to listen to.\n\nStory-wise, Blade Kitten is fun and interesting. Kit is an amusing and likeable protagonist, and most of the other characters are amusing and likeable as well. The story so far is incomplete as Episode 1 ends on a cliffhanger, but it left me wanting more and I eagerly await the release of Episode 2.\n\nOverall, Blade Kitten is a solid buy for the price. It's a fun game that will keep fans of the genre entertained and leave them wanting more. If you enjoy 2D Action Platformers with solid gameplay, colorful graphics, and an amusing cast of characters, then I highly recommend checking out Blade Kitten.","June 17, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I haven't finished it in one sitting, so it's definitely not short + there are lots of unlockables on each level I haven't found yet, the controls don't seem 100% intuitive at start, but while you get used to them, there's absolutely no problem in navigating at all (just wsad, shift and e to use an action). Voice acting is 100% fine for me, the story isn't FF7-like, but it's fun to follow. The only drawback I have is that the game runs on 30FPS, and it makes my eyes tired since it's quite dynamic ;X.

Worth 100% of the price.\n\nLong version\nThe game is a little funky with the controls but its still fun. It has a nice story with a lot of BAM moments, like BAM now this, BAM now that, BAM boss time. Its cute and funny too, more jokes that make me laugh from a character that is easily loveable and very adorable instead of trying so hard for some over the top meta crap. My play time at the time of this review was 4.2 hours, I only ran to the end of the levels and did not try to collect or replay parts. Not because it was bad but because I like to do things fast, so depending on your play style, thats about how long the game is. It was my own personal preference though. I like to speed run, there was a lot to look at though and now that I beat it on my little speed run I think I'll play it again and take my time .The game isnt perfect, no game really is but it gets a 10/10 from me.

But, it most likely will not entertain you if you aren't a fan of the webcomic.\n\nThe gameplay really depends upon what controller you are using..This is one of those games in which i can barely play it with a mouse and keyboard. You NEED a controller. Without a controller, i kept getting stuck to walls, slashing in the wrong direction, and i had a lot of trouble just getting through some of the very easy puzzles because of how bad the keyboard/mouse controls are. With a controller, it is MUCH easier to control and works quite well. The only issues i had is that the combat is somewhat imprecise.\n\nThe graphics are Cel-shaded..But in a style that doesn't compliment it too well. It seems extremely cartoonish and silly and appears very "Meh". Had they focused more on making it like the comic style (emphasising the lines and details of the characters), it would have worked better.\n\nConsidering the current price, i give it a recommendation to buy.\n\nAs for the game itself, i give it a 6.5/10","September 7, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Proably also liking Cat´s doesnt were a reason for liking it, since my first impression was "Huh... another stupid Platformer game who thinks just a cute character makes it good"\n\nWhat i mostly miss in other games is the smoothness of being able to control them just as this game!\nMy Combo´s works fawless and always is like i want.\nThe Story is beside nothing outstanding as you just follow some Girl (another headhunter) as yourself you were being forced to lose your headhunter key and ship to that *****!\n\nThe gameplay is easy the combo´s need to be used to same for defending and attacking emeny´s.\nOH and dont forget to get fishs, treasure chests and money you can collect all you´re way alone through the Maps.\nAlso activating keypoints with sword and friends is a must have you need to be able to do as you need them here and there sometimes (or for treasures/money/fishs)\n\nWould love to having such a kitty here @ home as we own 2 Cats yourself 83\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1-2:\n--------------------\nI noticed serveral Bugs and AI loses when going through the Episode 1 of this game.\nOne time it was so big that i did hangs like 7 dayz just to notice the Emeny could be killed while being stucked into a wall he needed to smash (you know what i mean with that)\n\nAnother Bug i noticed was the guys with shileds coudln´t be harmed after even 30-40 hits some all directions (weird!?) not even stunning them with the jump slash they could be harmed..\n\nAnd now today...\nsuddenly the game did let me go through all those bugs that´s why i could finally finishing it as i it seems i was already very near the end (2 Levels, maybe 30 minutes later it asked to buy Episode 2)\n\n\n\n@Developer\n-------------------\nYou should play your game and see the various Bugs i had been delivered!\nMake those weirdo bugs away and this game is really fawless!!!\nGJ so far done by you guys!\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2-2:\n--------------------\nI will Update again later on, when i bought and finished the 2nd Episode of this amazing game!","September 30, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got super bored doing nothing but just climbing every wall and breaking open yet another divergent path over an utterly massive area just to get money to buy items that you really don't need to beat the whole game. There is also no clarity as to which direction is the "right" one so you can't really skip the collectathon, and it feels all about collecting money. It could have really benefitted from more levels that are smaller and more interestingly designed. The gameplay is also very slow and floaty, no satisfying snappiness to the controls, and the combat could have been so much more. The bad asian stereotype shopkeeper was offensive. All that said, they have at least come a long way with the title over the years. It used to run waaaaay worse.\n\nIf you like annoyingly huge open levels where you slowly do almost nothing but collect money for pointless things between fairly boring cutscenes, get this. If you like satisfying platforming, fun action, tight and engaging controls, and requiring skill, you may want to go for something like Shantae or Freedom Planet instead.","June 24, 2015","false","11.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Gameplay wise it also reminds me a bit of 2014's remake of "Strider" - if you liked that one, "Blade Kitten" might appeal to you too. It's like a "Strider light" in every way (including the much lighter tone) - a fast paced metroidvanian jump'n hack&slash. I really wish there were more games like that out there.\n\n2) Since episode 2 is out, the game is finally complete. If episode 2 is installed, it gets merged seamlessly into the main game to bring it to a conclusion - nice! I like that they took the difficulty up a notch here, too. The game is still rather easy, though, and I wish the bosses were a little bit more challenging.\n\nAnyway "Blade Kitten" is a cute time waster that is easily worth its very moderate "full price". Yay team! :-)","June 21, 2015","true","22.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is possibly short for people who don't wanna collect the hidden tresures and items, but each stage is about a half hour long if you want to fully complete both episodes and make it to 200% give-or-take.

Unfortuanly the game does not really explain the story very well and at times I was often left wondering what was going on.\nNo matter though as most people are more concerned with gameplay right?\n\nThe controls are tight and it is fun to zip around as kit and take down enemies with ease. You wont find anything that is new and exciting in this game but that is fine, sometimes it is just nice to be able to play through a game without much thought and enjoy a fun game just for the sake of playing.\n\nThe game is on the cheap side and I had fun with it myself, so this game is easy to recommend.\n","July 28, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got this in a bundle, and it looked fun, but it's an honest disappointment.

Ten minutes in I was hung over with massive gaming sickness.  Five hours later, I'm only just starting to come around...\n\nThe gameplay is rather standard, using a similar movement system to the space ninja shooter WARFRAME for acrobatic commands, for a platformer: climb, run, jump, and look for secret areas while following a breadcrumb trail of currency.   Honestly, Mario Bros. for the Gameboy did it better.

I got super bored doing nothing but just climbing every wall and breaking open yet another divergent path over an utterly massive area just to get money to buy items that you really don't need to beat the whole game. There is also no clarity as to which direction is the "right" one so you can't really skip the collectathon, and it feels all about collecting money. It could have really benefitted from more levels that are smaller and more interestingly designed. The gameplay is also very slow and floaty, no satisfying snappiness to the controls, and the combat could have been so much more. The bad asian stereotype shopkeeper was offensive. All that said, they have at least come a long way with the title over the years. It used to run waaaaay worse.\n\nIf you like annoyingly huge open levels where you slowly do almost nothing but collect money for pointless things between fairly boring cutscenes, get this. If you like satisfying platforming, fun action, tight and engaging controls, and requiring skill, you may want to go for something like Shantae or Freedom Planet instead.","June 24, 2015","false","11.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I can deal with very poorly written Japanese-wannabe teen dialogue ("Win Get!" "Situation Oscar Mike Golf!" (yes, the enemies say OMG) "Do want!" and more) and the awful voice-acting. I can deal with the weird implications of a cat-girl collecting bagged goldfish and the button-mashy fighting.\n\nWhat I can't deal with is broken mechanics and lazy development. Melee enemies that can attack you from a different plane than you, so you can't hit them back. The player being pushed off the correct plane, dropping you through the world. No dead-zone on the control stick, so you are forced to move in a direction if you want to do a slide (which is mainly a combat move). No indication when the overhead grab will and won't work, and using the same button as the wall-grab, sticking you to a ceiling if you're too close during combat, which you can't attack from. Enemies continuing to attack you while you're in an attack animation against them. Being stun-locked by constant staggering attacks (and sometimes map hazards) for 20+ seconds, until death.\n\nAnnoyances include: Fast stamina usage and slow regen. Run-jumping becomes a long-lump and you lose the ability to double-jump, meaning if you're running and want to do a jump up to a higher level, you will instead shoot off the side. No benefits to collecting collectables besides completionism.\n\nNow, the gameplay itself is fine. Bland, but it works, for the most part. But this is no Strider, and the plot will send you to sleep, only to be woken up by the occasional cringe when the protagonist speaks.","March 7","false","7.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

The controls are 'iffy', and I really hate that I can't map movement to the d-pad instead of the gorram analog stick, especially since the game requires quick turns during combat and analog sticks can 'whiplash' and make you end up facing the wrong direction (this happened to me A LOT during play). Most of the control issues are really because the character just has too much going on and the controls aren't really locked down to any single mechanic, so even walking around feels floaty, and jumping is pretty ridiculous in some cases. You can stick to walls and cielings and climb around on them, you can also do Metroid-style wall jumps in cases where you can't stick to the wall. There's also these weird glowy things that try to make you land on them while jumping if you're anywhere near them. The tip sign says they're only supposed to draw you in if you hold the L-trigger, but it seems that they're always on instead. In any case, the controls are functional but need work before they can feel natural and repsonsive.\n\nCombat is sort of bad. I mean I was only in the first stage, but the problems were immediately evident, and I expect them to get worse as the game progresses. The main problem is that your stun animation is extremely slow, and you're not invulnerable during it, so it's incredibly easy to get stunlocked just by standing too close to an enemy, let alone between two. To add to the frustration, the enemies seem to be invulnerable during their close-range attacks, so you can get into some really crappy situations that aren't fun or challenging, but simply frustrating.\n\nThe character dialog isn't childish, but simply corny. I had though that we had advanced as a society since the early 90's, but clearly I was wrong: We've simply added memes into the vocabulary of "things that kids say".\n\nDespite all that, this is a workable platformer, and some of the moves are cool when you pull them off. I got the game on sale, and I don't really feel bad about it, despite not being able to play because of my motion sickness, which - again - is not the game's fault; I'm just overly sensitive to certain camera movements.\n\nIn the end I decided to vote up because when I was originally considering the purchase I saw a number of very concerning issues being raised in the negative reviews. They almost all turned out to be bunk, or at least far less of a problem than was being indicated. For instance, a couple reviewers said that there's no way to block. There are - in fact - two ways to block. You can simply hold the attack button for half a second, or you can use the L-Trigger to activate your shield and grab onto the ground. There doesn't appear to be any limitation on this either. You can sit there for days and the shield soaks up all the damage, so I'm not sure what that was all about. Additionally, some reviews rightfully cited control issues, but wrongfully exaggerated them to apocalyptic proportions. The controls feel floaty and sometimes wall-gymnastics don't go how you planned them, but they are entirely workable, and I've certainly seen a lot worse on more expensive games. Finally, the stunlock issue was presented by some as game-breaking. It's annoying and frustrating, but it's also very easy to deal with if you just activate the shield for a moment and then jump out of the crossfire between attacks.\n\nAnyway, that's my 2 bits.","January 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatisarat/recommended/9940/","whatisarat","Dangerous Beans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatisarat/","407 products in account","I only played this game for a little while, and it has some problems, but the reason I stopped playing is that I was getting motion sickness from the camera zooming in and out, which is my problem rather than a problem with the game.\n\nI was on the border about how to rate this. The controls are 'iffy', and I really hate that I can't map movement to the d-pad instead of the gorram analog stick, especially since the game requires quick turns during combat and analog sticks can 'whiplash' and make you end up facing the wrong direction (this happened to me A LOT during play). Most of the control issues are really because the character just has too much going on and the controls aren't really locked down to any single mechanic, so even walking around feels floaty, and jumping is pretty ridiculous in some cases. You can stick to walls and cielings and climb around on them, you can also do Metroid-style wall jumps in cases where you can't stick to the wall. There's also these weird glowy things that try to make you land on them while jumping if you're anywhere near them. The tip sign says they're only supposed to draw you in if you hold the L-trigger, but it seems that they're always on instead. In any case, the controls are functional but need work before they can feel natural and repsonsive.\n\nCombat is sort of bad. I mean I was only in the first stage, but the problems were immediately evident, and I expect them to get worse as the game progresses. The main problem is that your stun animation is extremely slow, and you're not invulnerable during it, so it's incredibly easy to get stunlocked just by standing too close to an enemy, let alone between two. To add to the frustration, the enemies seem to be invulnerable during their close-range attacks, so you can get into some really crappy situations that aren't fun or challenging, but simply frustrating.\n\nThe character dialog isn't childish, but simply corny. I had though that we had advanced as a society since the early 90's, but clearly I was wrong: We've simply added memes into the vocabulary of "things that kids say".\n\nDespite all that, this is a workable platformer, and some of the moves are cool when you pull them off.

In it, you control this cat girl with a giant floating blade and slash the enemies with combos that involve pressing the slash button very fast. The levels are gigantic and there's lots of hidden stuff. You can see the developers put some good effort into this game. The gameplay is decent. Not awesomely spetacular, but it's quite playable.\n\nThe characters are, like, ugh, sooooooooooo obnoxious. I mean, c'mon! The way they all speak is sooooooooo annoying. Their quips are irritating and it feels like the characters are trying hard to sound like teenagers (which isn't even a good thing to aim for, if you ask me). You'll feel cringe at some parts of the game that aren't gameplay related.\n\nStill, it's a good game. It's still receiving updates from the developers and all, so it's not an abandoned project.

Blade Kitten looked interesting at first glance, but it wasn't able to keep up with that first impression. The story as far as I played was non-existent other than chasing a blonde girl just to exchange insults when you catch up so she can run off again. That's it. No reason, no explanation, no world-building whatsoever. It's a catgirl with a sword chopping up lots of generic guards. I wasn't expecting a literary marvel but come on I at least want some kind of plot thread that's not out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon.\n\nThe combat did not gel with me either. Combat for the most part consists of swinging the sword, and having it blocked, or trying to swing the sword and getting stunlocked by two enemies kicking you repeatedly. I looked at the Blade menu and found out the swords had stats, but they don't seem to do anything. I bought the Grengis which had near max stats in all categories except Recharge, while boasting that it would break through any defense. Hah, no. No change at all in combat. I still get blocked and kicked and stabbed. It also doesn't help that everything is extremely floaty, so there's no feeling of solid control. More like I'm sliding around and slashing haphazardly.\n\nAll in all I don't recommend Blade Kitten. There's nothing worth playing here unless you really happen to like pink-haired catgirls that the game tries to tell you is a top-tier bounty hunter with a serious face.","May 22, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

How cute!!!". I was so happy to be wrong!\n\nI love this game, the acrobatic platforming is so addictive. I love that Kit (the protag) is taken seriously as a character and is still cute and tough while not being turned into a fan-service joke.\n\nSome of the problems I had with this game however is that this game has a LOT of controls to keep track of and almost no tutorial. I was playing on keybroad and almost all of the default controls were useless when I first started. I had to manually set all of them, which isn't that big of a deal. (I do strongly recommend playing with a controller though.)\n\nSecondly the pacing of the story felt a bit rushed, in the beginning it was hard to keep track of what exactly was happening due to the fact that you're on to the next thing so quickly, the pervious thing was barely explained at all. But such is the life of a galatic bounty hunter I guess.\n\nI only experienced one glitch in this game, and it was when you're blowing up the floor to get to a lower level of a temple (level 6 I believe). There was a pillar I couldn't move past, and I thought I had to do something to get it to move, but when I couldn't figure out what that something was (after about 20 minutes of screwing around) I decided to take a break and exitd the game. When I re-entered the game I found I could simply walk past that pillar that I was blocked by before. Turns out it was suppose to be part of the background, but like I said simply restarting the game fixed the problem and it was right after a save point anyway so no loss.\n\nOverall:\n\nPro's: fun and addictive platforming, cute cartoony style while still taking the story line seriously and being respectful of all the characters.\n\nCon's: pacing felt a bit rushed, default controls are wonky if you're using a keybroad.","February 5, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No 100 items or weapons to choose from, but enough to make you consider a weapon or upgrade.\n\n- Story does not always convince, jumping from here to their and some choices feel out of place.\n- Misses some emotion.\n\nSome of the serious events are taken up to light heartidly while I would find it more then acceptable either for a human or a half cat lady to be completely enraged or even heartbroken. And that doesn't happen at any point. Yes she gets a bit angry, but that to me is not approriate enough when someone blows up your ship worth a whole bunch of money and stranding you on a planet. Or even introducing a homocidal alien race that whiped out her people and will not stop till they have consumed all, and then being a bit angry but determined.

Cel shading will age well and always give a nice clean look.\n- Some of the murky sections with the pale greens and brown looked out of place.\n\n+ A wide variety of combat and movement mechanics. Can lead to interesting platforming and fights.\n- Controls feel sluggish, especialy when enemies hit you. Most of their attacks will stun you, which will lead to very slow and frustrating fights, especially when you get swarmed by enemies all stunning you with their multiple attacks.\n\n+ Excellent audio. The sound effects work and the soundtrack is awesome. I've listened to the OST a couple of times for fun.\n- Voice acting can be a little annoying at times, especially with the main shopkeeper. His accent will really get to you and his dialogue can get really repetitive. More variety in his dialogue and an accent easier on the ears would've been much nicer.\n\n+ The game features 13 levels, 4 different blades, 13 costumes and 10 passive upgrades. This all adds up to more content than usually expected for such a cheap game. Additionally, more content is on the way when Episode 2 release.\n- The following is what I find the most annoying about the game. While the levels are open, which is nice, the are littered with the ingame currency, treasure chests and a multitude of collectibles. The game for me went from a fun action-filled light-hearted adventure, to a game about walking to every single corner of each level, making sure that I hadn't missed some sort of collectable. I don't enjoy spending all of my time searching for the 142 Treasure Chests, 20 Skiffs, 20 Datapaks and the seemingly infinite amount of hex across every level. Sure, a couple of treasure chests for each level would've been great. It would've been fun exploring each location for that 1 or those 2 treasure chests, however, having 142 makes every single one seem sort of meaningless. That's not even taking into account the other 40 collectables that you have to find. I feel that this game could've easily been much better if there were far less collectables. I eventually just gave up crawling around every location to collect every Hex, and instead tried just running through every level. I found that much more enjoyable.\n\nIf you enjoy the Blade Kitten Webcomics or you are a fan of sidescrollers, you will probably enjoy this. For everyone else, just expect a few hours of fun. There are a few minor problems, as listed above, that could be easily fixed. Change the colours of some areas. Change the effects of most of the enemy attacks so most of them don't stun the player. Change the voice actor for the shopkeeper and give him more lines of dialogue. I doubt that fixing these should take up too much time, and in my opinion it will bump up the game from a 6 or 7/10 to a 7 or 8/10.\nThe biggest problem, in my opinion, is that there are collectables scattered everywhere, and too much of my time playing the game was spent look for every single one of theses. I gave up in the end, but making the levels smaller and reducing the amount of collectables could allow the players to focus their time on the combat, platforming and story. Still allow some exploration, and keep a few collectables, but having 182 things to find over 13 levels is too overwhelming, and just makes the game kind of boring. Fixing this, along with the minor problems, would make this game a solid 8/10, or even possibly a 9/10. For now, the game is 7/10 from me.","January 10, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blade Kitten is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. From it's gorgeous graphics, immersive musical scores, clever dialog & witty humor, to it's amazing character presentation, Blade Kitten outdoes itself in every category from start to finish. Kit Ballard is a strong female protagonist that's not just the paradigm of the purrrr-fect hero, but a model for all women everywhere. The games story is a classic tail of adventure and self discovery. But don't be fooled by this jolly romp: it's also very intelligent, sprinkled with political commentary on topical issues that affect our lives today, covering topics such as the equal rights of women to the war in Iraq. The gameplay is a creative mish-mash of 2D platforming seamlessly rendered in 3D environments for an experience unlike any other! The bottom line is that if you have ever enjoyed video games in your life, you owe it to yourself to get this game ASAP.","November 19, 2010","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

As you advance in the game, you will be allowed to buy new swords and costumes, which will even reflect in cutscenes.\n\nThe colours, the backgrounds, Kit's animations and the game replayability (you'll always wonder where is that secret you missed on this stage, or how cute/badass will Kit look while performing this attack, or in that cutscene) made me wonder when Blade Kitten Episode 2 would be released.\n\nAlthough it is fully playable with a keyboard, I recommend a game controller.

The writing for the game is witty and with great humor and care, with great graphics and music. The game has a bunch of interesting traits such exploration for collectibles to increase a completion percentage and a simple, yet functional combat system with moves like controllable angle short range slashes, middle range slashes, low, sliding kick attacks, a jump and dive slash and others that let you adapt to changing circumstances and enemies. it's not slash, slash, slash, jump, slash again.\n\nThe story presentation is done through animated cutscenes instead of stills or simply the in-game character models. The voice acting is also excellent, which makes for watching them a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game can feel a bit short, but the amount of unlockables and exploration greatly make this game worthy of revisits and its replayability makes it much more inviting.\n\nGive it a good shot. Play the demo or jump straight into the game. This is a game that has much more heart in every piece that comprises it than many other rehashed game entries we see year after year.\n\nThe second episode has been released in the form of DLC.

How cute!!!". I was so happy to be wrong!\n\nI love this game, the acrobatic platforming is so addictive. I love that Kit (the protag) is taken seriously as a character and is still cute and tough while not being turned into a fan-service joke.\n\nSome of the problems I had with this game however is that this game has a LOT of controls to keep track of and almost no tutorial. I was playing on keybroad and almost all of the default controls were useless when I first started. I had to manually set all of them, which isn't that big of a deal. (I do strongly recommend playing with a controller though.)\n\nSecondly the pacing of the story felt a bit rushed, in the beginning it was hard to keep track of what exactly was happening due to the fact that you're on to the next thing so quickly, the pervious thing was barely explained at all. But such is the life of a galatic bounty hunter I guess.\n\nI only experienced one glitch in this game, and it was when you're blowing up the floor to get to a lower level of a temple (level 6 I believe). There was a pillar I couldn't move past, and I thought I had to do something to get it to move, but when I couldn't figure out what that something was (after about 20 minutes of screwing around) I decided to take a break and exitd the game. When I re-entered the game I found I could simply walk past that pillar that I was blocked by before. Turns out it was suppose to be part of the background, but like I said simply restarting the game fixed the problem and it was right after a save point anyway so no loss.\n\nOverall:\n\nPro's: fun and addictive platforming, cute cartoony style while still taking the story line seriously and being respectful of all the characters.\n\nCon's: pacing felt a bit rushed, default controls are wonky if you're using a keybroad.","February 5, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"strange" and the music isn't in my opinion the best .\nBut why do I recommend this game ?\nBecause I love the combat system in this game even if it takes a while to get used to. There are many different ways to attack (including a "slam attack" kinda like the one in rayman legends) , shielding etc...\nThe story is good, not great but not bad, and the characters you encounter during your journey are charming.\nBut what actually retain my attention are the graphics (character design, environment ,ambiance etc...) which remembers me old sf comics (thinking about Valerian and Laureline if you want to know :3) and even for today's standards seems pretty good. The characters are pretty stylish, colorful and got their own voice acting, and the levels got a pretty good atmoshpere.\nAs for the platforming, basically Kit Ballard, the main character, can climb pretty much every thing, you can wall jump, run ,double jump, you have to resolve some puzzle etc ... nothing new, a little bit to easy, but still effective and fast paced.\nSo , to recap, Blade kitten isn't the best 2D platformer I've ever seen, but it's not the worst and definitely worth the price.\n\nPS : oh and did I forget to say that Kit is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cute :3","April 5, 2015","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I found it to be very entertaining and really enjoyed playing it. The only thing I didn't like was the "flat screen" feel the game has. I like third person games and especailly those that are 360 in scope. It allows you character to explorer the enviroment a bit more and, if the game maker is smart, he will enable some ways to do this. Don't get me wrong, this game as really great to play, but I found myself more than one time trying to get to objects in the rear of the screen or the front of it, off plane from where the character was. It appears that you should be able to and maybe I've not played enough yet, but I found it disappointing. I also ran into trouble at times trying to figure out how to get off one section to another as I'd forget that I couldn't just walk to the background or foreground and find a way around.  All that said, it's a lot of fun to figure out how to move around in an enviroment where you must go left or right or up or down but not forward or backward! Some of he puzzles are very well done and require a good bit of figuring out to solve. I also like the character you must control as she fun to watch.

The writing for the game is witty and with great humor and care, with great graphics and music. The game has a bunch of interesting traits such exploration for collectibles to increase a completion percentage and a simple, yet functional combat system with moves like controllable angle short range slashes, middle range slashes, low, sliding kick attacks, a jump and dive slash and others that let you adapt to changing circumstances and enemies. it's not slash, slash, slash, jump, slash again.\n\nThe story presentation is done through animated cutscenes instead of stills or simply the in-game character models. The voice acting is also excellent, which makes for watching them a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game can feel a bit short, but the amount of unlockables and exploration greatly make this game worthy of revisits and its replayability makes it much more inviting.\n\nGive it a good shot. Play the demo or jump straight into the game. This is a game that has much more heart in every piece that comprises it than many other rehashed game entries we see year after year.\n\nThe second episode has been released in the form of DLC. This adds a few more stages and more achievements, with a final boss that is the right amounts of tricky, difficult and requiring of a proper strategy to defeat.\n\nAnd for the price the game is at, it's almost absurd not to, considering the amount of work that has gone into it.

All in what I think is cel-shading, though I could be wrong about the that.\nThe battles tend to come down to button mashing, but that doesn't get in the way of fun as it's mostly a platformer, and a pretty great one, focusing highly on treasure collection, and if you want, you can jump over and ignore quite a few of the enemies. There are 19 levels, many of which are huge, but if you don't want to explore the first time around, you can get through them pretty quickly and go back later for secrets and treasure.  One thing I haven't seen before in a platformer  is the ability to climb walls, for you see, our protagonist is a catgirl.\nOf course, treasure collection is pointless without a way to spend treasure, so there's an ingame store that allows you to buy health and stamina upgrades, blades(get the strongest one for the least button mashing) and costumes, all with ingame money of course. This store can be accessed at any time once you've met the owner for the first time. There are a lot of costumes, and I do mean a LOT.\nThe writing is pretty good, even if it does tend to suffer a bit from mood whiplash. The whole thing has a nice, witty sense of humor, especially when the protagonist, Kit Ballard, has to deal with Kreel, except when it's suddenly serious time.\n\nI very much reccommend this game. See if you can spot the Ty the Tasmanian Tiger references for extra fun.","March 23, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Based on the Blade Kitten comic (fans can buy the 3 already published issues or read them online in the game's website, with a new page being uploaded every week), this is a 2.5D (3D scenarios and characters, 2D gameplay) action platformer with great physics and lighting, an engaging story and lots of humour. As you advance in the game, you will be allowed to buy new swords and costumes, which will even reflect in cutscenes.\n\nThe colours, the backgrounds, Kit's animations and the game replayability (you'll always wonder where is that secret you missed on this stage, or how cute/badass will Kit look while performing this attack, or in that cutscene) made me wonder when Blade Kitten Episode 2 would be released.\n\nAlthough it is fully playable with a keyboard, I recommend a game controller.

It doesn't really do anything that other games haven't done before, but it does most of the things it does pretty well.  There is a climbing mechanic, hidden collectibles, simple combat, and a cute catgirl.  It has an interesting, surprisingly dark story and jokes which are so bad they're good.  The OST is well worth buying, and I like being able to change to different outfits whenever I feel like it.  I also have to give some major credit to the people at Krome for sticking to it.  The development studio actually came back from the dead and worked for years to see to it that the second half of the story was released.\n\nThe only issues I really have with this game are a couple bugs.  There are some sections where you can end up too far in the foreground or background and be unable to interact with things you need to interact with in order to progress.  The other bug is more minor, but sometimes the character will float a bit too much to seem fluid while attempting to latch onto certain things.\n\nIt may not really innovate, but Blade Kitten is a pretty solid action platformer with a lot of love put into it.","May 15, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now for what I was able to type up after playing:\n\nWhatever you consider it a mix of, it's a pretty fun game. I did not intend to sink 4 hours in one sitting playing it. Combat is fast paced, level design is really interesting and rewards exploring. Some levels have multiple routes, or just multiple ways to traverse a route. Plenty of secrets (in the form of chests), a handful of unlockable upgrades and weapons (but nothing too deep), and even unlockable costumes, some of which look really neat.\n\nHowever, despite me really enjoying it and reccomending it, the list of flaws is bigger than the list of benefits, but they're very minor flaws.\n\nThe game isn't the most polished. For instance, cutscenes and scripted segments act strange when just coming from certain gameplay moments (enemies will move and attack but wont hurt you), and the way it restarts cutscenes if you died shortly after is a bit annoying. There's also some design hiccups in some parts. The game doesn't tell you about all the mechanics in the already unhelpful tutorial. In fact, the game will instruct you about shield breaking (hold down B against enemies with sheilds) while you're fighting the last boss (of episode 1). There are other mechanics you will have to find out on your own because the game doesn't even allude to them, such as jumping from a wall while sticking to it with your sword, to name one. I reccomend just trying to experiement with the controls and then move on from the first level.\n\nAbout more superficial complaints, let me start by saying the story leaves much to be desired. We're given no background about the main character, her rival, the world, what a "breaker" is, and the general lore. However, there is a comic that goes along with it, but that shouldn't be an excuse. Though it's not a big deal because of what story there is, it's really only on par with, say, Sonic Adventure 1 (at least this doesn't have plot holes out the ♥♥♥). About the main character, there are things likable about her: She's cute, she has personality,her character is established fairly, and her voice acting is decent. Everything else isn't that great. She can be annoying, has the charisma of a teenage girl, has a vocabulary that contains the words "Epic Fail", and often times says other stupid things. As for the game's graphics, just pretend this is a port of a PS2 game with upscaled graphics and you'll have no complaints. In fact, the game was made by the same devs as "T.Y. Tasmanian Tiger", a 'we too' attempt at making an animal mascot on the PS2. Though let's just say this game redeems them.\n\nLike I said, all of those complaints are very minor compared to this game's stengths, and you should check it out if you like action platformers. Not only does Episode 1 go for less than 2 dollars during any holiday sale, theres a demo. It's just this game might be a turn off at first, but if you keep with it, you will like it for sure.\n\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that it's fairly short, about 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, depending. This is because this game was going to be released in parts, but part 2 never came for the longest time untill some time in 2015, 5 years after the initial release. Aparantly there was some legal dispute. Either way, the amount of gameplay for 2 bucks during a sale is a good buy, and there is some replay value. As of writing this, I don't know what episode 2 brings to the table, but I'm sure it's more or less the same thing, just more of it.","June 20, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Was it in one of the bundles I bought? Or did I buy it specifically because of the name (yes, I am that easy)? I have no idea. But no matter how I got the game, I'm glad I did.\n\nWhile the story is quite simple (and not all that interesting, to be honest), the game has a lot of charm. The quirky protagonist can be funny at times, the levels are visually interesting and just plain pretty and the movement, ooh the movement.\n\nI really like when a protagonist can move easily through levels and doesn't get stumped by the smallest walls or drops. ("Oh no, a hedge, I can't possibly LIFT MY LEG OVER IT, can I?") Blade Kitten is right up my alley. Kitty moves swiftly and with ease, climbing sheer clifs and overhangs like it's just a stretching excercise. The movement feels really fluid and pleasant. It's a joy to play.\n\nI have noticed that some reviewers found it difficult to do precise platform-to-platform jumps and complained that the movement is perhaps "too fluid". I think that missing some jumps in a platformer game is to be expected ;) I guess it comes down to personal preferences, but it needs to be said that even when you do miss a jump for whatever reason, it's never fatal. You can easily climb back up and try again. This happened to me a few times but it never felt like a chore.\n\nOn the contrary, I felt such joy playing this game. It's just well-designed and well-made game. It throws new things and toys your way very often, so it always stays fresh. Even Kitty herself can be "customised" by buying new costumes. The pacing reminds me of the good old Prehistoric 2. When you got bored with running around and smacking dinosaurs, the game gave you a kite to fly for a whole level or so, which completely changed the dynamic. Blade Kitten's design works similarly and as a consequence never feels dull.\n\nOne small beef I have with the game is that in later levels it's very easy to get stun-locked between multiple enemies. Kitty, attacked from both sides, sometimes can't escape the onslaught, as there's no one-second-immortality-after-being-hit as in other platformers.\n\nOne larger beef I have with the game is that it essentially ends nowhere and prompts you to buy Episode 2. I had no idea that what I have is a story-wise incomplete game. It was a bit of an unpleasant surprise to find out just when the story got a bit more interesting. I don't know the reasoning behind the episodic format. Usually, tactics like these make me feel ripped off as a customer. Still, the game on the whole was a joy to play (and both episodes are quite cheap, anyways), so this time, there are no hard feelings.\n\nThis is the only platformer game I have played end-to-end in just about fifteen years. Because it's just good.","January 20","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a colorful, whimsical platformer that shovels throws various various curriences and strange loot in plentiful and accessible 'secret' areas (and with more and more games demanding you to be more skillful in general, I dig this conspicuous change in skill-reward ratio.)

Not to mention that she just seems to be having so much fun with everything that she and all the other characters play off of each other nicely and make it enjoyable to both fight and watch cutscenes.\n\nThe combat is simplistic, mash the attack button and jump around like a kangaroo. Congrats, you've beaten most of the enemies in the game. There's an interesting mechanic where you can do the aerial wall grab move against certain vulnerable targets for an instant kill with an extra cash reward, but sometimes a move will leave an enemy vulnerable and sometimes the same move won't, so it can be really frustrating when someone blocks all your attacks and won't light up for the finish move. Also, the wall grab prefers to grab walls and ceilings rather than enemies, so if you jump up and try to insta-kill an enemy in a room with a low ceiling, you'll be gluing yourself upside down for a second in the middle of the fight. Also, the move is kind of hard to pull off with a keyboard since you need to use the q button in conjunction with wasd.\n\nThe programming is...well it's finicky. Usually the game works fine, but there are plenty of weird parts. For example, often on the instakill move, Kit or the enemy will be in the wrong location and will slowly drift into position while Kit says her taunt. There are some other weird situations like this, but there's one of these actually has the potential to break your game: for context, this is a 2D game with 3D graphics where you're supposed to run along the x-axis and jump on the y, but there are times where Kit accidentaly moves some distance in the z-direction. This can make her collide with background characters and objects which can actually make it impossible to proceed. If this happens, you had beetter hope you left an enemy alive in the current area so that they can kill you and send you back to the checkpoint.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zenja-soba/recommended/9940/","Zenja-soba","Zenja (James)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zenja-soba/","221 products in account","Ok, quick rough and dirty explanation for how this plays using examples:\n\nImagine Megaman Zero, Donkey Kong, Contra Hard Corps. , Metal Gear Rising if it were 2D, and Prince of Persia.\n\n\nI plan on coming back to give a more elaborate review when I play episode 2 (it's got like a Half-Life thing going on). Now for what I was able to type up after playing:\n\nWhatever you consider it a mix of, it's a pretty fun game. I did not intend to sink 4 hours in one sitting playing it. Combat is fast paced, level design is really interesting and rewards exploring. Some levels have multiple routes, or just multiple ways to traverse a route. Plenty of secrets (in the form of chests), a handful of unlockable upgrades and weapons (but nothing too deep), and even unlockable costumes, some of which look really neat.\n\nHowever, despite me really enjoying it and reccomending it, the list of flaws is bigger than the list of benefits, but they're very minor flaws.\n\nThe game isn't the most polished. For instance, cutscenes and scripted segments act strange when just coming from certain gameplay moments (enemies will move and attack but wont hurt you), and the way it restarts cutscenes if you died shortly after is a bit annoying. There's also some design hiccups in some parts. The game doesn't tell you about all the mechanics in the already unhelpful tutorial. In fact, the game will instruct you about shield breaking (hold down B against enemies with sheilds) while you're fighting the last boss (of episode 1). There are other mechanics you will have to find out on your own because the game doesn't even allude to them, such as jumping from a wall while sticking to it with your sword, to name one. I reccomend just trying to experiement with the controls and then move on from the first level.\n\nAbout more superficial complaints, let me start by saying the story leaves much to be desired. We're given no background about the main character, her rival, the world, what a "breaker" is, and the general lore. However, there is a comic that goes along with it, but that shouldn't be an excuse. Though it's not a big deal because of what story there is, it's really only on par with, say, Sonic Adventure 1 (at least this doesn't have plot holes out the ♥♥♥). About the main character, there are things likable about her: She's cute, she has personality,her character is established fairly, and her voice acting is decent. Everything else isn't that great. She can be annoying, has the charisma of a teenage girl, has a vocabulary that contains the words "Epic Fail", and often times says other stupid things. As for the game's graphics, just pretend this is a port of a PS2 game with upscaled graphics and you'll have no complaints. In fact, the game was made by the same devs as "T.Y. Tasmanian Tiger", a 'we too' attempt at making an animal mascot on the PS2. Though let's just say this game redeems them.\n\nLike I said, all of those complaints are very minor compared to this game's stengths, and you should check it out if you like action platformers. Not only does Episode 1 go for less than 2 dollars during any holiday sale, theres a demo. It's just this game might be a turn off at first, but if you keep with it, you will like it for sure.\n\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that it's fairly short, about 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, depending. This is because this game was going to be released in parts, but part 2 never came for the longest time untill some time in 2015, 5 years after the initial release. Aparantly there was some legal dispute. Either way, the amount of gameplay for 2 bucks during a sale is a good buy, and there is some replay value. As of writing this, I don't know what episode 2 brings to the table, but I'm sure it's more or less the same thing, just more of it.","June 20, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention that she just seems to be having so much fun with everything that she and all the other characters play off of each other nicely and make it enjoyable to both fight and watch cutscenes.\n\nThe combat is simplistic, mash the attack button and jump around like a kangaroo. Congrats, you've beaten most of the enemies in the game. There's an interesting mechanic where you can do the aerial wall grab move against certain vulnerable targets for an instant kill with an extra cash reward, but sometimes a move will leave an enemy vulnerable and sometimes the same move won't, so it can be really frustrating when someone blocks all your attacks and won't light up for the finish move. Also, the wall grab prefers to grab walls and ceilings rather than enemies, so if you jump up and try to insta-kill an enemy in a room with a low ceiling, you'll be gluing yourself upside down for a second in the middle of the fight. Also, the move is kind of hard to pull off with a keyboard since you need to use the q button in conjunction with wasd.\n\nThe programming is...well it's finicky. Usually the game works fine, but there are plenty of weird parts. For example, often on the instakill move, Kit or the enemy will be in the wrong location and will slowly drift into position while Kit says her taunt. There are some other weird situations like this, but there's one of these actually has the potential to break your game: for context, this is a 2D game with 3D graphics where you're supposed to run along the x-axis and jump on the y, but there are times where Kit accidentaly moves some distance in the z-direction. This can make her collide with background characters and objects which can actually make it impossible to proceed. If this happens, you had beetter hope you left an enemy alive in the current area so that they can kill you and send you back to the checkpoint. I know I'm not the only person who's had this problem as I've seen forum posts about the glitch as well.\n\nThe story has a REALLY bad problem of assuming the player has information that they have no way of learning. Nearly the entire game, I'm wandering around in random directions and eventually reach the place I was appreantly supposed to go to. I would travel right to get to the outskirts of town, Kit would get something that she needs to take to the top building in the town and instead of just backtracking a bit I would for some reason end up in a factory underground that I have to climb out of to get into the city. The entire story just keeps dropping you in random places and say "Okay, go to the Holy Island now" with no indication of which direction it's in or how far you are from it.\n\nHonestly, I recommend the game as it's a fun diversion with some really nice characters. However, the game suffers from some issues with it's programming and its narrative conveyance, so just be aware of that going in.\n\nPS: As a side note, on the first computer on which I played this game, a certain cutscene always crashed the game and made it impossible to proceed.

Polished and fun - keeps me coming back!\n\nThe combat feels a bit... cheap at first... like, it lacks impact, I guess would be the best way to explain it. Almost like your attacks are going through each other and have no real punch. However, you get used to it quite fast and it kinda works well with the overall fluidity of the game. Not perfect but still definitely enjoyable.\n\nThe acrobatics are really great and the game handles very well.\n\nDefinitely recommended! :D","December 29, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fully voice acted, fairly good platformer controls. Give you flexibility to play it old school on a controller or do several keyboard+mouse  styles. Plot is... kinda disjointed, but evocative enough, especially with the voice acting.\n\nCONS: It's a little wonky getting used to having your weapon float and learning how to time your attacks so your blade is actually available to launch another attack. Wall climbing is somewhat touchy and more than once I got stuck in a slide or to a wall.  Never permanent, but it happened enough that it makes some of the rapid movement and combat sections somewhat annoying.  Short. Two hours in I had completed more than half of the game.\n\nMIXED FEELINGS: Some replayablility to find all the hidden collectibles, but it's no Metroid-vania. You don't revisit areas with new options, you just revisit them to find what you missed.  Despite the tooltips scattered around through the first few levels, They still leave some things out. Go into the options menu and read the manual first, as it also gives you some important context.\n\nOverall, I definitely recomend it. It's low cost and it's a fun platformer for the price.  I picked it up on sale for under a dollar, but I'd definitely recommend it, even at the full $3 price tag.","January 11","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you're climbing down angled surfaces you'll sometimes slide and that animation will keep playing which sometimes gets you stuck. My only real problem is the difficulty hike on bosses. The rest of the game will be fine but then bosses are just in your face wrecking your sh*t.

Wallclimbing/Transitioning is a bit cumbersome, but perhaps that's because I'm using a keyboard and mouse. As for the swordfighting, ya kinda find a 'knack' for it. It's a colorful, whimsical platformer that shovels throws various various curriences and strange loot in plentiful and accessible 'secret' areas (and with more and more games demanding you to be more skillful in general, I dig this conspicuous change in skill-reward ratio.)

Was it in one of the bundles I bought? Or did I buy it specifically because of the name (yes, I am that easy)? I have no idea. But no matter how I got the game, I'm glad I did.\n\nWhile the story is quite simple (and not all that interesting, to be honest), the game has a lot of charm. The quirky protagonist can be funny at times, the levels are visually interesting and just plain pretty and the movement, ooh the movement.\n\nI really like when a protagonist can move easily through levels and doesn't get stumped by the smallest walls or drops. ("Oh no, a hedge, I can't possibly LIFT MY LEG OVER IT, can I?") Blade Kitten is right up my alley. Kitty moves swiftly and with ease, climbing sheer clifs and overhangs like it's just a stretching excercise. The movement feels really fluid and pleasant. It's a joy to play.\n\nI have noticed that some reviewers found it difficult to do precise platform-to-platform jumps and complained that the movement is perhaps "too fluid". I think that missing some jumps in a platformer game is to be expected ;) I guess it comes down to personal preferences, but it needs to be said that even when you do miss a jump for whatever reason, it's never fatal. You can easily climb back up and try again. This happened to me a few times but it never felt like a chore.\n\nOn the contrary, I felt such joy playing this game. It's just well-designed and well-made game. It throws new things and toys your way very often, so it always stays fresh. Even Kitty herself can be "customised" by buying new costumes. The pacing reminds me of the good old Prehistoric 2. When you got bored with running around and smacking dinosaurs, the game gave you a kite to fly for a whole level or so, which completely changed the dynamic. Blade Kitten's design works similarly and as a consequence never feels dull.\n\nOne small beef I have with the game is that in later levels it's very easy to get stun-locked between multiple enemies. Kitty, attacked from both sides, sometimes can't escape the onslaught, as there's no one-second-immortality-after-being-hit as in other platformers.\n\nOne larger beef I have with the game is that it essentially ends nowhere and prompts you to buy Episode 2. I had no idea that what I have is a story-wise incomplete game. It was a bit of an unpleasant surprise to find out just when the story got a bit more interesting. I don't know the reasoning behind the episodic format. Usually, tactics like these make me feel ripped off as a customer. Still, the game on the whole was a joy to play (and both episodes are quite cheap, anyways), so this time, there are no hard feelings.\n\nThis is the only platformer game I have played end-to-end in just about fifteen years. Because it's just good.","January 20","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finished it in 14 hours but I have quite a lot left to go back and find.\n\nI love the characters (have not read the comics but I now intend to), the light-hearted humor that doesn't destroy the parts that were more dramatic, the music, the vaguely nostalgic feel of a late 90's style platformer. I liked being able to  jump and wall-climb pretty much anywhere, making the levels a nice open map. it sort of reminded me of Strider but with cute catgirls, and *everything* is better with cute catgirls! making the collectables a currency for upgrades and vanity items was a good choice.\n\nI did encounter a couple of bugs: a cut scene failed to trigger for me, making me have to restart a section, and I also managed to fall through the world. the controls could be awkward at times, a sequence of buttons refusing to activate because I got the timing a split second off, or me not being able to tell the difference between traversable and non-traversable territory.  the final boss with its incredibly fiddly mechanic that didn't trigger half the time was a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially as it kept suddenly refusing to attack me, making it hard to bait. these bugs don't make it unplayable, just a bit irritating at times, and I think the good parts make up for it, especially as the game is cheap and constantly in sales.\n","May 16","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
