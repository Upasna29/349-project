Honestly, it makes for a rather dull experience overall.  Let's start from the beginning so we can get an idea of what's wrong with it:\n\n1) Enemy placement - Enemies are often placed in areas that aren't well thought out (or perhaps they are, but for the wrong reasons). You'll find yourself tapping the controller or keyboard to move forward rather than have your character move at a constant rate for fear of an enemy popping up on the very edge of the screen and immediately firing. While this isn't terrible if you are into that sort of thing, I like to play my run-'n'-gun style of games where I'm actually RUNNING and GUNNING, not stutter stepping and jumping.\n\n2) Weapons - Good lord are the things generally useless. A bullet spray that shoots in a random barrage of bullets? Why not just make it the ever classic spread from Contra? In this, the bullets might miss smaller targets generally, and require me to maneuver in bizarre fashions to maximize the damage from an enemy.\n\nA misslie launcher? Sounds amazing, except it's not because the missiles generally have this nasty tendency to fly upwards after a few moments of being shot so they always seem to skirt *around* the enemies rather than at them! If that wasn't bad enough, the missiles are incredibly slow as well. Lame.\n\nBoomerangs? Okay, these actually aren't that bad, but it WOULD be better if you could switch between them and your standard gun.\n\nI could go on and on about them, but let's just say that most of them are a noticeable downgrade from your standard shot. This is absolutely not good at all. Sure, you can have weapons that are better at moments, but having them be worst in almost any conceivable situation is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nI especially love how the drops are random, so until you actually remember the symbols for your power-ups, you'll never actually be able to know which ones are actually useful or not (just skip most of them). Even worse is that some of them are a "partner" powerup, so there's no reason to not have those guys even if they have limited ammo and most aren't particularly helpful.\n\nThe Jet idea is pretty nifty but I feel like it's not utilized very well. Let's take the first mini-boss for instance, using your jet dodges every single attack it has, and even in hardcore mode, by the time it's actually ready to charge its next attack, your jet meter has already filled back up to the top again and can be used to dodge. I'm not saying remove the jet, but the enemies should have more attacks since the game knows that you will ALWAYS have the jetpack.\n\nLastly, I absolutely hate how the vast majority of the enemies are over your character's head but you cannot shoot up. That's not how you design something. Yes, I get that the jet pack is there to let you level out with the enemies, but it's excessive from as early as state 1, area 1-1. The helicopters should most definitely have a method of being shot at if you run underneath them outside of running backwards to shoot it (which causes enemies behind you to respawn), or running passed it; this makes it even more pointless to fight as it's no longer an obstacle.\n\nAll and all, it's not the most wretched game I've played-- it's not even really bad, it's just... Not good. In any real way.\n\nWhy was my review so long? I don't know, maybe it's a message to the developer so he can make a better game. I feel like if he made "Jet Gunner 2" and got rid of the above problems, the game might be pretty good.","August 10, 2014","false","0.4"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","43","61","0","1"

The same mechanics are all here, but they're clunky and unrefined; lacking polish and inspiration as if designed to intentionally bore the player, perhaps in the hopes that they quit playing before happening upon the later stages in the game which feature cheap deaths and frustrating gimmicks in place of creative level designs and solid combat.\n\nJet Gunner isn't abhorrently bad, but its abundance of poor design decisions, stiff controls, and underwhelming boss fights leave it floundering in an abyss of its far better contemporaries (not to mention the games which so obviously inspired it). It's full of the sort of almost decent monotony that makes it easy to switch off your mind and dully playthrough, but never once did I come upon a reason why I was wasting my time with such an underwhelming game.","August 8, 2014","false","2.3"," 41 of 64 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","41","64","0","0"

If it were a real console, I couldn't be happier with the launch line up, and Jet Gunner rounds things out so nicely with amazing run and gun platformer action - the first of its kind that really feels like an NES game but with none of the things that make going back to that console sometimes a little disappointing. Jet Gunner has the pallet and graphics you remember, but the controls are way more air tight and the whole experince is just smooth as silk. It really says something about this game when it saves your progress so you can continue from the last level you played but I always choose to play from the begining anyway because the experince is just so much fun. This may be the best purchase I've made on steam so far. I could give this game a simple but controversial three word review, and I mean this sincerely: "Better than contra." This game isn't just reminecent of the NES era, its what we all thought NES gaming should have been but so rarely was. With some distance between us and that wonder console now we can finally craft games that emulates its unique style but corrects all its limitations to bring a simple, addictive, and blissful gaming experince and Jet Gunner shows them how its done. Plus a hardcore a challanges mode to keep you coming back to master the game (and unlike many games, this one is actually fun to pursue mastery of) long after you've beaten it standard.  I really hope other retro style game developers are taking notes on this title but even more than that, I need Jet Gunner 2 to be a thing in my life.","November 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/314250/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","Pros:\n\n- Fun and tight gameplay evoking the likes of Contra, Power Blade, and -- bizarrely yet awesomely -- Kirby (due to the innovative jetpack mechanic)\n- Truly excellent graphics and sound design, with a feel that reminds one in particular of some of the finest Sunsoft games of the NES era\n- That wonderful balance between being challenging enough to hold interest but nowhere near the obnoxious over-difficulty most modern "retro" games are rife with\n\nCons:\n\n- Sadly, the music doesn't compare to most decent NES games' OSTs, and is unfittingly quite poor in comparison to the rest of the game's quality.  So many fantastic Famitracker musicians out there could have been hired to create a wonderfully composed and fitting soundtrack for this game; I don't really know what happened here, but it's very disappointing.\n- The game's over with extremely quickly, even compared to NES games of very modest length, perhaps partly due to how rarely you'll die and be forced to memorize the stage and boss patterns as perfectly as most such games.  It might be worth it to crank up the difficulty even on your first playthrough if you're an experienced retro gamer for this reason.\n- Cutscenes are completely pointless even for a guy like me who generally enjoys them; simply slapping sprites that are weirdly ugly compared to the rest of the game of your player character and his boss and having them spout one or two very basic lines doesn't really have a place.  Either go for Ninja Gaiden-style quality, Clash at Demonhead-style humor or just don't bother.\n\nOverall, though, the fun factor and quality of *most* of the game is high enough that this title is absolutely worth the price tag for any oldschool action/platformer/run-and-gun fan.","March 29, 2015","true","1.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naoisan/recommended/314250/","Naoisan","Naoisan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naoisan/","522 products in account","It's a fun, fast paced and challenging game that's like a mix of Megaman and Contra on crack! It has lots of enemies that respawn if you backtrack, lots of powerups which can significantly alter the behaviour of your weapon and you even come equipped with a jetpack. Powerups are also randomized so you can't beat the game strictly by trial and error making skill and reflexes key. The presentation is absolutely spot on right down to the segmented health/energy bars and achieves the retro 8-bit style perfectly -- it looks, sounds and plays just like an NES game. The sprites are large and easy to distinguish and they explode into colorful 8-bit pieces!\n\nMy only issue with the game is that the controls aren't as tight as I would like them to be. Sometimes when I try to move in the opposite direction it doesn't register particulary if I do it too quickly. Furthermore you can't remap the controls and the only controller it supports is the 360 gamepad, and it's not very playable with it because the controls are significantly delayed however the developer is working on fixing it. The options currently don't save either and be warned: This game is ***VERY LOUD*** when you first load it up.\n\nBut all in all, it's a great game that does what it sets out to do very well. It took me an hour just to beat the first stage and there's 6 in total. So make no mistake it is hard, especially unforgiving in hardcore mode. If that's what you're looking for, then for the price you really can't wrong with this.","August 4, 2014","true","5.4"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderist/recommended/314250/","murderist","Murderist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderist/","419 products in account","Jet Gunner is a side-scrolling platformer with a late-era NES aesthetic that wildly succeeds in emulating the most frustrating and archaic elements of that era.\n\nEnemies that fire immediately as they appear on screen, usually while you are mid-jump. Weapon powerups that have strange arcs that prevent them from hitting enemies directly in front of you. Massive knock-back. Vertical stages in which the bottom of the screen instantly kills you. Bullet-sponge enemies that necessitate a large life bar, resulting in a sloppy, inelegant play experience in which you can't finesse your way through a level but must rather brute-force your way through like a rabid speedrunner taking damage-- just to make it through a level, not to shave time.\n\nThese flaws could be overlooked or even appreciated as period-specific quirks if the visual and audio design of the game were more memorable, but they're just aren't. It succeeds at being a hard-as-nails NES game but that isn't really enough as unless you've played the entire NES library, there are probably dozens of better designed *actual NES* games that you could play and enjoy instead as well as better retro pastiche games on Steam.\n\nThat said, it still felt pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good to beat it.","February 2, 2015","false","4.2"," 48 of 80 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","48","80","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/314250/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Wanted to like this game. Has good old school NES gameplay. Pretty short, and levels aren't that interesting. Cool upgrades. What did it is the mechanics and platforming, which were too amateur-ish. The jump and falling are super jerky. When you jump up in the air or let off the jetpack, you fall way too quickly and just jerk down. When you boost up you jerk up high into the air. It is not smooth or intuitive at all. When you get hit there is the dumb mechanic of you are stunned and fall back a decent amount, which just makes platforming frustrating and not fun. You get 3 lives to complete 6 levels, and there are a few 1-ups and a few healths scattered in there. If you die on the final stage you have to do it all over again. This isn't bad initially. Then there is the hitboxes, which are spotty. Enemies fire at you immediately when they get on screen and before you can see or react to them, meaning you get hit when there is nothing you can do about it. The bottom of the screen is terrible. It registers you dying when only a bit of your foot touches it. This makes no sense because many time on the final stages you are expected to fly under things, and with the jerky unintuitive dropping and flying there is no way you might not graze the screen, but in this game thats an instant death and restart the level. The poor flying also doesn't work when they want you going in between top and bottom spikes, and you can't just hold it and keep it. The instant deaths from the bottom of the screen, poor jetpack mechanics, annoying enemies attacking before you see them, repeated 6 levels with 3 lives, and getting knocked back, all make this game poor by NES standards. Games back then usually had more polish. 4.5/10","August 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

As a consumer I'm not feeling respected.\n\nJet Gunner positive aspects:\n\n1) 8-bit graphics, controls and music.

It's very original and well planned. Makes me wonder how nobody used this mechanic back in the 1980s. At first 'Jet Gunner' looks like a 'Contra meets Shatterhand' title - but the jet makes it very unique.\n\nSo... The game is way to good to not be fixed.

You need to know which weapons to get and to avoid for each section of the level.

You get a jetpack which auto-regenerates it's fuel and you collect gun power-ups as you go. The game can be quite frustrating however, as the enemy placement seems to be questionable at times, especially on levels where you travel vertically. I still found myself having fun as I finished the last few stages, so I'd have to recommend the game if it seems interesting to you, especially since it retails at $4.","September 10, 2014","true","2.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Now that there's controller support, the game works and plays fairly well. There are a few problems, however. The lack of aiming up can make fighting aerial targets from the ground a bothersome affair, and restarting the level after running out of lives can make this a frustrating experience for some. The music isn't very memorable either; while they're not terrible tunes, they're not something I can hum to every now and then either. Despite these faults, it's still a decent shooter. The included bonus game, Alien Splatter, isn't too bad either.","August 6, 2014","true","3.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The field of view is rediculously tiny and even original NES games show off the ability to see the enemies attacking you before they shoot and take down a eighth of your health instantly. Due to this terrible feature, it's very difficult to last the first few levels within loosing all of your lives. This could easily of been prevented by making the field of view better and preventing the enemies from firing apon you whenever they are on your screen.\n\nThe general asthetics of this game are pretty good but it's easy to say that it's trying wayy too hard to be a late-era NES game. But appart from that the general scheme of the looks are nice appart from the cut-scene characters.\n\nAdditionally due to the cheesyness of the text and the lack of explination to get involved into the story by having some cheap-♥♥♥ text which sounds like a three year old made it additional to monkey looking characters.\n\nA lot of the power-ups are also terrible and difficult to use against the first few enemies in the game. Not all of the powerups are bad, a lot of them are pretty good. But some of the powerups just only seem helpful to the flying robots rather than anything else. Even then it's rediciously hard to aim some of the power-ups.\n\nThe games during the NES phase were stupidly difficult due to the lack of space the game cartrages had, making it last longer than it should with an easier difficulty. But with technology we have today, the game creator should of took into consideration that he has to the memory space to do what he wants rather than forcing himself apon making a game era which had a lot of bad games.\n\nThis game even forces itself apon using the classic square resolution rather than using widescreen to it's advantage and make it a more playable game.\n\nBut this game has some nice features, but nothing that hasn't been used before in pretty much any NES game ever. It's a  really plane and featureless game and nothing really unique to play.","June 14, 2015","false","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Both the background and characters animations will make you feel like playing your old good NES once again. 9/10\n+ Soundtrack: Same for soundtrack. Perfectly suits the game, however it could contain a little bit more of tracks. Using same one for all 25 challenge stages was a bit annoying. 7/10\n\nCONS\n\n- Gameplay: The weakest aspect of a game. The thing that made 90's games special was their playability. This game have none. You can use only 2 buttons: fire and jump. Maybe it's same like in old NES games but when I launched it for a very first time I was suprised that I can't even aim my weapon up or down. You can only fire your weapon left or right - thats all, and with certain gun combinations it makes so hard to hit the enemies that are close to you. The physics are weak, main character is slow and the knockback is really annoying. 2/10\n- Main story: The game has no story. Go to the space base, kill the Mother Brain -> profit. In fact you don't need a story for an arcade game, but...\nThe levels (all 5 of theme, what makes game very short) are very unbalanced. You are dashing through very easy stage to face the hard boss. The further you are, the bosses are easier. Just like the devs run out of ideas for them. I was tryharding to beat first one but killed last 2 (including the final boss) for a very first try. The final "F" level is nothing more than a boss rush when you just have to face all bosses again one by one without dying to reach the motherbrain. In fact, I had more fun playing extra challange mode levels than a main campaign. 3/10\n- Level desing: As I said, the first stages are bit easy but still fun to play. There is almost no difference in difficulty between stages 1 and 4. However, the fifth one is hard as ****. But not in a challenging way. It rather reminded me IWBTG series, where everything was covered by spikes and traps and the only way to beat the level was repeating it again and again untill remebering locations of every single enemy and trap. 4/10\n\nSumming up, if that game was released like 20 year ago, it would be just fine. But for now, it's definitely not worth its price and I would not recommend buying it. I hope it would change in a future as a game would be still develeoped.\n\nBut if you only want to bring some good, nestalgic memories back - go ahead and try it ;)","September 5, 2014","false","8.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/recommended/314250/","PURESEXCELLENCY","Squire Grooktook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/","360 products in account","Jet Gunner is a side scrolling run and gun shooter that utilizes a jet pack for more high flying platforming and combat. While this mechanic is interesting, and I am a fan of arcade style run and gun shooters, I feel the execution here is a bit subpar.\n\nThe jet pack works in that after jumping, you can press or hold the button as many times as you want to ascend while fuel holds out. The way fuel is handled though is perhaps my biggest complaint about the mechanic itself. Instead of having a set amount you can rise per jump, you have a fuel meter which slowly recharges when not jet packing. What this essentially means is that before or after many jumps, you'll have to sit still and wait for the meter to finish recharging before you can go again. While it's not terriblye noticeable most of the time (it recharges quickly), it still cramps the games fast paced run and gun action a bit, and makes the jetpacks use feel a bit more limited and restrained than it should be (in my opinion).\n\nBeyond the jetpack system, there's also a weapon system in which you can stock a standard weapon and a floating satelite (with limited use), mixing and matching the two. However some of the weapons vary in usefulness a bit too much. The worst offenders being a flame thrower with far too short range, a gun that shoots directly above and below you but not in front, an incredibly slow moving wide shot, and a missle launcher with pitiful speed and an annoying randomized aim. I can appreciate the attempt at variety in the weapons, but a few too many of them harm you more than anything. In fact, pretty much everything that's not a standard straight shot is pretty awful.\n\nThe level design doesn't make good use of the jetpack consistently enough. Occaisionally, there are interesting acrobatic manuevers, but these are a bit too far and few between. For the most part, the jetpack is just used to jump over slightly lengthier bottomless pits or other such hazards that could just have easily been solved with a more traditional double jump. Beyond jetpack use, the level design  is not particularly interesting, with fairly standard run and jump layouts for about half of the game. Enemy design is a bit weak, mostly consisting of standard foes who simply shoot at you before dying, forcing a single duck or jump whilst being too static to force any kind of improvisation or quick reflex once memorized.\n\nBoss design varies. A few bosses (the first one, for example) offer great design with a mix of strategy, reflexes (thanks to some slightly random attack patterns), and a need to use your jetpack well. But like the stages, some of them are a bit uneven, with a few snoozer fights numbering equally against the genuinely fun ones.\n\nThe game also has occaisional flaws and cheap moments in level and boss design that makes the whole experience feel a bit unpolished and poorly play tested. Examples:\n-On stage 1, you stand on a small moving platform over a bottomless pit, and pass under a block that prevents you from jumping. On a nearby wall, an enemy climbs up and down the wall and fires when you enter within range. If you're lucky, it won't pass by while you're under the block, or at least will fire at a height where you can duck, otherwise damage will be unavoidable if it happens to pass by at a crouching level.\n-On stage 2, a miniboss has a pattern in which it fires a random spray of slow moving bullets, followed up by an unreactable (I think) slew of fast and random cannon balls that are only consistently dodged by staying directly underneath the cannon. If you get bad rng on the slow moving bullets, you can get a wall of bullets that forcibly prevents you from getting to the safe zone, and results in unavoidable damage.\n-On stage 4, a platform moves when you jump on it, with ceiling fans that prevent you from jet packing. If you get knocked back onto the previous ledge (or jump back there for safety in avoiding an incoming enemy) you will be completely incapable of reaching the platform and will have to suicide in order to get it to respawn\n-etc.\n\nOverall not a bad game, but a very simple memorizer with a few standout moments and a few flaws holding it back. The gimmick is neat but stirkes me more as something with potential that's not fully realized here. If you really enjoy the genre, you may enjoy this, but I'd personally recommend something more masterful like Bleed first.","August 5, 2014","false","1.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","3"

I have no issue with the game taking cues from nostalgic pieces, but it hasn't done much in terms of smoothing out some of the rougher edges of gameplay. Enemy bullets fly entirely too fast. Your characters seemingly takes ages to simply turn around. Not having full controller support makes playing the game an unneccesary challenge. More options for screen resolution (and fullscreen mode) would be welcomed, too.","August 5, 2014","false","0.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

"Challenging" gameplay allows the user to make a choice and react, which this game doesn't give you much of a chance to do. Whenever an enemy enters the screen he immediately fires his weapon, giving you no time to react because the shot has hit you before the enemy is fully visible. Also if you land on the same platform as an enemy he will immediately fire, once again not giving you a chance to react to it. It's not challenging, it's flat out unfair.\n\nI started my first playthrough on Hardcore Mode because i wanted a really solid challenge but was unable to even get past the first level due to having no indication of when an enmy will fire his high velocity lasers at me. Hardcore Mode doesn't allow you to collect extra lives or health pickups and you take double damage, so trying to get through the very long levels having only 3 lives is nothing short of impossible.\n\nThis game looked cool but it's just way too punishing to the point where it's not fun and i feel i don't have control over a situations outcome. The dev needs to analyze retro games to see the difference between challenge and punishment. A good start would be adding a visual indication that the enemy is about to fire his weapon, that way the player has the chance to react and will only have himself to blame if they aren't fast enough. I'll always appreciate an atempt to bring back challenging retro games, but this just doesn't do it right.","August 7, 2014","false","1.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

A short-range flamethrower won't help if your target is far away. A gun that shoots two projectiles diagonally isn't much help when you're trying to hit a target across a gap. Specific-use weapons can be cool, but Jet Gunner seems to randomize which ones are placed in its levels. I would struggle against a boss with one weapon, and then completely murder him the next time around, because the game handed me a more effective gun at random.\n\nYou can get little robot buds that fight with you, like in Shatterhand. Man, I love Shatterhand. Again though, they're all over the place when it comes to usefulness, and the robot types available seem to be randomized. I know Shatterhand had a few dud robot designs, but at least you could plan ahead and choose the kind of robot you got.\n\nYour character has a bit of acceleration/deceleration when moving. One recurring nitpick I have is that when you change direction, you don't look the other way until all of the momentum from the old direction is gone. It's hard to explain in text, but: running right, jump right, tap left to shoot at something in the air -- you haven't turned left. This can get pretty annoying during boss fights.\n\nYou have a jetpack that lets you float in the air for a short period, but you can't shoot while thrusting. A good number of enemies and bosses are placed high above the ground, and you need to stay in the air to actually hit them,\n\nThe "old action sidescroller" is a simple formula, but it requires some attention to detail to make something that really clicks. I like the overall idea for this game, but I feel the execution falls a bit short.","August 16, 2014","false","2.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

After watching the preview video of the gameplay and seeing the passion of the developer upon making this I knew it was to be a treat. You have 6 levels of mayhem that feels Nintendo Entertainment System through and through. Don't know if it was intentional or just a "Way" of introducing this game but if you Browse the local files there is a another game that was on newgrounds called "alien splatter" which is also a great game with awesome music. You can use a xbox controller but I had a problem with my PS2 controller as the buttons were mismapped and would suggest if one doesn't have a xbox 360 controller to unplug your game pad other wise you'll  be stuck with crappy button mapping and there is no way out of it (at least to my knowledge).\n\nJet gunner is a great game for NES enthusiast and retro gamers alike. Wonderful 2D action that one can expect from a passionate developer. The price is perfect and for the amount of fun that can be had is endless. I replayed this game at least 5 times! It's THAT fun. Give it a play or two!

Once I managed to defeat that enemy, I spent a bit of time jumping around and getting a hold of everything, only to be attacked by more enemies (some of which were in the air) that were spawning from the right.\n\nOnce I started progressing through the level, I noticed immediately that any enemy that fired a projectile had no tell or warning of it's attack, and the enemies' projectiles were too fast to react to. On top of this, enemies will fire at you the moment they appear on screen, resulting in many points of damage that are near-impossible to avoid without knowing it's location.\n\nAnother thing I found was that despite how many enemies you defeat on your way across the level, enemies will continue to spawn from behind. Often times when I needed to back away from a swarm of enemies to collect myself, I found myself confronted by a similar bunch of enemies in the same area I cleared not 5 seconds prior.\n\nThe powerups in the game are fun but their powerlevel is varied immensely. Anything that fires slow prevents you from attacking the projectile-shooting robots before they hit you, and anything without a range or spread will leave you unprotected against at least one or two of the enemies on screen at any time. The color coding itself seems fairly backwards as well, as the pickups that change the gun that shoots orange bullets is blue, and the pickups that change blue bullets is orange. I understand that this is supposed to match the character and the side-kick's color schemes, but it caused issues when I'd accidently overwrite a good weapon. Another point of interest with powerups, is that the same shot type has different symbols depending on if it's for the main character or the side-kick.\n\nOther than that, most level design issues stem from enemy placement (covering entire platforms, being placed in spots that will probably get you shot if you try to attack, spawning behind you) and the initial difficulty level in the first levels.\n\nOverall, I feel like the game can be really good if the developer just tweaked the enemies a bit (give them a small warning animation before they shoot at the player) and looked at the difficulty curve of the early game. Making some weapons better would most likely be beneficial to the player, but it's not a requirement. I still reccommend playing this game if you are looking for an NES styled nostalgia trip, just don't expect it to be fair all the way through.","April 29, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The middle one is always the hardest.\n- If you can get past stage 2, it seems to get significantly more forgiving.\n","March 11","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No questions.\n\nNow the bad and I really don't enjoy listing the problems because I like the creator's other stuff like Ninja Virus.\n\nPretty buggy\nThere's random slowdown that reminds me of Contra Force. You could argue that this is a more authentic NES experience but...\nThe control mapping does not work. I have a PS3 Hori controller (great D-pad) so obviously it's not supported. Okay, this is an indie game so it's understandable, I wish X-Input became the standard for every developer, but it is what it is. So I load up X-Padder and config the controls for the Keyboard. I go with Arrow keys for movement and Z and X for jump and shoot. Only when I get into the game, the controls don't work. So I hit every button on the keyboard and realize that instead of the Arrow keys being the directional buttons it's instead the WASD keys... And the reverse happens if you set the controls in the menue for WASD and K and L for jumping and attacking...\n\nOuch.\n\nWould I still recommend this? Yes.

This feels as if Taito and Sunsoft had gotten together and made a game that was a mix between Batman: Return of the Joker and Air Fortress. For anyone who doesn't get that, Jet Gunner feels and plays like a solid late 80's NES game.\n\nWhat's refreshing to me was how the gameplay reminded me of a great Sunsoft title, but the bumpers between levels reminded me of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Electrobrain or Taxan game. In that regard, Jet Gunner feels genuinely NES and not just retro for retro's sake.\n\nThe video presents it to be a frenetic shooter, but it's actually much slower paced, and I like that. The core element of the gameplay, the jet pack, worked well and added nice platforming challenges. The weapon types were varied, and constantly changed throughout the game, even in the same stages if you had to replay an area over due to a death. This kept the game feeling fresh and active throughout.\n\nFor the price, this a steal. The presentation is solid and the gameplay offers about an hour worth of oldschool entertainment.

If I really want retro graphics and gameplay, I'll play a game that actually came from that period in an emulator, or something that has been re-released, like on WiiWare.\n\nI don't like the game, but it's getting a thumbs up because I got it for free and it drops a few cards that I can sell.","June 27, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pros and Cons:\n\nPretty cheap at $3.99\nAmazing sprite work and 8 bit music\nIt's fun, if you love the NES then you should play this. No questions.\n\nNow the bad and I really don't enjoy listing the problems because I like the creator's other stuff like Ninja Virus.\n\nPretty buggy\nThere's random slowdown that reminds me of Contra Force. You could argue that this is a more authentic NES experience but...\nThe control mapping does not work. I have a PS3 Hori controller (great D-pad) so obviously it's not supported. Okay, this is an indie game so it's understandable, I wish X-Input became the standard for every developer, but it is what it is. So I load up X-Padder and config the controls for the Keyboard. I go with Arrow keys for movement and Z and X for jump and shoot. Only when I get into the game, the controls don't work. So I hit every button on the keyboard and realize that instead of the Arrow keys being the directional buttons it's instead the WASD keys... And the reverse happens if you set the controls in the menue for WASD and K and L for jumping and attacking...\n\nOuch.\n\nWould I still recommend this? Yes. BUT, that control bug and the slowdown in particular makes it difficult.\n","June 27, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This feels as if Taito and Sunsoft had gotten together and made a game that was a mix between Batman: Return of the Joker and Air Fortress. For anyone who doesn't get that, Jet Gunner feels and plays like a solid late 80's NES game.\n\nWhat's refreshing to me was how the gameplay reminded me of a great Sunsoft title, but the bumpers between levels reminded me of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Electrobrain or Taxan game. In that regard, Jet Gunner feels genuinely NES and not just retro for retro's sake.\n\nThe video presents it to be a frenetic shooter, but it's actually much slower paced, and I like that. The core element of the gameplay, the jet pack, worked well and added nice platforming challenges. The weapon types were varied, and constantly changed throughout the game, even in the same stages if you had to replay an area over due to a death. This kept the game feeling fresh and active throughout.\n\nFor the price, this a steal. The presentation is solid and the gameplay offers about an hour worth of oldschool entertainment. Totally worth it.","September 24, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
