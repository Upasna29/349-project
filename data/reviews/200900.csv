"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/200900/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","It’s not easy to even start talking about Cave Story without starting to throw out such adjectives like “modern classic” or “cult underground hit”. But there, you have it, I just wrote it and I won’t take it back. This game preceded the current state of indie scene by a few years, back when it was released as freeware title in 2004. In a few years it was improved and expanded to various platforms with more content and refined graphics. It even was remade in 3D and published for 3DS, though that particular version lacks to provide definitive Cave Story experience. But in the beginning it was made by a single developer on his free time. His name was Daisuke Amaya. The fact that this guy is japanese (not that you couldn’t tell it by his name) explains a lot. Like, for starters, game’s setting and plot.\nTaking place inside giant floating island inhabited by giant sentient rabbit-like creatures called Mimigas this story is both absurd and complex. Starting out very light-hearted game is filled with tremendous amount of jokes. While the story develops, it tends to grow deeper and more brutal than you might think it’ll turn out. Like many metroidvanias do, game prefers not to present you with the world details and backstory, but rather let you explore it by yourself. A vague prologue, which will leave player clueless transits to waking up in a cave. A silent protagonist suffering from memory loss, as cliché as it is, works as perfect instrument here. You wake up, you find a gun, you begin your journey. Your mission, your ultimate goal is covered with the mystery. And discovering it can’t be done separately with finding an answer to an even more important question “What the hell is going on here?” But searching it won’t be similar to aimless wandering around. Cave Story keeps a very good pace, presenting you with new goals and providing directions to them on the go. It isn’t large glowing marker on the map though, but rather clevel organization of levels and progression of the story. Exploring and finding hidden secrets is present in the game, but size of the areas isn’t overwhelming and new levels are introduced one by one. There is though few very unobvious decisions that change the outcome of the game drastically. So if you want to achieve the best ending prepare to keep a keen eye for details or rather even look for some guides.\nFrom the perspective of game mechanics it’s the usual run-jump-shoot trio, but with a few twists. One of them is leveling system. Killed enemies drop yellow triangles, which fill the progression bar of currently equipped weapon. Fully filled bar increases weapon level, up to maximum third, but taking damage drops the bar back down, so prepare for some micromanagement. Weapons have different shooting patterns. There is Polar Star which fires plain bullets, then there’s Fireball which produces bouncing deadly balls of fire. Then there’s Spur which has chargeable beam; the longer you charge it, the more powerful the resulting shot will be. Plenty of choices results in very different strategies player can use. Though you’ll tend to have favourites among your arsenal, keeping them all leveled up and ready will be invaluable. To make things even more complex some of the weapons can be traded off in exchange providing you with other guns which have different qualities. This changes are sometimes mutually exclusive and not always reversible, so don’t answer yes every time some friendly NPC offers you something, that’s my advice here. Unlike your main interaction tools your character doesn’t really level up, with the exception of few valuable health upgrades. Not very hard if you keep the default path game is horribly ruthless when it comes to that last levels of the “best ending” branch. How does it sound for you: beating a few sequential levels swarming with enemies and two bosses? If you fail, you start again from the very beginning. That’s very different from the main path, where you’ll find save points after every major event. But then again, it’s for those who want to fully beat the game. For those who are trained and prepared there are even special timer for that last sequence, beating last boss before time runs out will unlock one of the few special music tracks in main menu. The themes depend on how fast you complete it, a new one for each minute saved. And that happens only if you found special secret item, but I guess that won’t be a problem for those who are that deep in the game.\nCave Story stands on the shoulders of giants, combining elements from both Metroid and Mega Man. But it goes further than just simple copying of old classics. It is polished and compelling and its influence knows no merits; nearly every modern 2D-metroidvania has taken some lessons from here. A must-have experience if you call yourself a lover of modern indie-games.","June 14, 2014","true","15.2"," 92 of 100 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","92","100","0","0"

Cave Story+ boasts extra gameplay modes, stages, the ability to switch between the original and new graphics and music (And the WiiWare exclusive music too!), difficulty modes, little easter eggs, and a few things I probably don't have memorized sprinkled on top of an already amazing game.\n\nThe problem I have recommending it to most people is that the original Cave Story is still out for no money whatsoever and includes the entire length of the main game. If you're not comfortable whatsoever about paying money for Cave Story+, you can still get the original for exactly 0 dollars and decide whether or not the extra content will be worth your time based on how much you enjoyed it.\n\nI'll be honest in saying that paying that amount of money for Cave Story+ feels like a bit of a rip once you've played the original and know its plot inside and out, but if you're like me and you really enjoy playing the game whenever you can, you won't really mind it. In reality, I own about six different copies of Cave Story between Nintendo systems and my computer, so you can tell I'm a bit of a nut about this game. There's something about the atmosphere, characters, and gameplay that just make it beyond awesome and a blast to play every single time.\n\n\nIn any case, I will always recommend you play the original first. It's free, and it's a timeless classic made by one man. You will enjoy it. If you come to love it just as much as I do and you need more, definitely grab Cave Story+ when you can (though maybe on a sale!)","July 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","77","82","0","0"

While I really enjoyed the higher quality graphics and SFX I did prefer the original dialogue a bit better. The story is the same but disscussions seem to be oversimplified.\n\nBottom line: Get this game. It will give you hours of button mashing enjoyment and is worth several playthroughs to see all the endings. It also has a few easter eggs which is a nice bonus :D\n\n(Edit: 3/19/14)","November 25, 2013","true","5.9"," 78 of 85 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","78","85","0","2"

It was probably the longest recommendation I ever made. What I basically said was that it was the best version of Cave Story that you can get, with everything being perfect aside from one issue, which I will get to later. The reason why I've deleted the recommendation and made a new review is because I really don't think I did the game justice. I would go as far as to say that Cave Story is in my top 3 favourite games of all time, and considering my other two favourite games are exclusive to consoles, and that I believe this is the best version of Cave Story there is, I might go as far as to say this is my favourite Steam game of all time.\n\nIf you want an explanation of what Cave Story is, I’ll tell you as much as I can without either spoiling your or me getting bored. You begin playing as a mute… “boy” that is suffering from amnesia, and just woken up in a cave. From there, you find a variety of different characters, amongst them is a race of rabbit-puppy creatures called Mimiga’s. They are suffering because there is a man known as “the doctor” who has come to their Mimiga Village to kidnap them individually. I won’t go into any more detail because, as the title implies, the “Story” in Cave Story, and finding out who this “Mysterious amnesia boy” actually is, is a huge strongpoint of the game.\n\nThis game isn’t just full with amazing storytelling either, the gameplay is amazingly fun too. It’s a Metroidvania that doesn’t focus on backtracking… most of the time (IM LOOKING AT YOU, GRASSTOWN!). Your main weapons are the guns you find along your journey, and how they work is actually really interesting and fun. The way that I would explain it is that it’s kinda like an RPG, as your guns can gain experience to make them more powerful. This may sound broken, but your guns can’t actually go any higher then level 3, and if you get hit while your gun has high experience, you will actually start to lose some of those points. It may sound annoying and tedious, but it’s actually extremely fun, and it’s a great punishment for getting hit a couple of times.\n\nNow that we got how everything in Cave Story works, I want to go into comparing Cave Story+ to the original Cave Story. Most of Cave Story’s fame not only comes from that it’s an amazing game, but the whole of the original was made by one person, and he actually released the game for FREE (This may not sound like much now, but remember this game originally came out in 2004). Now you may be thinking “But if the original version is free, why should I bother with this one?” That’s an easy answer, BECAUSE IT’S BETTER IN EVERY WAY. The original game was very 8-bit inspired, something that’s usually looked down on indie developers nowadays, but back then people would say that it’s a great call-back to old NES games. Cave Story+ turns the original 8-bit game into more of a 16-bit feel, and it actually makes the game better for it. Of course, you can change the options so that it’s like the original, but the new version is so much better. That’s not the only thing they added either, there are new gameplay modes that add new levels that you can play, or a boss rush mode, and many, many more.\n\nThe only complaint I have for this game is its controls. Believe it or not, even though the game originally came out for PC, the CONSOLE CONTROLS are actually better! If you don’t like using the arrow keys to move, or pressing “up” to jump (which sickens me to think about), you’ll have to change the controls for a bit so that they match up with how you play.\n\nSo please, PLEASE buy Cave Story+. If you’re really not sure, you can download the free version on the Cave Story website (you will have to add the English attachment to play it in English though), but buying the one on steam is so much better. I’ve spent way too long making this review, but trust me, it’s worth it. This game is amazing.\n\n(Also excuse me for my horrible grammar in this review)","November 26, 2013","true","35.8"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","65","73","0","1"

I go as far to say how easily they can surpass major blockbuster games both in sales, ratings and of course, the fans that cherish it so.\n\nI will not spoil much about this game, other than the fact it plays out as a retro sidescrolling, platform-adventure game; very reminiscent of the early-mid 90's and the plethora of game titles of that time, such as Mega Man and Super Metroid for the SNES. To top this all off the graphics, programming, story and overall direction was made by one man.\n\nTo the newcomers of Cave Story, take my advice and play this game slowly at a steady pace and try not to ask for any outside help, as you may experience the intriguing creativity of this game for yourself and the other first timers who have stumbled upon this game for the first time also. I've only played a couple of hours of this, and countless hours on the freeware version so trust me when I say this wonderful indie, platform-adventure game is far beyond perfection.","December 29, 2015","true","2.2"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","46","51","3","0"

Made in 2004, it was released as freeware and was only in Japanese. It got translated by fans of the game and became one of the cult-classics for PC Indie gaming. All of this was during a time when Steam was barely a thing, and most indie games were free.\n\nThis game has aged, and with its age has become more amazing. I have only been dragged back into this game more and more over the years, and about a year ago I was craving the gameplay and story from this game. I downloaded the freeware title; however, I soon came to realize the updated, upgraded version was out, so I bought it. I don't regret a thing.\n\nThe game sports a classic 2D style of shooter. You can get more health by collecting capsules, some are hidden, others aren't. Each weapon you obtain can gain levels, each level unlocking increased attack or fighting styles for the weapon. You get experience from killing enemies, and enemies will take the experience back if they hit you. Speaking of enemies: this game has a lot. I think there are close to 100 different fightable enemies over the course of the entire game.\n\nOn to the story. The story is very well designed and I cannot remember a game before this one that was able to keep me engaged long enough to care to remember the names of characters or their personalities. This game made me want to look after the lives of the characters, and will often torture you with suspense. It's a very linear sort of story, but the world is like that of Metroid. You can go around and complete smaller side-quests or just continue the main story. Some side-quests or small actions have more influence on the story than one would originally think.\n\nOn a scale of one to ten, I'd have to rate this a 9/10. It's a very well polished adventure through the denizens that live in the world of Cave Story.","October 10, 2014","true","8.8"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

I liked it 10 minutes into the game, and loved it by the end; when I had had experienced two different endings. "Multiple endings! Wow!", I thought; and when I read more about it, I found out that there was one another "best" ending, and some more hidden secrets that I was yet to discover. So I went back to the game, and I did. That was awesome, discovering something new about something that you are already in awe of.\n\nA couple of years forward, I'm playing Cave Story+, with polished graphics, remastered and new music, new game modes, and what not; and I'm totally in love, all over again. Take my word for it, this game is awesome, you will enjoy it to the core. But, if you do like to read more on why I think so, here goes:\n\nYour decisions, and there by your actions will have a bearing on the sort of a game end that you will experience.\nYou will still discover secrets when playing it for the 'n'th time, there by hugely increasing the game's replay value (provided you don't refer to something similar to 'Cave_Story_Secrets.txt' after the first time, or worse, before you have even completed the game; you will be very very tempted though, and hey, there's no shame in addressing a few guilty pleasures; I always do).\nYou will love getting lost in a fantastic 2-D world, with beautiful sprites and background art; an awesome score that sets the mood of the area and the situation you are in.\nAnd at last, you will relish, and be in awe of the fact that all of this, from programming; to all the graphics, music; to the big fantastic story in its entirety (which gets revealed in bits, a lot of it through a lot of the characters who are beautifully woven into its strands) was originally conceived by a single guy (who aptly calls himself 'Pixel'). A SINGLE GUY!\nPixel's spirit is that of Hermit Gunsmith, (the drowsy creator of Polar Star; "What's 'Polar Star'?", you ask! I say, "Play the game and you shall know.") for he says a few words of wisdom, late into the game, that very much reflect the guy that Pixel is.\n\n"There remains a very delicate balance in this world, between those who create and those who will experience the creations of others. I can't say that I wasn't aware of this. However, I had never experienced it. Now, thanks to you, I finally have. As long as the there is someone who will appreciate the work involved in creation, the effort is time well spent. To this end, I will continue to create for as long as I can."\n- Hermit Gunsmith; Creator, Polar Star & Spur.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123953248\nSay what you will, I will always be of the opinion that creating something like this (referring to the core of the game here / original version), with everything that it has, is extremely complex, even for a couple of people. A SINGLE GUY! EVERYTHING! Having played Cave Story(+) a good number of times; I deem this game, a creation born out of utmost love; and just for that single fact, it has inspired me.\n\nIf you can't afford this now, you can still play the free version[www.cavestory.org]. Apart from some bells and jingles, the core of the game is all there in the original version, you won't miss anything major.","December 25, 2014","true","72.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","1"

I played it for my first time back in 2006, and it's charming story and enjoyably difficult gameplay have stuck with me to this day.\n\nHowever, I cannot in good conscience recommend you spend money on Cave Story+. Cave Story was and still is a freeware game developed solely by a fellow named Pixel. A quick Google search will lead to the official tribute site where you can freely download the original Cave Story. The additions which the publisher Nicalis included in Cave Story+ are not noteworthy, and in some aspects actually detract from the original game. For example, the new visual style is quite ugly in comparison to the original, and Nicalis' altered dialogue negatively affects the impact that certain characters will have on you\n\nI would recommend you avoid this Steam release and play the original freeware version instead. As I said, this game is fantastic, but you should enjoy it as its creator Pixel intended it to be enjoyed: as a freeware game.","November 29, 2013","false","34.1"," 145 of 248 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","145","248","2","7"

No questions asked. This is more than a game: it is the reason why we have games such as Super Meat Boy, To The Moon, The Binding of Isaac and many more great indie games. This game alone created the indie gaming market. If this game didn't exist: the industry would be so much different.\n\nThe first thing that you will notice about Cave Story is the retro-like style with the fantastic 8 bit like visuals and music (it is more refined than that as the game looks better than an NES game). Speaking of which, the soundtrack in this game is simply beautiful. So many tracks are flowing with emotion such as Moonsong and Geothermal, to name two. These are some of the best songs I have ever heard: I am not even joking. And most importantly, the gameplay is very good and refined.\n\nIn its heart, Cave Story is an amazing platformer shooter action game with a great story. And, the story is just fantastic. You play as a robot who wakes up in a cave. He cannot remember anything, so he finds a pistol and discovers a place called Mimiga Village. In here, he discovers the war that the cute rabbit-dog like creatures are going through currently; and you have to help.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say the story gets REALLY good as it hits the narrative hook. The story, the visuals, the gameplay and the music is the reason why you will come back for more Cave Story. In fact, I am on my third playthrough at the moment! With multiple endings, difficulties and another mode, Cave Story is worth all of the money in the world. What is even better than a cheap $10 price point? The original game is free... That is right: the game is actually freeware and can be downloaded from cavestory.org. Cave Story+ brings more things to the table, but the game is worth paying for.\n\nTrust me and all of the other die-hard Cave Story fans.... Get the game now. It is just unethical to not try the original freeware game that has changed the gaming industry forever.","November 11, 2015","true","10.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It provides around 6 hours of fun for a single playthrough and some light frustration. I tried using a guide to access the best ending, but uh… more on that later. I should also note that this version of Cave Story looks much better than the original, but you can choose to play with the classic graphics and music should you want to check those out.\n\nGameplayYou will do plenty of jumping, shooting, and exploring. Every weapon you have at your disposal will have 3 levels with each one acting or performing differently. The Machine Gun, for example, will plink away rapidly at enemies at level 1, but at level 3, you can fire downwards to hover or gain height. The Missile Launcher will fire a single missile at level 1 and 3 missiles at level 3. Be aware that weapons can lose their experience whenever you take damage. This encourages learning how to avoid or destroy enemies effectively while collecting the valuable experience to keep you powerful. I definitely did everything I could to make sure my weapons would stay at max level in preparation for the many boss fights that the game has to offer.\n\nThe platforming aspect remains fairly simple until you acquire either the Machine Gun or a booster which opens up directional air dashing (up down left right). Before acquiring those kind of items, you’ll mostly be using your basic jump to navigate the levels and the obstacles within. Some areas of the game can require very precise jumps and movement. Failing to play well can result in instant death depending on the area. Some areas have instant death spikes, instant death crushing, or falling to your death. It’s very unpleasant to run into one of those deaths and having to go through the section again from the last save point used. Keep in mind, there are no checkpoints.\n\nExploration yields different benefits as you can collect health power-ups, missile launcher max ammo upgrades, find side-quests, and locate hidden items. The map is fully revealed with only hidden areas not being completely obvious.\nNow I’ll bring up my issue with the best ending route. It results in one of the last areas of the normal game having a huge difficulty spike, especially for someone like me that hates instant death. It changes the area to have more spikes/obstacles and all weapons will be reset to level 1. I was able to get through eventually, but that did require more than a handful of attempts. Then you’ll need to take on an additional and very difficult dungeon that resets your weapon levels again which was completely beyond me. So if you’re around my skill level, you’d better be content with getting the good/bad endings and watching the best ending on Youtube.\n\nStory and Other StuffThe story is simple, sad, and peppered with some odd, funny moments. The game starts you off with amnesia. From that point on, you’ll meet weird people, find weird items, discover what the heck is going on with all the bunny people (Mimigas), and unlock achievements that like to make the jokes. To know the full story, the best ending route needs to be pursued/watched since there are some important plot points and some surprises.\n\nThere are two additional modes. ?????’s Story lets you play as another character through the same game, but with additional dialog (the default protagonist is silent). You do have to find a hidden item to unlock that mode. The second one provides different challenges with different weapons. They are timed and feel like obstacle courses. I only did one. I didn’t care much for it.\n-\nThat’s it. I’ve nothing more to say. Don’t touch the big spikes. Don’t ever touch them.","March 5","true","6.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Cave Story+ is the remake of it. It's a 8bit styled vertical platformer-shooter with nice graphics, a well done soundtrack and a great, creative story. You, a robot called Quote, awoke in a dark cave without any memories. So the only thing you can do for now is to go to the Mimiga Vilage and see whats happening there. You will find out that a evil doctor is planning to kidnap all of those rabit-like creatures and your new mission is to save those creatures and save the world.\n\nPositive:\n- Well written story\n- Solid and responsible controlls\n- Nice creative gameplay elements inspired from the 8bit NES classics\n- New Graphics and Soundtracks\n- 5 Challenges added\n- New dungeon "Wind Fortres" added\n- Archivmentsystem added\n\nNegative:\n- Broken archivementsystem: "Curse Broken", the archivement after getting the best ending won't unlock so it is not possible to get that game 100% + Archivements won't unlock on japanese.\n- Broken Replay Function in challenges: Sometimes replays won't play correctly. It happend several times to me and i'm upset about that because i've beaten Wind Fortress within 2 minutes and Sanctuary within 6 minutes and guess what? I cant see what i've done there. That sucks.\n- Game closes after finishing a challenge. Thats minor but annoying. The Wii version haven't done something like that.\n- English Nicalis translation. The Aeon Genesis translation looks and sounds way better than that one by Nicalis. Fortunite, someone ported the AG translation to Cave Story+ in the Comunity guides but be aware that most of the archivements won't unlock with that translation.\n\nSince there is a freeware version of this game here are a few things that aren't present in the freeware version:\n- Difficulties:\n- Easy: Player takes half damage.\n(- Original: The name it self says that allready)\n- Hard: Brutally challenging. You only have 3HP most of the game.\n- Curly Mode (The same as the original story but you play as Curly Brace instead of Quote)\n- 5 Challenges (3 of them with brutal timebased Rankings from C to S):\n- New (awesome) Graphics\n- New Soundtrack (some kind of softer 8bit soundtrack. Original sounds better in my opinion)\n- Remastred Soundtrack (sounds like a techno mix. pretty awesome)\n- New dungeon "Wind Fortres" (avaiable via challanges)\n- Archivementsystem\n\nConclusion: It is a great remake of the original game with some things added and a high replay value. The story is binding, the characters rememberble and the gameplay nearly flawless. I can highly recomend this game for those 8bit and retro fans. For those hwo are sceptical about the game: try freeware version first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/200900/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nCave Story is a 2D platformer which takes you back to the 16-bit days, the game was released on steam in 2011, but the game was released in Japan in 2004 by Studio Pixel. Cave Story is not only a great platformer, it tells an interesting and far deeper story then you may realize on your first play through, if that wasn't enough, there are various decisions you can make throughout the game to obtain different items and even different story endings.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Maybe I heard Brentalfloss on Spotify singing the catchy theme song before playing the first 10 minutes of the game at a friend's house... and immediately knew I wanted this game. (Seriously, look up his song, it's sooooo good.)\nCave story starts out... DUN DUN DUN, in a cave! You're a boy who wakes up with no memory, but you soon learn of a mad scientist who intends to use these adorable bunny creatures (known as " Mimigas") in a sinister experiment to gain power.\nAs you progress through the story you pick up different items, accessories, weapons, and even a few aesthetics. There are also four different endings to the game, meaning if you didn't like the ending you got... guess what you get to do? mwahaha. While this feature is normally annoying, there's so much to discover I easily enjoyed playing the game again.\n\nGame Play: The controls are as simple as they get; up, down, left, right, shoot, and switch weapon. The game quickly changes the way you play with the addition of different weapons/accessories that may have a different impact on your character... I'm trying to be cryptic, shush.\nThere's really not much else that can be said about the Game Play, without giving away fun items that you discover from playing the game. I should mention that this game is one of those "probably more fun to play with a controller", but I'm dead set in my keyboard and mouse ways, so I've spent all my time playing this game with a keyboard; still an excellent, fun game.\n\nAchievements: There are 75 achievements for Cave Story, I have 57 of them (as of 04/20/15), I also have no shame in admitting I probably won't be getting any more of them, because this game is pretty tough in general... and I'm not even remotely close to a platforming-deity... Ask Super Meat Boy. *muffled crying* (It's a running gag, my friends get it... pops up in my reviews often.)\nThere are different categories for achievements: Story achievements, Item/weapon Collection Achievements, a few hidden achievements, Get a high letter rank on Bonus mission's, and End-Game Achievements. The most difficult achievements being: Hidden, Letter Rank, and End-Game Achievements.\n\nPrice: For just one payment of $14.99 you can enjoy the story inside a cave too! Seriously, that's a very fair asking price for a game I spent nearly 30 hours playing in the first two weeks of owning it. But if you're tight on money, just wait for a sale.\n\nConclusion: Cave Story is often times difficult (even on easy mode); the music is catchy, the game play is addictive, the controls are straight forward, and pretty much everything about the game is fun. The only real negative thing anyone can say about the game is that they might have mechanical problems (but those are few and far between).\nI absolutely recommend this game!","April 20, 2015","true","27.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Its strengths lie in the storytelling and art-style.\n\nStorywise, character development is achieved by slowly revealing new information about the characters.  The game has a level emotional depth to its characters, which is something not often found in this genre.  Multiple branches in the story will happen based on the players actions or inaction, which will have an impact on the outcomes of the characters you meet and befriend.  This branching is done in a way that it's not always apparent when you have made a 'choice'.\n\nThis depth is why I enjoyed the game (I am not a particular platformer fan) and probably why it has a sort of cult-like status.  I find it similar to how Pixar finds success in Toy Story, which has complex emotional themes despite being a movie for children.","December 16, 2013","true","9.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

After being released in 2004, the game recieved a cult following and was ported to the Wii and 3DS, and also to Steam with some new features, which is the version I'm reviewing right now. You play as a dude who wakes up in a cave, convieniently afflicted with amnesia, and well you run around figuring out what that you're doing on this cave which IS ACTUALLY A FLOATING ISLAND INHABITED BY CUTE RABBIT PEOPLE AND RULED OVER BY SOME CRAZY DOCTOR GUY WHO WANTS TO BRAINWASH THEM AND GET THEM TO FIGHT WARS FOR HIM SO HE CAN TAKE OVER THE WORLD\n\n♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, SUDDENLY YOU'RE RUNNING DOWN THIS CORRIDOR FIGHTING ELEPHANTS WITH A BB GUN TO TRY TO HATCH SOME DRAGON EGGS AND THEN YOU'RE TELEPORTING AROUND THE ISLAND ON RESCUE MISSIONS AND ♥♥♥♥, THEN YOU GET THIS GUN THAT SHOOTS BUBBLES DONT WORRY ITS REALLY GOOD AND AHH DONT SHOOT THAT YOU'LL BLOW UP THE ISLAND NOOOO\n\nIt's really fun, yeah. And the story is decent too, look, there's these cute anthropomorphic rabbits you can talk to and stuff, I don't care what you search on paheal after you're done with this game, it's all cool, man.\n\nBut the thing that put me off the game when I tried to play it a couple of years ago is the fact that there's multiple endings. Yeah, that's okay, I do like it when you get some clear cut paragon/renegade options for a good/evil end or if there's some stupid decisions you can make that'll get other main characters killed (and, as such, you can avoid making them), that's fantastic. But in Cave Story, without spoiling too much, the 'good' ending is sort of a secret path that you can only take after you've either beaten the game once and wondered, 'huh, let's try that again but I'll do that differently and see if something else happens', or if you look up a strategy guide. There is one bit that really irked me in which the game shows you something kind of important and you have to make a DELIBERATE EFFORT to avoid investigating i-okay, I'll shut up now, but the key thing that you've got to expect with this game is that you're going to '♥♥♥♥ up' in a sense on the first playthrough, and the best ending is more of a...hidden ending. But it's great. Play through it more than once, definitely, so you can try out the different weapons and stuff.\n\nI say this in all of my recommendations but well I really ♥♥♥♥ing dig 8bit soundtracks and this game has one of the best. Pixel (the aforementioned one japanese guy) definitely did a spot-on job of capturing the feel of OLD SCHOOL VIDEO GAME BEATZ, and if THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU, then the Plus version comes with a couple more versions of the soundtrack; a 'New' one, which is made by Nicalis and is, honestly, ♥♥♥♥ing awful, and a 'Remastered' one which is composed by none other than Danny mother♥♥♥♥ing Baranowsky,  and if you don't know who that is then ♥♥♥♥ you, it's the Super Meat Boy, Canabalt and Binding of Isaac guy.\n\nSo play through once with the classic soundtrack and get the decent ending, and then play through it again with the remastered one and get the 'true' or whatever ending and the super secret ultra gun and stuff. It's really, really fun. (I don't know if it showed up in the sale yet but if it does, you know what to do)","November 29, 2013","true","22.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","4"

Cave Story+ adds slightly higher-resolution (but still low-resolution) graphics, new music (that's inferior to the original music in my opinion), slightly better input device support, Steam integration, and some corny holiday-specific themes. But they significantly changed the game dialog, making it less charming and emotionally impactful, and to me that outweighs the new graphics. You can still download the original Cave Story for free, and if you want to support Daisuke Amaya (the creator of Cave Story), you can donate to him directly. I wish Cave Story+ included an option to use the original English text, like it does for the original graphics and music.\n\nHowever, if you want to play with a gamepad and don't want to spend any time getting it to work, Cave Story+ is probably the better choice.

I remember being on a budget and my consoles packed up 3,000 miles away. I remember hearing about this game, finding it with the aid of Google Translate and nabbing the excellent fan translation. And then I experienced the first game that made me think "this is a console quality experience." It was highly polished and didn't require any fiddling to make work. It had gorgeous pixel art graphics and fantastic chip tune music. The story was a tad hard to follow but very interesting and engaging. The game dripped with atmosphere. And ... it was all dreamed up and created by one man!\n\nFlash forward. In the meantime I beat this game on PC, I picked up the remake with optional slightly enhanced artwork and sound and beat it on Wii. And now I pick up that same game on Steam and start playing through it once again.\n\nAnd you know what? I plan on getting the 3D remake on 3DS next! There aren't many games I don't hesitate to play through again and again and even fewer I purchase again and again. Cave Story is up there in that elite list of mine. It is surely worthy of being called a classic and it is a game every gamer who grew up in the 8 and 16 bit eras will enjoy with an odd sense of nostalgia. Those growing up with gaming right now ought to take a chance and play through Cave Story.","October 20, 2014","true","5.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

Anyways, I already played this game a few years ago, but bought it again on Steam when it came out because, well, it's just that good. For fans of old-school 2D action-platformers, this game is for you. It has frantic shooting elements similar to action games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, but it's done in the exploratory 'Metroidvania' style. The gameplay is spot-on fantastic, and it's full of cool characters, maps, puzzles and secrets. It's also a tough challenge, especially if you want to go for the secret "true" ending. For fans of the genre, this game is a must-have. Pick it up, especially on sale. Note: I highly recommend using a gamepad.

However, Cave Story has a huge glaring issue that you need to be warned about if you've never played.\n\nThe game is cryptic as all hell. If you do not follow an extremely specific list of minute tasks (don't talk to this person, talk to this person a second time, examine an object that doesn't appear to be examinable, make this really long jump without falling, don't follow this person until you get this item, etc) then you cannot get the best ending.\n\nI am understandably upset, because even when using a guide, I missed one tiny little step (didn't talk to a person twice) and now the best ending is off limits on my current playthrough. I now have to start all over just because I missed one small step. This cryptic method of game development irritates me to no end and should be left as a relic of the NES era.\n\nPutting all that aside, Cave Story is still one of the best games on Steam and you should buy it rapidly. I just wanted to prepare you for one of the big problems of the game.","January 10, 2015","true","4.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"

It gives less than subtle nods to like platformers such as Megaman and Metroid, but has a very deep story. Characters do die and many of their fates rest on you and your decisions. While this game has a cute art style and happy music, it can be a very dark game when a favorite character(s) die because of something you didn't do. This game has multiple endings that feel incredibly different ie. not Mass Effect 3. This game is a blast, but is somewhat difficult to get the best ending. If you aren't completely sold I reccomend playing a bit of the original version for free  at www.cavestory.org so you know that you will enjoy it. One of my top 10 favorite games for sure, quite possibly top 5. All in all give this game a try if you want your mind blown. Fans of old school and new school games can easily enjoy this game if they are decent at platformers. If not there is an easy mode exclusive to cave story+ which does prevent you from getting the best ending. Also, I reccomend a controller.

Because it's just annoying to have to retrace your steps for a big chunk of road and watch the same cutscene over and over when you're trying to beat a boss, especially if you're trying to complete Hard Mode or to unlock the "Untouchable" and "Unstoppable" achievements. Everything else is just remarkable. It's the definition of Classic: a perfect Metroidvania platformer with great story and lots of secrets to be found. It's not a coincidence that Cave Story is considered by many the best indie game ever made. At least in its genre, it surely is.\n\nEDIT: I kinda hate Nicalis for introducing in the game achievements that are practically impossible to obtain. I mean, completing Blood Stained Sanctuary without ANY health upgrade, are they even serious? Have they at least TESTED if this thing was feasible AT ALL? I couldn't literally find ANYONE on the web that managed to do that. The very few people that unlocked the corrisponding achievement on their profile probably used cheats. This is no good.

I do, it's fun and energetic and really just a short and sweet experience that is no longer than it needs to be. Most of the game just works, and I do recommend this game just on the principle of how good it is. The soundtrack is wonderful, the gameplay is fun, and it's just really good storytelling. There are other reviews here that will sing all the praises of this game to the high heavens.\n\nHowever, in the interest of my own sanity, I'm going to vent a little. I'm going to talk about the design of the last level for the best ending of the game, and I don't think I'm spoiling anything, but if you are worried about that, feel free to make your own judgement call.\n\nWith that out of the way\n\nBlood Stained Sanctuary sucks. A lot. A lot of monkey nuts is what it sucks. It sucks so hard that I will do the proper abreviation of BS, remoiving the Sanctuary S because there is no sanctity in hell.\n\nIt would make a lot of sense as a challenge mode meant for people who wanted to put their "MLG 720 Pro" skills to a test, There's even a timer to tell you how long it takes for you to die. It's certainly difficult to get through, and it offers a big ol' challenge.\n\nHowever, there is a difference between playing a game to be good and playing a game to have fun. Pro LoL players play a game to be good, almost every Rocket League player is trying to have fun. A pro Smash player is playing to be good, a family is playing Smash to have fun.\n\nThe challenges are meant for someone who derives fun out of being amazing, out of working and working and working to get the shortest time possible, and then rubbingn it in the face of everyone else.\n\nBS does not quite understand this. It starts off with a fairly consistent challenge of flying over instant death spikes, and then the next two rooms are actively trying to destroy my will to live.\n\nAfter one bossfight, you will be rewarded with a slight breather, and then sent into a second bossfight, And at no point, in this entire sequence, are you given the option to save. Hell, you don't even have the option to refill your health between the two bosses. And you can kiss any health you lost on the way to BS goodbye.\n\nFirst of all, no one should ever, EVER, be able to summarize any significant portion of a game with the word "cluster♥♥♥♥". Two rooms and at least one bossfight in BS, however, are described perfectly in that way. It's annoying and it's unfair. Not difficult, unfair. Dark Souls is difficult, but Dark Souls is also great because it gives players a way to beat the game. Dark Souls, for all of its deaths, is surprisingly forgiveable and always makes sure the player thinks "I can do this", even when it drops the ball during certain fights (Bed of Chaos anyone?). BS is a random cluster♥♥♥♥ of falling blocks followed by a fight with a million tiny sprites that shoot arrows that deal far too much damage.\n\nSecondly, BS just shouldn't be the path to the "best ending" of the game. While I agree that a challenge is expected for the end of a game, I also feel that the challenge should be fair and it should be generally conceivable that a player of middling to decent skill should be able to overcome that challenge, at least on normal mode. If you are playing a game for fun, then you want to have fun all the way through. Bloodstained Sanctuary is like going on a couple of roller coasters, and then having your face beaten reapetedly into the asphalt because the park owner was offended out how you tried to have "fun" on what he thought was an extreme obstacle course meant for Hercules\n\nThirdly, and this is more tangential, BS brings up a comparison to the old Metroid games, which is bad because I can so clearly see where Metroid did it better. The entire levels is falling apart, evidenced by the massive rumblings and the faling bloocks of doom that knock out a fifth of your health. Metroid, too, always ended on the entire gameworld collapsing around you. Except you had seen all these portions fo the game world before, and going back was more a trip down memory lane. While road workers were trying to fill all of the potholes. And you were being chased by Jason Voorhees.\n\nSee, we hadn't even been given a real hint that that BS existed, you were just supposed to know that. And then you were supposed to dodge all of the falling blocks. And the little winged people, While using a jetpack. That always manages to fall into the path of a block because all blocks fall fast and the entire level is a cluster♥♥♥♥.\n\n\n\nOkay, I've had my breather, I've voiced my complaints. I'm good. I'm doing fine. Now I'm going to sit around for a while, and pick up Cave Story later. When BS is not going to immediatly give me an aneurysm.\n\nScratch that, just looked it up, says if I do sub-6 minutes BS run I get a Curly Brace themed title screen. If I pick up this game again, I'm going to lose my life.","May 19","true","19.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","The game is a classic, and nothing I can say will deter the millions in love since it came out in 2004. I had never played this game until 2015--I didn't get into the Metroidvania genre as a kid.\n\nThe purpose of mentioning this information is that (1) I didn't grow up with this classic, and (2) so many great games have come out, especialy within its genre, that, perhaps, my issue with the game is a problem with time. More specifically, the problem of genre saturation.\n\nThink of games like LIMBO that were the new standard of the puzzle-platformer, then those games were done over and over, and now, going back to LIMBO, the problems with the game stand more out as it's not as special as it once was.\n\nNES-styled games (or even Metroidvania games) are not that uncommon, nor are one-man projects--for example, Dust: An Eylsian Tale, Axiom Verge, Undertale, LISA etc.--as rare today. (I'm not saying the work has become easier. The novelty of one-man projects has come and gone.)\n\nCave Story will continue to be an inspiration to many indie devs, and it earns its acclaim as a great game. No mistake was made there.\n\nHowever... I think some aspects, both of its gameplay and of its narrative, will stand out as time continues. And this is a review to newcomers so that you don't set too high expectations for the game. (There will be no spoilers.)\n\nExploring the Story\nFirst off, this game's story is almost too serious for how stupid it sounds on paper. And so many disturbing things that happen in game are quite dark when you think about the things you don't see. I love how absurd this story gets at times, but it also never forgets when to keep a straight face.\n\nThe problem I have with this story is not what it is. My problem is how it is told, namely through exposition upon exposition, sometimes rather abruptly without any dramatic weight.\n\nI'm not against having complex plots or reading in my games. I love CRPGs after all. But this game loses all its mystique it builds up after the first hour as the game's story becomes told through constant expositions. Motives are sometimes introduced before you can imagine your own conclusions, and sometimes characters are suddenly introduced with a full backstory and the impact has no meaning.\n\nNot every exchange is telling you information for the sake of lore. The exchanges between Quote and Curly Brace feel heartwarming, and because I am invested in both characters the exposition doesn't come off as forced. There are also messages or notes hidden that share insight on characters, which is a great way to tell stories that feel like you made a discovery.\n\nMore often this idea is a roadblock. For example, you get a character that is suddenly vital to the game's story without any foreshadowing or even a early mention, and his backstory is told while pausing the game (randomly) on the most difficult level. So not only is the story pulled out of nowhere it also gets in the way of the gameplay.\n\nIt makes me wonder why not tell the exposition by other storytelling means like environmental design. The game has one or two moments like these, and on top of the notes/messages it feels like a reward for exploration.\n\nBut that's enough to say on the story; it's small fish compared to the gameplay problems.\n\nExploring the Cave\nFor a Metroidvania game, the game feels a little barebones in its mechanics.\n\nYou get seven weapons with different arcs and effects as you level them up from collecting triangles (and you lose the XP by being constantly hit), but manyfeel worthless except for specific cases (the Fireball especially). You also get a jetpack, but not until two-thirds of the game is finished--I don't think there's a way to collect it early because, for a Metroidvania game, it's very linear. And the only items to collect are health upgrades.\n\nThe one gamplay feature that I do like is the hidden difficulty throughout most of the game. You can swap out weapons or items to make earlier sections easier, or you can bite the bullet and earn the reward later. These aren't really obvious, and you won't know you made a bad decision until much later, which some of them tie into the bonus endings of the game. (There are really only two endings with a third one being a mid-game end. You will need a guide to know how to get the final/good ending because the game asks you to do something illogical).\n\nI really do like this feature because it ties so well into the heroic story where you influence the ones you can save and the people you simply cannot. These choices mean something.\n\nThe overall difficulty is not a fair game. Save spots are frequent through most of the game, which you will want to save often because cutscenes will be replayed upon death without a skip option. Only the boss-rush at the end, and the final level with five bosses have one save spot.\n\nThere are no E-tank substitutes--only a one-time full-health drink--but, like Megaman, you can kill smaller enemies in the boss-fights for health, weapon XP and missles. It takes real effort to regain your health in boss-fights, which I think is fine for when you have scattered save places. I would like that to be a player option rather than mandatory with the end-game'ssudden difficulty spike.\n\nAnd then you have the the last level. Symbolizing only one thing: Hell. (You will need a guide to trigger this outcome--no joke.)\n\nEither you will break your controller or you will develop a sixth sense of a bullet-hell mess for the level. Then you have to fight five boss-forms in ONE life, and if you fail you have to start all the way from the bullet-hell level. It feels like an excuse for NES difficulty rather than an actual challenge (and it reminds me too much of Street Fighter 2010: The Final Fight).\n\nAnd then you have extra challenge modes and a hard mode for enthusiasts. I might do a Curley Brace mode playthrough just for dialogue changes and for the normal ending. So, thankfully, for a short game (4 to 5 hours on a normal playthrough) there is lots of replay value for sadists.\n\nThere's Still A Great Game To Be Found\nPlease don't let my nitpicks convince you that this game is not worth the effort. Despite the steep difficulty curve, the game is very enjoyable and I can easily recommend it.\n\nAll I want to say is just know what to expect: Don't let nostalgia keep the faults unseen because without knowing where we err we cannot know where we need to grow.","September 27, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Just the feel of it ever since I first played it was just too much fun! I've played it through on PC, 3DS, Wii and bought it again on the Nintendo Shop on my 3DS(Classic) and did a hard mode run with the Machine Gun and Bubbline(Pains me to not use king's blade). So I decided, why not buy CS+ as well since it was on sale?! And even though it's like my 3rd time buying it again, I don't think I will ever regret the purchase! Just the diversity and the play style which causes for a tad bit grinding and the punishment system of trying to teach you to not get hit and be tactical. It also has a kind of feel like the game itself is telling you to not give up and be a hero! I mean that is something you almost never see in video games these days.\n\nIt also has these really nice transitions of bringing you from upbeat to depressing and it really just shows how a real villian is supposed to act instead of just a clash of ideals and opinions with the whole thing between Misery(Absoloutley <3 Misery she's so casual) and The Doctor(Just a downright jerk) going against Quote and Curly Brace. It just let you feel you were on a real cause instead of it just being a snuff game where the main character was mad the antagonist ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in his corn flakes. It even shows little things where the Villians start to step their game up and try harder instead of just refurbishing their same plan or just sitting back and watching you become OP. Made you feel like: "Hey, I'm getting stronger, faster and much more cool! I can really do this! Just look at me from start to finish! I started with a dinky pistol, now I'm shooting laser beams while I have stars following me!","December 30, 2013","true","6.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game was made by 1 person, everything. The music, art, and programming was just one dude. The art style is okay in "HD" mode, but consider playing through the game with original music and non-HD first, I feel that it is more charming at it's original state. Basically, you're a guy who, you guessed it, fights his way through multiple caves (and other places too), and this dude also has to deal with a bunny rabbit soap opera. The story is goofy, but very compelling. The script is awesome, melding happy, sad, and funny all togther. You'll have many fun weapons to use through out the game, and they all can be leveled up by collecting fallen Doritos which are relinquished from enemies when you kill em. But the weapons can de-level if you get hit too many times, making a unique challenge factor. This Steam version offers a new hard mode if you are a masochist, since the original difficulty is nothing to scoff at. The music is very memorable, and so well done too, setting the appropriate tone for each "cave". There are multiple endings, easter eggs galore, and a hidden final area/boss, which is a blast to speed run though once you unlock it.\n\nDo yourself a favor, buy and complete this game.","January 15, 2014","true","2.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The story is beautifully ominous and rich with immersion. It is a game that can be picked up time after time and still maintain it's replayability and fun. As someone who never played the original Cave Story, this game came as a great shock to me. It reminded me of oldschool platformer games like Metroid, where you could explore, find new items, get upgrades, discover secrets, whatever you so desired. A huge amount of games that try to do that can't pull it off. They do exactly the opposite of what Cave Story does. Cave Story gives the player a sense of exploration; something that can't be crafted in many games. The player IS the main character, and everything that happens will affect the player as it did the character. What detracts from this game is the same thing that detracts from every game of this genre; things like getting stuck on the same level over and over, getting stuck, and other things of the sort. I'm not going to lower this games rating because of that drastically, purely because that is sometimes what makes the game the game that it is. Example being in Zelda; you will remember the water temple more because it was a pain in the butt to beat. Things that like make Cave Story all the more memorable, and making it a game I will think about time and time again. Great indie game that everyone should play.","January 26, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is played with simple moving, jumping, and shooting mechanics with an emphasis on fighting but the game also requires a fair bit of platforming.  The weapons all function very differently.  They are suited for different situations and really mix up the gameplay as do the area-specific enemies.  The boss fights in particular will always force you to deal with something new and they are great fun.\nThe characters are suprisingly deep and they are what really made the game memorable for me.  Their personalities are communicated very well and it's easy to become attached to many of them.  The plot setup is fairly cliché but the characters and encounters keep it engaging and the story progresses at a very good pace.\nThe game seems to have a pretty linear progression at first, but there are secrets to be found, several sidequests, optional weapons, and multiple endings which all make the game that much richer.\nCave Story has great gameplay, a good story, memorable characters, and to top it off, an exceptional soundtrack.","July 3, 2012","true","30.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From the run and gun gameplay, to the hidden secrets, to the fairly simple story, players are rewarded for paying attention. With just the right difficulty curve for the average player, Cave Story has more than it's fair share of teeth-grinding, headache-inducing punishment for the player who dares to dig a little deeper.\n\nThe cast, small as it may be, is memorable and loveable.The story, simple as it may be, is fairly heavy and emotional.

When I played Cave Story the first time it was a cool little free indie title, so it's amount of depth and ideas surprised me and I was pretty forgiving with it.\n\nThat being said, the issues I had with it seem to remain unchanged. The game has 3 different endings and even some secrets. Solid replayability, right? It would be, if the pacing was better.\n\n- Fetch quests...Every time, without fail, the fetch quests discourage me from wanting to play through Cave Story again. Even the first time I played, they seemed overly-convoluted just for the sake of artifically lengethening the game. The rocket portion isn't nearly as offensive as the bomb and dog-catching parts, but still annoying.\n\n- Unskippable dialogue. This is unexcusable for a re-release. At least allow me to hold down a button to speed through text. Technically you can, but you have to press a button at the end of every single chunk of text, so it really defeats the point. What's worse, there's tons of dialogue in the beginning portions of the game, so it further hinders the desire to replay Cave Story.\n\n- In typical RPG fashion, you have to interact with specific NPCs or items in a specific order to progress through the story. It feels very unintuitive and could have been handled better. Particularly with the bomb part, combined with unskippable dialogue, it really kills the pacing.\n\n- The things you have to do to get to the real final level. The amount of unintuitive BS you have to do to access the true final area is dumb. Just the whole situation with Dr. Booster falling is infuriating. Your natural instinct is to go down and save him. Ok so he dies and gives you the booster, alright. But wait how do you actually save him? By not trying to save him....no explanation given. Even worse, it's VERY difficult to not fall down, and once you do fall down, you cannot get back up without the booster, so you'd better hope you saved just beforehand or you're screwed. Nevermind all the very specfic steps involved with saving Curly Brace...\n\n- 1-hit KO spikes. I get it, it's a 2D game and they need ways to up the challenge, but this has always felt like lazy game design to me. Particularly here where I'm a robot designed for battle and yet somehow the slighest touch of a spike kills me evem after having all upgrades.\n\n- Not being able to customize the weapon quick-swap rotary is extremely inconvenient. In the middle of battle I want to change my weapon without cycling through the weapons I hardly use. If I ever want to use them again, then let me just equip them.\n\nCave Story has a lot of cool things about it, but this mostly feels like a paid Steam port (of a free game) with slightly nicer graphics and sound, that did nothing to address some of its issues.","September 15, 2015","false","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Daisuke Amaya also known as Pixel made this game for 5 years during his free time which sounds great.\nYou play the role of a unknown person who wakes up in the first cave, im not joking thats what the 1st level of the game is called. You lookaround the cave and 'steal' a gun from a guy who is sleeping. You soon find yourself in a village called Mimiga Village, a race of bunnies who are kidnapped from the doctor, not the one who helps you with your body i mean the one who kills you for no reason just to possess something.\nAs you progress through the game you find a girl who was a human but got transformed into a mimiga ( dont worry only 2 people got turned like that, every mimiga is not a human) and asks your help to escape the island with her family. You realize you are on a giant island that was a piece of the surface (its not Earth). and that your a robot who was sent to the island to kill the mimiga but you got seperated from your partner and you forgot your name (its a stupid one but im not spoiling that much). Your job in the game is, find your partnet, save the mimiga, rescue the captured mimigas from the docter, kill the docters minions and himself and 1 more thing that affects the entire island.\nThis game is actually harder than it looks as you find missle upgrades, health upgrades, new guns and most importantly, what you must and musnt do. There is 3 ending in the game, bad, ok and good ending. getting the good ending is hard as you must get certain items and not pick up items.\nI give this game 9 out of 10 because Daisuke Amaya really took his time to make an amazing game all by himself, the music,the gameplay and the graphics. The story gets more interesting as your progress through the game and the gameplay is equevalent to everyone well not the ending as it takes hardcore players to finish.\nI forgot to mention once you beat the game, you can play as your partner and everything is switch, now the partner is looking for you but its not worth sin e its the exact same thing but with diffrent dialologue.","May 4, 2014","true","13.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Retro or Modern-retro or Modern?\nRegardless of your answer, the Soundtrack option has you covered, even with different styles and approaches, they all manage to create great tunes for ambience and just ear-candy, my personal pick is the Remastered style, but be cautious, you might have some tracks burnt into the back of your mind for the next few weeks.\n\nDurationFor a Metroidvania style game, generally one can say is on the short side, if you are quick to getting the hang of it, you can get the Good Ending in about 5 hours, but be prepared to have your patience and staying power tested and tempered if you decide to find and get the Best Ending (Difficulty walls are a beautiful thing, let me tell you).\nHowever if you are like me (Don't do that, you're taking the wrong path) and decide to 100% this game's Achievements, oh boy, you are in a cup of lemon juice over a dry open cut.\nI think its accurate to say some of these are among things that only those very dedicated people do (Looking right at you, Unstoppable and Hell under 3 mins achievements!!), not to mention one of these Achievements is bugged and will not unlock unless you use a Program, Yeah yeah, call me cheater, but i did fulfill the requirement for the Achievement rightfully, so i just claimed what is mine!\n(Inb4 anyone asks, the program is here[gib.me], in case you ARE a Achievement Hunter like me and you want to get that Bugged Achievement (It's name is Curse Broken, by the way!~)\n(PD: I know some people will abuse it to get EZ Achievements, but mommy ain't gonna save ya from the Ban that awaits for U!)\n\ntl;drWhy are you still reading this? Wasn't the intro text clear enough? This is one of the finest Metroidvania Indie games in the scene out there, initially made by one guy, this game cannot be reccomended enough if you like Metroidvania and Platformer hybrids, even if you don't, who knows maybe Cave Story can change that!\n\nAs such, i shall grant this game, the fabled...\nCURLY'S PANTIES/10","May 22","true","60.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

Это единственная игра, в которой я намного больше следил за уровнем, чем за здоровьем (за ним вообще не следил, если честно, так что было много глупых смертей ради опыта).\nТонна секретов. Я не нашёл ни один серьёзный секрет, хоть и осмотрел все углы в большинстве уровней.\n3 концовки (сразу предупрежу, что хорошую без гайда почти невозможно получить, так что готовьтесь к очень грустным и неоправданным событиям).\nОтличный баланс между стрельбой и платформером (но стрельбы всё равно больше, особенно в конце игры). Обычно в подобных играх всё время надоедают однообразные прыжки по платформам, либо однообразное мочилово, тут же я всю игру прошёл, даже немного не теряя интереса.\nРазные уровни сложности, что редко встречается в платформерах.\nХороший сандутрек.\nВыбор между новой и старой графикой и музыкой.Минусы:\nЧтобы получить хорошую концовку, нужно сделать не очень логичное действие, а после этого тщательно подумать в одном месте. Ну или воспользоваться гайдом.\nНекоторые задания заставляют ходить по одной и той же локации кругами. На лёгкой сложности это не было проблемой, но на средней это ад.\nОчень маленькое разрешение. Мне это совершенно не помешало, но я представляю, как это должно быть ужасно для людей с 4К.Эта игра на лёгком закончилась всего за 4 часа, но смогла вызвать лёгкую депрессию. Слишком впечатлительным лучше не играть.\nP.S. Оригинальная игра бесплатна. Здесь лишь новая музыка, новые текстурки и несколько бесполезных фич. Но в оригинале Мимиги не такие милые, так что советую купить.","October 30, 2015","true","4.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I remeber getting the demo of this on my Wii some time ago, and i enjoyed it. When i saw this on Steam i bought it as soon as i could. And i love this game. The game is like a good old 2D shooter, but the music and the RPG elements makes it different. I highly recommend using a controller to play, for convinience that is. The game is funny at times and i have cracked a smile once in a while. The game is however difficult, so difficult at times that i just had to put my controller down. The game does have the "What do i do and where do i go" moments in it, which really irritated me. The game is cheap and it gives more than it costs.

There is also a newer art style that is "HD" polished look, cleaner lines etc. 3D characters etc. The soundtrack from the original is there in all its glory. There is also a remastered version of the original soundtrack, and a brand new soundtrack. There are 3 saves slots in story mode, so you can mix and match art styles and soundtracks.\n\nI love this game, is tough, has questing, platforming, amazing boss fights, retro visuals and great gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/recommended/200900/","lightbringerid","Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/","83 products in account","I'm sort of biased about this game.\n\nI say this because I played it before it was on Steam. As a freeware PC game, it was top notch. Hard to believe the original was made by just 1 guy. However, this isn't the original release I'm reviewing and they charge 14.99 for this version.\n\nThe game itself is some sort of a strange hybrid of Run N' Gun platforming mixed with Metroidvania, as the whole game is just 1 huge level with some backtracking is required to obtain certain items.\n\nThe controls themselves are excellent and there is a nice variety of different weapons you can use. Also, the minimalistic graphics and chiptune soundtrack give the game a unique retro vibe which is either hit-or-miss, depending on whether you like 8 bit games. The game does come with 2 graphic modes and 3 versions of the soundtrack though, so you can adjust the feel of the game somewhat if you feel inclined to.\n\nAt about a third through the game, following a plot twist, the game starts gaining momentum. The plot becomes darker, the bactracking becomes a lot less common, your arsenal starts growing to a nice size, and the game becomes a joy to play, with more varied environments, more challenging enemies, and epic boss battles.\n\nMy main issue with the game is it's first third. During your first few hours of the game, your arsenal is very limited, you backtrack through the same environments over and over on fetch quests, and fight the same enemies. This part of the game greatly highlights it's low budget and repeatedly recycled assets. However, if you endure enough to get over this frustrating part of the game, you're in for a treat as the following parts of the game are excellent.\n\nAnother minor gripe I have with the game is how easy it is to miss the best ending. The game has 4 endings (same as the original), and getting the best one will probably require a guide, as reaching it is very unintuitive and much harder to do than any of the others.\n\nI have a problem recommending this one. As much as I love the later parts of the game, this Steam release doesn't really add much content, and the earlier segments of the game might make you lose interest before you get to the good parts. I recommend you try the original, free version, as it's basically the same game without some modern conveniences.\n\nIf you enjoy that one, like I did, and a higher resolution, new soundtrack, and an additional level justify the 15$ for you, I say go for it.","August 10, 2015","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the silent protagonist is quite overdone by Japanese style games, it's still interesting to see the exchanges between characters and whatnot.\n\nThe gameplay itself is nice. In the midst of all the 3D games, it's nice to have a 2D sidescroller once in a while, and it's quite reminiscent of games such as Metroid or whatnot. It's unique in that you have different levels for the weapons that you can lose by being hit (so there's encouragement to avoid attacks beyond hp) and gained by eating doritos. The gameplay mainly speaks more for itself, in any case. Also, the gameplay strikes a nice balance with difficulty. It becomes extremely difficult at times, but not overwhelmingly so. Of course, if you want to go for best ending... heh. Good luck.\n\nSo, it's worth a try at least.

It's a great game that mixes a great story with great platforming. And best of all, it has many different weapons.\n\nSpeaking of many differing things.. it has a bunch of endings too.\n\nWhat really brought me to obtain this game (thanks to a friend) was the extra content. Whether it be challenges or the new remastered soundtrack and sprites, you're gonna find something new here.\n\nBut what truly made me want this is Curly Story. I mean come on, Curly Brace is the best.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I'd recommend this to anyone. I've had a lot of experience with this game (on the freeware version), I've played through it with every possible weapon combination and I try to always aim for the best ending possible. It's an experience that you ultimately decide on how it plays out.","January 13","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/recommended/200900/","Lobinbe","Lob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/","301 products in account","I know I'm late to the Cave Story party but this game is great and I was surprised by its quality. Cave Story is a 2D side-scroller/run n' gun where you progress by exploring, defeating enemies, finding items and beating the many boss fights. Although this may all sound run of the mill, the strengths of the game lie in its mechanics. Although it is inspired by retro platformers it is not an amalgamation of several retro platformers, instead doing its own thing. An example of this would be the levelling system of the game's weapons, where they are levelled up by collecting xp drops from enemies, but xp is lost when you take damage, and the weapon can even level down again. This makes for an interesting mechanic, where there are higher stakes to getting hit than there usually is in a modern platformer.\n\nThe weapon balance is great. No weapon entirely replaces another as they each have their own pros and cons, and are useful in different situations, For example, the rocket launcher can pummel through enemies but it takes awhile to level it up and it is reliant on a limited ammo supply. The second of this game's biggest strengths is the level design, which is on point. The difficulty curve is smooth and the levels are filled with a variety of secrets and surprises, the boss fights are placed so as to surprise the player and keep them on their toes, as any retro-styled game should.\n\nFinally, the game has a charming art style and cast of memorable characters, which I would go on about more but I am more concerned with the gameplay here. Unfortunately, the game is not without its faults. First and foremost, the controls feel very floaty at the best of times. It isn't too hard to get accustomed to the floatiness of the controls, and most people won't even notice it, but for someone like me who plays a lot of run n' gun-style arcade games this can put me off, and I feel like much of the game's difficulty comes from the floatiness rather than actual design (most of the game's difficulty is legitimate however).\n\nSecondly, the three difficulty options presented to the player are not fleshed out, since they only affect how much damage you take from being hit, rather than changing the design of the game to make it more or less skill-demanding. This is likely because the original freeware version did not have different difficulty options, therefore the publisher of CS+ tacked them on.  The other big issue concerning difficulty is the frequency of the save points. They are just too frequent. It is only at the final part of the game where save points are scarce, for most of the game you will never go long without a save point. This reduces the otherwise high-stakes of the game and makes death feel disappointly lenient. Again most people won't mind this but those looking for high-stakes action should keep it in mind.\n\nThis is not so much an issue with the game, but with the localisation. The official translation by nicalis is terrible and strips away most of the charm of the character cast and setting. If you want to play this game don't do what I did, play with the official translation. What you're gonna want to do is download a fanmade translation and extract it to the game's directory on steam. There are other steam guides to help you through the process, and trust me you will be happier for having done it.\n\nOverall, Cave Story is easy to recommend for just about anyone interested in a hardcore platformer/run n' gun with great level design and weapon balance, and a charming visual style.","February 17","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I would highly recommended to look up a speedrun and/or walkthrough of that part if you’re getting stuck on a certain section of it (especially with the very last 2 parts because you have 10 seconds to figure it out and to many ways to mess up). The 1st 3 parts of it is UNfairly challenging and can be learn given enough time.\n\n\nSoundtrack/OST:\nOne of the best OSTs ever made IMO, be sure to have the game set to “Remaster”\nhttp://cavestory.wikia.com/wiki/Version_differences <-- If you want to know about the different versions of this game and their assets.\n\n\nMain Problem with the game:\n-The branching paths... The paths are few and far between but taking the wrong path will give you the lesser ending + weaker items (and nothing more)\n-The paths are not obvious which mean you can end up making a mistake where you end up deeply regretting latter (which usually leads to messing with trainers to get back where you want to be)\n-So with this I have to regrettable say, it’s in your best interest to grab a guide that at least tells you about these branching paths and which ones to take.\n\n\nConclusion:\nOverlooking the game problems, I think this is a game that EVERYONE should play/try.\n-IMO there’s something whimsical about this game that makes it special for me and also IMO it would be unfair to yourselves if you went on living without never touching this game.","September 26, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

To be honest, you probably did, but if not, you should be impressed.\nI enjoyed this game a LOT, my hours should pretty much be the evidence for that. The gameplay is pretty addicting, it isn't easy, but not too hard either (for the most part, atleast).\n\nHowever, the original version of the game - found at http://www.cavestory.org/ - is free and it's pretty much the same with the exception of challenges and runs at 50fps, while the Cave Story+ version runs at 60fps. As a player of both versions, I got to say, I enjoyed the CS+ version more.\n\nIf you don't like the "remastered" graphics or soundtrack you can always change them to original (in the soundtrack, there's a "New" version, which is the Wii version's music, I believe).\n\nBeware, though, there IS one achievement that is bugged, and as having all other achievements, this is annoying and makes me wish Nicalis fixed it.\n\nFor some reason, I didn't really enjoy it at the start (stopped at around the 2nd or 3rd area), but once I got around to play it again, I enjoyed it.\n\nRating?

He grew very emotionally attached to Curly quite quickly, and he got to a point where he had to fight a boss. Due to Cave Story's weird ending system that this kid had no idea about, he couldn't save Curly, and she drowned. This made the kid cry for hours. This kept him awake at night years later. (No joke, and I'm not exaggerating here.) And he beat the game. For a long time, he didn't return to Cave Story. He was too sad. Years later, he got on Steam one day, and saw something in the store called Cave Story+. He decided to buy it, because he really liked Cave Story. He played it, and he beat the game and got the best ending. He saved Curly. He was so happy, and he slept better at night. If you haven't guessed yet, this kid was me.

Yes!\nI also recommend playing it on easy difficulty the first time! Otherwise, you could spend hours being stuck due to some boss battle. Tons of achievements that are fun to get, plenty of secrets/"easter eggs"\nGorgeous soundtrack and graphics, and the story is amazing. Now go buy it. Why are you still reading? Go buy it!\n\nIf you're still reading, you hopefully already own the game, and you've beaten it.\nMajor spoilers are coming up, so stop reading now if you don't want spoilers.\nHere's a story of a kid who decided to buy Cave Story for Wii. He started playing the game, and honestly, he loved it. He played it for hours every day, and eventually he met a girl named Curly. Curly was a robot, just like the player this kid was controlling. He grew very emotionally attached to Curly quite quickly, and he got to a point where he had to fight a boss. Due to Cave Story's weird ending system that this kid had no idea about, he couldn't save Curly, and she drowned. This made the kid cry for hours. This kept him awake at night years later. (No joke, and I'm not exaggerating here.) And he beat the game. For a long time, he didn't return to Cave Story. He was too sad. Years later, he got on Steam one day, and saw something in the store called Cave Story+. He decided to buy it, because he really liked Cave Story. He played it, and he beat the game and got the best ending. He saved Curly. He was so happy, and he slept better at night. If you haven't guessed yet, this kid was me. Thanks for putting this on Steam.","November 27, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/recommended/200900/","lightbringerid","Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/","83 products in account","I'm sort of biased about this game.\n\nI say this because I played it before it was on Steam. As a freeware PC game, it was top notch. Hard to believe the original was made by just 1 guy. However, this isn't the original release I'm reviewing and they charge 14.99 for this version.\n\nThe game itself is some sort of a strange hybrid of Run N' Gun platforming mixed with Metroidvania, as the whole game is just 1 huge level with some backtracking is required to obtain certain items.\n\nThe controls themselves are excellent and there is a nice variety of different weapons you can use. Also, the minimalistic graphics and chiptune soundtrack give the game a unique retro vibe which is either hit-or-miss, depending on whether you like 8 bit games. The game does come with 2 graphic modes and 3 versions of the soundtrack though, so you can adjust the feel of the game somewhat if you feel inclined to.\n\nAt about a third through the game, following a plot twist, the game starts gaining momentum. The plot becomes darker, the bactracking becomes a lot less common, your arsenal starts growing to a nice size, and the game becomes a joy to play, with more varied environments, more challenging enemies, and epic boss battles.\n\nMy main issue with the game is it's first third. During your first few hours of the game, your arsenal is very limited, you backtrack through the same environments over and over on fetch quests, and fight the same enemies. This part of the game greatly highlights it's low budget and repeatedly recycled assets. However, if you endure enough to get over this frustrating part of the game, you're in for a treat as the following parts of the game are excellent.\n\nAnother minor gripe I have with the game is how easy it is to miss the best ending. The game has 4 endings (same as the original), and getting the best one will probably require a guide, as reaching it is very unintuitive and much harder to do than any of the others.\n\nI have a problem recommending this one. As much as I love the later parts of the game, this Steam release doesn't really add much content, and the earlier segments of the game might make you lose interest before you get to the good parts. I recommend you try the original, free version, as it's basically the same game without some modern conveniences.\n\nIf you enjoy that one, like I did, and a higher resolution, new soundtrack, and an additional level justify the 15$ for you, I say go for it.","August 10, 2015","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I discovered it on the DSiWare shop on my Nintendo DSi 5 years ago, and I bought it. I then moved onto the freeware version from the fansite, and now I've gotten my hands on this - Cave Story+. It's a great game that mixes a great story with great platforming. And best of all, it has many different weapons.\n\nSpeaking of many differing things.. it has a bunch of endings too.\n\nWhat really brought me to obtain this game (thanks to a friend) was the extra content. Whether it be challenges or the new remastered soundtrack and sprites, you're gonna find something new here.\n\nBut what truly made me want this is Curly Story. I mean come on, Curly Brace is the best.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I'd recommend this to anyone. I've had a lot of experience with this game (on the freeware version), I've played through it with every possible weapon combination and I try to always aim for the best ending possible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/recommended/200900/","Lobinbe","Lob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/","301 products in account","I know I'm late to the Cave Story party but this game is great and I was surprised by its quality. Cave Story is a 2D side-scroller/run n' gun where you progress by exploring, defeating enemies, finding items and beating the many boss fights. Although this may all sound run of the mill, the strengths of the game lie in its mechanics. Although it is inspired by retro platformers it is not an amalgamation of several retro platformers, instead doing its own thing. An example of this would be the levelling system of the game's weapons, where they are levelled up by collecting xp drops from enemies, but xp is lost when you take damage, and the weapon can even level down again. This makes for an interesting mechanic, where there are higher stakes to getting hit than there usually is in a modern platformer.\n\nThe weapon balance is great. No weapon entirely replaces another as they each have their own pros and cons, and are useful in different situations, For example, the rocket launcher can pummel through enemies but it takes awhile to level it up and it is reliant on a limited ammo supply. The second of this game's biggest strengths is the level design, which is on point. The difficulty curve is smooth and the levels are filled with a variety of secrets and surprises, the boss fights are placed so as to surprise the player and keep them on their toes, as any retro-styled game should.\n\nFinally, the game has a charming art style and cast of memorable characters, which I would go on about more but I am more concerned with the gameplay here. Unfortunately, the game is not without its faults. First and foremost, the controls feel very floaty at the best of times. It isn't too hard to get accustomed to the floatiness of the controls, and most people won't even notice it, but for someone like me who plays a lot of run n' gun-style arcade games this can put me off, and I feel like much of the game's difficulty comes from the floatiness rather than actual design (most of the game's difficulty is legitimate however).\n\nSecondly, the three difficulty options presented to the player are not fleshed out, since they only affect how much damage you take from being hit, rather than changing the design of the game to make it more or less skill-demanding. This is likely because the original freeware version did not have different difficulty options, therefore the publisher of CS+ tacked them on.  The other big issue concerning difficulty is the frequency of the save points. They are just too frequent. It is only at the final part of the game where save points are scarce, for most of the game you will never go long without a save point. This reduces the otherwise high-stakes of the game and makes death feel disappointly lenient. Again most people won't mind this but those looking for high-stakes action should keep it in mind.\n\nThis is not so much an issue with the game, but with the localisation. The official translation by nicalis is terrible and strips away most of the charm of the character cast and setting. If you want to play this game don't do what I did, play with the official translation. What you're gonna want to do is download a fanmade translation and extract it to the game's directory on steam. There are other steam guides to help you through the process, and trust me you will be happier for having done it.\n\nOverall, Cave Story is easy to recommend for just about anyone interested in a hardcore platformer/run n' gun with great level design and weapon balance, and a charming visual style.","February 17","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

To be honest, you probably did, but if not, you should be impressed.\nI enjoyed this game a LOT, my hours should pretty much be the evidence for that. The gameplay is pretty addicting, it isn't easy, but not too hard either (for the most part, atleast).\n\nHowever, the original version of the game - found at http://www.cavestory.org/ - is free and it's pretty much the same with the exception of challenges and runs at 50fps, while the Cave Story+ version runs at 60fps. As a player of both versions, I got to say, I enjoyed the CS+ version more.\n\nIf you don't like the "remastered" graphics or soundtrack you can always change them to original (in the soundtrack, there's a "New" version, which is the Wii version's music, I believe).\n\nBeware, though, there IS one achievement that is bugged, and as having all other achievements, this is annoying and makes me wish Nicalis fixed it.\n\nFor some reason, I didn't really enjoy it at the start (stopped at around the 2nd or 3rd area), but once I got around to play it again, I enjoyed it.\n\nRating?

This is, without a doubt, the best indie game I've ever played.\n\nStoryline(s)The multiple endings are all very well developed. Although there is more than one endings, te endings don't effect the gameplay negatively. This game masterfully avoids too many endings, unlike some other games, where, simply for the sake of adding endings, the creators forget to make their game playable.\n\nGameplayThis game is very engaging. It keeps you wanting more, while not revealing too much to the point where the playthrough feels mindless. The replayability is astounding, because, although the location and dialogue don't change much throughout different playthroughs, as you become more experienced, you are able to find many more aspects that were originally, seemingly, hidden.\n\nAchievementsThe addition of acheivement is Cave Story+ from Cave Story is luxurious. Although, not necessary, the achievements are a very powerful driving factor in the exploration of the game. These achievements aren't just mindless rewards given out for any task, but instead, vary in difficult, presenting a challenge to achievement collectors.\n\nExtra FeaturesThe additional features added in Cave Story+ (Curly Mode, Machine Gun Challenge, ect.) are all very engaging and are a good reason to keep coming back. They all leave a bit of a mystery that is intruiging enough for a player to want to replay this game, over and over and over, while still being excited about each playthrough.\n\nAlthough I do realise that I gave a very brief review, I believe that I covered important aspects of the game.

The lovingly hand-crafted graphics and catchy chiptune soundtrack create a vibrant "16 bit" environment. The storyline is interesting and quirky, with a distinctly Japanese flavor. Gameplay is somewhere between a "metroidvania" platformer and a "bullet hell" shoot-em-up: platforming challenges mix with a unique weapons upgrade system which rewards skillful dodging and punishes the slightest misstep with power-downs. There are certainly challenges to be had on higher difficulties, but those who just want to coast through the story will find options which suit them as well.\n\nInconvenient save point locations can make difficult areas a bit of a grind, as you have to beat the same area over and over again to reach a boss fight or other difficult challenge, and the game does little other than drop hints to steer you towards your end goal. Perhaps the game's biggest flaw however is the length: a skilled gamer can breeze through easy difficulty in less than four hours. Certainly there is a lot of replayability, as one can increase the difficulty level or make different choices in storyline progression, but one must certainly have a strong appreciation for that type of repetition to endure.\n\nOverall Cave Story is a rewarding experience for gamers who yearn for secrets to discover, discrete clues, skill-based challenges, and the nostalgic thrill of it all being rendered in a faux 16-bit facade.","February 26, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You're this little guy that wakes up with no memory of what happened and you find that a race of bunny people (Mimigas) are being abducted from a mad scientist for experiments. You must save them.\n\nAnd how you save them, is the main reason you should buy the game: Sega Genesis/SNES combat in a modern title. There is a variety of different weapons ranging from missile launchers, to pea shooters, to a mario styled fireball thing. The other mechanic in this is platforming, but "true" platforming that is reminiscent of Super Mario and Meat Boy is only present when you're trying to get to power ups, etc. It is more combat focused but that doesn't affect gameplay.\n\nBeing a nostalgic throwback, Cave Story's graphics pop. If you can get over it being purposefully pixellated, you should enjoy the bright colors of the overworld and gloomy atmosphere of the caves. This does run in 1080p and the pixels are sharp - something that a game like this NEEDS. It runs fine on my rig, but that doesn't mean anything. It probably will run smoothly on a 5 year old Windows XP machine, since it is not a demanding game.\n\nIf you've grown up with sidescrolling shooters like Metroid and Castlevania, then this is definitely something you should pick up.\n\n8.5/10","March 30, 2013","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The soundtrack of this game remains my favourite, Pulse and Geothermal are my top two tracks, and I have the entire soundtrack on my phone to listen to sometimes. I play this game with the original music and visuals, because it feels nostalgic somehow, so I can't give much input into the remastered versions of the two. Curly is an awesome character, and genuinely pulls on your heart strings at times throughout the game, and all the other characters grow lovable too, even the villains. The gameplay is a mixture of megaman and castlevania, or better known as the genre 'metroidvania', which wouldn't usually appeal to me, but does somehow. There are a wide variety of weapons to find throughout the game, some requiring restarts of the game to get, since it's a pick-this-or-that type thing, which is fine because there's fairly good replayability, and plenty of achievements to get alongside your restarts.\n\nProbably 200+ hours of game time if you're dedicated to getting 100%, definitely worth the price, more so on sale. I more than recommend this game to anybody wanting a retro indie game with an amazing story, solid characters and a perfect soundtrack. 10/10 for sure, in my books.","May 30, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/200900/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","It's amazing what a single person can accomplish when they set their mind to a task, isn't it? Cave Story was made by one person, a Japanese developer with the handle "Pixel", and when it was originally released (for free) it set the indie gaming scene on fire. Not only did it look and sound wonderful, with a memorable soundtrack and gorgoues sprite artwork, but it was also huge, potentially taking upwards of 8 hours to finish. Heck, it even had a secret ending which sent determined players dodging and blasting their way through a ruin as it crumbled around you, to fight and defeat one last ultimate boss enemy.\n\nAnd one person was responsible for doing EVERYTHING.\n\nYou play as a deceptively cute robot - who initially is not named - stranded on a vast and labyrinthine island suspended in the sky. As you explore, you meet the mimigas and learn of their plight: a crazed Doctor wishes to expose them to a certain flower, which causes the mimiga to fly into an uncontrollable rage and attack anything in sight. But to what end? To wage war on the planet below the island, and elevate him to the status of undisputed ruler. He's a villains villain, a real moustache-twirler, and to the credit of the game, both the baddies and the heroes in this game are really memorable. The story isn't so original, but the characterisation is really strong so you'll care, and want to help the mimiga, and want to learn about your own mysterious origins.\n\nExploration is a big aspect of Cave Story. There is lots of ground to cover and lots of enemies to fight, so it's helpful that you'll get pretty well equipped over the course of the game. Quote, the robot you control, was built to use guns. Your first weaponry seems pretty pitiful, but when you kill enemies, they burst into glowing triangles which can be collected to power up the gun you're currently using. Hoover up a few of these gems and your polar star peashooter will become stronger! But, if you get hit, your weapons will lose that collected power and level down. It's important, then, to be aggressive and kill your enemies before you can get hit, but also to be careful and dodge attacks that are coming your way. You could even, if you're quick, swap to a weapon you won't use as much and let that one "take the hit", so to speak, keeping your most used weapons at max level.\n\nBosses in this game are really memorable. There's a recurrent fight with one of the Doctor's cronies, a big lunkhead named Balrog. He's kinda cute, really - loyal to the wrong side, but probably with a good heart deep down. It's fun to beat him and hear him threaten to get you next time. There's a fight against an odd machine, stamped with glowing paw prints, and controlled by...something unexpected. The boss fights will tax you as a player, but Cave Story has generous checkpointing so if you are defeated, you won't have to travel far to try again.\n\nOn that note, I have a criticism. Exploration is great, and there's lots in this game, but there's some areas - I'm looking at you Grasstown - which have far too much backtracking. Grasstown sees you collecting items to make a bomb, and one ingredient has to be collected no less than three times, requiring some serious repetition on the part of the player. This feels like padding, which really isn't necessary in a game which has so much varied content to see. It's a slight concern, really, nothing major, but it has frustrated me when I've tried to replay this game ("Ohhh, not this part again!")\n\nAnother problem I have is the hoops you have to jump through to access the optional and more difficult end-game content. It requires skipping certain items and doing certain things out of a logical sequence, and honestly you're extremely unlikely to figure it out without resorting to a guide. Even having done it before many times, I still get it wrong because there are lets of steps to it and it isn't signposted anywhere in the game.\n\nThis version of the game is Cave Story+. It's the same game, so still brilliant, but with redone music and visuals, the obligatory Steam achievements and trading cards and whatnot. I'll be honest and say that I don't think the New or Remastered music is much cop compared to the original, but you can opt to have whichever one you want. Same with the visuals. Don't like them? Set it back to the original art, wonderful as it is.\n\nYou may ask, why would I get this version over the free version which is still floating around online?\n\nController support is one reason. I know lots of us are using XBOX360 pads and they are supported instantly, with no faffing, although ideally you'd want to use a controller with a better d-pad. You can jury rig the freeware version to support controllers, but it'll take extra software and a bit more legwork on the part of the player.\n\nThe second and most important reason is that, by buying it, you're putting money in Pixel's pocket. He worked on this game for many years out of sheer passion, and decided to give it away for free for many more years, and I think that we should reward such generosity. He deserves a few quid thrown his way, and this game is often on sale, so you've no excuse.\n\nCave Story is unmissable. It handles well, is attractive and sounds great, and actually has a really good story, with some legitimately terrific dialogue and characters. There may be frustrating moments where you'll struggle with a certain boss, or feel fatigued because you're retreading paths that you've been down before, but these are tiny blemishes on the surface of a diamond.","April 20, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's written with a lot of wit and charm. The gameplay is fun with a wide range of weapons that give you a lot of utility. Level design is varied and keeps things interesting and challenging. The soundtrack is a nostalgic trip into chiptune goodness.\n\nIt does have some flaws though. Its challenge mode is broken for me and many other players by crashing as soon as I reach the finish of the first challenge. Don't expect this to be patched as it's been known for a long time and nothing has been done about it. I'm also not impressed with its graphics. They're not terrible, in fact some of the character designs might be called cute, but many of the environments are drab mixes of grays and browns. I generally found the soundtrack catchy but there were a few tunes that became annoying.\n\nPlaying on "original" difficulty I thought that the combat had a satisfying level of challenge to it. However, the amount of damage you take from environmental dangers like spikes was too harsh in my view. There are numerous traps that will kill you in one shot no matter how much health you have. That is more unforgiving than I like, especially in a game with slightly floaty controls. Fortunately, the controls are consistent throughout the game so you can adapt to them and they become more manageable once you get the booster. Keeping with the old school  theme you are unable to shoot diagonally, only in the four cardinal directions.\n\nI'd like to close by bringing special attention to the rich world that is explored in Cave Story+. There's a fascinating backstory to discover as you play as well as fun characters to interact with. As with most "Metroidvania" games there are plenty of hidden and optional areas but here you won't just find power-ups. There are side quests, additional lore, optional weapons and gear, and even events that can lead to different endings for the game. This is a dream for players that love to dig into all the details of a game.","June 21, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

As you play you are given choices throughout the game that not only impact the story but even what weapons you can use. All of this leads to some good replaybility and is probably the games' biggest asset\n\n+The game has somewhat of a unique upgrade system for the weapons you use. As you kill enemies they drop experience that will increase your weapons level. Each weapon has 3 levels each one getting progressively better. However if you get hit by an enemy your weapon level decreases adding an extra level of complexity to the game.\n\n+ A variety of different weapons that fit your play style or situation.\n\n+ The game controls are fantastic and feel very responsive\n\n+ The game has some really great boss battles, the further you progress in the game the more diverse and unique they become\n\n+The game provides a lot of different modes after you beat the game. Each mode requires you to beat it in a certain amount of time, the better you do, the more achievements you get. This further adds to the reaplayability to the game.\n\nThe Average:\n\nLevel design and objectives are not that good. Most of the levels have you running to one end of the map only to run back to the beginning again to complete certain objectives and advance the story.  This adds nothing to the gameplay and seems only to be used to pad out the game length. It gets tiring after a while.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- I really disliked the story and characters. Nothing seems to make sense and about half way through the game I couldn't care what happens to anybody.\n\nConclusion\n\nI  had a lot of fun with the game, I just wish the levels were better designed. The extra modes provided are also fun.\n","November 25, 2014","true","15.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Everything about this game is absolutely perfect. The chiptune soundtrack is amazing, the graphics actually feel like appropriate (and not the "HD retro" style that you see in a lot of other games that try to emulate the retro visuals), and the controls are tight and responsive.\n\nYou will NEED a controller to play this game, though. Because - like in many action platformers - you'll be doing a lot of actions all at the same time (jumping, running, dashing, shooting, etc), your fingers are going to be busy, and it only feels right when using a controller.\n\nThat said, everything about this game is pure nostalgia, without ever feeling like it's pandering to retro gamers at all. While playing Cave Story, it honestly feels like somebody went back in time, stole the source code to a SNES game that was in production, and then brought it back and compiled it all over again for PC.\n\nI honestly could think of no problems with this game. It's got great dialogue, the animations are amazing, the gameplay is spectacular, and THE MUSIC. It's a great game that is well worth the pricetag.","November 25, 2013","true","6.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Excellent controls and interesting characters. Several soundtrack choices as well as an option for the original graphics. Multiple outcomes for decisions made, as well as weapon options.\n\nCONS: Steep difficulty curve near the end is extremely frustrating. Similar to Eversion, you're mainly paying for graphical update and soundtrack options; the entire original game is free.  Many will also tell you that this version of the game has unlikeable dialogue changes. Mac players have been having trouble with it as well.\n\nOVERALL: Charming fantasy sci-fi that shows that 2D platformers with pixel art and limited palettes don't have be outcast to the realm of "dated" or "niche." Cave Story was made with a lot of love which has turned it into an outstanding addition to any library. If you feel that supporting this version of the game is wrong for one reason or the other, you may find your money better spent on "Kero Blaster," to support its original creator.\n\nSCORE: 10/10","March 9, 2015","true","37.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's unique story makes it really intesting to continue (Even though I'm not a story guy, I still admired it). It's technically one of those games that says: "Screw reality! Let's go for imagination!", which 95% of all games doesn't do nowadays. Throughout you play the game, you'll confront different entities that you haven't seen before. The first ones are the Mimigas. They also play an important role in the game, so don't forget about them. Later on, you'll confront other types of entities. But remember this: You have never seen them before in your life.\n\nIt also have the feel of the old games. It's not really difficult like the old games but it has some of the thinking from the time. For example, there is bosses (Loads of them), no health recharge (All new games has that, and I think games are too easy with it), manual saving (Using save points) and so forth.\n\nBut there's one negative side with this game, though. And it's that the story is very involving. And if you know games: The more story it is, the less gameplay. That leaves the player with dialogs and cutscenes where the player doesn't do much other than watching things happen. And what I think about games are that gameplay is the most important thing. Because when I play a game I want to stay in control throughout the whole game. That's what I like with games like Snayke or Doom.\n\nStill, an amazing game. Even though of the negative side, the positive sides overwhelmes that side of the game. I also made a playthrough on this game on YouTube.\nHere's the link to my montage of my playthrough (If you're still unsure about buying it): http://youtu.be/CefqCi1vUbs","June 3, 2014","true","41.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2012/10/cave-story.html\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nIndependent developer Pixel spent five years working on this game in his free time, by himself, and produced a game with a compelling story and great retro platforming.  The popularity Cave Story achieved as a freeware title went a long way in proving to the gaming market that you can get a quality product without shelling out $50 to the big production companies.  Surely, this title paved the way for a variety of Xbox Live Arcade, Steam, and even Humble Indy Bundle titles.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nCave Story plays like you would expect most games of its type to play, so there is no tutorial level.  The creator designed the first area in a way to “lets players feel like they've solved problems on their own.”  While it may seem frustrating to learn the hard way that those red spikes will in fact kill you instantly, or that you went the wrong way and have to double back before you can progress, it isn’t like you lose anything for dying, and there are only two ways to go anyway.  Using this sort of tough love tutorial might leave you feeling challenged, but ultimately more accomplished from the very beginning of the game, which sets the tone for the rest of the game.\n\nThere is certainly no shortage of challenge, here, and even veteran players will experience a few moments where they may feel like pulling their hair out.  Collecting all of the hidden items and choosing the strongest weapons will go a long way in making you successful, but gathering them is a challenging endeavor in itself.  If you are feeling complacent with the difficulty, aim for the secret “good” ending, which features an impossibly difficult series of platforming feats.  In later ports, “hard” mode and a boss run time trial were added for the truly masochistic.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nWhile the graphics and music have an enjoyable retro feel to them, and were produced by a single creator, I have to admit that they are not up to par with the technology available.  Later versions, notably Cave Story+ on Steam, cleaned up the graphics and sound while still keeping the retro feel that made it so enjoyable.  The most recent version, a port to the 3DS, was built from the ground up with rendered graphics, stereoscopic 3D, and additional content.  All of the versions are still enjoyable and feature the same level design and gameplay, so just pick the one that fits your visual preference and the limitations of your wallet.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nThere are a lot of good moments in this game, but I’m going to have to say that the best moment to me is the boss fight at the end of Sand Zone.  To me, this is the point when the story proves how serious it is going to be.  The dialogue with King and Toroko at this point really hits home, and as the first act comes to a close, you are pumped up and ready to take down the Doctor.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nThis is a modern classic that almost any gamer will enjoy.  Take an NES classic like Metroid, add a compelling story and a bit more linear exploration pattern.  If you have a computer, you have no excuse not to play it, since the original game with a fan translated patch is still available for free (http://www.cavestory.org/downloads_game.php)!  If you are willing to spend a few bucks, I would personally suggest getting your hands on the DSi or Steam release, as they have some additional features that extend the replayability of the game.","November 28, 2013","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In later ports, “hard” mode and a boss run time trial were added for the truly masochistic.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nWhile the graphics and music have an enjoyable retro feel to them, and were produced by a single creator, I have to admit that they are not up to par with the technology available.  Later versions, notably Cave Story+ on Steam, cleaned up the graphics and sound while still keeping the retro feel that made it so enjoyable.  The most recent version, a port to the 3DS, was built from the ground up with rendered graphics, stereoscopic 3D, and additional content.  All of the versions are still enjoyable and feature the same level design and gameplay, so just pick the one that fits your visual preference and the limitations of your wallet.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nThere are a lot of good moments in this game, but I’m going to have to say that the best moment to me is the boss fight at the end of Sand Zone.  To me, this is the point when the story proves how serious it is going to be.  The dialogue with King and Toroko at this point really hits home, and as the first act comes to a close, you are pumped up and ready to take down the Doctor.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nThis is a modern classic that almost any gamer will enjoy.  Take an NES classic like Metroid, add a compelling story and a bit more linear exploration pattern.

A very decent platformer in the style of metroid, with a faster paced feel to it, and an interesting story that builds up as you play. It gets very hard towards the end though, depending on the decisions you make\n\nCave Story+ is basically Cave Story with better graphics, and a remixed soundtrack which I don't like as much as the old one. It's also got a new translation which I think is better, but others disagree. It's got some new levels that you can't play till you complete the game on Normal, and an easy difficulty level which is nice.

If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2012/10/cave-story.html\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nIndependent developer Pixel spent five years working on this game in his free time, by himself, and produced a game with a compelling story and great retro platforming.  The popularity Cave Story achieved as a freeware title went a long way in proving to the gaming market that you can get a quality product without shelling out $50 to the big production companies.  Surely, this title paved the way for a variety of Xbox Live Arcade, Steam, and even Humble Indy Bundle titles.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nCave Story plays like you would expect most games of its type to play, so there is no tutorial level.  The creator designed the first area in a way to “lets players feel like they've solved problems on their own.”  While it may seem frustrating to learn the hard way that those red spikes will in fact kill you instantly, or that you went the wrong way and have to double back before you can progress, it isn’t like you lose anything for dying, and there are only two ways to go anyway.  Using this sort of tough love tutorial might leave you feeling challenged, but ultimately more accomplished from the very beginning of the game, which sets the tone for the rest of the game.\n\nThere is certainly no shortage of challenge, here, and even veteran players will experience a few moments where they may feel like pulling their hair out.  Collecting all of the hidden items and choosing the strongest weapons will go a long way in making you successful, but gathering them is a challenging endeavor in itself.  If you are feeling complacent with the difficulty, aim for the secret “good” ending, which features an impossibly difficult series of platforming feats.  In later ports, “hard” mode and a boss run time trial were added for the truly masochistic.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nWhile the graphics and music have an enjoyable retro feel to them, and were produced by a single creator, I have to admit that they are not up to par with the technology available.  Later versions, notably Cave Story+ on Steam, cleaned up the graphics and sound while still keeping the retro feel that made it so enjoyable.  The most recent version, a port to the 3DS, was built from the ground up with rendered graphics, stereoscopic 3D, and additional content.  All of the versions are still enjoyable and feature the same level design and gameplay, so just pick the one that fits your visual preference and the limitations of your wallet.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nThere are a lot of good moments in this game, but I’m going to have to say that the best moment to me is the boss fight at the end of Sand Zone.  To me, this is the point when the story proves how serious it is going to be.  The dialogue with King and Toroko at this point really hits home, and as the first act comes to a close, you are pumped up and ready to take down the Doctor.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nThis is a modern classic that almost any gamer will enjoy.

It's unique story makes it really intesting to continue (Even though I'm not a story guy, I still admired it). It's technically one of those games that says: "Screw reality! Let's go for imagination!", which 95% of all games doesn't do nowadays. Throughout you play the game, you'll confront different entities that you haven't seen before. The first ones are the Mimigas. They also play an important role in the game, so don't forget about them. Later on, you'll confront other types of entities. But remember this: You have never seen them before in your life.\n\nIt also have the feel of the old games. It's not really difficult like the old games but it has some of the thinking from the time. For example, there is bosses (Loads of them), no health recharge (All new games has that, and I think games are too easy with it), manual saving (Using save points) and so forth.\n\nBut there's one negative side with this game, though. And it's that the story is very involving. And if you know games: The more story it is, the less gameplay. That leaves the player with dialogs and cutscenes where the player doesn't do much other than watching things happen. And what I think about games are that gameplay is the most important thing. Because when I play a game I want to stay in control throughout the whole game. That's what I like with games like Snayke or Doom.\n\nStill, an amazing game. Even though of the negative side, the positive sides overwhelmes that side of the game. I also made a playthrough on this game on YouTube.\nHere's the link to my montage of my playthrough (If you're still unsure about buying it): http://youtu.be/CefqCi1vUbs","June 3, 2014","true","41.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The music is wonderfully catchy, and the visuals are simplistic yet stylized, and quite frankly, adorable.\n\nThe original version of the game was produced and released entirely free, and is still available today. The +/plus version of the game, available here on steam, includes an entirely re-drawn HD texture set, and three different versions for the music. You can switch between any of these options in the main menu, and it doesn't effect your save in any way.\n\nI would high reccomend that you play with a controller, as the game is notably more difficult with the keyboard. There are certain mechanics that allow you to shoot towards the ground and fly up like a jetpack, but there is also a jetpack that you can use on top of that, and in the end it really does feel much more precise with a controller of some sort. I'd reccomend the PS3 pad as the D-pad feels the best, but anything should be fine.\n\nAside from the incredibly satisfying and decently challenging gameplay, one of the most amazing things is that the game gives you choices, and in really the best way possible. Its not a conversation dialog where you select option A or option B, its a story that branches based on various factors and decisions that you make a long the way. At what you feel is the end of the game, you are given the option to just follow someone and and escape unharmed, or you can go a different and much more challenging path, to save the people in need. There are various endings and items and weapons that you can miss entirely. This is a game that you will want to play through multiple times to experience the different endings. I'd reccomend that you play game game once, and then google what you need to do to see the other endings, because I would imagine it would be quite difficult to figure out these paths on your own. Some even involve completely denying good things that you usually get early on.","July 12, 2012","true","7.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Those people are wrong.\n\nThose people may not like the game, but to say that this game is overrated is an invalid opinion. Although this game is one of the primary reasons that the PC game market is oversaturated with indie platformers, Cave Story is truly in a league of its own compared to virtually all indie games. The remastered soundtrack sounds great, too.\n\nFrom the get-go, it's obvious that Cave Story draws a lot from Castlevania and Metroid; it has the more-intense platforming of the former with the shooty guns of the latter. Like Symphony of the Night, it occasionally breaks up the action with a dialogue sequence. It also has key plot events that can be changed or prevented if the player is observant enough. Unlike SOTN, however, the characters, dialogue and story are actually memorable and meaningful. Like many Japanese games, it gets incredibly ♥♥♥♥ed up near the end. And it gets even more ♥♥♥♥ed up if you get the best ending.\n\nCave Story is short, but quite replayable, with plenty of hidden content. The plus edition adds even more, with a super-hard area (Wind Fortress) added in, amongst a few other little features. Having said that, this game is designed like an NES game, or perhaps like Dark Souls; which means that it's short, but because of the difficulty, you'll probably end up spending the same amount of time you would on this game as you would on a game with more content on your first playthrough. And believe me, you will most likely play through this game more than once.\n\nThis game was created by Daisuke Amaya over a five-year period in his spare time, and his talent is incredible. Not only is the game programmed well with no noticeable bugs or glitches to speak of, but the art looks great and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in years. As I mentioned before, the story elements of the game are also quite good. I definitely understand that it took him five years to make this, but even so, it's truly impressive that he was able to perform outstandingly on all aspects of the game development cycle.\n\nI highly advise you have a gamepad of some kind before playing this game. I played through part of it with my keyboard, and after an hour and a half of playing it my fingers would actually start to hurt. Using your meaty thumbs on softer gamepad buttons will be much better for you in the long run.","June 19, 2014","true","20.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/200900/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","Cave Story+ is a famous Japanese independent game that was originally released as freeware with a fan translation. This re-release offers a choice of playing with the original graphics and music, or the remastered graphics and music. Whatever your choice may be, the game is a well done fanfare reminiscent of the classic platform games on the NES and SNES. The keyboard controls takes some getting used to even though they are simple to learn, but you do have the option of rebinding the keys and using a gamepad. The plot is comparable the well established lore of yesteryear by being invited to save people and rid a world of evil. The enemies are stereotypically Japanese in design, as well as the overall game mechanics and boss battles. Some of the dialog can be slightly amusing and sometimes charming, but this once again, does not steer too much away from what we have grown accustomed to enjoy from the 80s and 90s console eras. The difficulty settings can be adjusted to your liking, and they each provide an adequate challenge depending on what option you have decided to go for. The power-up system rewards the players who go out of their way to collect dropped items from downed foes. Switching between each weapon rapidly can be tricky, but this does not hinder the player from enjoying the changes, as adapting comes somewhat quickly through your progress. The different weapons acquired throughout the game are all quite useful and play very different from each other. As you change between them, there is much satisfaction shooting down your enemies and conquering bosses. While the storyline is reminiscent of past decades, it is surprisingly unique, in addition to flowing and developing well. This appealing plot provides the player with plenty of entertainment for many hours as you progress through the story. After tougher areas or tougher boss battles, your weapons' levels go down quite a bit as you take damage, and gathering the necessary drops in order to get them back to full power can be a chore. Cave Story+ is full of retro charm, from its game play style to its artistic inventions. There is very little to complain about, as I cannot think of any serious flaws. The resolution settings do not allow for true full screen, as black borders will be placed at the sides. The platforming elements in conjunction with the shooting can sometimes take some skill and getting used to, especially in high action sections. Some portions of the game (namely some bosses) become quite frustrating, no matter what difficulty setting you are playing on. This forces the player to redo a part of the game again in order to face the same boss (or bosses). Each repetition is about five minutes or longer, which constitutes of a problem to me, as dying with certain bosses occurs often. It is a game that may not be for everyone if the genre is not to their liking, but overall, it is quite the accomplishment, especially if you keep in mind that it was designed entirely by one single person, and achieves such positive results. The music is nothing short of superb. It embodies all that was great from the 8-bit and 16-bit eras and makes it exceptional and complementing to the game's presentation and plot. There is also a considerable amount of replay ability, as there are unlockable game modes and four different endings. If you love platform games with shooter elements, this is a must play. If you are unsure about the genre, you owe it to yourself to give this indie classic a try.\n\nCave Story+ is great.","March 20, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You play as Quote, a robot soldier discharged from an old war in which you use your array of weapons to stop the Doctor. Cave Story features an amazing story which also contains alternate endings based on your actions throughout the game. This game has been released on multiple platforms such as the Nintendo Wii, 3DS and of course, Steam. This version features an enhanced versioin of Cave Story, with cleaner graphics and remastered soundtrack, as well as challenges and achievements. The achievements are simple to get, most of them can be achieved during your first run of the game. Others require to complete certain objectives and replaying the game. The challenges can be challenging, but it does give the player some elements aside from the main game.\n\nHighly recommended for people who love an amazing story and a general fanatic of platformers. High replayability, alternate endings and challenges. Best version of Cave Story.

After it's freeware release it was remade to all late 21st century Nintendo consoles, and fans made it portable to the original Xbox and some graphing calculators (along with Mac and Linux).\n\nAfter all these years critics have called it the "King of the Indies", commending it for its masterful game design and storytelling.\n\nEven if you do not like semi-open/branching world story-driven 2D sidecrolling shoot'em-ups, then this game is worth a purchase, because being a PC gamer in this golden age of indie development and not looking into Cave Story means missing out on how our culture has developed, and what values started it all.

This game has a wonderful story with multiple endings, great art style and soundtrack. Imagine Mario + undertale with guns. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who is alive, but sadly I can't recommend this game on steam because you can get it for free and legally(hopefully) from a fan website, just google cave story. But cave story+ does allow for remastered graphics and sound. but the price is a bit much for not much extra i would still recoment downloading it from the fan website and if you really like it, buy it here......

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Light2997/recommended/200900/","Light2997","Light08","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Light2997/","422 products in account","This game is one of the best adventure games I have ever played!\nIt's an old game in retro style, which just got updated with High Definition graphic, that's why it's called 'Cave Story+'. (The original Cave Story isn't available on Steam btw)\nCave Story is a great 2D game, where you play a robot named 'Quote', who just lost his memories and gets to know what happened the farther you play the game.\nSo, where to start?\nFirst off, the Story is quite nice... not the best but it's nice. I don't want to spoil to much but as mentioned, you wake up somewhere and you don't know how you landed there nor what your past is. You have to fight your way through the levels to find out who you are and what you actually did. To reach your goal you'll have to use many different weapons... There's a big arsenal of weapons, but not all of these are obtainable in one single playthrough. The different enemies differ from each other so there's always another strategy how to beat them, the same applies to bosses.

(The original Cave Story isn't available on Steam btw)\nCave Story is a great 2D game, where you play a robot named 'Quote', who just lost his memories and gets to know what happened the farther you play the game.\nSo, where to start?\nFirst off, the Story is quite nice... not the best but it's nice. I don't want to spoil to much but as mentioned, you wake up somewhere and you don't know how you landed there nor what your past is. You have to fight your way through the levels to find out who you are and what you actually did. To reach your goal you'll have to use many different weapons... There's a big arsenal of weapons, but not all of these are obtainable in one single playthrough. The different enemies differ from each other so there's always another strategy how to beat them, the same applies to bosses. The levels are awesome made and the retro graphic style makes this game in it's look beautiful.\n\nAnd if this game was too easy for you, there are a lot of items you can collect and many challenges to complete. In case you aim for all achievements, you'll have to beat this game multiple times because - as mentioned before - you can't get all items in one single playthrough.\n\nAnyone who has never played it yet, has something missed in his life.

Cute characters, simplist scenarios but, attracting, at the end.\nHard. You are dead really fast and, the saving spots are spread in each level so, you will repeat the same several times, which can be annoying and frustrating for most of people (including myself).\nBut, I don't know what, the game invites you to continue playing; it has some magic...\n\nOnly negative I can say is that the game should be automatically saved before starting to fight against any boss, otherwise you have to re-do the path to the boss and follow the bunch of dialogues before the fight, what can be really boring. Another thing that I hate is that every time you enter in any room, the complete scenario resets and the already killed enemies respawn.\nIt would be a perfect game if it allowed to save the progress at any time.\nTo repeat several times same thing is boring and kills the overall charming of the game.","August 13, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If not THE best.\nIt's a great mix of Metroid, Castlevania and (a little bit of) Zelda.\nThe story, the characters, the combat system, the music, everything is just awesome.\nAnd to top it all, certain decisions grant other items or lead to different endings which provides a high replay value.\nWarning: Extremely addictive. I've finished it 6 times and it still isn't boring.\n\nGreat extra: You can choose if you want to play the game in the original art style (as Pixel, the creator of the original game, made it) or in an enhanced style with smoother, hand-drawn-like graphics.\nThe same goes for the soundtrack (original chiptune-like, remastered and new).","September 16, 2012","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Cute characters, simplist scenarios but, attracting, at the end.\nHard. You are dead really fast and, the saving spots are spread in each level so, you will repeat the same several times, which can be annoying and frustrating for most of people (including myself).\nBut, I don't know what, the game invites you to continue playing; it has some magic...\n\nOnly negative I can say is that the game should be automatically saved before starting to fight against any boss, otherwise you have to re-do the path to the boss and follow the bunch of dialogues before the fight, what can be really boring. Another thing that I hate is that every time you enter in any room, the complete scenario resets and the already killed enemies respawn.\nIt would be a perfect game if it allowed to save the progress at any time.\nTo repeat several times same thing is boring and kills the overall charming of the game.","August 13, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It combines classic pixel platforming with exploration, a large open world and an assortment of collectible weapons and upgrades. While it visually looks like a much more polished verison of a game from that age, Cave Story also includes some enhanced features like a storyline reminiscent of Japanese RPGs and an in-game map like later "metroidvania" games.\nCave Story does not do much by way of innovating; it is very much, at its core, an adventure platformer. However it is a very good action platformer that appeals to my sense of nostalgia and fills the need quick action platformer type games. It is definitely worth some time if you are looking for a metroidvania game or get the itch to play Super Metroid or Symphony Of The Night but want a game you have not already played.","January 9, 2015","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've been a Cave Story enthusiast since before CS+ existed. I bought this game because I want money to go to Pixel, because he's a boss.\n\nWhat is Cave Story?\n\nWell, once upon a time a really smart guy looked at emerging computer technology and said, "What if we use this to have fun?" For a while things were great, but then the dreaded 'Video Games Industry' came and took all the fun away, replacing it with things like 'features' and 'innovation' and blah blah blah. Everyone was sad.\n\nThen Pixel rode in on a white horse, weilding a 20 string electric guitar and a legendary sword that shoots awesomeness and bacon. Our mighty hero dropped trou and took a fat dump on the stale industry's stupid hi-res face. Then he made the GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME and gave it away for free. (You can get the original CS with bonus materials for free on the CS website.)\n\nAnd the moral of the story is: NOW YOU CAN BE A HAPPY PERSON.\n\nCave Story recaptures the soul of classic NES and SNES era games. It does everything right that those games did, and then it does everything right that those games didn't. Every inch of the game radiates pure fun and excellent design, and you don't have to play long before you realize that this is something that someone made for the love of the game rather than to try and squeeze another nickel out of you with the latest lame gimmick.\n\nCave Story seems like a simple metroidvania platformer, but don't be fooled. There are cool secrets hidden all over the place. The game just plays so smoothly that you don't even realize that you're making plot decisions and weapons selections as you go along.\n\nIf you like to have fun then go grab the Ultimate CS pack from the website and play the game. When you've finished crying ecstatic tears of reverent joy, you'll want to buy CS+. Not for the new bonus modes, not for the remastered graphics and music, not even for the steam acheivements.\n\nYou'll want to buy CS+ out of sheer gratitude.\n\nNow go forth!

Can't recall how many times I've played this and replayed it again and again, by now. Even though it's not 100% feature complete, if you don't want to spend money, play the free version! I did play through this on the Raspberry Pi via NXENGINE as well and it was just as much fun. It's still a very heartbreaking and heartwarming experience all throughout, much like Undertale has been. Some scenes aren't easy to take for me.\n\nThis game is special. I didn't have this on Steam yet, so ... (MRROW! *Pounce*), GOT IT! <3 <3 <3\n\nOh, it's a sweet and playful platformer-"metroid-vania"-style sidescrolling shooter strong on secrets and story and characters.

The action itself is ok, but somewhat repetitive however there are a couple mechanics that are REALLY annoying.  The weapon leveling sounds good at first but the ease with which you lose the weapon levels causes lots of trouble mid-battle, and more importantly wastes a ton of time with grinding, checkpointing and then getting going again;  which slows down the pacing considerably if you want your weapons fully leveled ... and you do, because the fights can be quite challenging.  A good deal of the challenge though comes just from the widely spaced checkpoints which are quite annoying, especially if you have to go back through the same grindy level bits and unskippable cut scenes to get back to a failed boss battle which is a shame because they would be very good battles if you weren't already in a bad mood from having to grind and cut scene your way back to them ...\n\nSo that's the bad side on the better side the sound track is EXCELLENT chip tune inspired work, probably the best element of the game, and there are a lot of tracks which are well placed and distributed.  I suppose the story itself is pretty interesting and unique but leaves quite a bit unanswered, which is fine.\n\nConclusion: I'm not sorry that I played Cave Story+, but the amount of time that it wastes in between the good bits is sufficient to keep me from recommending it.","September 21, 2014","false","9.3"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/200900/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Ahh, Cave Story, everyone loves it, it made a big splash on the indie game scene and pretty well changed the industry!\n\n...but I don't like it.\nIt's far from the worst game but it has a fair share of problems that add up to a rather unpleasant experience for me overall.\n\nFirst and foremost, the platforming controls. They're very floaty and slippery. I seriously though the game was running slow when I first started playing it. And then you combine this with the fact that a lot of platforming in this game involves one-tile blocks and... well, you can fall off pretty easily. It feels like you fall off edges the moment any part of your sprite leaves a ledge, too, I fairly often fell off a ledge because I jumped just a little too late in what would otherwise be a normal jump time in any other platformer. I will say that the weapons are pretty satisfying and varied, they all feel like they have a purpose. Well, most of them at least. And they're pretty fast and/or powerful, too. I like the semi-boost that the machine gun can give you, but it's too bad getting that weapon prevents you from getting a much better one down the line.\n\nThe other huge problem I have in this game is the level design and story progression. Not the story itself, it's fine and fairly interesting with multiple endings and such, that's okay. But... alright. I understand that Pixel didn't have the means to make a massive game, but... retreading over the same patch of land in the Bushlands for the 6th time is just not fun at all. There are three main fetch quests that occur in the game, and all three of them are exercises in tedium. The Bushlands has you collect Jellyfish Juice no less than three times from the same spot near the beginning, and two of those times (or one if you know in advance) involves basically trekking all the way across the stage and back again. But even that is topped by good 'ol Sand Zone, which has the most incomprehensibly bad design I've ever seen. Halfway through the area, you're given a fetch quest to find five things. Okay. But you can only carry one at a time, and when you get it you have to go back to the point where you were given the quest. So the last stretch of level, you have to travel halfway across and back twice, and then all the way across twice as well (and once back). Add to that, this last stretch involves fall-and-start-over-a-section design, twice, where you'll lose a minute of your life going through basic platforming with no enemies 'cause you killed them all if you fall off the one-tile blocks. This zone is painfully tedious and not even fun the first time through. The third major fetch quest happens at the Plantation, though it's thankfully not AS bad as the other two; gotta go a bit of a ways to get one item, exchange it for another, bring it back to the quest NPC, go get another item, bring it back, done, not as painful as the other two but at that point my patience was already wearing thin.\n\nThere's also two segments of the game (three if you go for the true ending) that feature everyone's favorite, checkpoint starvation! Revisiting the Egg Corridor and the boss rush at the end of the game, specifically, the former of which features a lot of instadeath traps and a surprise boss if you open a chest, with no save point until after the boss, and the latter which involves three relatively easy bosses followed by an incredibly spammy one with only the chance for a MINOR heal after the third, and dying at any point sends you back to the start to refight the other three bosses again. I understand that the end of the game should be harder than the rest, that's fine, but this is just plain cheap. The problem with these kind of things is that the rest of the game doesn't follow in their trends, save points are common and the emphasis is on shorter bursts of challenge. So putting these kind of sections in your game destroys any sense of a difficulty curve (and indeed, everything between these two points is relatively tame by comparison). The true ending level is even worse, featuring a longish level followed by 5 bosses with only a luck-based healing chance between the first and the other four. Marathon level it may be, fun it certainly is not, and not helping matters is that one room of the level is entirely luck based and most of the challenge from the level design comes from the enemy spam involved. It's really unpleasant to play through. The only remotely decent part of the level is the platforming bit at the start, but it's short and not really that great, the Hidden Last Cave had a lot more interesting platforming going on.\n\nThe tedium of the game is also increased by its nudging to replay the game and get the true ending. You won't get it the first time because doing so involves 1. making a difficult jump (unless you got the machine gun) and defying common sense by not talking to an injured NPC and 2. going through a long, rather non-obvious quest to revive a character that can be permanently screwed up in a number of ways very easily. And even then, you have to go into a building as the sky is literally falling at the end, just to gain access to the true ending. It's pretty hard to even know about without a guide, and honestly isn't worth the effort in the end. But anyways. Yes, replaying the entire game. You can't skip cutscenes, and the way the game is designed, you can't sequence break, you can't do anything to speed up the pace of the game other than be slightly better at it than the first time. And little else changes besides maybe having different weapons at different points or not having the booster for a boss. Playing this game once was already tedious enough, even replaying on easy and having everything be a breeze to get through doesn't reduce the tedium of a second or third playthrough.\n\nMinor gripes, but the presentation of the game isn't great either. Yeah the original graphics were made by one guy but this is the remastered version, you can do a bit more than just make everything look a tiiiiny bit better. The game's worlds look very bland and most backgrounds are just cave walls. The music's okay, nothing special.\n\nReally, overall, I just... can't find a lot to like here. There's some decent bosses and a bit of decent platforming, fun weapons, an alright story... and I can respect that one guy made all this (originally, at least). Maybe it just hasn't held up well, you had to be there or something, but I don't believe that and I don't believe this is a very good game. Maybe it's just me, but. I do not like Cave Story.","August 23, 2015","false","13.8"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","0"

In fact, I bought this simply to show support for Pixel, who is amazing; the amount of time and effort that went into the original is actually rather inspiring for a one man project. That said, what I paid money for was the original content, not what came with +.\n\nI hate the new graphics and music, they're ugly to both senses. The translation, the most subjective part, to me is inferior to the original fan translation way back when. The only positive I can claim is that Curly Mode is a cute little different take on the whole game, but it's not something that can carry such a large price tag.\n\nIf you love the original Cave Story and want to toss some money at Pixel, then hey, buy it like me. If you've never played Cave Story, do so with the original freeware version, because there is nothing really here for any first time players.","June 12, 2015","false","11.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

In addition to this, it seems that Nicalis has also decided to not put the game on anymore sales, and from what I have heard, there hasn't been anything done to the game content-wise that could justify this. In other words, Nicalis has decided to raise the price just to gain more money. I can no longer see any reason to purchase this version of Cave Story, as I mentioned in my original review (which will still be posted below this paragraph) that there isn't enough content to justify a full price purchase of this particular version. Instead of purchasing this version of the game, I advise that you just go and download the freeware version of the game, as you will be saving a whole lot of money just downloading the freeware version than by buying an overpriced version of a game that, while good, isn't worth $14.00. $9.99 was already steep, but increasing the price without even adding any content to justify it is pathetic. Don't give Nicalis your money.\n\n\nORIGINAL POST: Despite starting one of the worst trends in gaming (indie gaming, to be more exact), Cave Story is actually a pretty damn good game made by just a single person. Of course, with that being said, I suggest that you play the original freeware version of the game first before using your money to buy Cave Story +, as this particular version of the game isn't much different from the original freeware game, save for some bonus content and some minor improvements. If you do decide that you want to purchase this version of the game, do wait a little to see if it goes on sale, as I don't think that there is enough content to justify a full-price purchase of this version of the game.","August 17, 2014","false","0.5"," 30 of 63 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","30","63","0","5"

From the beautiful pixel art and the 16-bit music, to the Metroidvania style, and the lovely characters. There are lots of moments that make you love the characters. Bad things appeared very soon into the game, as I got a map, but didn't know how to use it. Controls aren't well explained; I had to look for them in a website.\nThere's a high amount of achievements that make the game longer, experience points, levels, powers, lots of items, cool boss fights and other things that are common in Metroidvanias.\nSo, my conclusion is: this game is awesome. It was in the last Humble Bundle, so there are lots of people who have it but haven't tried it yet (like me some hours ago).

(Although it is not very common to find a game in a more pixelated style these days.)  One thing I like about the control scheme is that you can, well, modify which button corresponds to which control in the game.  As expected, the controls in-game are responsive, like movement and shooting.  Additionally, the game gives off a very retro style due to its pixel style.  (You can even set the\ngraphics to "Original" for an even more retro experience, although I'd recommend "New" because they look more refined.)\n\nThere is one downside to this game, though.  This game only has a Story Mode and Curly Story mode with three saves each, and a few special challenge levels.  There isn't much else to do in the game, however the difficulty modes and options to trade weapons within the game (aquiring special weapons from NPCs, there is no actual trading in the Cave Story games) do add some replay value.  There are three endings in total, and if you're trying to get a specific ending (I won't tell which one) you'll have to go through a secret stage after the "canon" events of the game.  The secret level has a surprise at the end..  You'll have to find out yourself if you want to know what it is.\n\nI initially was not knowledgeable that you could shoot upwards and downwards, and so I only shot left and right.  When I actually figured out about the full firing capabilities, I face-palmed and said to myself, "This isn't Megaman, I can shoot up and down!" (So you can shoot upwards and downwards, now you know.)\n\nIf you buy this game on Steam or the other ports on 3DS and Wii, or even if you download the original version from the Internet, hopefully this review will be useful to you.\n\n9.5/10, very good game!","January 5, 2014","true","29.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

Does it "invoke classic Metroid"? No. Is it as good as Metroid? No. The only thing it has in common with Metroid is the sound when you grab a health powerup. But for what it is, it is done very well. Indeed the NES could have used more games like this rather than having roughly 90% of its games be complete garbage that I found out through many wasted weekends renting ♥♥♥♥ing trash games when I was younger. This game has great retro graphics and good sound and music, good weapons and enemies, and solid level design. Retro platformers should always be welcome to any gamer with a brain.\nThe only thing that killed this game dead in the water for me was the last battle. You have to fight 4 bosses with 1 life bar and a life full up jar, and it's not that it is hard that gets me, just pure frustration at it's worst. Trust me, beat the first 3 bosses with 1 life bar then use the jar for the final battle. That is your only hope. If you die, you have to do it all over again and go through all the dialogue. It will test even the most dedicated persons patience. There are no words to describe the frustration it causes.

The new English translation, while in some regards technically better, lacks many of the quirks that Aeon Genesis' original translation made beloved by English-speaking fans ("huzzah!"). And things like difficulty modes are essentially redundant, since there already exist established challenges that simulate harder difficulties.\n\nWhat would really have made for a nice Cave Story+ would be the inclusion of more flexible tools, like a level editor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyGuillermo/recommended/200900/","CrazyGuillermo","Man-Baby the Great and Terrible","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyGuillermo/","245 products in account","Cave Story is lauded by many players and reviewers as a grand masterpiece of an indie game. I disagree, I think it's popularity as a novel, well constructed freeware experience inflated the reputation of this little game to the point that years later it simply doesn't hold up to the hype.\n\nBefore diving in, I'll make the simple statement that $15 is severly overpriced for 3-4 hours of a sub-par experience.\n\nThe story was perhaps what dissapointed me most. The story for this game is said by some (including its own store page) to be rich and original. Unfortunately, this just isn't the case. The story is an extremely straight forward "mad scientist trying to take over the world" narrative, with the miguided (if persistent) drive to constantly be extremely cute that a lot of Japanese media today shares. Some of the characters seem interesting, but an overall lack of meaningful characterisation makes them more like simple cartoon characters the player can immediately understand rather than authenitc people and animals. The closest game narrative to Cave Story's that I can think of is Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and that's a pretty low bar.\n\nWhile maybe I can excuse what I view to be an extremely typical, lackluster story, I can't forgive the dissapointing gameplay. Any allusions to the Metriodvania genre when reffering to Cave Story are misleading at best. The game does not permit, require, or encourage exploration or mystery in a major way, let alone use it as a core engagment. The fairly fast paced action-platforming does provide some challenge, but it doesn't hold up over time.\n\nThe jumping and shooting simply doesn't create a large number of interesting challenges or situations during the game. After the first hour the mechanics of the game have basically played themselves out, and nothing experientially different really comes out of the gameplay, largely due to the repetitive design of enemy encounters. The weapon leveling system is novel and seems like a good idea; for the first hour or so I played very deliberately so I could get my weapons to maximum power and keep them there. However, this quickly becomes old hat and the interesting idea of this system just becomes tedious when the game gets tougher, and taking a single hit can force you to switch from attacking to recovering lost power ups over and over again.\n\nI was dissapointed by Cave Story, but I would still recommend people to try it out. The original version is available for download on the internet for free, and at that price it's worth it to play through and form your own opinions. If nothing else, the free version of Cave Story is worth playing in order to see a piece of foundational indie-gaming history.\n\nTL,DR: Doesn't live up to the hype, uninspired story and unengaging gameplay. Not worth $15 but the free version is online so I recommend trying it for yourself.","June 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

Maybe you'll like it, though, and I hope my review can help you decide.\n\nMy biggest issue was that it's often called a Metroidvania, but the first 80% of the game was missing any exploration: the gameplay is very linear, even if you're doing some backtracking. The bosses and minibosses are a bit repetitive. There's very little in the way of puzzle bosses or even puzzles in general, unless you count talking to everyone until you find the right dialogue trigger.\n\nThematically it's a bit of a mess: a hodgepodge of sci-fi and fantasy. (These two genres certainly can be combined well, but it needs to be done coherently.) The story is not that epic or original, and the dialogue could use some serious editing. The description calls the game "massive", and that's a definite exaggeration.\n\nThe action gameplay itself is pretty good. The controls felt a bit floaty to begin with, but this gets much better when you gain the ability to hover. The leveling system for weapons is a nice touch. There's a good variety of weapons, but 95% of the time I just went with the machine gun.\n\nSo if you want an action platforming game with charming retro graphics, cute soundtrack, and straightforward gameplay that you can finish in a few hours, this could easily be the game for you. If you've heard it's a massive Metroidvania or that the story is amazing, I would temper my expectations.","March 1, 2015","false","6.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

This, one of many ports responsible mainly by Nicalis, is none of those.\n\nFaulty gamepad support, crash prone, lack of resolution options (including any widescreen support, which the Wii version was able to [poorly] do), tacked on extra modes (the difficulty modes are self-imposable), and the, "so-bland-it's-meh," soundtracks and script of the oher rehash ports.\n\nOn the plus side, this is Cave Story: a wonderful action platformer. On the case for this specific version, at least the graphics are decent and it does include a cut area, but, ultimately, it's not worth spending money over.\n\nThis all happened in a manner of minutes. A terrible job on behalf of Nicalis.\n\nStick with the original version (it's FREE, nothing to lose), or, if you really wanted to buy Cave Story, the 3DS version would be the only one I'd reccomend purchasing (all features from CS+, portability, optional 3D, supports proper 16:9, stable, $10). If you want to support Pixel (you should), go buy 10 copies of Azarashi instead.","November 26, 2013","false","1.0"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","6"

You can argue and debate about how you can toggle off the extra things like the (awful) remixed music but that's avoiding the point. The point is that the very worthwhile experience of this game is available for free and this port does nothing to expand upon the (rather high) benchmark that it's predecessor set.\n\nA quick google search will show you how you can install the freeware publish of this game and a english patch (if needed). I would strongly recommend doing that, it is a very well-made gem of a game.","December 30, 2013","false","6.2"," 8 of 29 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","8","29","0","0"

I really don't mind difficulty in a game, if you even briefly browse my profile you can see that, however there is a major difference between fun difficulty and frustrating difficulty. let me explain in detail...\n\ni really don't appreciate seperate endings that depend on arbatrary actions, IE having to make a jump that most would deem impossible with permenant reprocautions.\n\ni really don't appreciate being given choices that downgrade my character for 40% of the game with absolutely no idea before-hand IE being given the choice of choosing a different gun with no option of going back.\n\nI really don't appreciate having to replay huge sections of the game, because the creator refuses to put an extra checkpoint in because he insists on clinging to archaic game design. ghosts and goblins may be your childhood, but let's face the facts, that game would not have suffered, nor your experience, if it had the option to save.\n\nbut lastly, i really don't appreciate jumping through many arbitrary loops, so that i can get a non-♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending, only to come to a nigh-impossible set of obstacles and 4 bosses. listen, i know you think you feel much more satisfied knowing you beat hell, and 4 bosses, but I challenge you to think about something... would your experience REALLY have suffered if there was a checkpoint after hell? or after the first boss? or the second? or the third? would you really have thrown down the controller and been "AHH ♥♥♥♥! AND I WAS HAVING SO MUCH FUN BEING CHALLENGED"\n\ni really doubt it. but for those of us who memorized patterns for hell, and for the three of the four bosses, and still die, it's frustrating, its assinine and it. is. not. fun.\n\ni would love to reccomend this game for the first half, which is fun and challenging and almost worth the price of admission, but once you hit the wall of rediculous challenge, only to be let down by a sub-par ending, and then finding out that a much shinier ending lies behind 7 impregnable doors... i just can't ask anyone else to go through it.\n\nthis game is not horrible, but it is not the glorified masterpiece that everyone insists it is. do yourself a favor and stick to super meat boy.","November 25, 2013","false","25.4"," 14 of 44 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","14","44","0","11"

It has translation errors, but that doesn't detract much from the story that you probably already know. To the uninitiated, cave story is a sidescrolling, high difficulty shooter with a whimsical style that makes it hard to get mad at the game for filling you up with bullets. It has a bit of replay value with three endings that, for the most part, are determined through the second half of the game.\n\nDying would be punishing by today's standards, with no lives system and only the ability to reload. It's a small thing to overlook considering how spoiled we are by quick loads.","December 26, 2011","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Advance your weapons and stats as you go through the story, and there are plenty of hidden powerups and bonuses along the way.\n\nDefinitely worth at least two playthroughs of the story to see everything there is to offer. The game is also decently challenging - actually pretty tough in some parts - without being unfair, and the storyline has some very well written characters.\n\nBesides a few minor nitpicks (one boss character in particular is re-used a lot, and so it's just tedious by the end), this is arguably the best "indie" game on the market.\n\n10/10 would buy","March 21, 2013","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
