"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baole58/recommended/274130/","baole58","Bao-Le-58","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baole58/","169 products in account","Why did I buy this game? Maybe because it was on sale and I wanted to see for myself just how bad this game was. But at around £10, I felt ripped-off. Everyone has already said what needs to be said about this game but I'm going to do it anyway.\n\nThis game is an on-rail shooter with no innovations. If the developers didn't want to do anything new, they should've just developed a generic FPS game (like Call of Duty) or something. At least that way, you're able to move freely and more effort would've been put into developing the game. "Stealth" sequences are just QTEs and there are even QTE sequences for entire levels, which you can auto-pass with the first "perk" you unlock. Yes, you can complete missions by doing nothing.\n\n"Perks" and "abilities" are pretty much useless in this game and guns have very little differences. No light gun support and cutscenes are awful. Ripped straight out of the first three Rambo movies, it would've been better to just put the actual scenes from the movie itself as cutscenes because the voice-acting in this game is terrible. There are multiple bugs and glitches that causes the game to randomly crash and can stop game progression (sort of). On one level, when I "moved" to the next section, there were no enemies. Because of that, I couldn't pass and threw a grenade at myself to start from the last checkpoint as oppose to restarting the level from the beginning.\n\nThe graphics are awful, the game looks like it was made in the early 90s. I don't demand the most beautiful, cutting-edge graphics in modern video games but since this game came out early this year, the graphics are way below average. Character models are some of the most laughable I've ever seen, and for some reason, John Rambo is the worst looking. He looks mentally deficient, like the puppet of Matt Damon in Team America. The trailer misrepresents the kind of game this is. This game is not a "John Rambo" experience. That's even a difficulty mode, the "hardest". Don't bother with it and just stick to Green Beret. The game will often "move" to sections where you're completely out in the open and can't cover, so you'll take loads of damage. That's why using Wrath Mode is very important in this game because during Wrath Mode, you heal when you kill enemies.\n\nThis game is so easy until the last mission. It's not even difficult, they just throw waves of enemies at you because the developers think that that's "challenging". You're going to die a lot and often duck for cover, with a cover system that doesn't even work (bullets often go through) and it's one of the most frustrating experiences ever in gaming (even on normal difficulty). That's why you should avoid John Rambo mode, the difficulty is the same except you get more points on higher difficulty and you get only one more try in John Rambo mode. You get three more tries in Green Beret mode, five more tries on normal and (I assume) seven more tries on easy (whatever easy and normal modes are called in this game). Because you die often in the last level (or last two levels) having only one more try after you die is not worth it. You'll have to restart the whole level so even if you get past one wave of enemies, the game throws even more at you, making the game feel endless. There are no achievements for playing the game on John Rambo mode anyway (or any incentives to do so) so don't. If you're looking for a challenge in this game, you're not going to find any because on higher dificulty, the AI is exactly the same.\n\nYou can complete this game in two hours. £30 for this p.o.s? NO! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Steam, you removed Ride to Hell: Retribution. Please remove this game, it's just as bad. Please avoid people from buying this ♥♥♥♥ game. I'm surprised this game hasn't hit the bargain bin, or even the trash bin. I bought Ride to Hell: Retribution (for giggles) because it was dirt cheap (£3). It's worse than this game but at least I didn't feel ripped-off after I bought Ride to Hell: Retribution. But it's "Rambo" so I guess that's why they're overcharging you for this turd of a game. My friend bought it full price because he told me and I quote "it's for the fans". He said exactly the same thing about Prison Break: The Conspiracy (because he's a fan of Prison Break too). NO!!! JUST NO!!!!! This game ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the movie license. I'm not a Rambo fan but even hardcore Rambo fans can see what a ♥♥♥♥ game this is and they're clever enough to avoid it.\n\nI would buy this game if it were really cheap (like Ride to Hell: Retribution) and I thought £10 (during the Halloween sale) seemed reasonable for a bad game. DON'T PAY MORE THAN £5 FOR THIS GAME OR AVOID IT AT ALL COST! I do respect different opinions but the minority who are giving this game positive reviews are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing morons who are blinded by loyalty and nostalgia. This game gets 1 point for being better than Ride to Hell: Retribution and another for making me laugh at times.\n\n2/10 - TERRIBLE! :@","November 5, 2014","false","1.6"," 176 of 203 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","176","203","12","2"

I've been gaming since the 80's and seen some terrible games but this has to be one of the worst.\n\nAI are a scripted mess who move the exact same way and duck into cover in a routine.  They cant hit for crap, i mean its a rambo game sure and in the movies nobody seems to be able to shoot for crap anyway but this is just silly.\nThe Weapons handle terribly, seriously moving a weapons around the screen?  Who came up with this?!  This would be far better suited to a classic light gun game you might find in an arcade, this may even make it slightly more fun who knows right.  Even reloading is annoying as you have to try and get perfect reloads to reload faster.\nThe time senstive moments where you have to press a button combination is pathetic, i could do it with my eyes shut and still get it right.\nThere are even scenes where you get penalised and lose points for killing and not wounding enemies, for gods sake with 50 people all shooting at me with automatic weapons the last thing i want to be worrying about it not killing them and just wounding them.\nThe voice acting is horrendous.  Stallones voice is in but the other originals.. no!  just bad voice actors who sound nothing like the originals.\nSure it looks pretty in places but its rather dull and bland graphically, the cut scenes hold some merit to the movies but thats really about all thats reasonable with this game.\n\nI have to admit i enjoyed it slightly only because it gave me an uncontrollable urge to watch all the rambo movies in succession on bluray, it does have a certain sense of nostalgia btu you can get that just from watching the movies which i did right after playing.\nSo if you are reading this, watch the movies again and just avoid the game.\n\n1 out of 10.","December 25, 2014","false","0.8"," 92 of 109 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","92","109","5","1"

Rambo is an awkward experience with plenty of QTEs, short levels, frustrating difficulty spikes and/or checkpoints, moronic perks/skills and, well, it's just no fun. If you replace 'fun' with 'frustrating' then you absolutely have a good point. And I would agree with you all the way, no arguing here.\n\nRambo himself looks like ♥♥♥♥, he looked like the melting man from the Robocop movie. The levels on the other hand look actually decent. You can clearly see it was done by seperate teams. The voice acting was ripped directly from the movies, as you can tell by the poor quality of it all.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, this is an on-rail shooter, but without the light guns. And with a mouse.\nMaking headshots with your mouse is ridiculously easy, but reloading takes ages and it has the mechanic that games like Gears Of War use. So press the reload button at the right time and you'll reload your gun with double the ammo, if you fail it will jam your gun and if you do it the normal way you'll reloaded normally. It doesn't work a game like this, because well, it's about shooting people. I don't have time to try and reload at the exact right time when there are several enemies shooting at me, and staying behind cover doesn't do sh*t when one is still standing on the side of it, shooting at you.\n\nCheckpoints are random. Sometimes it saves right after a scene, sometimes before. Sometimes it saves right before a big fight when you're extremely low on health and the first bullet that hits you kills you. Fine. Just restart the checkpoint then (you can retry 5 times per level). But what's this. The exact same thing happens, again ! And within a minute you wasted 5 continues. At least give a bit of health, or let enemies hit you less frequent. Sure, maybe I suck but that's not the point. Why add a mechanic that doesn't even do what it's supposed to do ? Who thought of this game in the first place ?\n\nThe QTEs are too fast, I had to actually look up my keyboard to see where the keys are supposed to be. I use the WASD keys automatically and never really think about what I'm actually pressing. This game made me feel like someone who just starts working with computers. Great job !\nI'm going to stop now, I don't want to waste any more time on this game. I've already done that enough.\n\nSkiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip and never think about it again.\n\n[Rating: 30/100]","February 24, 2014","false","4.9"," 74 of 84 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","74","84","3","3"

I really don't but this game was not what I expected it to be.\n\nIt would have been a really great and fun game had it been a free movement 1st or 3rd Person Shooter. This game would have been a blast! I could have seen myself actually having a lot of fun with this. But sadly, the WHOLE game is a rail shooter. All you can do is duck out of the way, aim and shoot.\nAnd stay away from using a 360 or any other game controller to play this. The accuracy is a mess even with aim assist. It's almost unplayable with a controller. You have a much better chance playing with a mouse and keyboard for better accuracy. And speaking of aim assist... just turn it off, believe me you will hate it.\n\nWhat also gets me is the audio. The background music is great! It's Rambo music and it's crisp and clear... until you hear the voices which sound like they were ripped from a VHS tape version of the movies with a low sample rate.\n\nI'm thinking the devs wanted to make the players feel like they were getting an Arcade experience like Operation Wolf or something but with this game, it just doesn't cut it. I mean the idea was great to make a game being Rambo and it would have been a TON of fun had there been free movement like other 1st or 3rd Person Shooter games.\n\nFor the price they are asking, I can not recommend this game. Maybe if it was $14.99 USD, then yea.\nBut, if you are really into Rail Shooter games, then you might like this game. I also like Rail Shooter games. But just couldn't get into this one. :/\n\nR.I.P.

Yes, even as a rail shooter! - but not like this.\n\nRambo: The Video Game lacks every inch of love and care for the franchise with very poor production quality, half-♥♥♥♥♥ level-design and boring, sluggish gameplay. Other rail shooters already showed how you can improve the formula by mixing little bits like target practices or hidden collectibles into it. Rambo on the other hand is a game of memorization. Once you know the enemy positions, you can almost breeze through the entire game - up until the last level, where the difficulty spikes up twenty times.\n\nBut where Rambo really fails hard is on the technical level: Atrociously bad graphics, poorly ripped sound and voice files from the movies and unresponsive controls - this game has it all.\n\nTo know the devs also acquired the license for the first two Terminator movies makes me cringe for their take on Arnold's T-800 days...\n\n[BAKER TEAM UPDATE: While the 3 new missions are a bit better than the main campaign, they don't really differ from them with innovations.

Rambo The Video Game takes place through the first three movies and you relive the best moments from those movies. But will you want to play it ? Well right now I can say that this is one of the worst on rails shooters I have ever played. The game somehow and I'm not sure how get's the story of those movies wrong. The gameplay is simple. You are put on a rail and you go around and shoot people and sometimes there are stealth segments in which if you are spotted you get an instant death screen. The game is also riddled with bugs and some of them are hilarious but the joke wears out very fast. The game is also incredibly short and it's easy as hell until the final level where the difficulty spike rises to unbelievable heights where they put every kind of enemy on the screen and three checkpoints through the entire level. This game is incredibly bad, how can you mess up a Rambo game this bad is beyond me. Even if you are a On rails fan this game is big mess which you need to stay away from no matter what, just get Blue Estate or any other on rails shooter game. Rambo The Video Game is one of the worst games I have ever played. I give Rambo The Video Game a 2/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 20, 2015","false","4.6"," 52 of 70 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","52","70","2","0"

You can shoot an enemy player five times in a row and they do not go down or die. You have to have perfect aim. Sometimes you get stuck and have to fight waves of 30 or 40 enemy players in a row without an autosave checkpoint, which puts you into the middle of a maddening loop where you die 50 times in a row and keep playing the same checkpoint over and over until you are lucky enough to squeeze through.\n\nThe game is stupid hard, even on the easiest level settings. The achievements are stupid. You have no control over your movement, with the exxception of the times when the game allows you to take cover, so sometimes you will come face to face with enemy players and when you run out of ammo, you can't do anyting but just stand there and reload while they unload bullets into your face.\n\nThere is no auto-reload in the game, so you constantly have to hit the (R) button over and over again for each stage.\n\nThere are parts of this game that are a a lot of fun, and as someone who loved the movies, it can be fun playing through the jailbreak scene from the first movie. This game could have been so much better though. Why can't gamers get an awesome Arma style game featuring John Rambo?

Rambo is a rails shooter- that in my book is a good thing becauase it makes the games more closely resemble the old rambo arcade games. On the other hand- the game looks like ♥♥♥♥ and it becomes painfully obvious when you get your first look at John Rambo and he looks like a character from ♥♥♥♥ing clay fighter. And unlocking wepons in this game is an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥- you unlock them through challenges and the first one I got was to get 50 headshots on a certain level, sounds easy right? It's not, because of the games auto lock on system it's nearly impossible to get a headshot and if you turn it off, getting headshot's is easier, but it's hard to hit an enemy let alone get a ♥♥♥♥ing headshot on them... aiming sucks in this game. Its also very short- it can be beat in under 4 hours, but it has some pretty high replay value (because its an arcade style game). It is also a fairly decent challenge for all you hardcore gamers out there. And a quick tip for all you hardcore gamers out there- this game will randomly crash on you! And the last level of this game is impossibly hard, i would say it's harder than the last level of Bioshock Infinite. This game will be enjoyed by those who are die hard fans of the film, but otherwise...UUUUUUUUUUGH.I find it hard to recommend Rambo The Video Game- its honestly pretty bad.

I still recommend waiting till this is on sale before buying it.  Once you've got it, take it for what it is, a  budget  title  following the story of Rambo in his first three movies.  I'd l actually like to see a  sequel released covering the  fourth and final film (though it is rumoured that Stallone may do a fifth film - even tohugh he's approaching  70 he's still looking amazing).\n\n\nOriginal review with  some changes in the first day of release:\n\nHmmm!  I was really looking forwards to playing this game ever since I saw it was coming to Steam several weeks ago.  The intro movie in the Steam shop window gives you the impression that it's an open world game, or at least with some freedom of movement; but,  in reality you don't even get to move Rambo yourself, basically, this is a rail shooter.  All you do is shoot and occasionally duck behind cover. (later in the game   you have to select from   the usual WASD keys to activate actions such as knifing   one of the police officers that were searching for you in First Blood part 1.  If you get the timing spot on, you'll just disable them and get good points  that  help you to level up and unlock  perks.  If you  press the key too early   you kill the officer and get fewer points, if you press the key too late you get shot in the head and have to restart from a checkpoint.    Your movements are controlled automatically; and, after watching the German videos by KeysJore on you tube, it looks like   all of the game is like this.   You can see the first intro’ game HERE.\n\nThere's no health packs and the only way to gain health is to go into wrath mode and kill enemies.  The more you kill in wrath mode, the more health you regain.  Trouble is (as far as I can see so far in the game), wrath mode initially only lasts for seconds, so, unless you are lightning fast, it's hard to get a kill  during this time, even though the enemy are firing at you in slow-mo.  Thankfully, as you earn perks you can  increase the length of time wrath mode  remains.    There are loads of  perks such as   no QTE fails, earn 5% health for every head shot, reloading behind cover gives you 20% more  ammo, kills during wrath mode earn 25% more health, moving in and out of cover 50% faster,  reloading faster, deal more damage, as well as  loads more  and some of which are upgradeable. and for achievement hunters there's a generous number of achievements to be earned.\n\nWhenever you level up (by scoring points) you earn skill points.  these can be spent on various skills such as Toughness (harder to kill0, improvements in  different types of  weapons  for example, light and heavy weapons a swell a sspecial equipment  and of course wrath.  there are  five upgrades for each skill.  with respect to wrath, each upgrade adds   a new  wrath bar to  your HUD.  The first upgrade effectively doubles your wrath bar.\n\nOn my first try I didn't even get past the first stage, but, once I'd realized how to gain a 200% mag fill  it made it easier to avoid getting shot as often, and once I'd earned my first perk, I spent it on the wrath perk, which  enables you to recharge your health  when you make a kill in wrath mode.\n\nAs Rambo is one of my old favourites, I'll probably continue with the game, but I am very disappointed in this offering.  It reminds me of my disappointment with one of the Medal of Honor games I got for free when I bought the Wii several years ago for family gatherings.  It plays very similar with respect to no movement control.  It's like someone else has played the game through and recorded all the movements necessary.\n\nMy advice is wait till it’s on sale before you spend your hard earned cash.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nWith respect to  recovering health, I think the trick (after studying the videos a little more), is to concentrate on killing  one enemy at a time; for each kill you get about 20% of your health back, so you can afford to lose a little health from other enemy fire  while   aiming at one of them.   As you progress you unlock perks that can extend the wrath mode, which then becomes   a little easier and more useful to use.  Wrath mode is activated by filling a kill bar.\n\nThe game covers the first three  films in the franchise i.e. Rambo First Blood (1982), Rambo First Blood II (1985) and Rambo III (1988), pity they didn't add the latest movie released back in 2008 20 years after the last one.\n\nsecond edit:\n\nThanks to Bridget Fisher, I finally read the instructions (instead of jumping in blindly the first time around)  and found I actually enjoyed the game   more than previously despite it being  a rail shooter.  I'd ignored the instructions for getting   a 200% mag fill, which  in this game makes a big difference  with respect to losing health. I do think  it's a little too expensive, especially here in the UK.  If you get a friend in the US to gift it to you, you can save a further £5.\n\n\nOverall I've changed my opinion of this game after   playing it for  three hours.  Now I give it  a thumbs up.  :)","February 21, 2014","true","2.6"," 1,192 of 2,224 people (54%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","54","192","2","34","72"

"we know best" and "mission accomplished").\nThe Russians have tanks, armoured verticals and HIND helicopters.\n\nStallone's great writing how to get out of the situation:\n"Lets F-ck them"\n\nI can still hear tens of thousands Americans cinema goers shouting: "F-ck yeah Rambo. Show them the American way. Shoot them until they are dead so they learn about peace and freedom the American way".\n\nSo no.. Don't buy this game over 50 cent. (at least the trading cards would give you back the money)\n\nJust google "Commando Libya" for C64 and play that. At least you get to kill Khadafi's children on the bonus stages or the classic (and 100% censored game in Sweden) Raid over Moscow. Raid over Moscow is 100x times better than Rambo and is more true to Rambo's spirit. Imagine a stage in a game where you have a bazooka and your goal is to blow the Kremlin towers up. I love non political correct games from the 1980is.","April 7, 2015","false","0.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","0"

But here we go, we got served some lame half-♥♥♥♥♥ Rambo game. As a Rambo fan, this is a BIG disservice! Not only hurting the Rambo brand but the game itself is bad!\n\nI grew up watching these over the top action flicks, which even prompted me to join the Army many years ago (along with many other war movies that is!). I own the VHS, DVD and even Bluray of the whole movies and to play a game like this... a huge shame...\n\nAs for the game, you have the movie trilogy mode, which follows you playing from the stories perspective. You have a new mode that was added recently, the free BAKER TEAM UPDATE, that adds about 3 missions, set before the movies.\n\nAside of the story modes, you've got the Trautman challenge, which unlocks new weapons to be used in the story mode... since all guns are locked and can't select new ones.\n\nSo, that's pretty much it...\n\nOVERALL:I don't intend to write an essay over this game. It is pretty much universally disliked and hated. The soundtrack are ripped from the movies, which might be the only positive aspect of the whole game. As for visuals, graphics, voice acting and sound... AWFUL! The sound was ripped in low quality of the movies, even the voice acting.\n\nIt's hard to know this game takes a whole 8 GB of space and yet, the visuals and sounds are really bad quality... even the aiming feels off at times. Must be the mediocre aim-assist, that I couldn't find a way to turn off.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:Hardcore Rambo fan or not or even fan of Rail Shooter games, be on your guard!\nOnly consider at 50% sale!\n\n...well, at 5$, it could be worth it though!","April 26","false","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even the description on Steam stresses the fact its a rail shooter on three occasions. Of course people just look at the pretty pictures and assumed it was another first person shooter. I personally love rail shooters and it's such a shame it's becoming a dead genre. So I was really pinning my hopes on Rambo The Video Game, unfortunately the combination of bad game design and lazy production values hold it back from being a fun arcade shooter.\n\nRambo the Video Game recreates the events of the first three films in the franchise. You play as John Rambo, a Vietnam War veteran unable to readjust to normal society and learns the battlefield is the only place he can call home.  The developers have managed to replicate all the key sequences from the movies, while adding a few of their own. The voices for Rambo and Colonel Trautman were taken directly from the movies and were spliced among newly recorded voice overs (comprised mostly of UK actors using a poor excuse for an American accent). The end result is an inconsistent audio mix that comes across as cheap and lazy.\n\nThe game play is an on rail shooter with a cover system similar to Time Crisis. Unfortunately this so called "cover" doesn’t protect you from certain enemies and can easily be destroyed by enemy gunfire. To make matters worst, half of the game is spent standing out in the open with zero protection. A huge problem when reloading your gun turns the player into a sitting duck. This has to be the most frustrating on rail shooter I’ve ever played, in fact the difficulty on the last level spiked so hard, the only way I could finish this bloody game was by adjusting the difficulty to the lowest setting.\n\nThe developers tried to mix in a couple of ideas from other genres, but they don’t exactly work in the simple on rail shooter. Does every game need to have stealth these days? As well as those bloody quick time events, in fact one whole mission is nothing but quick time events. A testament to the game's lazy design.\n\nNow to be fair there are some interesting ideas, including the RPG style upgrade and perk system. You can also disarm enemies by shooting the gun out of their hands and a wrath system where Rambo does his trademark screaming, which allows to gain back some health with every enemy he kills. So that's how he survived the fights in the original films.\n\nIt took me 3 hours and 6 minutes to finish the story mode and this includes all my failed attempts and watching every cut-scenes. You can play through the missions again to unlock all the weapons and perks. There’s online leader boards and two player co-op. But it still doesn’t hide the fact it’s a really short game.\n\nThe issues with Rambo The Video Game stem from it trying to do too much with a simple genre. Plus the low production values, terrible quality control and bad graphics are really glaring for a game in 2014 from a non-indie developer. If you’re looking for a good Rambo video game, keep an eye out for the Sega arcade machine from 2008 and leave this one to rot in the hole it deserves to be in.","May 3, 2015","false","4.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

However, I tried many times to do the last mission in Afghanistan and it made me a little frustrated; when I passed through I was happy and delighted.

The other half was mostly long winded ways of saying "I am angry because this game is exactly what it says it is and not what I want it to be," that is an arcade rail-shooter that plays like an arcade rail-shooter and not like a normal PC/console FPS.  The other few reviews were people complaining about technical issues which will vary from machine to machine.  The one positive review that I read started as negative until the guy played it a bit more and realised, "Hey, this isn't half bad.  Heck it's actually fun!"\n\nWhile not perfect, Rambo The Video Game is far from bad.  It provides a good challenge with fun gameplay for about three hours or so.  You get to use a nice variety of weapons that all differ in their own way slightly and you can unlock them all to use in any mission by completing challenges you unlock by progressing through the game.  There's an active reload system similar to Gears of War only much faster, and if you jam your gun at the wrong time you're as good as dead unless you quickly switch to your secondary weapon.  The cover system works pretty well and the game is smart enough to not let you sit there all day by either making your cover destroyable or having a grenadier throw grenades at you.  Managing your rage meter and when to unleash it to restore your health isn't terribly hard to figure out as long as you keep an eye on your health.  The vehicle segments and stealth segments with the bow are lots of fun and the explosive arrows are about as fun as you'd hope they would be.\n\nOverall I'd probably give the game at least 7/10.  I didn't experience any bugs or technical issues.  I had a lot of fun with the single player and I plan on trying out coop with my friend this weekend.  If I remember to then I'll add on to my review for coop and using a controller to play instead of the mouse.  My only real complaint about the game is that the quick time events are really hard to judge (which isn't really an issue because you can get a perk that prevets you from dying if you fail one).\n\nI would reccomend buying the game on sale, as it isn't really worth $40.  I got it for $10 myself and I'm happy with what I got for that.  If you intend on buying this game, make sure that you're expecting an arcade rail-shooter and not a Triple A FPS.  The game has about the same production value as the actual Rambo arcade light gun game (which is also really fun).  The graphics LOOK like an arcade rail-shooter.  If you're not sure then watch some gameplay footage.\n\nEDIT: I tried out playing with an XBox 360 controller.  It's certainly playable, albeit a bit awkward at first.  When playing with the controller there's a bit of autoaim to help you out, which doesn't feel intrusive and is actually helpful.  Mouse and keyboard is probably the better option for most people, but in the end it comes down to preference.\n\nDOUBLE EDIT: Tried out local coop.  Plays just like single player only you have TWO guns shooting at once!  You share health and rage which works just fine.  If you play local coop I reccomend going into the display settings and turning off display weapons to make it a bit less cluttered and confusing.","April 6, 2015","true","11.9"," 15 of 52 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","15","52","0","0"

That being said - the game is a RAIL SHOOTER not a 1st person shooter and you can see the graphics in the gameplay videos and screenshots on the store page. So complaining about the graphics and how it is a rail shooter is really silly.\n\nRegardless, the game is actually pretty fun and short since it's a really straightforward arcade style rail shooter that recreates the major scenes from the first three Rambo films. It makes my inner nine year old oh so happy.\n\nI tried playing the game with a wireless Xbox 360 controller and with keyboard/mouse. It is immensely easier with a mouse and I do not recommend trying to play this game with a controller. Aiming with a joystick on a controller is really sluggish, especially with the 'aim assisting' feature. Just remember to crank up the sensitivity regardless of which control mechanism you use.\n\nI enjoy this game but I can only recommend it to players who like rail shooters and/or are big fans of the Rambo films. I bought this game on sale and as much as I like the game, I don't think it is worth spending more than $10 on it. The base price of $40 is ridiculous.\n\nFinal Thoughts - This game is stupid fun despite all of its flaws, but don't pay full price for it.","April 8, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 38 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","9","38","0","0"

If you come into it knowing It's an arcadey on rails shooter, then you're going to have an amazingly fun time. It has a very deep scoring system, with challenging difficulty. If you're a huge fan of rail shooters, you can sink a whole lot of hours into this one. I have two bigger issues with this game though. The first are the quick time events. It's really unneeded and It feels laggy. I press the proper button in what I think is the perfect timing, but I miss it completely and fail the section. I should note that you have the option to select a perk that hits all the QTE's perfect and you just sit back and watch. I haven't tried this yet, but it's pretty neccessary in the harder difficulties it seems. The second issue is the fact that you may have one or two enemies on the screen, and they won't be shooting you..but you'll be taking damage. It's not a huge deal i guess, but it's really annoying and it shows lazy programming. So where are we? At $40, it does seem pretty steep for a 2-3 hour experience, but If you're a fan of rail shooters, you'll get plenty of your money's worth with the scoring system and replayability.\n\nAt $10 - Instant buy for fans of rambo or rail shooters\nAt $40 - Serious consideration..worth it, but not to the majority of the population!\n\nBottom Line: I love this game, and don't listen to all the haters. It's an arcade style game for god's sake!

It's not horrible. Not incredible, ♥♥♥♥, it's awful. But I go on youtube and watch reviews on it and it's voted, 2/10, 3/10 by reviewers. It's not THAT godawful.\nIf I'm being totally honest, I kinda enjoyed, somewhat. It has some stages that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me the ♥♥♥♥ off, namely the last stage. ♥♥♥♥. THAT. But other than that, it somewhat succeeded design-wise. Not hard, somewhat easy at times, but it mostly does it correctly. The guns all feel the same, like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ paintball gun. The only change is the rate of fire and magazine size. It has a somewhat interesting reloading mechanic, despite what people say. It's not realistic, but it's ♥♥♥♥in' Rambo for gods sake. Anyway, the textures, animations, and just graphics in general are ♥♥♥♥, but outside of custscenes it's negligible I suppose. Though strangely, out of all models, Rambo seems to be the worst looking one.\nThe story is like the first three films, though some small differences. For example, at one point Rambo shoots 200 or so cops, which.. y'know.. didn't happen.\nIt has a wrath mode, which is okay i guess. It puts you in slow-mo, and highlights all enemies. In wrath mode, each enemy you kill gains you health. The audio though.. that's the worst part. It's literally the voices ripped straight from the movie. And it's obvious, horribly horribly obvious.\nOther than that, it's an incredibly mediocre first person cover shooter. It's playable, but not breaking and new ground or anything, despite being a ♥♥♥♥ing cover shooter made in 2014. Overall its maybe.. 5/10. Then again, I picked it up for 10 bucks, DO NOT pay more for that. ♥♥♥♥, unless you're either a big fan of cover shooters or a big fan of Rambo don't even bother with it.","July 18, 2015","true","4.7"," 6 of 31 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","6","31","0","9"

First off this is NOT an Epic Story Lined RPG/FPS MEGA MILL Game .... yeah, and I dont think it was suppose to be either. If you have watched the Rambo movies then you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect, minimal ... cheesy dialogue and excessive explosions. What you do in this game is play all the action scenes from the first 3 movies (4th film is not in this, though I wish it were). It IS a Rail Shooter, to those that may want more of an example, this game reminds me a lot of the Movie based rail games back in the late 80s and early 90s, I remember playing an Arcade version of Star Wars that was the same way.\n\nYou still have to take cover and shoot and there are some QTEs, you can get a perk in the game to make QTEs impossible to fail but you wont get any points for not doing them, with or with out the perk. A lot of peps hate that the perk is in there, my advice, if the idea of not being able to fail a QTE bothers you, then dont use the damn perk, its very simple. The combat is fun, the QTEs are fun and ... well your playing as Rambo and blowing everything in the game world up ... what else do you want out of a Rambo game?\n\nIs it perfect? Of course not, but its fun. In our modern world of games there seems to be a huge focus on pretty and mainstream and feature this and feature that, to me (my humble opinion), all I want is the game that I bought to be fun. Its suppose to be a game .. right? Game. In the end, if the game is fun and Im having a blast playing it then what is the issue?\n\nAgain, your gonna see and hear a lot of hate for this game and some peps are very good at hating everything, so I suggest you watch game play videos online with no commentary, come in to this game with out looking for the bad, because if that is your focus, then your gonna find it, dont care what game your playing.\n\nIf you like Rambo, and you want to play as Rambo and blow things up ... well pretty much everything up, then I can not recommend it more. If you dont like Rambo, rail shooters, the 80s or playing a game just for the fun of it, then stay away. This is not for you.

I was terribly wrong. I was expecting Arm Wrestling, when instead I get giant Sly Bobble head with a Perm. My Mind was blown, not only did it have everything I've ever wanted in a video game, but it also gave me the freedom to be a real american. I made up words to the theme song, I screamed them for an hour until I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off my wife and she went up stairs. But its okay, she doesn't even know what a Rambo is. Now, I'm killing them damn VietKongs and blasting Hulk Hogans Real American theme while smoking Marlboro Reds, while a bald eagle sits purched on top my laptop.\nSure, this game probably should have come out in like 2004, but hot damn it gets me goin. I put a bunch of peanuts in a burlap sack and started swinging the sack around like I was Thundar the Barbarian.

Are you a bad enough dude, to play RAMBO?!\nGOTY 30/10 Rambos.\n\nUPDATE: So I spent 2 hours, disarming cops and not killing them for 1 prize. A Shotgun. And might I say, Rambo with a shotgun is one of the greatest achievements we as gamers could ever be granted. You might be asking yourself, would Rambo with a shotgun be worth the money? No, absolutely not. Not one bit. I mean I could have used those 2 hours of my life to Fist Fight this damn gigantic ♥♥♥ dog that randomly stands upright and walks through my backyard. I mean it's probably some crazy man that walks on 4's then just randomly stands up. Never the less, by gaining Shotgun ablitiles, Rambo becomes so overpowered that nothing can stop him. Helicopters, pshhh, they're like horse flys to Rambo, he just uses his mighty boomstick and cast them down straight to the dephs of hell.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperSixBravo/recommended/274130/","SuperSixBravo","SuperSixBravo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperSixBravo/","359 products in account","Firstly put aside all the negative reviews and forum posts. Yes the game has some serious issues and the some of the game play mechanics are a bit of pain.\nTaking all of the above into consideration there is actually quite a good game in there. Yes its on rails, but its not that bad. There is quite a lot of depth to the game that some reviews did not mention because they were too busy telling us how bad everything is.\n\nThe cover system whilst taken right out of the likes of time crisis etc, does some quite good things. Hide behind a box and the enemy will shoot the box out leaving you with no cover, there is also quite a good system where by when being shot at by multiple enemies its advisable to wait for them to reload before you pop out of cover and take them down. Of course you can't also wait because  your cover may be getting destroyed affording you no time to wait for reloads.\n\nYou can also make choices such as killing or disarming cops rather than killing them, Totalbiscuit touched on this all be it he mocked it at least he noticed it so good on him.\n\nThe graphics whilst not earth shattering are not of PS2 quality and If you think that then please go back and play a PS2. There is lots of destruction especially when you get to fly the helicopter and "Blow Stuff Up" the buildings all blow up nicely and in a seemingly non scripted way and catch fire, enemies lose limbs and its very satisfying cutting them down with the guns mounted on the helicopter.\n\nQTE's well what can you say? they do have a place in some games and I sense that they were added because of the on rails type of game play. Again some reviews have mentioned the perk you can get where you can avoid doing the QTE's as the game will do them for you, but what they did not mention was, that  whilst the game does them for you, it does them in the worst way possible as in you will never get a perfect timing hit. You can also still do the QTE's yourself with the perk and get them perfect often affording you a little more time to shoot the incoming nade or take up cover quicker or just avoid a mortar but you will still lose some life. So yes whilst the perk will do the QTE's for you its really only just getting you through the game its far more beneficial to do them yourself.\n\nThe game is also fairly hard in some places, sometimes due to bad design but more often its because its just hard. Of course the better you are the less hard it will be for you, I find it hard at times so this is just my observation.\n\nIf you like time crisis, good old fashioned guns and action with no need to worry about your path and clear objectives then you will like this game. There are lots of little things you will notice and think ah ok thats quite cool.\n\nI am enjoying this game and I also think there is a lot of replay value to it. For people wanting a light gun experience you can use a wii controller but this is not supported by the game, however google is your friend.\n\nIts not that bad IMHO if you get to try it you will be surprised.","February 25, 2014","true","6.9"," 18 of 168 people (11%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","11","18","168","3","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/274130/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","This isn't Rambo the Photo Editor, or Rambo the Audio Mixer, this is Rambo: the VIDEO GAME!  Its on rails, this is Rambo!  Rambo doesnt wander around willy nilly looking for things to kill, all a Rambo does is KILL KILL KILL so on rails kinda works, check youtube for gameplay videos to see if it is a good fit first....   On rails shooters are not a bad thing, most games just trick you into thinking their open world because you press forward but that is just a trick!!!  Look at Splinter Cell Blacklist it is so heavily scripted with walk cycles, it might as well be on rails.  This game has ALOT of QTE's, some levels are all QTE's but dont worry their easy, and the first time you level up there is a perk called "No QTE fails", so its no big deal.\n\nWhen first starting the game you are at Rambo's funeral, then the worst guy ever to give a funeral speech says, "I'm Glad Rambo is dead".  What a jerk, they couldnt find someone else?   That is pretty depressing is there any other way to start a game without the death of the main character and the US military mocking him?  Turns out Rambo faked his own death.  Then at the end you are in Afghanistan, at first I thought Rambo was helping the terrorists by getting revenge and killing all the US military people for being jerks.  But it turns out Rambo is fighting Russians for some reason.  Was that why he faked his death?  Im not sure and it's never explained really in the game at least, maybe in the movie it is.\n\nThe gameplay is kind of cheap and unfair during the last mission.  There are guys that toss grenades from behind cover that you cant dodge you have to shoot them out of the air.  Sounds easy right, but its not easy when there are helicopters, mounted machine guns on jeeps, and ten thousand other things trying to kill you.  Those grenade guys are real unfair that they can hide meaning you need to wait for them to throw a grenade to shoot them, but good luck dodging every thing else while trying to do it.\n\nThe games graphics are old school, the forest scenes are great, lots of vegetation, I was real surprised.  The audio in the entire game is way to low, whats worse is the audio is already set at 100%, so you cant turn up the volume in game.  If you get a sound notification for a steam message from a friend, its like a nuclear explosion going off.  Other parts of the game I cant hear the dialog at all, for example this one part Rambo is in a patrol car, and the music and car engine are so loud that it covers up the dialog.  The game is on rails, but it is fun, I had a good time with the game.  The game runs at 60 fps, but oddly in cut scenes they drop to 30 fps for some reason.  While playing I encountered no bugs or crashes.  There is replay value because you can play it anytime, the controls are real easy and intuitive, so no need to relearn controls everytime you play it.\n\nRambo has a waifu in this game, waifu is a slang term used that means wife or something.  This girl shows up like in the movie to help Rambo.  In the game everyone looks sorta real, or using human models, but oddly Rambos Waifu, I call her that since she looks like an Anime character, big eyes and all that.  Often she comments on how strong Rambo is, or how Manly he is, it is quite amusing actually, I was surprised she didnt shout out that Rambo must be very virile or she is looking forward to their masculine children.\n\nThe co-op hmmm well its the worst co-op ever made but its the most fun!  Rambo is a two player game so grab a friend and get ready to RAMBO together!  What makes the coop terrible is its local coop, meaning your playing with your friend next to you.  This game is a cover game like Time Crisis, or gears of war.  There is NO split screen, so if either player ducks to cover both players end up ducking, there is only one health bar, meaning once its gone both players are dead.  There is a thing called wrath in the game where you hit a button to trigger a period of time where you shoot enemies to get health,  if either player hits the wrath button, both players end up doing it.   Which can be real bad if its hit while one player is reloading and the wrath period ends before their done reloading.  What makes it the most fun, is due to these terrible mechanics it means talking, or yelling like a Rambo at your friend.  This game brings out the Rambo inside all of us.  especially when you lob a grenade only to have your friend duck as you pull the pin throwing the grenade at the cover watching it bounce back killing both of you.  This is very fun, and even better with beer, or other things...\n\n*Bridge-Tip: Turn off auto aim, Rambo doesnt aim he just shoots everything!  Before doing the last map, do the Trautmans challenges and get the E3 M60 Heavy machine gun, it will make the last map easy.  Also on timed parts like the helicopter battle, make sure to use the perk +25% damage to take out that helicopter easy peasy.  To level up fast, just keep doing the jailhouse break mission and get over 200k xp real fast since its just qte's, maybe a minute or so long.\n\nThis is a good party game with friends.\nRating:  9/10  Value:  $9.99\n\n\n*Looking at the forums, watching reviews online, people are shocked to find out the game they bought is an on rails game.\nHow would they ever have known it was an on rails shooter?\n1.  On the store page it says on rails shooter.\n2.  The developer spent time in the steam forums before launch telling people it was an on rails shooter...\n3.  This 3 month old interview the developer says the game is an on rails shooter: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVYh5Zee0gY .\n\nSome people say the screenshots don't look on rails.   When in game the gun is showing, if those screenshots were used it would be more confusing because then it would look like an FPS.  oh well, feelwithit...","February 24, 2014","true","14.4"," 31 of 231 people (13%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","13","31","231","3","11"

It's an 'on-the-rails' shooter, like Time Crisis and the age-old 'Operation wolf' (remember that), and doesn't pretend to be more. The graphics are nice, not mind-blowing but very decent, and the game has a silky smooth framerate. If you're expecting an openworld FPS then you're going to be disappointed, but if, like me, you are a fan of those ever-diminishing light-gun games, this is a worthy addition. My only real complaint is that it would clearly be better suited to using a light gun, and the pc version doesn't appear to have that option. Other than that it's good fun, and a good way of getting in some target-practice in preperation for any other FPS multiplayer games. Just know that you are buying a no-brainer rollercoaster of a game, not a shooter which requires to much of the old grey matter. It's just a bit of arcade-shooter fun!\n\n75%","February 21, 2014","true","0.8"," 39 of 288 people (14%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","14","39","288","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/austin_findley/recommended/274130/","austin_findley","Jewbacca","http://steamcommunity.com/id/austin_findley/","103 products in account","This game gets a lot of hate, but for what it is I think it is pretty great (perhaps because I may be one of the biggest Rambo fanboys in the entire universe.) Like many others I feel like the video shown on steam is about as misleading as an Army recruiter, but if you take a step back from all of your hatred for the game being a rail shooter you can take the opppurtunity to note that this type of game could be the beginning of an actually badass Rambo game that plays like Far Cry 3 does (please baby jesus let that happen) I will note the pros and cons in this game. Pros- Fun to play, Satisfying kills, Lots of different weapons, cool perks and skills, interesting twist on the movies, the ways you recover health is fun (especially the headshot perk), you get to slay a lot of bad guys, the weapons have huge magazine capacity, the quick time events are exciting (usually), decent enough graphics for a video game based of a movie (those usually suck much worse). and obviously this is the only Rambo game out there so shout out to the guys who actually made this little boys dreams come true (even though its not as good as it could be its a start). The Cons- Its a rail shooter. Its a rail shooter. Its a rail shooter. some of the QTE are awkward and some points which would be perfect for QTE do not have them, For some reason I killed some vietnamese dudes in Afghanistan? Most of the bad guys are exactly the same character models, same weapons, and same deaths; it makes the game rather repetive and I have to stoop and take a break. The cover system can sometimes be awkward (and pointless). Obviously not worth 39.99... more like 4.99-7.99. They take audio from the movie, which is great, but it sounds like ♥♥♥ and is not consistant with the rest of the games audio. It seems like they were really trying to make the game consistant with the movies, but when it comes to the characters they royally f**ked up. Rambo himself is not really up to par, Teasel and Colonel Ruskie man is completely different, neither of them had facial hair in the movie, why add it for the game??? WTF? Co Bao looks like an emo anime girl teenager, Gault is bald.. I mean seriously? At least try not to ♥♥♥♥ on my favorite movies ever. and last of my cons is that they left out some of the most memorable scenes from the movies, like when Rambo finds his way out of the caves in the first movie, when he gets hung up in the second, stick fighting in the third (although by this point in the game they have butchered the transition between First Blood Part 2 and Rambo 3). I think that this game would be much better if they had done it correctly as an open world RPG action/adventure like Far Cry 3, that plays through First Blood (Bonus points if it goes by the book, which is 100x better than the movie btw) FB pt 2, Rambo 3 and Rambo. I would play the ♥♥♥♥ out of that. Also, one more con that doesn't really have anything to do with the gameplay, but because I myself and in the Army, they really f**ked up the uniforms in the cinematic sequences. Those Berets look like a bag of ♥♥♥ and the soldiers are all wearing officer uniforms without ranks on the shoulder boards. The nameplates are blank, the medals and ribbons are decently placed, but could have been done better. Also if the soldier is wearing the special forces patch he should be wearing a green beret, not a black beret. Just a little sidebar that annoys me in videogames and movies.","February 22, 2014","true","4.5"," 17 of 202 people (8%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","8","17","202","4","0"
