You could be faster if you want, but why would you want that in such an eviroment? And i will defenetly go back and sink some more hours.\n* price 19,99 euro and wort every cent of it\n* only minor issues (get stuck some time, but could teleport out of it)\n* it runs really smoth with my gtx970. got no judder at all, even the big areas running great\n* besides the ending of "call of the starseed" thats to most epic experience at this time!\n* immersion is great\n\nnegatives\n* not many at all. All i could say would be nitpicking.\n* you have to be aware that this is an exploration game. There is not much to do, besides taking pictures, find your way, shooting flares and look out for things that will kill you. But like i said, thats not a bad thing.\n\nIf you are into a scifi setting, buy it. And if you are not, buy it anyway ;)\n","April 28","true","3.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

Now for this you can replay it as many times as you wish, take your time and walk around the world of imagination that this game is. There are many paths you can take, you can interact with the world around you, and more areas in development.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing, he somehow manages to capture the feel of a disney park ride, without even putting you on a track (well except for one point during the intro). Certain aspects of the game fill you with that wonder, reminds me of how I felt watching tomorrowland. Certain aspects of the unknown hidden deep in the caves of this game also prove, you can play a game not even remotly related to a horror genra with no jump scares, and still feel tense and nervous of whats around this corner.\n\nAlthough I praise it a lot, of coarse this game is definitly not without flaw. There are of coarse points you might get stuck (tip: teleport mode helps you get out), and there are definitly bugs (pun not intended).  This is an early access game and nowhere near the final product. There is limited gameplay, I havn't had time to play through all of it, but from videos it seems you can generally go for a couple hours and still discover new things you may have passed before. But dont let that worry you, this is definitly a game you can constantly go back to, and is a great demo to show those unfamiliar with VR. The whole atmoshphere and music really reminds me of those old retro space games you might find in an arcade, which is nice.\n\nNow if you are considering buying this, please do of coarse with anything you buy do some research. Watch a video and see if its worth it in your opinion, I know i hyped it up a lot, but just like any game the wonder I felt wont be shared by everyone. If you do watch videos, just dont watch too much so you can still feel suprised about whats waiting for you around the corner.\n\nJust dont go into this expecting a game, go into it expecting a VR experience","May 14","true","1.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The sense of wonder while roaming around in the exploration pod is quite tangible. I love how it slowly ramps up the experience in both scale and sense of danger. You'll see things both unexpected and familiar - but never on a scale that would exist in the real world. It's distorted and actually a bit scary at times. It feels like travelling in a very obscure piece of art.\n\nThe music and wind audio is the one thing that bothered me a bit, as mentioned in my other post. The music itself is good. Expressive and bombastic during moments of danger and then morphs into a more subtle vibe when exploring the caves. But I miss the silence. Silence is such an underrated concept in games. Imagine total silence during the cave lake sequences. Just you, the water ripples and the sound of the entities in the cave. I would love to experience that. I also found it odd that the wind sound effect seemed constant, even in the caves. Almost like it was part of the music and not the environment.\n\nI don't know where this experience will go from here. But from what I've seen it is certainly worthy of your time.\n\nPlayed on the Oculus Rift CV1.","May 1","true","1.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The music, while well produced, is absolutely everything except subtle.  It pounds you into submission without mercy or rest.\n\nThe visuals are reasonably good, and often times quite creepy.  But on the whole it felt more like a voyage through Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory than any "sciency" voyage into a possible realm...\n\nThe whole thing is rather on rails, making it an IO version of the Haunted Mansion at Disney except you control the speed of progress.\n\nOn my DK2 it was a bit laggy at most times.","May 11","false","0.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

Would prefer a real body for even more immersion\n- Can't upgrade "Brainpod", could use some crafting elements\n- Can't disable Xbox 360 force feedback, it's very strong, makes my hands numb and drains the batterys of my controller\n\nFor me, the game was worth it's money. If you like high immersive experiences mixed with some exploration, give this game a try. I'm really looking forward of what's coming up next for iOMoon from the very talented dev of this!","June 1","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
