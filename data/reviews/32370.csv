Knights of the Old Republic [KOTOR] takes place some 4,000 years before the events of A New Hope; Yoda, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker are names of no consequence in the Star Wars universe. You are in completely new, unfamiliar territory here.\n\nStar Wars fan or not, KOTOR is a game that everyone should play. A companion system ahead of its time, multiple storylines, rich dialogue and backstory, YELLOW lightsabers and a unique tactical approach to combat allow this installment in the Star Wars series of games to really shine.\n\n- Companions -\nYou will meet several unique, diverse characters in your travels; a few of them can join your party. Grab two party members of your choice and your main character and hit the streets (or dunes, or forests, or whatever). These characters come with set attributes and skills, but when they level up (yes, there is a leveling/experience system; this is an RPG), you control how they improve.\n\n- Story -\nNo spoilers here, don’t worry. There are a multitude of side-quests to complete that complement the main quest, backstories to explore for each of your party members, fascinating lore on the origins of a few prominent species and multiple storylines. Depending on dialogue decisions, you can earn either Light Side or Dark Side points, determining the final path your story takes.\n\n- Cons -\nNot too many of note. I clipped through the floor a couple times. A number of seemingly random fatal crashes. This game was put out in 2003, so it’s a little behind the times in visuals and the cutscenes are really cheesy. The camera is a bit tricky to figure out at first. If you’re not expecting tactical battles (give orders rather than do battle yourself), it can be quite confusing. The biggest thing is that your companions will, at times, slow down or stop when you’re not looking for no reason, preventing you from entering the next area.\nThe Bottom Line: None of these presents anything more than minor frustration; the game is well-built.\n\nWell, that’s all I have to say about KOTOR. An aged but timeless classic that any Star Wars fan (and quite a few non-Star Wars fans) will enjoy.\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended With Caution\nRecommended\nHighly Recommended\n- Recommended as Essential\n\n\nFun Facts:\nDeveloper: BioWare (Dragon Age: Origins, Baldur’s Gate, Mass Effect)\nRelease Date: July 18th, 2003\nSoundtrack Composer: Jeremy Soule (The Elder Scrolls, Guild Wars 2, Total Annihilation)\nProminent Voice Actors: Ethan Phillips (Star Trek: Voyager, Benson), Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect 3, Baldur’s Gate), Steve Blum (Wolverine and the X-Men, Metal Gear Solid)","July 25, 2015","true","59.8"," 277 of 290 people (96%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","96","277","290","18","4"

This is one of the greatest games ever.  An immersive storyline, interesting characters, great gameplay.  Despite its 2003 release date, and somewhat dated graphics, I still return to this game every so often to replay it.  Because of the branching story and different choices you can make (be evil, be good, kill this guy, steal this item, etc) each playthough is different.  I actually have a difficult time playing as an evil character because the game makes me feel bad about my decisions; very few games can do that!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/32370/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Before Mass Effect there was Knights of the Old Republic. Bioware, in 2003, decided to introduce a decision-making system which enabled you, the player, to align yourself with either the light or the dark side. Major plot decisions could be made and your gender could also yield different options during the conversations.\n\nThis is one of the things one can like in KotOR. The two different alignments enable you to have at least two different playthroughs. But you have many side missions anyway. Even the companions can give you some.\n\nThe world where the game takes place in shows us the previously unknown history of the Star Wars universe. A world that is 4,000 years before the films are taking place. You are awaken on a ship that is being attacked by Darth Malak. Your job is to escape, find companions, regroup and annihilate your archenemy. Of course, in the process you get to learn the Jedi way!\n\nDo note that the game is round-based. You pick the actions necessary (though this is limited each round) and you can even pause at certain points. You can also make a decision on behalf of your companions - the choice is really yours. What I have found out about the game later on is that it is based on Dungeons and Dragons rules. And the actions are calculated in accordance with these rules. As to how successfully the dice were rolled and what modifications were applied to the damages you are not told - but this is accessible from a menu.\n\nThe game has excellent music (composed by Jeremy Soule), a long-lasting experience and, well, I wanted to say good graphics, but as the game has aged in the last 10 years or so, this is not really true anymore. Still, the art design is as Star Wars-esque as it can get and this being a Bioware RPG I highly recommend it.

You are all of these things... and yet you are nothing. In the end, you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone."\n\n(This review contains spoilers.)\n\nThe original KOTOR has what I believe is the quintessential "Star Wars experience" out of all the franchise games released to date. Mixing the gold-standard Bioware gameplay and character arcs before they became overused and predictable, a focus on exploration and discovery, respect to the SW lore and a strong attention to world-building and detail, it's a game that still stands the test of time and is recommended for any fan of RPGs.\n\nAs much as I'm a fan of KOTOR II's cerebral, relationship-driven, "take every trope and turn it on its head" gameplay, I still think the first game is the better of the two. The mystery of who you are, what your relationship is to the squadmates and enemies you meet in the world and how you grow to encompass that reputation again (whether for good or evil) still sticks out in the post-KOTOR world of cookie-cutter games like Bioware's own The Old Republic, which only has a superficial understanding of the choice and consequence that went into the former.\n\nThe plot is fairly straightforward. You are an amnesic man (or woman) who wakes up aboard a starship, having been out for several days and coming to just as it is being attacked by the Sith. Narrowly escaping with pilot Carth Onasi, your pod crashlands on the city-world of Taris, where you begin investigating the circumstances that led to your foggy memory. Along the way, you'll pick up a starship (the Ebon Hawk) and meet crew members like the murder-happy HK-47 assassin droid, Jedi Masters Bastila Shan, Juhani and Jolee Bindo, Mandalorian soldier Canderous Ordo and Wookie renegade Zaalbar, among others. All this comes to a head as you uncover the true identity of the Sith leader Revan and assault a space station called the Star Forge in order to stop Darth Malak, the man who took up Revan's job and threatens to destroy the galaxy.\n\nThis game has some of the most "pure" Star Wars moments I can think of. The moment when you first step out into the Dune Sea, and see that vista all around you and the smoldering Sandcrawler in the distance. The trek through to the lowest levels of Kashyykk and the civil war going on between the various Wookie factions. The underwater walks under Manaan. The reveal of Revan, backed by that epic score.\n\nWhile the player being Darth Revan is a plot twist that is firmly in "It Was His Sled" territory as far as spoilers go, it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game one bit despite knowing about it long beforehand. There's so much content to see and do that it really felt like an enjoyable and fulfilling role-playing experience. Whether it's doing some of the sidequests (like getting involved in ruling family squabbles or doing assassination contracts) or just running through some of the areas, there's a wealth of material here for fans.\n\nIt's true that the storyline wanes a bit by the end (not counting the potential Dark Side twists like convincing Zaalbar to kill Mission or the Bastila reveal), but it still didn't mar my enjoyment, mainly because I brought a pair of squadmates specced out for long-range combat (Canderous and Juhani) and went in guns-a-blazing in the Star Forge.\n\nThe morality system can also be exploited to great effect (you can get to full Light Side or Dark Side in less than half of one playthrough), including doing things like maxing out your LS points than choosing Bastila's Dark Side option at the end to still remain "neutral" but get her as a squadmate for the Star Forge finale.\n\nIf there's one thing I hated about the game, it's the inventory system. You WILL pick up a lot of vendor trash in this game, and I found it was far easier just to dump or never pick up most of the gear I found, sticking to one weapon until I found something significantly better.\n\nIt's also much better to spec your character manually, because the auto-level system is nigh-useless and will often result in your character gaining abilities that either aren't class-specific or generally have no benefit to you.\n\nRegardless, KOTOR (and its sequel) still stand out among the best sci-fi RPG's in recent years, and the price point is a steal, regardless of whether it's on sale or not. If you haven't played it, you owe it to yourself to check this out.","July 30, 2015","true","48.7"," 230 of 274 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","230","274","12","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027999270/recommended/32370/","76561198027999270","Eifersucht18","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027999270/","133 products in account","“A Long Time Ago, in a Galaxy Far, Far Away…”\nA war rages between The Republic and The Sith. ‘Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic’ throws you head first into a fantastic recreation of the Star Wars universe filled with lightsabers, Sith Lords, and political intrigue, in an immersive, gripping tale of Good vs. Evil which - more than a decade on - stands tall as one of the best RPG’s of its generation, and probably the finest gaming interpretation of the iconic Star Wars franchise.\n\nCampaign: Released in 2003 by Bioware | Lucas Arts, and set 4000 years before the events in ‘Star War’s - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace’, ‘SW:KOTOR’ tells the tale of a relative unknown caught up in events of cosmic proportions. The opening credits thrust you into the midst of an inter-galactic battle between Republic forces and a Dark Sith Lord, which finds you crash landing onto an alien planet, trying to stay alive and escape an inter-planetary Sith blockade. An unusually strong connection with the Force catapults the player from by-stander to protagonist, as an engaging, story-fueled campaign takes you across the galaxy from the mysterious water-world of Manaan, to the desert planet of Tatooine among many others. A lovingly crafted universe is filled with lots of recognizable faces to include – the treacherous Hutt’s, Bounty Hunter’s, Sith, Jedi Knights, Wookies, Protocol Droids, Rancor’s, and Sand People - amongst a broader cast of nearly 300 distinctive alien races.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound: A Third-Person RPG in the classic mold, gameplay in ‘SW:KOTOR’ is built around the 4 pillars of ‘Character Development and Customization’, ‘Inventory Management’, ‘Combat’, and ‘Dialogue-driven Story-Telling’. You choose to play as one of three character classes (Soldier, Scout or Scoundrel – with both male and female options available), and then as one of three Jedi sub-classes (Sentinel, Consular or Guardian). A deep inventory system allows you to customize and equip your character with a multitude of clothing, weapon and armor options as well as assign XP to level-up in a variety of areas from Attributes, Skills, Feats, and Force Powers. Combat is based around the ‘D20’ RPG rule-set popularized in ‘Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)’, and while round-based, players are able to queue up actions and run them simultaneously in real-time. Finally, Character interaction is via a dialogue menu that is rumored to contain over 2000 lines of text, clearly geared toward maximizing player choice across multiple playthrough’s. While the broad strokes are seemingly representative of standard RPG fare, three elements serve to distinguish this title from the rank and file – 1.  The ability to switch to | customize | play as any character in your group provides for great overall variety 2. The campaign is well-paced with ‘Third Person’ gameplay broken up by ‘Rail-shooting’, ‘Stealth’, ‘Racing’, and ‘Gambling’ mini-games and 3. Deep customization options, lots of side-quests and the sheer glee of roaming the Star Wars universe adds great replayability to this title. Sound Design is also particularly noteworthy, with voice-acting, sound effects and background score composition all top-shelf. Well optimized K&M controls round out a well polished title.\n\nFlaws: There is little to gripe about here, and perhaps the game’s biggest ‘flaw’ is its dated graphics - which have not aged particularly well - but it’s a testament to the overall strength of this title that it remains not only playable, but immensely engaging, despite this. Other minor issues include somewhat repetitive combat, and some minor character pathfinding issues.\n\nOverall, ‘Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic’ is an erstwhile classic from another time, rich in Star Wars lore, with a deep, engaging campaign, a fantastic background score, compelling combat mechanics, high replayability and filled with iconic characters, plot twists, and moral complexities. This is a title you could easily lose yourself in for 50-60 hours on a single-playthrough, and that’s even before player-choice dictates your ultimate path to the Light or Dark Side. The Force is all around you, Padawan.

Great graphics for the time period and some of the most entertaining star wars lightsaber combat, beaten only by the Star Wars Jedi Knight series. Not to mention the STELLAR voice acting.\n\nWith the recent announcement of EA purchasing the patent for KOTOR 3, this is a great item to pick up to get you into the realm of KOTOR.\n\nBut how much could they have changed compared to the realm of star wars might you say? A but ton that's what.\n\nOk to start with, the game takes place 4000 years before the movies and revolves around a wide spread jedi council. You are , (with as few spoilers as I can manage to describe this in) travelling across a set of 8 unique planets and locations where you can interact with tons of sidequests.\n\nOne more entertaining sidequest (Non Main Story Spoilers) on Manaan where you act as a lawyer/detective and attempt to prove a man in court either innocent or guilty. Which winds up being a lot more fun than expected due to the depth of the investigation process and the trial interactions.\n\nHowever, I do have a few complaints about the game.\n\nFirst, the beginning sequence is AWFUL. The first time through it is entertaining to an extent, but if you want to start a fresh playthrough, you are often discouraged due to the length and lack of interest the beginning sequence holds. Once you are off Taris(the starting planet) however, the game's pace drastically improves. (Note: However there are mods to solve this issue should you find them necessary)\n\nAlso, the main character is unvoiced, while it is kind of nice not having to hear one or two voices for all of your characters, the addition of voice and voice editor would have made the game that much better.\n\nLet's also not forget the utter lack of animations. Let's see, the game has about 5 death animations, 2 talking animations and very ugly running animation. Leading to a severe lack of depth visually.\n\nAll other complaints I may think of are tiny things about the game that I take as a personal disliking based on taste, not anything that drastically affects the title.\n\nOverall, pick up this game if you like RPGs. You won't be disappointed in the slightest.","November 27, 2013","true","16.5"," 109 of 118 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","109","118","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/32370/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nKnights of the Old Republic (Also known as: KOTOR) is an RPG that BioWare developed in 2003. KOTOR implements conversational dialogue where choices are made between different interactions the main character can make various ethical decisions, solve puzzles, provoke, chastise, forgive, extort, and more.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You are a crew member of a republic ship named the "Endar Spire", after creating your character you awaken to find that your ship is under siege from the Sith forces, you need to use your class-specific-skills to slice, pew, or sneak your way past the Sith troops.\nAs you progress through the game there are probably HUNDREDS of sub-stories that you encounter, including 9 different characters with their own unique back stories. When it comes to story time, few do it as well as KOTOR.\nFor my fellow Star Wars Junkies, this game takes places during the "Old Republic" era, not long after the Sith wars (or Jedi Civil War). The lore on this game is very good, you get to visit Kashyyk, Korriban, Tatooine, Yavin, Manaan, Dantooine, and a few more KOTOR specific planets.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=446138566\n\nGame Play: This is the part where I stop praising the wonderful lore and story of the game... I have been replaying this game on steam, I had actually spend many hundreds of hours on this game when I was a kid... I had forgotten that the game is rather buggy, and your character gets stuck often.\nThere are ways to get around the flaws (teleport back to your ship, or switch characters and run as someone else), but the inconvenience is VERY obnoxious. Others may not encounter these problems, but my point is the game hasn't aged very well at all.\nBug's aside, the auto level up feature in the game is definitely suggested for beginners, however I was an idiot when I first played this game and would create characters who had skills they had no business in specking into. (For example; a soldier with high intelligence and focused on the persuasion skill)\nThe Game play really doesn't get rolling until after you've escaped the Endar Spire and Taris, then you get to chose between having Jedi, Droids, or range fighters by your side. The strategies in the game really start to shine once you get into situations you cannot win with default combat alone. (For example; trying to get off Taris without leveling up the main character... I had to heavily rely on grenades)\nSomething should be said for the detail and complexity of the combat system in the KOTOR series, if you don't want to learn how it works, just auto level up and you should be able to get through the story. (However, there are parts and fights that will elude you unless you get creative.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=429916767\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam achievements for  KOTOR, that doesn't mean there is no challenge or difficulty... Someday I'll need to try to speed run and/or try to see if I can beat it without my whole party wiping (game over).\n\nPrice: Knights of the Old Republic is priced at $9.99 that's a pretty fair price for most RPG's. Since this game is rather old, I would recommend waiting for a 50-75% off sale, I got my copy from a Humble Bundle. (Humble bundle was like "Heyyyy Atratzuuuuu, GiveUsYourMoney!" and I exclaimed "No! I'm trying to pay back college loans!" And Humble bundle retorted with "It's a Star Wars Bundle." And then I threw my wallet at my monitor...)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=446300039\n\nConclusion: I cannot speak for everyone, but this has always been one of my most favorite Star Wars games, even with the various bugs while running the game, I still intend to play through the game at least once via steam.\nThe game should easily take about 25-40 hours... depends on how easily you're side tracked... if you're a completionist like me you'll probably be looking closer to 50 hours, and then if you want to replay to help/screw the NPC's you screwed/helped, you can easily double your time spent.\n\nLet's put it in a simple pro's vs con's list:\nCons: graphics are old, characters get stuck, not much aesthetic customization, combat is more complicated than it needs to be, cheap tactics to get you to replay the game, screen resolution limitations, and lastly Bastila Shan and Carth Onasi as main characters.\nPros: HK-47 and Jolee Bindo... Trust me - they're awesome. Good story telling, skills/talents/stats are highly customizable, multiple endings and multiple endings to sub-stories, props for all the voice recording required for this game, and the appearance of familiar star wars themes/planets/factions.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update May 20, 2015:\nI recently turned on V-Sync in my graphic settings, and that has removed all "getting stuck" after combat and interactions. Which has already improved the game 100% (it's a pain switching characters, or saving and reloading to move again).\n\nUpdate September 17, 2015:\nAdded screenshots to review.\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords","April 27, 2015","true","29.9"," 68 of 75 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","68","75","12","0"

I was skeptical about the gameplay when I used to watch videos of this game but it works really well.\nYou have 20 levels to rank up jedi powers, combat skills and feats (your starting class determines which of these 3 categories gets the most points per level up). A jedi power available is force lightning, a combat skill is something like flurry which increases your number of attacks but they deal less damage and might not hit and a feat is which type of armour you can wear or other passive benefits.\nCombat is played on a turn-based dice roll system which might sound off-putting but works out well. Throughout the game you will meet characters who join you on your spaceship and you may choose 2 of them to accompany you outside of the ship. Companions will have their own stats, gear and skills so you can play around this (if you come across a companion with high lockpicking you might choose not to level your own and swap to this companion to unlock things for you). You can choose to level up your companions skills manually or automatically.\nYou can choose preset combat manoeuvres for yourself and companions such as ranged attacking or jedi support (buffs and heals) or you can choose to manually decide you and your parties actions by pausing the combat and assign attacks and items to a queue. You also don't have to use companions at all, you can elect to play in a solo mode where all the exp gained from enemies will go straight to your character. You also don't have to worry about this mode because companions will automatically be boosted to your level if you haven't used them.\nHow you play the game is up to you. I went for a dual-lightsaber character with light armour and attack bonus jedi powers but you can play as a sniper, explosives expert, jedi caster or even unarmed fighting.\nThe story is really what made the experience for me however. You will travel to multiple planets, gain your own starship, meet interesting characters and get to interact with almost every NPC you come across with multiple lines of dialogue and character development.\nOne downside to this game is that you can't play in a widescreen resolution without using mods (although guides can be found for this on the forums here on steam, along with HD mods and many others).","October 18, 2014","true","25.0"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","51","53","0","0"

It's not perfect and it can be argued if it aged well or not, but it's a lot of fun to play and has a great story if you let it suck you in.\n\nThe game itself follows the tried and tested D&D rules like many Bioware games, with this game using a variation of 3rd/3.5 Edition rules; at least that's what it reminded me of. Put simpler; Dexterity for guns, Strength for melee. Feats add to abilities, skills and the like and force users essentially get a magic bar and the choice of powers every few levels. There's also the use of the ever present Dark side/Light side choice in Star Wars. This is mainly to affect opinions of your team mates in some conversations, but it also provides cheaper Force use for certain powers if they conincide with your alignment (Spamming Lightning never became easier!). It's nice simple, it works. There are a few useless powers and feats, but really, that's subjective on my part and there's probably someone out there for every combination.\n\nAs for the atmosphere and world building, I won't go into too much detail. It's Bioware, by this point we all know that Bioware can excel at this. I will say though that by being set years before the movies, there's a nice chance to set up some new villains and situations that provide a nice background to everythgin; I'd say the whole story is a huge point in the games favour.\n\nLike I said though, the games not perfect. It's hard to ignore that the levels you visist are essentially successions of corridor after corridor. There's one path that reaches the end, sometimes you divert off it for secrets, but the apth is always there. The game tries to disuguise this, and I admit, it took me a while to catch on, but it's there, and hard to ignore once you notice. Not to mention, without spoiling it, the end game can feel a little sloggish with how it handles itself. It can be fun, but your first time, without expecting it, prepare for a lot of reloads.\n\nStill, despite all that, the game's a tonne of fun to play and I love to return to it once in a while. I'd easily say it's worth every penny and should be played by everyone at least once; wholeheartedly reccomended","December 20, 2014","true","88.7"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","36","40","2","0"

Even though the graphics are a little dated, it is worth the time.","March 29, 2015","true","95.9"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","44","54","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040024328/recommended/32370/","76561198040024328","The vintage feeling","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040024328/","97 products in account","General info\n~Genre: Role playing game\n~Number of players: 1\n~Star Wars related product\n~Completion time: 30-45 hours\n~High replay value\n\nStrong points\n+Variety: Visit places with different geological maps, inhabitants, natural characteristics. Even the “tutorial” planet (Taris) is distinct from the others. You won't find repeatable patterns in this game. Each place has its own story to tell. My advice: Don't rush; take your time and explore.\n\n+Music score: A plethora of modern games advertise the “quality” of their music. Mostly it's just a marketing trick. Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) is an exception. The developers put a lot of effort to capture their product's atmosphere in a music sheet. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD4YUEd18R0\n\n+Story: “Memorable characters” is a cliché. Numerous titles brand the term in their case cover but only a few actually deserve it. KotOR does. Don't take my word for it. Just try the game and see if Juhani, Jolee or Canderous won't leave a mark on you. This will be a tale about partnership, trust, love, hatred, grief, revenge, anger, maturity, and reckoning.\n\n+Liberating experience: This is a game of more actions that words. Albeit a role playing game, KotOR pushes players to be responsible and pick their own path. Every character has a background and follows a moral code. Your protagonist's choices will reflect upon your companions in more than one ways. Aid them and they will aid you back. Betray their trust and see what happens in the course of the story. The game allows you to be whoever you want to.\n\n+Grey: Despite being a Star Wars game, KotOR isn't a monotony of light and dark side choices. You can pick grey as easily as you can pick black or white. In that aspect it surpasses even the films in some instances. Are the Jedi the just order and Sith their everlasting evil counterbalance? Are the terms good and bad viable in such context?\n\n+Micro-management: Pause the action anytime and give your commands to any member of your team. Sometimes, such management is the difference between success or… reloading the game. Just press “Space” (by default) during combat.\n\n+Working bench: Forge weapons, enhance armor efficiency and even craft your own lightsaber piece by piece.\n\n+Blend in: Not a Star Wars fan? No problem, neither am I. The story takes you 4,000 years before the events of the first film trilogy. You will meet individuals never seen before and you shall witness how certain groups became infamous in after years. Even if you have never heard of Star Wars before, you will still be able to enjoy the game to the fullest.\n\n+Living in the parallel: Fan of Star Wars? This game is for you. You will recognise many familiar patterns. Be alert though: Darth Vader and Darth Malak despite playing a similar role in the two stories they don't necessarily serve the same purpose.\n\n+Side questing: Tired of mundane sidequests which involve killing massive amount of weak enemies, fetching items from borings NPCs and ultimately rewarding the player with useless items and questionable currency? From saving a captive spy to playing the attorney for the shake of an old friend, KotOR will make you remember each completed side quest.\n\n+Narration: KotOR is one of those games that utilizes your imagination to some extent instead of showing you everything through a cut-scene or an FMV. Listen to your teammates stories, close your eyes and imagine being there with them; in their old tales of youth and inexperience. Gaming as it should be.\n\n+Price: Even if you can't wait for a sale, buying it at full price worths it.\n\nWeaknesses\n-Old school dice: KotOR utilizes some mechanics which younger gamers won't recognize or are too lazy to study them for a few hours, such as invisible dice and hidden statistical factors. As a result, if you don't plan your character carefully you might be unable to finish the game. It is advisable to consult some guides before starting a new game.\n\n-Graphical issues: This game might be unplayable in Windows 7 or later versions. One common solution is to turn off the grass on graphic options and disable movies. If that doesn't fix the issue (as it did for me on Windows 8.1) consult the helping and friendly community here on Steam.\n\n-Limited customization: Unfortunately, the only body part that you are given a choice to meddle with (at the character selection section) is the face; not even the head generally. NPCs suffer from the same banality as well.\n\nMy rating4.5/5\nI'm not a Star Wars fan. Nevertheless, this game reminded me of how a proper title must be developed. Forget the flashy trailers and bright packages. This is gaming at its finest. After 20 years of gaming experience, I feel content to include this game amongst my favourites.","March 6, 2015","true","102.1"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","3"

I actually prefer it.\nThe story is gripping, the characters well-developed.\nIt really does it's job in inserting you into the Star Wars universe, and story wise I have no complaints.\nOne complaint I do have is the length of time you spend running around. It's at least seventy percent of the game.

Nach ca 10 Jahren sah ich das die Star Wars Collection im Angebot ist und hab natürlich zugeschlagen. In dieser Box war zu meinem Glück SW:KotoR 1 & 2 dabei und dachte mir sofort das ich sie unbedingt wieder spielen muss !\n\nSW:KotoR 1 ist damals wie heute einfach ein RPG MEILENSTEIN, das Spiel hat eine wirklich sehr gut geschriebene Story die ein jedesmal von neuem fesselt egal wie oft man das Spiel durchspielt. Nach jedem Playthrough finde ich immer wieder Quests und Dialoge die ich noch nie gesehen hab.\n\nSo jetzt noch eine kurze erklärung vom Spielverlauf:\nMan erstellt sich am Anfang vom Spiel ein Charackter. Man wählt die Klasse aus verteilt paar Talentpunkte, bestätigt und es folgt Star Wars typisch ein kleines Intro die, die Handlung vom Spiel kurz erklärt. Man startet auf einem Raumschiff das sozusagen als Tutoriallevel funktioniert, in dennen die Spielemechaniken erklärt werden.\nDie Kämpfe sind Rundenbasiert wärend man sich auf Nah- oder Fernkampf spezialisieren kann. Dabei wird man immer mit 2 weiteren Charackteren begleitet die man im Verlauf des Spieles findet. In dem Spiel gibt es eine Gut-Böse Mechanik, sprich alles was man tut oder nicht tut hat Folgen auf den Verlauf des Spieles.\n\nNun folgt noch eine kleine Warnung:\nDas Spiel ist frustrierend verbuggt auf Windows 7, ohne gewisse Einstellung und Fixes die man sich aus dem Internet zieht crasht das Spiel fast nach jedem neuen Level (Planet).\n\nDeswegen möchte ich noch einmal einige Tipps mitgeben die mir beim spielen geholfen haben:\n\n- Im SW:KotoR Ordner gibt es eine Datei die "seconfig.exe" heißt, dort müsst ihr unbedingt die Hardware-Maus deaktivieren.\nWenn bei euch das Spiel crasht wenn eigentlich eine Video abspielen sollte, müsst ihr leider die Videos deaktivieren.\n\n- Im selben Ordner gibt es eine Datei die sich "swkotor.ini" nennt dort geht ihr unter "[Graphics Options]" und stellt "FullScreen=1" auf "FullScreen=0". Ausserdem fügt ihr "AllowWindowedMode=1" in der untersten Zeile von [Graphics Options] ein. Diese aktiviert den Fenster Modus des Spieles, da es im Fenstermodus weitaus stabiler läuft.\n\n- Hier nochmal ein Video auf Englisch der das hier alles nochmal erklärt + einem Fix zum downloaden : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6QE4WB1y14\n\n- Das alles fixt jedoch nicht eines der nervigsten Bugs im Spiel: nach einem Kampf kommt es vor das der Charackter sich nicht mehr bewegen kann. Das liegt daran der er noch im Angriffsmous steckt obwohl keine Gegner in der nähe sind.\nWas dagegen hilft:\n* Wenn du Glück hast ist noch ein Gegner in der Nähe die diesen Bug beheben können.\n* Manchmal hilft es einfach mit einem Bgleiter kurz zu reden.\n* Aber am effektivsten ist es einach zu speichern un neu zu laden.\n\nDas sind wirklich die einzigen Bugs die man merkt und wer über sie hinwegsehen kann, dem erwartet ein grandioses Rollenspiel der bis zu 40 Stunden pro Spieldurchlauf fesselt.\n\n\n","May 17, 2014","true","35.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","2"

It isn't just a great RPG or a great entry of the Star Wars universe, but is also and quite simply a great video game that can be enjoyed by a wider audience than just RPG and Star Wars fans.\n\nStory is an EXTREMLY important part of this game, and a highlight to that as well. You are a Republic soldier on a ship called the Endar Spire, and your goal is to escape before the Sith destroy it. You crash land on the planet Taris, and your adventure unfolds through exploration, character-development, and revelation. Choice is present in this game as well, adding replay-value as well. I cannot give away much about the story without spoiling the game, and it is best to experience it for yourself. Personally, I had no qualms with it, and the game stays true to the Star Wars universe while adding flavours of its own. The setting of 4000 years prior to the movies also makes it so you can appreciate the story without any past knowledge of Star Wars. I would even dare to say that this game easily triumphs over the stories of the movies.\n\nHow about gameplay? It is a turn-based game with many different weapons (from ranged to melee), powers and abilities that can be disposed against the enemy, and thankfully this game has a lot of different foes to defeat. The layers of strategy are quite endless, as you always have two squad-mates present at any time. Do you charge into battle while they cover you with gun-fire? Do you all throw grenades to make quick work of your foes? Difficulty options are also present, which are nice as some weapon configurations can allow you to be a god while others will leave you crying for mercy. Luckily with squad-mates, this is really a non-issue. There are also side activities, called swoop racing and pazzak, which are fun side games that provide replayability.\n\nAlso a side note, but combat can be paused to issue commands, and you watch the action unfold. Modifiers can allow you to deal more/less damage, and you can even miss, as the game has a dice-roll mechanic in its turn-based formula.\n\nAs for graphics, the game is clearly dated by today's standards. In terms of art style, this game is spot on. It retains Star Wars' signature look and style, and developer BioWare has added their own flair and style to it, making the game stand out in this department, and being memorable to that. This can also be said for the sound, which is indentical to what you would expect from the franchise. Lasers to lightsabers all sound spot-on, and both the soundtrack and voice work are fantastic as well.\n\nIn terms of replayability, the great story and presence of choice already make it a game that you can put multiple playthroughs into. There are also many side quests and lore that you can delve into, and maybe you'll see something that you didn't see before on a second or third playthrough. Even the gameplay can offer up different experiences depending on how you play. My run of the game was about 31 hours, and this was ignoring most side-quests, so you will find your money's worth at $10.99, especially if this game goes on sale.\n\nHonestly, this is one of few games I can say I didn't have any personal issues with. Others may differ in opinion, but to me KOTOR was flawless. If you're a Star Wars or RPG fan, this game is a MUST BUY. I'd strongly reccomend it to anyone, however the combat mechanics may turn some off, especially if you loathe RNG. However, in this particular game it comes off as natural and is perfectly fine, unlike the TES III Morrwind combat system, as it is turn-based. If I had to rate this game out of 10, it would definitely be a 10/10, but like every game it does have mechanics that have the potential to be even better.\n\n","September 2, 2015","true","33.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

So why would I play this game if I have plenty of hours on my other games? There's a simple reason for this.\n\nBioware. Yes, the timely company turned EA division, makes this game great.\n\nWhile this game will prove a challenge for people who want non-stop action, this classic title has to be one of the most solid RPG games, if not PC titles ever made. Before I got a Steam account, I played this game with CDs (yes real CDs).\n\nThere's actual content to the story, and the plot is well thought out and executed. Your actions will have consequences, and will either lead you down to the light or dark side of the force. Beyond just simple dark vs. light, the game offers other ways of having a unique experience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480619533\nUsing your repair and computer skills, you can clear rooms filled with enemies, or fix up and alter a robot to fight for you. Want to avoid enemies? There's a stealth skill for that. Want to avoid fights in a bar? The persuasion skill is your go to skill. Maybe you even want to have the most powerful force powers available to you? There's a way to go about that as well. The only limiting part of the game is base story, which should be entertaining and engaging. It can be a little dry, as there is a lack of humor, but this title does very well considering its ESRB rating (Mass Effect isn't in the same boat).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=436449755\nAs always, it wouldn't be a Bioware game without companions. Each offers something unique, and will progress your back story which isn't mandatory.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=481536576\nDownsides? Well every game has some which isn't surprising. For being an old title, the graphics are very simple. If you failed to notice the processor requirement of an Intel Pentium 3, then I'm not sure what to say. There's nothing you can really do to improve the graphics of the title, but there are certainly ways to modernize them. By default the game is only compatible with a 4:3 ratio monitor. By using third-party utilities, you can resolve this and get a better experience with a now standard 16:9 monitor.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427275987\n\nBeing an old school game, it does have all the “attributes” available. Yes, you will have to micro manage things like points in “wisdom” and “dexterity”. If you want to avoid all of that, play with the “auto upgrade” button. The game does also have a “dice roll” system, where there are chances to miss/hit and not do complete damage. Mass Effect 1 carried on from this, in case you were wondering where that game got its mechanic from.\n\nAll in all, this title should impress you for being so old, yet being so solid. Why games aren't being made like this anymore, who knows..","July 14, 2015","true","34.5"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","16","21","4","0"

The ability to choose to gravitate towards the Light or Dark side of the Force is fantastic; as is the ability to choose Force powers to go with your choice (ie. Light side powers involve buffing, Dark side powers have things such as Choke and Force Lightning). Obviously the Dark side is a lot more fun, simply due to the dialogue options you have available, the ability to earn a lot more coin and the joy of choking your enemies.\n\nGreat game.","October 18, 2014","true","53.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Bugs everywhere! (Saving often and in different slots is highly recommended)\n- Camera and movement\n- Neutrality is punished here\n\nREVIEW\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a well-acclaimed RPG made by Bioware. Its action is set 4000 years before the Galactic Empire. The war between the Republic and the Dark Sith Lord named Malak is raging. The protagonist is merely a Republic soldier at first, but, as the story progresses, he/she starts to play a much more important role. It turns out that the main character has a strong connection to the Force and has to train as a Jedi.\n\nThe player can choose between three classes for the protagonist: Soldier (expert in combat), Scoundrel (rogue), Scout (jack of all trades), and, later on, 3 Jedi classes: Guardian (focus on lightsabre combat), Consular (focus on Force powers), and Sentinel (jack of all trades). Every class has its own strengths and weaknesses and require a different approach so choose wisely.\n\nThe main hero will not travel alone. There are a few characters who will join him on the journey. Every companion has a story and motives behind them so it is worth to talk with them. Moreover, they add yet another layer to the rich plot.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on doing quests, visiting planets, levelling, and, of course, combat. The game's mechanics are based on D&D 3.5. Fortunately, it is made accessible even to the players who are new to RPGs. There is a huge variety of skills, feats, and Force powers at your disposal which definitely contributes to longevity of the game. Most of the time, the player leads a small group (with up to two companions) and ventures forth. All characters are controllable and while they seem to do well enough on their own, there are issues with pathfinding and sometimes the characters get stuck. This is particularly noticeable in locations with tight corridors.\n\nThroughout the game, the player will have make many decisions. The choices can have a huge influence on the outcome. This is one of the biggest strengths of the game. Speaking of the freedom of choice, the player is able to choose between the light and the dark side as they see fit. Earning light side points make using the light Force powers cost less and using the dark ones cost more and vice versa. This is one of the first games where being the bad guy is just as doable as being the saviour of the Galaxy. While remaining relatively neutral is possible, it is not a very viable choice. For instance, there are some items which are restricted to either side of the Force spectrum. Moreover, the player more often than not will be forced to join one side of a conflict or to take some action. Be wary of your choices, for the Galaxy is at stake!\n\nSaving the Galaxy (or dooming it to fall) can be exhausting. Worry no more, for there is a lot to do in your free time. Apart from a myriad of side-quests, there also are minigames, namely pazaak (blackjack on steroids) and swoop racing. Not only they are enjoyable but also can give you extra credits.\n\nHowever, there are some serious technical issues. The game is utterly crawling with bugs*. For instance, it is not an uncommon occurrence when the dialogues start to skip. Restarting the game and reloading a previous save seems to help, but it is a glitch worth mentioning. What is more, teammates may sometimes stop attacking the foes. While I have not found any gamebreaking bugs, it is very sensible to save often and in different slots** just in case. Speaking of downsides, I am not particularly fond of the camera and movement. It is not bad per se, but it may take a while to get used to. And last but not least, there are few Aliens' dialogue lines so they get extremely repetitive after some time.\n\nConcluding, this is one of the best RPGs I have ever played. Its compelling plot alone makes it outstanding and the decision-making adds to its replay value. If you do not mind dated graphics and are able to get past the technical issues, the game will reward you with a memorable experience. They just do not make games like they used to... A 9.5/10.\n\n\n*Yes, I am aware it's a terrible pun. I apologise.\n**Yes, you've heard it right: you can save whenever you want and in different slots. It used to be an "industry standard" back in a day. No silly checkpoints and such. The saves are stored on your HDD.\n\nP.S.

The first thing to note is that the game is quite buggy, crashes occur at random and minimizing will periodically result in a crash as well. There are not enough auto saves in the game so SAVE OFTEN. This will prevent some serious frustration. The second thing to note is that the start of the game can be difficult to sink your teeth into. You may find your interest is not aroused immediately, just remember to give it time. I had to put the game down several times at the beginning as my interest waned. Come back with a fresh mind and push through and you will soon find the game much more immersive and rewarding after you contend with the beginning.

This game (+Star Wars Galaxies) made me like the Star Wars franchise and watch the movies. You could compare Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic to Mass Effect, also made by Bioware.\n\nWhat makes SW:KOTOR such a great game to me is without a doubt the story. The choices you (have to) make, good vs bad, light side vs dark side and one of the best endings I've ever seen in any game. Most of the npc's are interesting and you build relationships with them, as the story progresses.\n\nObviously, the graphics have aged over the years but It still manages to make the Star Wars universe feel alive. For example, there are space ships flying around, even though they only consist of a few pixels, you still know what they are and makes the world feel more alive.\n\nCombat is semi turn-based and often relies on tactical thinking. You are able to play KOTOR in real-time but you will probably die often.\n\nLike I said before; Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic, mainly relies on the story. Unless you are a real Star Wars fan, this game is not recommended for players who rather have great combat but for anyone else this game is one everyone should have played, before they are dead.\n\n\n","March 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

However, as kid I played this on the original Xbox back in the day. So trust me on this.\n\n1.) This game is by far my favorite in the Star Wars series, it's unique RPG style was unlike any game at the time (at least for me.) The choices you made in-game defined your character from the Jedi, Sith or even the interesting/unique Grey jedi and each choice could impact in small/ large ways the overall outcome of the story and your companions which makes for a lot of replay value.\n\n2.) The story (without spoilers of course) is very compelling and complex with many new challeneges as you progress further and even a few twists and turns that keep the story exciting and not dragged out. The characters are interesting and fun to learn more about once you start forming bonds with them through your adventures.\n\n3.) Turn based combat which is interesting and though wasn't my favorite style of combat, the formula for this game just feels right and flows well for what it is. It makes weapon modifications, skills and talents, armor and modifications and even the choice of companions important based on the enemies you may face in each and every encounter.\n\n4.) Just buy this game! it's worth it. If you like a game where you create your own path, then make one in this beautiful universe of Knights of the Old Republic.

Ever since the original Star Wars trilogy ended 30 years ago we have been given lackluster successors to the trilogy in both film and video game. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game that really captures the narrative sense of adventure and good vs evil that made the original three films such joys to watch. (SPOILERS AHEAD) The characters you interact with are for the most part a very strong point of the game. Carth is a tortured character you really to have to spend a lot of time to understand. Bastilia is a gifted Jedi who is attempting to be the emotionless patient Vulcan-like Jedi we have come to known in the prequel films which makes it all the more fun to really get her angry at you. Mission Vao and Zaalbar are basically Chewbacca and Han solo if Han was a 13 year old girl. Jolee Bindo is one of the more interesting Jedi you’ll ever encounter; he’s not a member of the Jedi order and dodges any attempts you make to probe his character. Canderous Ordo is a perfect specimen of a Mandalorian (the human version of Predators) and is a combat veteran. You get two droids on your adventures, T3 who is basically R2-D2 and my favorite companion HK-47, a assassin droid who refers to all non droids as “Meatbags” and who you’ll learn is responsible for the deaths of all his previous masters. Oh and if you run into someone called “Juhani” just kill her, it saves you a lot of time. The Combat of this game is turn-based and as you gain more levels you are able to spec into a variety of different abilities which will give you new options when it comes to fighting enemies. However the calling card of this game is the story (MAJOR, GAME RUINING SPOILERS AHEAD). The game leads you to believe at first you are a Republic (insert class here) stationed on a ship orbiting Taris and it is up to save the galaxy by rescuing the Jedi leader of the ship’s expedition who was lost on the planet following an attack by the main enemy of the game Dark Malak. You then learn after you escape the planet you learn that you are gifted and can learn the powers of the Force. You take this as simply coincidence and continue on your journey to stop Malak (M. NIGHT SHAMALYAN SPOILERS AHEAD, LAST CHANCE TO TURN BACK). However in one of the greatest plot twists in video games, you learn that your character is actually “Darth Revan” the former master of Malak whose memory was changed by the Jedi Council. Now while this game is my favorite of my all time favorites it does have its faults. There are extra quests in the game that are just not do able unless you so happen to do planets in exact orders, the first two planets (Taris and Dantooine) are major drags to get through and are not the most enjoyable things to get through. Despite this, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is the greatest Star Wars game to exist and is easily worth the 10 dollars.\n","November 27, 2013","true","192.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is an excellent game, and a great RPG in the vein of other Bioware RPGs. Mechanically, it is a little dated and can take some getting used to, and the early portions of the game can drag a little bit, but once you get to the meat of the game, it's one of the best RPGs of all time, and a truly, truly excellent game.\n\nIt's been some time since I played through it, so I'm afraid the details have faded, but it's really a must-play for fans of the genre or of Star Wars. It's one of the best Star Wars properties which has ever been made, and it's a great game that stands up even a decade later.","March 2, 2014","true","35.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This game, which produced a metascore rating of 93 out of 100, takes you into the Star Wars universe, and lets you "run free." You can choose the path you which to take, whether it be the light side or the dark side, and you can decide which planets you wish to visit. Along the way you will encounter new characters and aliens, some of whom will even join your party. KOTOR is a game for those who enjoy long, deep stories that let you truly decide who your character becomes. It has an incredible soundtrack created by Jeremy Soule, who later went on to compose the soundtrack for multiple games, including Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim of the Elder Scrolls series, and the Harry Potter video game series. If you're looking for a first person shooter or a game with intense combat, this game is not for you. The combat is primarily turn based, and can take some getting use to. However, if you are looking for an RPG that you can immerse yourself in and play for the story, then Knights of the Old Republic is the RPG for you.","December 9, 2013","true","14.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The PC graphics are slightly better 2. The mods you can download are AMAZING and 3. I just had to.. its star wars okay I just had to, So lets get started with this review and firstly lets talk about the gameplay.\n\nGameplay: At first it took me sometime to get used to playing this on PC with the mouse and keyboard but I adapted quickly to it and to be perfectly honest I prefer playing it this way than on the Xbox simply because it is sooo much easier to click on which enemy you want to attack rather than scrolling through each enemy with a gaming controller and also navagating the menu's on PC is highly superior and its pretty obvious why. The combat in this game is fun most of the time as you would issue a command and your characters will carry out that command without you having to mash buttons or whatever kind of like a Final Fantasy game but in more of a real time than that, but at times it can be very repetitive and enemies can just get annoying as it feels like they are stopping you from carrying out the story but this is just a minor grip with the gameplay as most of the time I felt very happy with the combat its just certain areas in the game the enemies get a little tendious (Damn Khath Hounds.)\n\nStory: Well this is definetly the strongest part of the game as it is a Bioware game (Known for  the Mass effect series, Dragon Age and Jade Empire) and when you buy a Bioware game you know the story is going to be good and in this case the story is DAMN GOOD. I won't give anything away story wise but something happens later on that made my jaw drop. Overall story wise this game has a ton of sub plots as well such as the characters you interact with that come along with you on this journey all have their own back stories that mostly impact the main plot in some way and are also very interesting (well mostly).\n\nGraphics: The graphics of this game are very good for its time and I think they still hold up today I mean it is a dated game so its not going to look amazing but with some extra mods you can download the game looks even better and theres nothing bad I can really say about this.\n\nOverall verdict: Well I would say if you enjoy games that are heavily focused on story and if you love Star Wars (who doesn't) this is a must buy.","February 26, 2014","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/32370/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","his WRPG brought to you by Bioware was a stunning release for its time and playing it really shows you where their newer games have come from. But how does it stand up to some of the standards set by their newer RPGs? Pretty well, in fact; however, there were some pretty major annoyances and some issues I did have with the game. For starters, I just got done playing Planescape: Torment, and that WRPG (released 4 years earlier) had infinitely better decision making paths than KotOR did. I recognize that this *may* be due to the confines of working in the Star Wars universe: you have the Dark Side and the Light Side - each contrary to the other, but really I felt it could have been done better. Your options in KotOR seem to boil down to A) I'm going to help you out or B) I'm going to be a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Example: You are in the slums and you have the ability to save a race of people for light side points. The dark side path is you can sell them out to some junk dealer because he wants to keep his profits up *for a measly 100 credits*! Just to let you know, that's not a lot of credits. And if you don't pick a side and want to stick in the middle path then guess what, no awesome light/dark side affiliated equipment for you sir! Speaking of roleplaying, if you decide you want to roleplay as a blaster user then you're going to have a bad time. As I said, I just got done with Planescape and I figured, "why not go a charasmatic path" like I did in that game. Well, KotOR thinks it's fun to throw you into 1v1 duels quite frequently, and if you don't have a lightsabre or focus on combat you're going to have some serious aggravation. Eventually I got through them and carved a niche for myself by spamming the Insanity and Force Wave abilities. Those abilities got me all the way through the final boss of the game, so another complaint I would have is game balancing - whether it's combat, dialogue choices to avoid battle, or other ways to accomplish things, I think this game could use a once-over. Some of the characters were also a little one-sided, not just regarding light vs dark side, but wholly uninteresting. Take T3-M4 for instance. Yes, it's a droid, but R2-D2 had a personality and T3-M4 doesn't, which is disappointing and I can only attribute it to laziness. The game is also a little glitchy. My characters ended up getting caught in doorways quite often and during conversational cutscenes sometimes weird things would happen - eg holding invisible weapons. A few final annoyances were whenever you suit up (either underwater or in outerspace) you walk stupidly slow and every time you travel from planet to planet the cutscenes are recycled and you end up playing the same repetitive "space battle" minigame. KotOR also has bad and unfrequent quicksave times (spam that F4 key!). The inventory was also quite a mess, a lot of wasted screen real estate in the menus and it was nigh impossible to determine exactly what items you receive as quest rewards.\n\nWhile the above may seem like a long list it really didn't effect my enjoyment *too* much (except for those 1v1 duels, ugh) and the game has a lot of merit to it. There are many fun and challenging puzzles, the music is phenomenal, using motiffs we know and recognize from Star Wars that weave seamlessly in and out of original material that keeps the nostalgia flowing, and the controls are quite good, allowing you to mostly play with your mouse hand only. And, most importantly, the story was excellent. I was really impressed overall with the narrative and felt empathy for most of the characters in my party (I really loved the other droid you get as well, meatbags!).\n\nPros:\n\nNarrative\nCharacterization\nMusic\nLots of character customization\n\nCons:\n\nLack of "good" character customization from protagonist\nA little too "black and white"\nSome annoyances (see above)\n\nAll in all it was a memorable journey that I would recommend you try if you like Star Wars or Bioware/WRPGs but it falls short of my "must play" stamp of approval.

This game might be old now, but its still one of the best RPG's ever made. Star Wars might be a tainted franchise in alot of ways, having produced alot of garbage and many terrible games. But some is good... and some is great, and this is one of the great things.\n\nGameplay wise, it came between Baldur's Gate and Mass Effect, and you can see traces of both games in this one (the "dice" combat from BG and the dual morality and third person gameplay of ME). A few parts of the game are a bit slow, most of all in the beginning, but the later areas more than make up for this. And story... well, you will have to see that for yourself. No spoilers from me! It's one of the best in any RPG, with plenty of interesting characters to go with it. Especially that... droid. You will know which one when you meet them.\n\nThis game pretty much always gets hugely discounted during major sales, so if you don't have this one you may as well pick it up cheap and check it out.

There is a nice twist and it gives you some clues along the way. I can't say too much more without spoiling it.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to other games like Baldur's Gate, but at a closer third person view and with a smaller party. Don't expect an open world, as areas are very small and closed off. In the late game you will find yourself wanting to stack your party with jedi with the heal and flurry abilities. Since you have little-to-no control over whether you hit, how you hit, or how you get hit, bosses end up being punching bags. They ignore your control abilities with saving throws and your heals can typically out-heal any damage they deal out. Your lightsabers also protect you well from blasters and other melee enemies die very quickly.\n\nCharacters are good. I thought I could romance a twi'lek who turned out to be 14. One is a conspiracy nut and a certain old man likes to use jedi mind tricks. For once, I actually liked getting involved with characters and knowing their backstory, whereas I am usually interested in the backstory of the world.\n\nThis game is a steal for $10. Graphics don't matter in this game. Gameplay holds up, but try to avoid min-maxing to avoid makign the game too easy. Try to roleplay a little with your party coomposition. Buy this game for the story and the characters. 8/10.\n","July 19, 2015","true","34.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has space travel, your own starship, multiple characters for party choice, an optional Solo Mode, great "pause-then-set-tactics-then-attack" battle system, a proportional storyline / quest with multiple side quests, great weaponry / armor / droid customization / lightsabe customization / armor customization, fully outfittable party members, auto-leveling (if that's your kind of thing), epic battles between Sith and Jedi, full scale path choice (can go either Light Side or Dark Side), great writing and voice acing and much, much more!\n----------\nI, for one, am very glad that I spent the $9.99(USD) for this game, as I have played numerous Star Wars franchise titles, including all the Lego Star Wars titles (even the Lucas Arts X-Wing title for the Sega 32X system add-on for the Sega Genesis), and I would have to say that besides Star Wars: Republic Command, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is by far my favorite title, thus far. It provides me with enough of a challenge, but not too much as to turn me into Bantha fodder and even adds some great references to the saga itself along side of some great antics and enough humor to make even a Jawa laugh.\n----------\nA definite "Must Buy" for any Star Wars Fanboy or Fangirl!","July 22, 2015","true","40.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have played everything from Super Mario RPG, all the way up to FarCry 4 and Fallout New Vegas, no game gives me a feeling, no, a sensation of feeling like a total badass like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. bonus points given due to it being made by Bioware.\n\nBasic storyline: This game is set some 4,000 years before the original trilogy, during this time, the Sith are trying to take over the entire galaxy, just like your average bad guy corporation, after you spend thirty or so minutes of game time aboard a ship that should've been destroyed by the time you first opened your eyes, you already will have the basic controls down. After a few hours, you will get the force, despite this. I still tended to stick with the tried and true rifle-type weapons, even though the lightsabers, which come in dual, short and standard types, are incredible to look at and use,\n\nRPG Elements: The greatest asset in this game, to me, is the ability to modify certain weapons and armour, including lightsabers and Jedi Robes that turn you into a walking laser sponge, the addition of a conversation system was one of the first examples I've seen, and was used later just as innovatively in the Mass Effect series.\n\nFinal thoughts: I love this game, it's light-hearted, but can be serious at the same time. I never had as much love for the second KoTOR game, because it didn't feel like the same game, if you're either a veteran of RPG's or are a kid just starting their journey into the gaming world, this is one of my personal top picks, it's fun, it can run on a potato, and for the hardcore Star Wars fan, it holds a little surprise from the comic series.","July 27, 2015","true","41.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I deeply regret having to not reccomemend it, but THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. Whether it's because of steam or that's it's old as hell, whenever I even start up the game it has probably about a 5/10 chance of getting to the main menu screen and a 1/10 chance of being able to use the menu screen without it frozen. To make it better, even when you get in game during normal cutscenes you have about a 1/2 chance of crashing and during a specific cutscene for me (the one where you leave Taris) I've only once got through it without crashing the game and am stuck since I can't continue on without crashing. I've probably started up and turned my computer off and on accurately about 35 times total, not even an exaggeration, just to get the game to work/start up. My pc has a htx 960 and an i5 intel core proccessor, so it isn't that I'm on a potato either.

Set 4,000 years before the Galactic Empire, you are a Republic Soldier stuck in a war against a newly formed Sith Empire lead by former Jedi heroes, whose steps you retrace in an attempt to discover the source of their military power.\n\nPros: Nice story that explores the ages before the modern Star Wars setting, back when the Republic was half its size and most of the Galaxy was yet to be mapped. You are joined by a cast of up to 8 additional characters, up to 2 can join you at a time. You can travel to 5 different planets (with different environments, creatures to fight, and equipment to buy for you and your party). Different encounters or quests might unlock depending on which side character is in your party at a given time. Some items are upgradable standard enhancement parts, others are fully customizable such as lightsabers. Multiple side quests allow you to delve on which side of the force you want to be in. Oh, and the story has a great twist!\n\nCons: The graphics didn’t age too well, many objects and characters look very polygony. If you’re not familiar with tabletop RPGs and the D20 system, you can easily get confused of how the mechanics work when selecting weapons, upgrades and other equipment. Character creation is limited, at least by today’s standard, where you pick from a dozen pre-gen faces among 3 different classes to begin, then among 3 jedi classes. Each planet has a very linear map, with a few outbranching paths, again contrasting with today’s standards.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list\n\nIf you’re not a fan of Star Wars, you probably won’t see the appeal of this game. Otherwise, it’s one of the best installments of the games. The game isn’t too lore-heavy, allows both light and hardcore fans to enjoy the settings and game. I recommend giving it a try, it’s worth the price!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","November 14, 2014","true","45.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's hard, I tell you what. But I'll give it a shot, regardless.\n\nMy first experience with Knights of The Old Republic was on the original xbox, back in the year of 2004. And my only memories from it are good ones, walking on the bottom of the sea on the ocean world of Manaan, or wandering around amongst the trees of the wookie planet of Kashyyyk all made you feel incredible due to the great sound-design and beautiful (at the time) visuals. The gameplay can feel a bit slow and sluggish by todays standards since it's not superfast and pulse pounding the way some games are, but that's not what it was about, and frankly, I rarely cared so much about the gameplay in this title because of the fact that the story, the characters and the setting is what brings this puppy home. It's safe to say that what Bioware created with this title was a game of the ages, something that would stand the test of time forever, and proudly so. When people place this game on their "Best games of all times" list, they do not do it for any other reason than the one that it is a god damn good game.\n\nThe story will take you far and wide, beginning with your character (which you can customize, male-female, caucasian/hispanic/african etc) waking up on board of a republic ship that is under attack by Sith forces, for you who don't know, the sith are the "bad" guys. In the spirit of spoiling as little as possible, you end up on a city-planet called Taris, where you have to take on an underground crime syndicate, join a swoop race (kind of like floating motorcycles) and take out a crimeboss. All while doing this, you will meet companions who joins your party. The companions are varied, and extremely well fleshed out, and they all have good voice-actors (admittedly some better than others).\n\nBy the time you're done on the world of Taris, you will have spent about 3-6 hours in the game, depending on how much time you spent doing sidequests, exploring and talking to your companions. And that's just the first "major world" that you get to visit during your main quest, which I shall not spoil for you! Regardless, you have several more worlds to visit during your quest, and the game can take you anywhere from hardly any time, to a god damn lifetime to complete.\n\nAll in all, I rate this game a perfect score, there is a bug here and there, but they are rare and have never (to me) been gamebreaking. So to summarize:\n\nAmazing story\nAmazing characters\nAmazing setting and locations\nAmazing gameplay (in my opinion, this is more subjective since some do not like the DnD combat in RPGs)\nAmazing sound-design and soundtrack (composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule!)\n\nIt's a god damn 10 out of 10 in my book. And everyone should at least give this game a try. :)","August 24, 2014","true","6.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you havent played it yet I strongly recommend you do as it is essentially your own Star wars trilogy. Ill go into why it is so in a spoiler section at the end but this game has such a great twist I wouldnt advise reading into it. But enough exposition and acclaim, The game feels like Star wars; From the fantastic sound design that captures the original score perfectly to the sound of lightsabers clashing and blasters firing. The set-peices, ships, weapons and armor all look like they are of some older era of the star wars universe capturing that feeling of an even longer time ago. The story and subject matter is (arguably) the best ever told and/or touched on in the Star wars universe telling countless stories of redemption, betrayal, revenge, hope, loss, sacrafice,ascension,downfall the list goes on, you become the embodiment of the character you play (good or evil) be it Sith, Jedi, Bounty hunter, Soldier, Scoundrel with any number intertwining for you to create this story thats set a long a fixed path into something of your own. Again making it your very own Star wars trilogy....\n\n************************************SPOILERS************************************************************************************\nFrom the point it begins to the point you escape Taris and arrive at the Jedi temple on Dantooine I consider to be the First Episode in th KOTOR trilogy and a story of the players new beginning (obviously).

Its complexity. Its story. Its intrigue. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic draws out as an instant role-playing game classic, influenced modern RPGs like never before. Developed by an unknown company, known as BioWare, the game is a golden hit by its original dialogue, choices, companions, and character development. The game even expands the Star Wars universe that can equate to the six Star Wars films by its popularity. Despite that the game was released in 2003, there is no argument that the game has a direct impact in popular culture and how it shapes other games, even Bethesda Studio's Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. Knights of the Old Republic is need to be played from anyone who thinks that other RPGs is better suit than this; they're wrong.

The light vs. dark side I should say is cliché but there are some story telling that is pretty surprisingly interesting picking up half way through the game.\n\nI chose to be light side because I’m always am and got motivated to defeat Malak the antagonist of the game. There are some nice moments where you go “awe” and “what” and that’s good, it shows Bioware was starting to stable themselves as the “capital ship” of 3rd party company.\n\nHowever, their earliest isn’t much what I expected because the backstory of the old Republic never mention this ever and even talks about the origin of the war. Yes they do talk about the rise of the Sith but just a brief one, I was expected a prequel of the star wars movies about telling the origin of what happen about everything; the war, the rise of Sith, the origin of the Republic everything, but no not a whole lot and both side doesn’t show much color.\n\nThe Sith are so generic with their “I’m a snob so that means everyone I look is a weakling” their motivation of doing this to so weak to me, yes they do what Sith do but what they are doing just doesn’t convince me to show sympathy to them or even see them differently. Is just “he’s bad and we’re good.” What about the republic surely they are some goody-two shoes?\n\nWell at first almost but no they can be somewhat corruptive and wrong of their morals too! And that’s what I want from it, the republic side showing its own “both side” but also want the Sith to show “their two faces as well” instead of all being rich snob Nazis.\n\nA final note on this yes they do some moments with the Sith on Korriban but not entirely enough to see them as “they are evil but I can see their side point why they do this horrid things.”\n\nCharacters\nthe NPC and partners are interesting as well especially I like that when you got the time you can talk to them and hear some back stories even if you bring one of them along in one certain planet, more dialogue options to choose and you will have a good backstory of the character. Malak I think is a cool villain especially the way he talks plus and robo-jaw that he has is really cool to look at.\n\nNow here comes the problems I have this game and two things are repetitive and cliché for the story aspect side. The NPC of any species just looks the same especially on the human side they have the same texture face model which doesn’t add a lot of emersion seing the same human character twice and even the voice, the alien sort of get a pass but their voice over just doesn't because they reuse the same alien language dialouge many times and it gets tired around the ears.\n\nYes, I know that Bioware was at their first steps and you could say is budget problem by not hiring more actors and having to change face textures about everything that won’t affect too much on the rating scale, is just a nitpick problem where you try to discover a new world with new species (though in my case I already know the species) but they sound the same you wanted to see many new variation looks/voice as possible. Hopefully in the second game when the game got very popular it will have more.\n\n\nChoose your side\nAlright now the big one and is, which side would you choose, well I should say, none of it matters! Well what I meant was it really doesn’t matter in “morality,” yes of course you still choose your light and dark ending but at endgame, for the rest of the game it really doesn’t matter if you are the lightest person in the world, you can still choose the dark path at the end of the game.\n\nSo what gives? What is the objective of those light side dark side points? Is really for gameplay wise in armor and weapons, the force powers I made my main character have some dark powers even some of my light-side partners, which doesn’t really matter if you are good or not you can still equip dark powers or light powers if you are choosing your endings. Another thing about the moral points is just cosmetic option but only in the dark path when your character begins to change color.\n\nSo now it sounds like it only effects gameplay and not story telling which blows badly right? Well at first yes, I thought it would be the biggest disappointment ever since no matter if you are the biggest jerk in this galaxy or the nicest one you can switch sides in matter of seconds. Well I should say not entirely in that center problem, because you can still have consequence when doing certain side quest and do evil things and in some planets some characters will pay you back hard, if you are prepare.\n\nNo, I think the big point taker has to be your partners’ reaction to the player’s action. Yes they say “you did a wrong thing” but they never “punish” you for it or better yet leave you or stop you even though they are the once that help you do the main’s dirty deed. Most of your partners are from the light side and whatever you do will make them react but not upon action which is really shame.\n\nI expect during some quests or the main “dialogue” choice your friends will abandon you and you will be recruit with more dark players and the story switch to another quest, “conquest” I thought. You can be the biggest jerk without a reason to them and they won’t even leave your side no matter what you did, even by the next set of choice that you made “wrong” you can switch to being nice again and they will forget about your “dirty deeds.”\n\nI find it odd that after everything I do bad they won’t bat an eye of my behavior which just tells me that my choice won’t affect much around me until the very end, but during the whole game experience I thought choosing one side might affect the story telling as two sides, one fight for the good or join the Sith and fight from the republic and you will eventually fight Yoda! (Which I know that isn’t him.)\n\nMy main when going dark or light doesn’t give a deeper meaning why he’s doing it, I’m just having that express feeling that “I do it because I’m a bully and want to take things just because,” “I’m good because I’m a goodie two-shoes,” and mind you I’m talking about story wise, the gameplay well that is different because I want the extra status boost.\n\nThe side missions some I like but is just another generic “do this because is the right thing to do and do this because you are a jerk” Even the options you choose sounds a bit preachy for me thinking “well duh of course is bad to do this but should I?” There is only one side quest I think is my favorite where it involve no light or dark side points and only pure morality choice which about there I got a moral dilemma and I wish there was more like that but I know if it is it makes the system even more pointless.\n\nVerdict:\nThe final verdict is a 7/10 a good starting game for Bioware’s time but need improvement on the writing, and moral choice but other than that I did enjoy the game despite some minor flaws the gameplay works flawlessly and I don’t have much of a problem to say, hopefully when I finish star war kotor 2 maybe things will change and improve until then, may the force be with you.","March 20","true","52.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The graphics are obviously dated (but not an eyesore), and the combat finds a comfortable balance between simplicity and the necessity of pausing to issue commands to your party.\n\nTo fans of the Star Wars franchise, the world of the Old Republic will be familiar, but also incredibly alien. Unsurprisingly, the writing is clumsy by modern standards, equal parts railroading and patronizing handholding. You get the sense that each line of dialogue was written to leave an opening for every question you can ask, and characters have no problem imparting upon you the same piece of information a dozen times over the course of a conversation. In spite of this, however, the world makes it incredibly easy to immerse yourself in it.\n\nEven with its shortcomings, KotOR is undeniably the genesis of the modern RPG, the proto-Mass Effect, and although you might not get it on with 100 year-old blue aliens, you can't help but feel that this is where it all began.","January 14","true","47.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yeah, it's showing its age compared to more modern RPGs. Yeah, the combat system is clunky and easy to exploit (the AI's pathing is awful). Yeah, the graphics aren't the great thing they were back in the early 2000s. But the real heart of this game is the story and characters. It was one of the first games of its kind and wasn't afraid to take risks, paying homage to the old Star Wars trilogy while creating its own interesting universe and characters. I had this game as a kid on my old Dell (it was piece of junk) like ten years ago and I thought this game was the ♥♥♥♥ back then.\n\nBasically, you play as a Jedi trying to stop the Sith from destroying the Republic. You can use the Force to bring unholy destruction on the dirty non-Jedi plebes or even just use blasters, because lightsabers are for the weak.\n\nGenerally, the choices go between being the nicest guy (or lady!) in the galaxy, or being a total ♥♥♥♥. But there's a lot of good writing you don't see in a lot of modern video games. Especially from your companions (9 of them in total).\n\nI'm able to get it running on my MSI laptop w/Windows 10, so I'm not sure the difficulty others are having. I disabled movies and it works just fine (you're not missing out on anything essential with the movies). Also, get Flawless Widescreen from somewhere in the internets if you have a large monitor, it helps a bunch with some of the visual glitches users run into.\n\nIf this game comes on sale and you like Star Wars or RPGs, definitely consider buying it.","January 8","true","28.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

WARNING: May include spoilers, even though I´ll do my best to keep them out.\n\nKotoR plays like 4000 years BBY (for not SW Nerds: Battle Before Yavin, or 4000 years before "A New Hope").\nDarth Revan and Darth Malak, two heros of the Mandalorian war, a war that could´ve destroyed the Republic, return to the galaxy as new Dark Lord of the Sith. Darth Revan, the leader of the newly "build" Sith army wins one battle after the other, before he´s betrayed by his student Darth Malak, who wants to rule on his own. Now that we know a little bit about this games backstory (which is also included in the game and one central point of the plot), let´s get down to the mainstory.\n\nYou´re a soldier (or one of two other classes), recruited for duty on the "Endar Spire". While you´re resting, the Endar Spire gets hijacked by the Sith army. You try to fight your way trough the enemy, while you do your best to reach the Jedi "Bastila Shan", an important role in this war because of her "Force Meditation". As you´re unable to find her, you make an emergency landing on the planet "Taris", which is confronted with a sith blockade. On Taris you´re trying to find Bastila and afterwards leave this planet.\nAs soon as you found her (after doing some favors and a veeery terrible first 2-3 hours), you leave Taris and travel to "Dantooine". As soon as you arrive, your Jedi-Training starts and a long journey to save the galaxy begins...\n\nEven though KotoR is already 11 years old, it still has some good graphics to offer. Surely there are so animations that look kinda strange or even some textures which look "washed-out", but it´s still a pretty game. You travel to different planets, which all have their individual look. As we´ve seen in BioWares "Dragon Age 2", this isn´t something they´re always able to achive ;)\nAlso, some of the characters faces look kinda mechanic. They have a disturbing lack of emotions, espacially your main character. Yet they´re able to eradicate this by having absolutly professional voice actors.\n\nThe atmosphere created by a very typical Star Wars score, pretty graphics and  very well written (and spoken) dialogues is intense and believable, espacially as you´re reaching the end. Planets like "Kashyyk" create their own unique flair and are very well translated from the source-material. Especially the dialogues do a good job of delivering story, feels and atmosphere and serve a very wide variaty of emotions. But as we all know, that´s something BioWare has mastered over the years.\n\nThe character editor is also nice. Even though you don´t have that much influence on the appearance (as you can only decide how your character looks by some different faces, without having much influence on them), but you´re able to build a charater you want through the variaty of stats and attributs. A good and fair skill-system keeps you motivated to level up and the (even though it´s very limited) customization of your weapons will enable you to create a very individual character.\n\nI won´t say much about the story, but.. it´s absolutly amazing. I finish this game at least once a year (also KotoR II: TSL, which in my opinion is a little bit better, even though it´s an unfinished game) and I´m still enjoying it. It keeps you motivated to go on, find all this different NPC´s and involves you in a story that (at it´s time) was a amazing thing for the SW franchise.\n\nI recommend you to buy this game and enjoy it. I´ratte it with an 8.6/10. It´s a classic. It´s an example for BioWares brilliance. Buy it now and you will have 20 hours of fun in a world that wants to be explored!","July 16, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I remember picking it up back in 2003 when I was 8, just because it had 'Star Wars' in the title. Ever since then, I have played this game through numerous times. The game regardless of how you play it, is just plain fun. The graphics are dated, yet they still look pretty decent. The gameplay is challenging and rewarding. The setting and locations in this game are stunning. From the urban cities of Taris, the deserts of Tatooine, to the oceans of Manaan, all of the locations are beautifully done. The characters you meet are diverse and likable. Most are pretty interesting, including npcs. There are plenty of opportunities to walk around and explore or talk to characters off of the beaten path. There are also mini games such as Pazaak and swoop races. The story is intriguing and has many turns. It also has a lot of replayability. There are different conversation choices, different endings, different classes, abilities, weapons, character party, and for the hardcore players no alien subtitles. There are plenty of customization options for the weapons you use, whether you want to be a calm and thoughtful Jedi using lightsabers and the force, or be the smooth talking smuggler using blasters and grenades, you are able to choose the way you want to play.\n\nIn conclusion, this is probably my favorite game. It has decent graphics that have aged somewhat well. The locations, characters, and story are all well made and great. There are many options for customization and replayability. Also the game is just plain fun. I'd highly recommend it to any Star Wars, sci-fi, or rpg fan.","May 18, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is amazing, but Can be a pain at times.\nThe game itself is absolutely amazing and it has a wonderful story that any starwars fan should be enthralled by.\n\nHOWEVER! The fact remains that this game is extremely dated and it has a lot of problems when it comes to computers. It can be as I would put it "whiny" and crashes a lot for some people. The game is so outdated that it literally thinks some pc parts are older than itself or it cannot recognize them.\nI know many work around for this issue and they are on the forums, but it is still a pain.\nBeyond that, the graphics and some of the sounds are pretty iffy, but since it is 10 years old you should expect that.\n\nI would still recommend buying this game even if you wait for the steam summer/winter sales where it is 5-10 bucks.

Even if the combat itself can be played in real-time and doesn't\npause by itself you will constantly die if you don't hit the pause-button\n(which is the spacebar btw!) frequently on higher difficulties.\n\nIf you can get along with turn based combat, this game will offer the best\nStar Wars experience anyone could hope for, including tactical depth,\nawesome characters, and a story that is so well-told, no other game\nuntil today was able to surpass it in that respect.\n\n\n","December 22, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I heard a lot of positive responses over the years of its existence so I got it on Steam Sale.

You want me to explain? Fine. A traditional Star Wars story that captures the heart and soul of the series and is 10 times better than anything Lucas has written since Return of the Jedi. Set a couple 1000 years before Phantom Menace (Lucas wouldn't let them get any further away from it), Bioware was given the creative freedom to write their own narrative, succeeding in creating not just one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made (arguably the greatest, behind a heavily modded KOTOR 2) but one of the greatest Star Wars stories ever told. Helping you on your adventure is a cast of colorful Bioware characters that you'll either love (Bastila) or hate (Carth) but find engaging nonetheless. Possessing classic real time combat that doesn't feel as dated as it should for game that is 12 years old, newcomers will be able to adapt its to Pre-Skyrim style quite easily. Engaging voice acting from some of the best (Jennifer Hale and Kevin Michael Richardson to name a few) just seals the deal. The visuals are a little dated but that just means any modern computer can play this game at full settings. Besides, presentation is everything and Bioware's models are just as Star Wars as the movies.\n\nIn conclusion <See top of review>","April 17, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is my favorite game of all time. The character creation is great and the way your character becomes stronger over fighting regular enemies, monsters, and even sith is amazing. The amount of fun you can have in this game is endless! The story in this game is by far the best writing by Bioware in my opinion. Especially the epic plot twist about your character when confronting Darth Malak, this game's Dark Lord of the Sith. The party members are fun to talk to and energetic, especially HK-47 and Jolee Bindo who are by far the most interesting characters to converse with. The first level in this game brings you in the middle of the action! And it hasn't even been five minutes into the game! The first "official" level is Taris the planet that you crash land on and it serves as a "tutorial level" but the shere amount of learning you have to do especially with help is incredible. The game will teach you about certain combat feats, control, different weapons and shields, and most importantly the alignment system. The alignment system is where you can choose to follow the light or dark side depending on what actions you take and what dialogue you choose to say. And it affects your personality, traits, and appearance! A light sided character will be helpful and looks "good" for lack of a better word, and a dark sided character will be demonic looking, evil, and will kill anyone they can for no apparent reason. Anyways, this game is by far the best Star Wars game I've played and its sequel is awesome as well. I recommend this game to any fan of the RPG genre and a Star Wars fan as well, and to any person interested in playing the game or getting into the series, try this game out it will be worth your time and money.","March 1, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

When this game released many moons ago I was a young teenager. I have never played an RPG before and even worse: I did not know this game was an RPG. Unaware of my ignorance I placed the game into the the disc tray of my Xbox and never looked back. Since the release of the game I have over 1000 hours of play time between the Xbox and PC version. But what makes this game so good?\n\nFirstly is the the story. From the first second you feel a level of immersion that I find hard to get with other games. What makes the story even more enjoyable is that each playthrough you can do things differently and experience something new.\n\nCharacter customization has almost everything I could want in a game. While there are restrictions with physical appearance in character creation everything else seems to disregard it. The leveling system is beautiful with enough options that ensure every character you create will be different if you try. I find myself being immersed with the Equip screen as well, sometimes going through my equipment just to see what I will look in various armors/robes.\n\nThe gameplay itself is satisfying. Using a real time turn based combat system, you rarely feel things are moving slow. While in combat you have the ability to pause the game, if you wish, and issue up four commands for your companions to perform. Experimenting with this can be fun to see what type of damage you can do and how quickly you can kill harder opponents.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game for any Star Wars or RPG fan. Knights of the Old Republic is a milestone in gaming and everyone should try to experience what it hast to offer.","May 5, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world created for this era predating even the prequel movies by thousands of years is fantastic, for Star Wars fans and RPG fans alike. The characters are memorable, the cinematic moments in the game keep you on the edge of your seat, and the game play is interesting.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is probably the closest thing to a virtual, 3D version of Dungeons & Dragons I've ever played. It's based on a very similar stat/skill/feat system, with rolls calculated by your computer deciding how combat plays out. If that kind of strategic, min-max type of gameplay appeals to you, then this game is a great choice.\n\nPartly for nostalgia, but mostly because of the immense amount of love and care that Bioware put into KOTOR, it remains my favourite game of all time.","July 12, 2014","true","69.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is riddled with plot twists, and the game is using a form of D&D in combat, so the D20 still reigns supreme. The visuals fare just fine, and the music is well-placed in the various locations of the game. Sure, there are a few occasional bugs, and some can be quite annoying, which, when combined with the game's above-average combat difficulty, can cause some headaches. But the drawbacks are largely overshadowed by the well-done aspects of the game. If you're a fan of the Star Wars universe or not is unimportant, since an excellent RPG is the same, no matter the setting.

I didn't get to play this game around the time it came out so the graphics are a bit dated for me. But the rpg elements are nice, you get to customize your stats (like str, dex, int, etc.), skills (like opening doors, repairing droids, etc.), and feats (which are actions you can do in combat or passives that gives bonus). If you don't want to do all that customizing, you can just auto allocate them in the options. Some items, like armour, lightsabers, and other weapons, are customizable that will increase damage or add effects like a chance to stun your enemy.\n\nThe story, which is probably why you're here, is pretty good. Side missions are good. You get to choose your conversations when interacting with npcs, some of them can make a difference in the story while others doesn't. Just a warning though, there is a lot of talking in this game and if you try to choose every possible conversation, some of the npcs will just repeat the same information that you got from other npcs.\n\nOverall, this ♥♥♥♥ is good.

My grandad bought me this game for PC back when he had Windows XP, we couldn't work out how to play it and he thought it was crap, so he returned it! But! Several days later, I went from school to a friend's house, Akko (who you can find on my friends list). Akko had KotOR on his Xbox, we started playing it, that was when I realised, that it wasn't some werid game that we couldn't figure out how to play, we just didn't give it a chance!!! Sorry if this story bored you!

Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is my favorite game of all time. The character creation is great and the way your character becomes stronger over fighting regular enemies, monsters, and even sith is amazing. The amount of fun you can have in this game is endless! The story in this game is by far the best writing by Bioware in my opinion. Especially the epic plot twist about your character when confronting Darth Malak, this game's Dark Lord of the Sith. The party members are fun to talk to and energetic, especially HK-47 and Jolee Bindo who are by far the most interesting characters to converse with. The first level in this game brings you in the middle of the action! And it hasn't even been five minutes into the game! The first "official" level is Taris the planet that you crash land on and it serves as a "tutorial level" but the shere amount of learning you have to do especially with help is incredible. The game will teach you about certain combat feats, control, different weapons and shields, and most importantly the alignment system. The alignment system is where you can choose to follow the light or dark side depending on what actions you take and what dialogue you choose to say. And it affects your personality, traits, and appearance! A light sided character will be helpful and looks "good" for lack of a better word, and a dark sided character will be demonic looking, evil, and will kill anyone they can for no apparent reason. Anyways, this game is by far the best Star Wars game I've played and its sequel is awesome as well. I recommend this game to any fan of the RPG genre and a Star Wars fan as well, and to any person interested in playing the game or getting into the series, try this game out it will be worth your time and money.","March 1, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I will not spoil the story but it has an excellent ending and interesting plot twists which the user will not expect. It is a fantastic chapter in the Star Wars universe and I highly recommend it to any RPG fans as it truly makes the genre hard to better, again for a 12 year old game it is unbelievably addicting and will have you playing the game non-stop until you finish.\n\nIt has replayable value as you get to choose your own path, light side or dark side you have the choice entirely and conversational structure in the game allows you to make these decisions.\n\nPuzzles feature heavily throughout the game and are challenging with little aid, personally I struggled with them and had to research how to solve them online but they can be easily figured out with some effort. The characters in this game are unique and loveable, they aid the protagonist throughout and help influence your decisions if you allow yourself to fall into this game's smart trap of wanting to make your companions happy so you make decisions based on their interests.\n\nOverall I would put this game into my top 5 list of games ever, and it easily has one of the best storylines of any game I've encountered as an RPG fan.","February 11, 2015","true","53.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/32370/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a third person rpg set 4000 years before the events of the first movie. It starts off with you being able to customize your character to be either male of female and choosing your class. Afterwards you get into the actual game as your ship is immediately being attacked and boarded by the Sith. You are quickly overwhelmed and crash land on the starting planet. The planets and environments are one of the best features to the game. They are all very unique and offer lots of room to explore. You can converse with most alien species since your character speaks nearly every language under the Republic's domain. Some speak in their native tongues and you understand via subtitles but man do they talk slow. It could take upwards to 20 seconds for every sentence as they grumble and grunt their language at you which made me very glad there is an option to skip sentences with the click of the mouse. It's usually worth talking to them as they explain their culture, problems and feelings on the war between the Republic and the Sith.\n\nYour companions on the other hand are some of the most annoying and broody bunch of support characters I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong a few are actually really cool but it would be nice to kick most of them out of your base. You can take up to two of them with you on missions and you can equip and dress them however you like. They will sometimes trade quips or add their opinions into a conversation which helps flesh them out more. An alignment system is in place where you can either focus on the light side by doing good deeds or the dark side by evil ones. It's not just a superficial system, being on the light sides makes casting dark side powers a lot more difficult for you to cast. You can also be neutral but it is pretty hard to maintain. Which makes for a lot of interesting circumstances on whether you want to help someone due to being dangerously close to steering toward the light side which has nowhere near the strength of the dark side powers. We don't start of as a jedi and don't have these powers at the start of the game but it is something to keep in mind.\n\nGameplay consists of auto-attacking and clicking on abilities to either damage or heal. There is an option to pause time and set commands to each of the party members which lets you use plan your battles far easier than trying in real time. At times your character will just freeze up and not do anything while enemies get free shots in. Happens rarely but is infuriating when it happens in a brutal fight. A glitch that happens a lot more occasionally is being unable to move after a battle. It fixes itself after 30 seconds of not doing anything but with the amount of battles in this becomes a real problem. Activating Vsync fixes this problem for some people. You can use a shield a limited amount of times, throw grenades, lay land mines and use force powers which makes for a lot of variety. Never gets old seeing a  Jedi get fed up with fighting a group of enemies and just throws a grenade.  Melee combat is pretty cool as well, they have a preset fighting animations where they kick, dodge and slash at each other. You have no control over it but it definitely adds more action to the fights. Ranged has a single animation where you dodge some blaster rounds but starting off your aim is so bad that it would make a StormTrooper blush.\n\nOutside of combat you can explore, disarm landmines and pick locks considering you have the skill to do so. You can gamble in some kind of modified version of BlackJack but you need to collect the cards of the deck yourself. You can also join Swoop races that play like your modern day runner. There are also turret sections on occasion where you can defend your ship from an attack fleet. On top of all that there are a ton of side quests and having done nothing but what I was required to I still got 31 hours out of the game so as you can see it is a very lengthy game. Most of the time you will be in dialogue with another character and given multiple ways to answer or deal with dilemmas. Unfortunately the voice acting ranges from mediocre to terrible and considering the amount of talking you do it may be a bit of a turn off to some. That is the only thing wrong with the sound side of things. The music has a mix of original Star Wars music and some newly composed music that all sound excellent. The sound of blasters, electrocuting people and lightsaber fights all sound great as well.\n\nStory is kind of dull. It starts off promising but quickly devolves into a treasure hunt for maps.  Occasionally you will get a cut-scene of the villain sending some useless goons to hunt you to remind the player he even exists. The story really picks up near the end of the game though. You'll mostly be interested in the politics of each planet and the troubles they are going through like trying to stay neutral in the war, slavery and criminals controlling everything. Your choices have some pretty big impacts like medicine costing much more credits (money) to everyone, yourself included. It is definitely the type of game you play for the adventure instead of the grand overall plot.  Graphics are obviously dated with character models looking very ancient but the environments themselves look decent.  The menus are awful. You can pick up as much stuff as you want without limits but everything in the inventory is seemingly placed at random,without ways to quickly reach a category of weapon or to sell junk it really becomes a chore. You will have to change weapons since some are much more efficient against certain types of enemies and would have been made so much less frustrating by a decent menu.\n\nIt is a good game don't get me wrong but it is not the greatest rpg ever that some people claim it to be. I had quite a bit of fun with it and will immediately play the sequel after this review. I am not a Star Wars fan though so that may be a fact to take into consideration.  Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a fun game dragged down by some technical and  user interface issues but still manages to be a game worth considering if you are into the genre.It's also nice to see a Star Wars game not including Obi Wan or Luke like most games and you can tell they put a lot of effort into weaving their own identity into the Star Wars universe. It still holds up against the rpgs of today and shouldn't be dismissed due to it's age.","February 19, 2015","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Period.\n\nThere's little to be said about this masterpiece. Even being a 12 year old game, it didn't age badly and still plays fantastically. Possible to launch it in 1080p with a bit of tinkering. Game is fairly unstable on modern OS and in one playthrough crashed about 7 or 8 times. Still, all technical negatives aside the game still feels wonderfully crafted. Endless dialogs, various quests, different and varied locations and choices with serious consequences - all these elements are only a small part of the whole KOTOR package. HK-47 is probably one of the best video characters BioWare has ever made, or even in general.\n\nGame does have it's flaws. For example: inventory system is really basic and once you start hitting 20-30+ hours into the game, and if you're a hoarder, it gets very difficult to find stuff that you need, since everything is thrown into one pile. Camera can take some getting used to, but overall won't be too much of a trouble. AI pathing is poor, ofter will your AI partners get stuck and you'll have to take control of them to make them move towards you again. Also your AI doesn't use health packs, stimulants, or any other consumable, half the time they don't even use their learned abilities. There is a "Script" option, but it's very basic, since you can't customize it, and it only offers 3 rudimentary options.\n\nSome of the above mentioned negatives are more or less nitpicks, since this is technically a turn-based RPG, so you are encouraged to micromanage everything yourself, rather than let the AI do everything for you. This might be a deal breaker for some, but I personally did not find it too difficult to setup fights with my party, while also controlling my own character. Game does have a pause, so you can always pause and take a breather if things are getting out of hand.\n\nAs a 12 year old RPG game, it puts most today's RPG to shame with what it has to offer.\n\nA must have game for any RPG, Star Wars fan, or even if you just like great games.\n\nmeatbag/10","June 12, 2015","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't get to play this game around the time it came out so the graphics are a bit dated for me. But the rpg elements are nice, you get to customize your stats (like str, dex, int, etc.), skills (like opening doors, repairing droids, etc.), and feats (which are actions you can do in combat or passives that gives bonus). If you don't want to do all that customizing, you can just auto allocate them in the options. Some items, like armour, lightsabers, and other weapons, are customizable that will increase damage or add effects like a chance to stun your enemy.\n\nThe story, which is probably why you're here, is pretty good. Side missions are good. You get to choose your conversations when interacting with npcs, some of them can make a difference in the story while others doesn't. Just a warning though, there is a lot of talking in this game and if you try to choose every possible conversation, some of the npcs will just repeat the same information that you got from other npcs.\n\nOverall, this ♥♥♥♥ is good.

Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is my favorite game of all time. The character creation is great and the way your character becomes stronger over fighting regular enemies, monsters, and even sith is amazing. The amount of fun you can have in this game is endless! The story in this game is by far the best writing by Bioware in my opinion. Especially the epic plot twist about your character when confronting Darth Malak, this game's Dark Lord of the Sith. The party members are fun to talk to and energetic, especially HK-47 and Jolee Bindo who are by far the most interesting characters to converse with. The first level in this game brings you in the middle of the action! And it hasn't even been five minutes into the game! The first "official" level is Taris the planet that you crash land on and it serves as a "tutorial level" but the shere amount of learning you have to do especially with help is incredible. The game will teach you about certain combat feats, control, different weapons and shields, and most importantly the alignment system. The alignment system is where you can choose to follow the light or dark side depending on what actions you take and what dialogue you choose to say. And it affects your personality, traits, and appearance! A light sided character will be helpful and looks "good" for lack of a better word, and a dark sided character will be demonic looking, evil, and will kill anyone they can for no apparent reason. Anyways, this game is by far the best Star Wars game I've played and its sequel is awesome as well. I recommend this game to any fan of the RPG genre and a Star Wars fan as well, and to any person interested in playing the game or getting into the series, try this game out it will be worth your time and money.","March 1, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The story, in my opinion, is the best of any RPG to date with interesting characters and satisfying plot lines throughout the game.\nThe plot unfolds in a clear and logical direction and keeps you engaged. There are several worlds to explore, each with unique environment and challenges. The character leveling is fairly simple and provides a multitude of options for you to build your character to fit your playstyle. Quests are rewarding and can be completed how you see fit, each with its own consequence, big or small. The tutorials are helpful and will get new players moving along right from the start. The combat system is easy to understand and works very well both automatically and for a strategic and keen minded player. The inventory is very easy to manage and understand, and there is never a shortage of options when it comes to buying or using items.\nAlthough this game was released over a decade ago, it remains one of my all-time favorites, as well as my favorite RPG. It has stood the test of time as it still looks very nice and smooth, (even on the Xbox version), functions exceptionally well, and continues to keep players engaged and captivate their interest to this day.

Featuring a combat system based more on Dungeons and Dragons than the action-based Mass Effect or Skyrim, the round-based combat effectively delivers on the lightsaber and blaster battles anyone who loves the films craves, while offering a unique and captivating storyline set in its own special corner of Star Wars.\n\nIf I'd impart one piece of advice before sending you off to purchase what is admittedly one of my favorite games of all time, it would be this: Persevere. Do not let Taris intimidate you, and for goodness sake, savor the few hours before you delve into the flash and hum of lightsabers and Force Powers to get to know the place. Quite frankly, this is one of the most in-depth and immersive games out there, especially from Bioware, and woe be to the gamer who sees the dice roll mechanics and whines because he can't aim down a scope or he has to listen to actual character.

I would recomend it to any rpg gamers out there unless you hate the star wars series with a passion. Unlike what i find in many modern RPGs this game is not linear, you can chose where to go when you want and not simply made to for the story (Although certain plot points will restrict this for a time). The game reminded alot of Mass Efeect 1 in the way it ran which would probably be expected as both are from Bioware. The cast of characters were interesting though some seemed to lack in any real development. The free rein to play in which ever style you want complements the gameplay, if you dont want to be a jedi  you can still use blasters and vaporise those who satnd in your way. The only major bug i came acrss in my experience is that randomly after combat some characters would not be able to move which did get irritating at parts where the player has control over an individual character instead of the three man party so if this glith is experienced save regualy. Despite some of its criticisms this is a great game and if your a fan of RPGs this will have you hooked. 9.3/10","October 23, 2014","true","54.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

By far the best in any video game in my opinion next to the first Deus Ex. Also has a bunch of unexpected and genius twists that kick you in the balls and make you say "What the hell?"\n+Brilliant yet simple combat system based on the D&D dice roll system.\n+Lots of customization for you and your crew.\n+Lovable characters that you actually see develop through in-game dialogue selections(except Juhani)\n+Decent graphics for a 2003 game.\n+The planets you visit are diverse and extremely fun to explore.\n+Large range of weapons and powers\n+Light side and dark side alignment choices are present (you can be a saint or a ♥♥♥♥, your choice).\n+Has HK-47, the slyest and murderous son(or droid?) of a gun that you MUST purchase when you're in Tatooine if you want to laugh all the way to your final fight with Darth Malak. Also has Jolee, the sterotypical old black man that makes you crack up at his sarcastic antics.\n+Mods support, but why modify an already amazing game,\n\nCONS:\n-Lots of bugs.\n-Pazaak, the most unfair and unbalanced variation of the game Blackjack/21\n-Podracing gets old.\n-Juhani, the most emo character in Star Wars history. I half expected her to burst out singing "Crawling."\n\nTo be honest who gives a damn about the cons. Just get this game if you want to immerse yourself into a 50 hour campaign of lightsaber duels, firefights, well rounded characters(except for you-know-you) and the best Star Wars story, hell even the best story in a video game.","May 23, 2015","true","40.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was the RPG that got me into RPGs (narrowly beating out Morrowind) and when I was young I played through the game in every single way possible on my Xbox. Best birthday gift my grandmother ever gave me.\n\nIf you enjoy any RPG or story rich games, this is an old gem from the 6th generation that is worth revisiting, even if the graphics don't hold up anymore. The story is amazing, to say the least, and shot Bioware to fame; without KOTOR who knows if they would have made Dragon Age or Mass Effect? If you like those two latter titles, KOTOR is clearly the blueprint of success that Bioware has been building upon in all of their other titles.\n\nIt is sad that KOTOR II was sent off to Obsidian and that the MMORPG they made have failed to reach the original game's stature, but it is a very large shadow to fill.\n\nBastila and Carth, Malak and Revan -- the characters are very well developed and the voiceacting is still great (and especially for the time period the game is from).\n\nThe game is so good I bought it on Steam just so I could review it.

This game is absolutely amazing from start to finish.\nThe plot is very strong with some suprising twists which makes it interesting as well.\nThe characters that follow you have their own background, and your companions may trigger an argument making it feel more alive!\nThe combat is turn-based and easy to understand, with the ability to pause in the middle of the battle, giving you time to set up a strategy.\nThroughout the game, your actions will change who you are alligned with, whether its the dark side or the light, each having their own unique powers giving it some replayability.\nThere are many side quests for you to complete ranging from interrogating to finding missing holocrons, adding a bit of variety.\nThe only downsides that i give to this game are: the autosave sucks a lot, so make sure you save often to avoid any stress.\nThe AI sometimes messes up, whether they block your way, they get stuck and rarely stop attacking and bugs out for a second or two.\n\nOverall i give this game a 9.5/10 because it is one of the best star wars games of all time. It has a lot of content for you to explore and learn the universe of star wars, i believe if you can bypass these cons, this game is a perfect 10/10 without a doubt.\n","February 25, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Several days later, I went from school to a friend's house, Akko (who you can find on my friends list). Akko had KotOR on his Xbox, we started playing it, that was when I realised, that it wasn't some werid game that we couldn't figure out how to play, we just didn't give it a chance!!!

It is one of the best RPG's out there, along with it's sequel, and hands down a must-play if you are a Star Wars fan!\n\nCurrently, the movement can be a bit buggy. I don't recall this as an issue when I played it back on Windows XP years ago, but simply switching to one of your other controllable characters allows the other character to move out of the terrain glitch. I have only had the very rare crash so far in 20 hours of gameplay (I think twice). This game has a decent story, and plenty of weaponry to choose from. It allows both melee and ranged (blaster/bowcaster) gameplay, and the combat is turn-based in real-time, while still pausable at any time in the game to allow control of your characters and their combat options. There are times when you might come across a group of enemies to eliminate, during which your first attempt might end in complete failure, and minimal losses to the enemy; whereby approaching with a different strategy / different abilities, you may not lose a single companion, and find the fight much easier. Such is the combat mechanic depth.\nGraphics I can't say much about due to it's age, but they are good enough on the Steam version of this game to at least scale somewhat to to a widescreen configuration. In other words, the game is very playable (albeit not with the graphical content or depth of, say, Assasin's Creed).\n\nAbsolute 10/10\n\nAnd if you enjoy this game and it's playstyle, then absolutely recommended is the sequel!!!!

They focus more on the story telling and i loved there approche on the force.

I played it not very long ago, after missing out on this beautiful masterpiece of a game. The opening scene that I was thrust into was amazing and action packed, with the 'Endar Spire' being bombed by the Sith. Once you escape there, you go to a planet known as Taris. That is by far the most annoying and agrivating part of the game. That's not in a bad way though, because the thing that makes it hard is it's sheer difficulty. If you choose the 'Soldier' class, this won't be much of a problem. However, if you're going for stealth or a balanced character, prepare to have your backside handed to you!

If you're a fan of Star Wars & love RPG-type games such as the Witcher series, then I highly recommend this game.\n\nCons:\nIn my opinion, the ending/s of the game was a little weak. It was very short, abrupt, & unsatisfying after playing through such a deep & immersive story to say the least.\n\nAlso, once you finish the story, you can no longer free roam. Instead it takes you back to the main menu where your only options are to reload previous saves or start a new game. I wasn't a fan of this since I spent so much time upgrading my character & making him look cool just to find out that you literallty can't do anything with him after completing the story.\n\nStill an amazing game though!

It's got light and Dark side choices, anything you do will determine that. There's no quick path to the light side, or the dark side, you can't pick and choose easily. The sidequests are plentiful and and probably take twice the time it takes to complete the main story.\n\nThere are major problems, that can sometimes ruin the game.\n\nOn the Korriban level, one of the tombs will break your 2nd companinon, which really sucked, because it broke HK-47.\n\nEvery shot and block is all on chance, so even if your blaster is at point blank range, you still can't shoot that scruffy nerf-herder.\n\nAutosave doesn't work too well\n\nSith enemies have an absouletly OP life drain, not only stunning you but healing themselves.\n\nYou can sometimes go back "home" when in combat. This makes it so much easier, but takes the fun away.\n\nAWFULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL STARFIGHTER MINI GAMES. Everytime you leave a unsafe planet, starfighters go after you. It sucks you can't save, and the fact that turning is slow and painful makes it horrible. There are 6 starfighter, and if they hit you 2 times each, you die.\n\nWhats the best thing?\n\nThe fact that Companions are bantha fodder, and guerilla tactics are awesome. Relying on them is hardly needed.\n\nThe AI, is actually not crappy. It's pretty decent. (They still block you though)\n\nLeveling up characters, allows you to choose skills and powers to upgrade\n\nIt's almost free world\n\nCollecting everything is very rewarding. In the end I had 12 lightsabers or something crazy like that.\n\nThe plot is absoluetly epic, it goes with the regular star wars stuff, You are a force-user, you save the galaxy because you are the chosen guy, and have a wall of plot armor. But, the twist is absoluetly.....wow....and you'll want to play again for the ending you missed (dark or light) and all the side quests you left untended.\n\n10/10-ign\n\n10/10-gamestop\n\n10/10-angryjoe\n\n10/10-pegi16\n\n10/10-SunpaiSilverAussieCat\n\n\nBUY THE GAME ALREADYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY","May 11","true","52.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In all seriousness though. this has to be one of the greatest games ever made, a fact most major gaming publications have agreed upon. I played it many years ago, but never finished. Now I've returned to the KOTOR universe, and I can't see myself not finishing it this time around.\n\nThe gameplay is very strategic and smart. It's addictive no matter your success rate. When you dominate in combat, you want to continue dominating. When you fail, success usually seems so close that you want to try again until you've won. The same can be said of the mini-games... I've put way more time into Pazaak than I care to admit.\n\nHowever, it's the character development where the game really shines. The slow build towards making significant changes in the Star Wars universe captures the tone and feel of A New Hope way better than most other Staw Wars tie-ins. Most of the voice acting is incredibly strong and reasonably paced. It was actually a pleasure to listen to the voice work, which is a must in a game with this much dialogue.\n\nWith a little elbow grease (digitally speaking, of course) you can mod your way to a truly incredible experience. Some of the hi-res textures out there really help modernize the title. There are many, many other gameplay enhancements to be downloaded too, although I've been trying to keep my experience as close to the original as possible.\n\nTo that point, I was able to use Pinnacle Profiler to configure my 360 gamepad to play close to the original X-Box version, with a shift mode controlling the mouse pointer when I need it. Again, it took some toying and learning, but I was able to get it to the point where it works extremely well.\n\nNot all is sunny and roses on the planet Taris, though. There are some odd graphical glitches from time to time. Also, some of the NPC's faces repeat or are similar enough to be jarring. In 8 hours of play with a few mods installed, I only experienced one crash to desktop (and of course, this could be related to having modded the files). There was also an annoying glitch in which my character would stop moving after battles, but this was fixed on my machine by enabling V-Sync.\n\nHowever, the overall quality of the title is so absurdly high that these minor annoyances pale in comparison.\n\nHIghest recommendations on this one. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this masterpiece classic.","February 19, 2015","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even ignoring being a fan of Star Wars overall, it seems detached from almost everything else that has been produced (The Old Republic being based off a similar time frame), movies especially, and brings a lot of new things, despite keeping that semi-familiar setting.\n\nIt shows it's age, though, with no widescreen video options, and (very surprisingly), no vanilla overhaul mod available to tweak it up. At the same time though, there's a big reason for that, and that is that it has very little in the way of bugs and problems, and looks good enough for a game over ten years old. Another big way of showing age is a lack of functions many have come to expect from RPG's, like some kind of auto-loot, there's no way to heal the entire party automatically.. But the variety of how you can approach situations is rather staggering (But rather expectable from Bioware nowadays)\n\nDefinitely a great game, would recommend it to anyone who wants to lose a few weeks to a rather engrossing classic.","February 14, 2015","true","40.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_Mike/recommended/32370/","T_Mike","Todd Michael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_Mike/","1161 products in account","One of BioWare's earlier achievements, KOTOR's an easy game to criticize in retrospect. From the release of Baldur's Gate in 1998 to Mass Effect just 10 years later, most every RPG released by BioWare would follow the same mass-produced, literally by-the-books Hero's Quest outline—i.e., each game’s plot felt like a meeting of forced expectations, sometimes satisfying and sometimes mind-numbing in their predicted delivery—a choice that simultaneously made their products restrictive holds against and necessary stepping stones for advancing the depth possible in video game story-telling.\n\nBut who cares, right? KOTOR tells a generic Star Wars story with mostly generic Star Wars characters, meeting every generic Star Wars expectation a gamer could ask for right down to the tired, required lines, but it does so almost flawlessly, to such an extent that its seemingly pedestrian qualities make it among the most fun and accessible modern RPG experiences and Star Wars stories. In an age-old formula so noticeable and so repeated some players even refer to it as "the BioWare Cliché," a faceless variable with a background too vague and mysterious to be taken seriously, recognized by everyone around them as vitally important is thrown into the midst of a universal conflict against a threatening Force of Unfathomable Evil. As their life is turned upside down against their better judgment, they’re guided by close mentors friends, one of whose personality’s teeters on the edge of simply being Han Solo before he’s overcome by emotional turmoil (and the personality traits are thusly handed off to a snarky youngster and her wookie companion), the other a sassy, sexy Obi-Wan-Leia hybrid.* Through thick and thin, unsurprising twists and heart-wrenching betrayal, they form a series of close bonds and pass the required tests necessary to rid the galaxy of malice once and for all.\n\nDropping the vague references to clichés repeated, KOTOR stars a young nobody, canonically male, her past just barely customizable to the point of ineffectuality, being shipped under unspoken circumstances that end under the galaxy-wide Jedi Civil War igniting her hidden potential in the Force (à la Luke Skywalker) over an introduction spent making friends and escaping the occupied planet-city Taris. Under the tutelage of these newfound friends, she hones her skills in the Force, strained physically and morally under four major tests of heroism across beloved planets like Tatooine and Kashyyk. What she and her entourage seek, they seek in the footsteps of the Sith Lord Malak and his former master Revan—deceased: betrayal, Siths, &c.**—, piecing together an alien map in order to understand what massive power source drove those two to Team Slytherin, or, like, whatever.\n\nTheir fall is itself a story existing partially outside the game’s bounds, a series of events that took place after the culmination of the Mandalorian Wars—the galaxy’s previous Big Mistake and a war led by the war-mongering culture of Mandalore, a bone-headed, unlikeable civilization modeled after a single facet of humanity, their sole goal to enslave or destroy everyone just because. The backdrop of this war’s aftermath fuels the chaotic political state in KOTOR; it was a war in which the Jedi stood by, watching—idling on the decision of whether their place included interference—and yet a war won almost single-handedly the two previously-mentioned Jedi, rationalizing the need to defend freedoms and lives threatened by Mandalore’s conquest.\n\nKrayt dragons, wookie tribes, life debts, Klingons, Jawas and their sandcrawlers, planets being razed from space, half-naked old men running around star ships, limitless sources of unimaginable power, lost alien civilizations, bland villains—KOTOR has everything you expect and love from a Star Wars tale, wrapped and guided by the massive conflict of good and evil fighting over mythopoeic indulgence. The central theme of mythology itself, abused by Lucas and now by BioWare, here works as a symbol of their aging morality mechanics. Following this game, treading those grey areas became a duty, even if it took a couple stories and universes to figure out how to present believably.\n\nAs an RPG born in 2003, it almost can’t help but tread that line between oldschool and new-, providing a strategic (but accessible, simplified) battle-management system that lets you plan the course of every encounter at your own pace, coupled with real-time decision-making and exciting action full of lasers and light sabers and lightning-quick force powers and, uhm, grenades, I guess—just with dice rolls, added and appreciated: beloved mechanic of chance in things past. The leveling system also stands as one of BioWare's most fluid and functional (opposed to, say, Mass Effect’s messy, meaningless overdose of options and numbers), letting players tread lines however customizable they can get to the point of breaking the game, i.e., as with many RPGs prior to this last generation, it’s not exactly difficult to customize your character to the point that whatever plot point is impassibly difficult, i.e., multiple save files are strongly suggested.\n\nAnd as such an RPG, it took some shocking dares in character design: HK-47, the fan-favorite assassin droid prefaces every delivered line with the emotional intent behind them, creating a stir of always-contemptuous black humor and irony; and Jolee Bindo, whose entire presence—a good man sitting comfortably on the line between the series’ Dark and Light Sides, quick to point out the flaws (and outright stupidity) inherent in the tenets of the Jedi Knight code—hints at the brilliant postmodern deconstruction Star Wars would get in Obsidian's ambitious sequel. They let us know lead-author Drew Karpshyn was capable of a lot more than farting out game-y dialogue and fetch quests by the dozens even when limited by that bullet-point list of Quest-with-a-Q requirements.\n\nThat greyed-out line Jolee walks, also brings to the forefront major flaws in BioWare’s championship of the modern RPG format. Areas of grey don’t apply much outside of his character or even BioWare’s RPGs prior to Mass Effect 2, but the forceful impact of choice has been their calling card (& often selling point) since 1998. When choice arises in dialogue or action, the writers strive to bring the sense that you’re calling the shots, that you’re the acting force that shaping its conclusion. Those choices, unfortunately, amount to either following that path of charity and sacrifice defined by the Jedi code, or make your avatar sound like a cartoon jerk tossing out petty insults like candy--maniacal laugh included. Under this system, choices often amount to little more than variations on the lines “I’d love to help clothe and feed you!” or “I don’t have time for your stupid babble.” This never makes sense with whatever narrative is being told: E.g., Why would these characters follow these bad decisions? Why would this person fall in love with this monstrous cliché?\n\nAre these aged mechanics and writing a bad thing? I would definitely argue No, despite the lingering force of Internet backlash BioWare gets from more critical players. The ambition driving this illusion of meaning in player choice has only improved and grown more bewilderingly ambitious with every game BioWare’s released, the massive steps taken between each a necessary movement culminating in (as of 2013) the phenomenon that is the Mass Effect trilogy, a series driven successfully by the player choice and personal involvement all their previous RPGs like KOTOR strived towards. It may have taken a lot of trial-‘n’-error gambits—still ongoing—but it doesn’t mean the errors are necessarily mistakes, and it certainly doesn’t mean they aren’t worth experiencing when they’re this danged fun.","December 31, 2014","true","44.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love everything about the Star Wars expanded universe and this is the pinnacle of it, it rises high above the waste and filth that are 90% of Star Wars video games and stands proudly as an amazing story drive experience. Light Side or Dark side, you choose, it's all up to you and it will affect you're ending and which of your party members decide to stand with you.\n\nI'm not normally a fan of turn based combat, but they nailed it right here, the animations, the visuals and the effects\ndo look quite dated now but believe me, at the time it was a sight to behold.\n\nIt's hard to give this a neutral critical review because it would be like insulting my child if I were to say too many negative things against it.

Long used to WASD gaming it has an unusual but fitting control system that you quickly get used to. I freely admit learning it was the only part of the game that wasn't smooth, and even saying that it's very quick to get used to.\n\nNot long into SWKotOR I began to realise and regret that I didn't play it sooner. As a long-time STAR WARS fan, and with how much I enjoyed STAR WARS Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy & STAR WARS Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast on release date because of how well-made they were I should've known how good SWKotOR would be.\n\nEven now I'm surprised with how well-written the game was. I couldn't stop playing it, couldn't wait to see how the relationships with the other characters would unfold, couldn't wait to get started on the next side quest.\n\nThe only gripe I had at all was that it was short - slowly pushing 100% of content played only took me a little over 40 hours.\n\nAfter you get to grips with the different controls you're going to love it if you're a STAR WARS fan of any kind.\n\nSWKotOR is an old, but superb game.","January 8","true","44.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I got this game when steam didn't even exist and it is the epitome of what games ought to be: worth the damn money.\n\nObviously it's Star Wars, so it's got that whole world going for it, even if it is now part of a disavowed canon. But beyond that there isn't a lot happening that was ground breaking for RPGs (maybe the decision based morality system, but I am not certain about that). So why should you buy it and play a thousand hours?\n\nThe story.\n\nIt's a compelling story of redemption if you want it to be. It's a compelling story of fate if you want it to be. It's just whatever you want it to be. Add in all the mods currently available and it is literally whatever you want it to be. Also, the restored content mod adds originally designed items and quests that got left out because LA loves to rush their ♥♥♥♥ to the market before it's finished.\n\nI mean, if you want to "be a Jedi", there are better games. Battlefront. Jedi Knight II. To an extent, the Force Unleashed series. All of these let you control more of the force powers and have something more akin to actual saber combat. But this game is all about the story:\n\nSith versus Republic, a band of warriors brought together to fight for (or against) peace, and a mysterious stranger recruited to help defeat (or supplant) the Sith apprentice become master, Darth Malak. You travel to worlds across the galaxy in order to figure out how the Sith are building their fleet more quickly than the Republic can defeat them. And with the addition of the "grey" Jedi, those who are neither light nor dark, maybe you decide it's best to sweep away the remnants of the Galactic Republic and rule it yourself.\n\nI mean, it's not canon anymore anyway. Do what you want.\n\nRecommended Buy, but only on sale because it goes on sale so often. It's worth the extra money, but I believe in you and your ability to exercise self-control until it's 75% off.","March 13","true","90.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a must play for Star Wars fans and Bioware fans. For Bioware fans, it's fairly similar in the formula of playing a character that is set on a task of saving the world/universe from the forces of evil, in this case, the Sith, while there is also the moral choice of following the dark side here, as well. But Bioware fans, more specifically, Mass Effect fans, will find it familiar for the numerous side quests, the collection of companions and taking two with you at a time. You get to a point where your companions travel through space with you on a ship and, like Mass Effect, the companions are located in various points of the ship.\n\nYes, I know, this game came out years before Mass Effect, but not everyone played it back then, and it should still appeal to a mass audience now. I'm glad the game is on Steam, as there are ways to get the game to play in full 1080 HD/16:9. It involves editing text files and running a patch, but it works and shouldn't be an issue, if you know what you're doing.\n\nThe plot, amazing. I shouldn't even have to talk about it. You play a soldier that wakes up in the middle of battle on a ship and you fight your way to the escape pods with your bunkmate. Along the way to escaping, you meet Carth, whom will become your closest ally for the rest of the game, and unfortunately, your bunkmate dies, sacrificing himself so you can escape. Carth, and yourself crashland on Taris in the escape pod, and from there, your wild adventure begins. From Taris, you find work, make money, figure out what's going on between the Republic and the Sith, meet various companions, the Big Z (a wookie) and Mission (a twi'lek). You meet the mercenary Canderous and eventually you get to learn how to race and finally, you meet Bastila, a Jedi who becomes your second closest companion.\n\nThere are more companions in the game, but I'd be diving into the story and other planets. As for your character, you uncover the fact that you are strong in the force and train to become a Jedi. And soon, you're on a  mission to save the world from the evil Sith, and Darth Malak, a formidable foe, and one hell of a boss. (I died too many times on the final fight, prepare to have plenty of medpacs)\n\nOverall, this game was insanely awesome.\n\n10/10","March 5, 2014","true","57.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a perfect bit of writing, ending with my very dodgy-looking Jedi (pale skin, yellowing eyes, red lightsaber) asking him, 'Am I supposed to be the snake?' He says, 'Well now, that's what I came to find out'.\n\n--\n\nKotOR is mostly an interactive story, and a really magical one. The writing is slightly dated by the standards set by Bioware's more recent hits, often slightly 'videogame-y' and always less cinematic than the likes of Mass Effect, but it's still just amazing. The combat is semi-turn based - very similar to Dragon Age: Origins or the recent Pillars of Eternity - but it's a lot of fun. And if you've ever wanted to play a game where Bioware absolutely live up to their promises and potential for once, then this is it. It's the one that put them on the map.\n\nIt's also the game to play if you're looking for that 'feel like you're in Star Wars' quality that games like Battlefront and Jedi Knight come so close to capturing but don't quite get. In an average 30-40 hour playthrough of KotOR you can expect to save / condemn the galaxy, ride swoop bikes, manipulate beaurocats and dodge docking fees with the Jedi mind trick, leap halfway across a map to cut sand-people in half, convert a lost dark Jedi back to the light (or the opposite), buy an assassin droid who calmly tells you how every single one of his former owners died by his hands and just how much he enjoyed it, and argue with all manner of space-Nazis about every facet of space-racism. It feels very 'Star Wars' and very 'Bioware' at the same time, but the two never clash.\n\nWhat the game does best is in breathing life and weight into the 'good versus evil' meter that so many RPGs had back then, and some still maintain shadows of (i.e. Mass Effect, The Walking Dead). KotOR's devs and writers were aware that they had the Star Wars licence for this one and that their story was supposed to be about Jedi knights. They took full advantage of the 'lure of the dark side' angle, allowing the cruelty or generosity of your actions to be meaningful and to form the centre of a game's story and theme. Who your character becomes is crucial to the plot, so deciding who to torture with lightning and who to donate money to makes all the difference in the world. It all builds up to a single brilliant decision and two very distinct, very satisfying endings. The game knows exactly what was so great about Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back (Vader, Yoda, the hero's journey, the dark side, the Falcon, the love story, the big twist, the world-building, the witty banter) and it lovingly packs it all in.\n\n--\n\nA polished, large, joyful Star Wars replica. It gets everything 'just right'.","May 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recently picked it up in the steam christmas sale for like 3 bucks. I played a couple days later to see how good it actually was. to be honest at first I absolutely hated it. the combat style was completely new to me and I had no idea about anything in the old republic era of star wars so I closd the game and didn't play it for another month. I opened it back up convinced that this game was something. I mean most people say that this is the greatest Star wars game ever, let alone rpg ever.\n\nI beat this game a couple hours ago and I have to say that this has been the best Star Wars game I have ever played in my life. Number one this game has an insane amount of content in it. I beat the main storyline in about 30 hours. Most games that hae come out recently don't have a storyline this long. The characters in this game are absolutely awesome to learn about and get to know through the game. the game incorporates a kind of moral system where decisions you make in the game effect whether you go to the dark side and go to the light side. This game has a very cool combat system (was you get the hang of it.) It is turn based so most people (at least me) was not used to this type of system. The graphics are very dated yes, but the game is by far playable. I honestly didn't really have a problem with them. But the best part of the game is that it feels completely "star wars" I really did feel as if I was imersed in the world of Star Wars.\n\nNow for cons of this game. In my opinion there isn't that many cons. The only ones I can think of is that your "bag" i guess or where you hold items in endless you can hold a million items if you wanted to which is cool but the items aren't very organized which is the con in this case. My other con is that after I beat the game I planned on doing all of the leftover side quests but when I beat it just rolled credits and I wasn't allowed to go back and do other things in the game which kind of annoyed me.\n\nMy final rating of this game would have to be 10/10.","February 15, 2015","true","30.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now, so many years later it hasn't lost it's apeal. The story and it's developement, the many hints that can give you the creeps - and still keep you guessing. Once again a good roleplaying game under the licence of Lucas Arts: Star Wars Trademark.\n\nGraphically dated, but yes there is an upgrade downloadable, there are also some unofficial mods to this game. The game itself is sealed in its story, there is no need to bugger around a lot - because the riddles and minigames are selfexplanatory. Being a Jedi can be quite a hard job at times... Decissions, decissions, decissions... and though some decissions can be quite deadly, others are more aimed at your preference about light and darkness. This time I decided to become a paragorn of the Light side... and, well, let's just say "Revan" died this time once and for all.\n\nBeing a Jedi doesn't mean that you can't use subterfuge or clandestine ops - but you have to make sure that you help others with it, helping out a young couple just to press their families and them out off their money, isn't a good way to start.\n\nOff course, the game plays in a time far beyond the main story of the original films of the second and "first" triologies - but, it's still Star Wars and it does play a lot like a Star Wars game - running through the windblown and forlorn dunes of Tatooine, you could quite well feel the "vibes" of things to come in the future.\n\nI can recomend this game on several reasons: It's a Star Wars game. It's a Bioware RPG. It has a lot of depth and is an immersive experience. And Lastly it's Star Wars...\n\nHave I forgotten something? Probably, but for this it's just no rocket science.","February 9, 2015","true","54.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But it's still playable if you can survive the atrocious screen resolution (it won't go higher than 1024x768, but you can make it Full HD with Flaweless Widescreen). Talking about the game itself, it's pretty good, I love all the party characters, they're deep and have a good development, some more than others. The story is pretty decent and easy to follow even if you have no clue about the Star Wars universe. The setting is convincing, you have a lot of things to do and the NPCs are very interesting. The combat on the other hand is kinda old school, from a time where dice rolls were a thing (they're still a thing in some other games), so don't come expecting a "Mass Effect combat" like I did, but it's decent if you know your way around the character creation. Don't be afraid to use guides and manuals. I could just don't recommend this game after all the frustration I had with it, but in the end, that's impossible. KOTOR is still a very good game and one I'm glad I played until the very end, against all odds.","May 6, 2015","true","35.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

In my opinion it's way better than KOTOR 2. It is much more challenging to play as a Light Side, because of difficult choices, instead of killing everything that goes on your path and become Sith Lord.\n\nThere are some not satisfying things in this game. It includes a LOT of running from one place to another, which can be boring. Even there is a fast travel, it's limited to your hideout/ship and location you currently are. Also, being bounty hunter or just regular person with range weapon is pointless, since you are Jedi/Sith.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the best SW games ever.\n\n10/10","May 11, 2015","true","26.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now, so many years later it hasn't lost it's apeal. The story and it's developement, the many hints that can give you the creeps - and still keep you guessing. Once again a good roleplaying game under the licence of Lucas Arts: Star Wars Trademark.\n\nGraphically dated, but yes there is an upgrade downloadable, there are also some unofficial mods to this game. The game itself is sealed in its story, there is no need to bugger around a lot - because the riddles and minigames are selfexplanatory. Being a Jedi can be quite a hard job at times... Decissions, decissions, decissions... and though some decissions can be quite deadly, others are more aimed at your preference about light and darkness. This time I decided to become a paragorn of the Light side... and, well, let's just say "Revan" died this time once and for all.\n\nBeing a Jedi doesn't mean that you can't use subterfuge or clandestine ops - but you have to make sure that you help others with it, helping out a young couple just to press their families and them out off their money, isn't a good way to start.\n\nOff course, the game plays in a time far beyond the main story of the original films of the second and "first" triologies - but, it's still Star Wars and it does play a lot like a Star Wars game - running through the windblown and forlorn dunes of Tatooine, you could quite well feel the "vibes" of things to come in the future.\n\nI can recomend this game on several reasons: It's a Star Wars game. It's a Bioware RPG. It has a lot of depth and is an immersive experience. And Lastly it's Star Wars...\n\nHave I forgotten something? Probably, but for this it's just no rocket science.","February 9, 2015","true","54.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love how this game makes you learn bit by bit "the truth", until the final revelation. I also liked the characters, and if any of your companions annoy you, it's your choice if you want to bring them in your adventures or not. And the weapons... whoa. At the end of the game, I had like 30 different weapons (lightsabres, swords, heavy blaster rifles, blaster pistols, etc.) and lots of equippable stuff like armour, energy shields or cybernetic implants. But the dark side/light side alignment system is an even greater feature. Depending on your actions and what you say, your character will either gain light side points or dark side points. So choose your words carefully, they can change the whole game.\n\n\n\nSpoilers\n\nWARNING There is one single spoiler that can ruin the whole game if you know it. Even if you're stuck, DO NOT read for walkthroughs or whatever, because most of the time they will reveal the main plot of the story. I'm telling you this because I also checked for walkthroughs and they just spoilt the main thing that makes you understand the whole story before the end of the game.\n\nBut this game is so epic that despite of the spoiler, it was still one of the greatest games I've ever played. Thank you George Lucas and Bioware.\n\n\n\n12/10","September 20, 2014","true","77.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/recommended/32370/","Pakkidis","Pakkidis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/","1250 products in account","Rating 7.5/10\nOverview: Turn Based RPG\n\nThe Good\n\n+ The game has a lot of robust options in how you build your character. You start by choosing between 3 classes, soldier, scout or scoundrel. Each class obviously focuses on different aspects of combat. Further in the game you can then choose the Jedi you wish to be: Guardian, Consular or Sentinel. You can fully customize your character how you wish between attributes, skills, feats and jedi powers. All of this leads to many different options and replaybility in how you design your character\n\n+The core aspect of the game is that as you can either play as a Jedi that is good or evil. Saving people, being kind and choosing the peaceful solution leads you to the light side while doing the opposite leads you to the darkside. Doing so leads to certain bonuses to your Jedi Powers. Being good means Lightside powers will use less mana and darkside powers cost more and viceversa. I find the system to be very effective because it ties morality choices into gameplay, a feature that seems to be very lacking in today's modern games.\n\n+The game supports a solid story that is engaging throughout the entire game. Dialogue is well done although a bit heavy on exposition in the beginning.\n\n+As is the case with every Bioware game, the supporting cast of characters are interesting and unique and features some of the best writing in the game. Getting to know your companions and there back stories is one of the highlights of the game.\n\n+The game has plenty of interesting sidequests that are fun to play and depending on how you solve them really start to shape your character. I wish there was more ambiguity with the quests because it becomes very obvious which is the good and evil way to solve them. A moral grey area would have made choices tougher to make.\n\n+ The game takes place across a series of planets within the Star Wars universe. Each location feels different from the last and has a rich back story that just adds to the authenticity.\n\n\nThe Average\n\nCombat in the game is basic, simply select your choice of attack then watch and hope your character can actually connect with a hit. It doesn't feel very engaging especially in the later parts of the game when you become really powerful.\n\nThe game had many graphical glitches and bugs in certain areas that made it difficult to play.\n\nFinal boss is frustrating\n\nThere are a lot of areas in the game that feel big and empty.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe UI especially navigating to find items in your inventory is a chore and frustrating. The inventory screen is a long list of your items. Finding a specific item can be problematic, for example, if you find a data pad and want to read it, you have to open your inventory scroll through a long list of items until you find it. If you have other datapads in your inventory that you haven't checked yet then you have to check each one until you find the one you're looking for. There are options to filter the list based on specific items but this doesn't fix the overall problem of a bad overall inventory management system.\n\nConclusion\n\nI have played this game many times before it came on steam and having it in my library I decided to play it again to see how well it holds up and I was pleasantly surprised. This game feels like the blueprint for Mass Effect as it shares many similarities in its design choices.\n","December 14, 2014","true","22.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

Some people may not have much trouble starting it but a majority are not able to get this game to run without spending a significant amount of time troubleshooting. The first time two years ago after nearly an hour of trying fixes the game finally ran after character creation. I was about two minutes in  but could not figure out how to progress. Turns out it was bugged. More troubleshooting and I manage to finally get to the next part of the mission only for it to be bugged again. After a few hours I could not get the game at any more playable of a state. One year later I give it another shot and this time I can't even get the first mission to load.

I will first start out with how this is one of my favorite game titles from the sixth generation of console's. I was never a true Star Wars game or movie fan, sure I played some games like; star Wars BF 1&2, Star Wars Republic Commando which I would also recommend to any Star Wars fan. Now the KotoR series shows a deep connection not to the history made by George Lucas(not to discredid the man since I do not know how much he has contributed to the historical lore of his series) which the fanbase has mostly made for the accounting matters of most stories before and after the Star Wars Saga(all 6 movies). This Game was the second Star wars game I fell in love with after the first few hours of playing on the original Xbox. The mechanics were something I never really liked in most games and I admit I shrugged it off in terms of not wanting to play it since it went far off what I was used to for gameplay. The story, the Characters, the complete immersion of the destinies of people you interact with that could alter the fate of an entire planet quicker than you would have known of in a game like this. In short I really love this and KotoR II. Because of this game in particular, I have started down the evil path in all decision based games with a morality center like Jade Empire. then I just do everything different on the next playthrough. A lot of the game is laughable in today's sense of "Modern Gaming" or in the everything about the game's graphical engine and motor physics of the semi-turn-based combat which was as close to a then modern miracle/innovative as it could be at the time in "my" opinion. So yea, I will love and keep supporting games like these and if someone knows of more games like this just leave a msg at the end of the comment or msg my profile. 100/100 Don't mind the almost no play time on the thing, I have logged more than 80 on console","January 13, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I originally played KOTOR II on the original Xbox; it was one the best video game experiences I've ever had despite some of the issues with the game. Nearly 9 years later I started using steam and I noticed the KOTOR series on sale. I bought the two games and I must say that was the best decision I've made in a long time. Let me start off with a brief synopsis for those who are unaware of the story of KOTOR I. You essentially play a character with no background. Your first mission is to find a Jedi named Bastilla who was onboard the ship that you were on when it got attacked. Once you rescue her and escape with your new crew, you begin to learn the way of the Jedi on Dantooine. You get to choose the path you want to travel: the light side or the dark side. There is an evil sith lord named Malak who must be stopped, so you can either save the galaxy or become one of the most powerful sith lords. The choice is yours. Along the way you will befriend people and maybe lose them depending on your choices. Now I'm not going to go much more into the story; that is for you to discover dear reader.\n\nIf you are a Star Wars fan, then get this. You can't call yourself a fan without having played this game. If you love RPGs, then get this game. Some issues are the d20 combat system that might seem unengaging and annoying at times. The story is a bit too black and white, but keep in mind that the Star Wars series in general has held a black and white morality viewpoint. This was just a minor issue for me because I had played KOTOR II before this game and it seemed to do a better job at making the morality of both the Jedi and the Sith greyish. The game might also seem a bit dated now, but trust me it holds up fairly well. The sheer mythology of Star Wars should be enough for you to buy this game. Even if you don't consider yourself a Star Wars fan, you will still enjoy this game. I hope this review answers any questions you had.

Knights of the Old Republic focuses on the span of time after the Mandalorian Wars of the Old Republic, and follows a soldier with little recollection of their past.  The graphics are pretty well done, best enchanced with mods (I have tons of awesome mods on mine that add in content and bring in hd graphics), the gameplay is simple and well executed, and the storyline is a great one to add to your Star Wars repitoee (sp?)  There are some things that sort of get left behind for your character, such as melee weapons and ranged weapons and combative skills that go with them once you become a Jedi (or Sith if that's what you want to role-play) however they still help your companions.  The companion system is great, allowing either 0,1, or 2 companions - be sure to check with all of them for specific content related to your companions!  One game-breaking bug that should be mentioned... try to do Tattoine last if at all possible.  There is a companion mission that leads you to tatooine that gets broken if you have gone to particular places before getting the quest - I could provide more info but that would be a spoiler.  Pick up this great game and have fun!","July 4, 2014","true","91.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
