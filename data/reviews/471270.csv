If you ever wished how bird\'s flapped their wings for hour\'s try this game and see if you can!\n\nFlap your arms to sore through the different stages of the game, dodge everything in your path or try to fly through it.\n\nI didn\'t get any VR nausia playing this game but i do have sore shoulder\'s from all the flaps i do :)","June 1","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Caigan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caigan/","1157 products in account","An amusing take on what is, in essence, Flappy Bird / Runner style game. You literally flap your arms to fly upward, and you can dive downward by holding the trackpad. Lane swiching is done with the triggers, or can be changed in the options to take advantage of roomscale.\n\nI didn't get any dizzyness from the movement system. You can see your beak in front of you as a sort of point of reference, and flapping your arms gives you the sense that you are controlling yoru movement. .","May 27","true","0.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","1"

This one makes me queasy. I was drawn to the mechanic of flapping arms to make the wings go--very cute, right?--but there's one problem with the implementation: the bird I'm supposed to be is below me. Disorienting. Am I supposed to be riding this bird like an invisible gnome, controlling its wings with puppet strings? That's how it feels. Maybe I'd feel less motion sick if I was the POV of the bird. Not sure. The diving mechanic doesn't make physical sense to me, and the swooping back up makes me nausious.\n\nDevelopers please try adding these options:\n* be the POV of the bird itself\n* steer to different lanes by banking with the arms at diagonals","May 27","false","0.2"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","15","26","2","8"
