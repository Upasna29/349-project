YOU GINGER DEMON.\n\nThis is my first attempt at this game and it was going pretty well until Sole went and ♥♥♥♥ed up everything. Literally.\n\nFor some reason I just had a real urge to play some kind of sim game recently. I didn't want anything overly complicated and I remembered these games. I used to watch my sister play them when I was a bit younger and always thought they looked fun. It's a little nostalgic playing this myself now, I'm hoping I can solve all the puzzles, get all the upgrades and build up a fairly good village before I lose.\n\nI think it’s pretty fun for something to check on every now and then and try and figure out all the puzzles. The Puzzles and survival element being the majority of the game. You raise a village by giving villagers jobs, making them breed and using your newly trained villagers to make discoveries. There are 16 puzzles to solve, all of which are discoveries you can lead your villagers to.\n\nThe game is made a bit harder by “random events” that happen, which usually gives you a choice and you can either benefit from it or something bad can happen. It’s possible to gain/lose part of your food supply, your research and even be hit by disease.\n\nI’ve been playing this in-between the main games I’m trying to complete and once I have done everything here, there are a few sequels I can move onto for more puzzles and such!\nI look forward to trying the others out as well.\n\nAll in all it’s a fun little game/franchise. It’s nothing amazing but it kills time in a fun way I would say.\n\n\nTL;DR : A fun little sim game. It’s not the best game in the world but it’s a good time killer between other things.\n","January 1","true","18.9"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","94","31","33","35","2"

You watch over your little survivors, guide them to make the right choices, and choose in various random events what to do. It's real time, meaning if you forget about your survivors you might find your tribe wiped after half a week (although you can pause the game), it doesn't take much time at once, but it's surprsingly addictive gameplay makes you return again and again. Try the Demo. Now.","July 18, 2012","true","9.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I remember how much I used to love it when I was younger. I've been wanting to play it for a while so I finally gave the ten dollars necessary to do so. I now somewhat regret my decision because the countless hours I used to have fun with this game no longer hold up.\n\nSure it's nice to have a real-time game that you can check on periodically like you do with Facebook or a virtual pet. This game however lacks the certain fun qualities of a real-time game. Your villagers randomly die while you're not playing and it doesn't clue you in on why it happened so that you can prevent it in the future.\n\nOverall, I would say this game is worth three dollars max. I regret paying so much for it, but now I know what seemed fun when I was younger may not be the case in present day.","December 27, 2013","false","9.5"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","1"

It was extremely fun, but the demo didn't let me enjoy it to the max.\n\nAfter setting up a steam account, I noticed this game was on here and I decided to buy it for that nostalgic feel.\nAlthough it has its quirks, cons, etc, I still fairly enjoyed it and for a game made so many years ago, I - for one - had lots of fun with it and consider it a pretty decent game considering what it is.\n\nIf you can get over the few cons in it, its a pretty decent game - not perfect or extremely good, but I'll still recommend it. :)","April 4, 2015","true","32.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Basically, you have some shipwrecked people and you have to figure out 16 puzzles and level up 6 skills (techs) to help your villagers prosper.  You can set individual villagers to do different tasks like forage, build, heal, research, and breed, The villagers will grow old or can sick so watch out for that.  It's a real time game, which means the game continues on when you're not playing.\n\nBe warned, this game does not ♥♥♥♥ around about the real time aspect. Last night I had 13 villagers (mostly females) and I set one male to be a breeder. I woke up to find I had 63 villagers ( 5 scientist adults and everyone else was a child), almost  no food and a pile of skeletons. The real time can make losing easy.","November 16, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
