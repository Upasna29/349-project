Basically, everything is bigger than you.\n\nGameplay\nAbout 10 maps, different game modes which are all fun, you all start with the same weapons, you don't buy ammo, you don't call for 'air support', or such.\nIt's a pretty simple and minimal game, and i love it for that, lately i've been too annoyed about the lack of actual fun shooters/online games that are also minimal.\n\nCommunity\nWell, it's too early to talk about the community, but, you shouldn't consider it much, basically, toxic players are in every game.\nHowever i made this small section in my review to tell you a funny store that happened to me earlier in this game.\nSomeone randomly said 'Votekick X', i tried to defend that one 'X' because it didn't seem fair since he didn't do anything. That 'X' that was votekicked, actually votekicked me and said 'lol'.\n\nFEW CONS\nFirst of all, the devs seem like they take care of the game, and they seem to be interested in actually solving problems, i point these out for them, in case someone slipped the details on the forums, and they actually read my review.\n\n- Sudden loss of connection, happens basically, after almost every match, sometimes before joining one.\n- The 'Find Game' option, often finds a game that is already full, which can be quite frustrating.\n- There is too much "invisible unwalkable space" (sorry, can't really describe it better as English is not my main language). Basically, you can walk too close to a teammate or you will be blocked by some invisible space. Which can be bad if a teammate is AFK in some sort of small space. You can't walk past him even if there seems to be plenty of space.\n- The votekicking can use some improvement, but i am pretty sure it's a bit obvious, and you probably didn't work on it so far because you were focused on the game itself.\n\nSo far, so good, i received this game as a gift, a beautiful gift that make me chuckle quite a bit upon seeing it. Also, brings me alot of childhood memories.\nDamn you, nostalgia!\n\nNOTE:\nRegarding the lost connection issue, i think it's because of the ping, when you browse for servers join the ones with the lowest ping.\n\nPS:\nI would love a Steam Workshop for this, and some easy ways to create content for it :)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=573615922","December 11, 2015","true","5.9"," 103 of 112 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","103","112","5","10"

There were Army Men, but unfortunately I never got my hands on that game. This game makes me feel like a kid again and it's a damn good feeling. I absolutely recommend this game and here's why:\n\nThere are 10 maps and each map has it's own gamemode. There will be more maps and gamemodes coming soon according to the developers. Each map design is astonishing and the detail put into them is amazing. Sometimes you just want to look at your surroundings and appreciate the thought put into those maps. There are 6 weapons you can use which are the classic assault rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher, sniper rifle, flamethrower and a grenade. As of right now, flamethower is mostly used for objective maps rather than as a weapon, since in recent update it was nerfed pretty badly, however, shotgun is a VERY powerful weapon in close range. The game doesn't really have a big learning curve and gameplay is very simple. You just hop in a game and have a good time. If you have a friend to play with, I highly recommend it, because I find the game much more enjoyable when you play it with a friend. Soundtrack is very catchy and probably one of the best I've heard in years. Developers are very active in Community Hub and they are always there to assist you with your problem.\n\nWhile I highly recommend this game, there are also things that need to be fixed. Firstly, I think that shotgun should have a nerf, since it's mostly a one shot kill from a close distance. In smaller maps people mostly use only shotgun, because there's no reason not to. Secondly, I've noticed that the flamethrower does not register its hits as much as it should. There's no use in using it as a weapon as of right now. And last thing should be progression. I like games where it's simple, but there should be something that keeps players coming back. It doesn't have to be something fancy, but at least badges or levels for your accomplishments would be a great start. Sometimes it just feels to repetitive and you don't feel satisfaction in winning a game. It does feel amazing to make a plan with your friend and succeed in it with or without a reward, though.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite games and I can't wait for new content!","February 4","true","24.1"," 73 of 77 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","73","77","8","3"

I can see teams of five people, using team speak, really making something of this.   I can see tactics etc being used to win matches amongst five friends.\n\nThere are a few different game modes... the one involving the fooz table is my favourite so far... basically you have to score a goal whiles killing other army men!!\n\nPlenty more scope... I haven’t played loads yet... but i'm gunna suggest my mates get this so we can all have a go.\n\n-ve points\n\nThere are only 5 people on each side.\n\nThere could be more customisation/weapons to make the game more in depth.\n\nThere could be a chat function so users with microphones can communicate if they want too.\n\nI would love to see swimming and parachutes... but maybe I am greedy!\n\nIt is difficult to get a game at this point in time... although I do realise this is brand new and not many people have got it yet.

There are usally about 3~7 populated servers.\n\n8.5/10\n\nThere are 10 modes and 10 maps. In other words... One mode for one map. You can't play other game mode with said map. Every one of them is designed for their specific game mode. Everyone of them has their own (nice, happy) BGM too.\n\nGunplay: You have one rifle, shotgun, sniper, RPG, grenades and flamethrower.\nUnless you die easily, you will be forced to use your rifle. The other weapons have a reasonably big lack of ammo (the game has ammo regen) while your rifle will have 200+ bullets. I didn't notice any bullet drop, but there is a max distance.

You battle in between gigantic doughnuts, bubbles from a sink, and your mission is to knock over the enemy cup so that they can't zipline into the level anymore. There are so many creative objectives placed on colourful and alive maps. It's a nice breath of fresh air in the shooter genre.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite simple. You sprint, jump, shoot and roll. The combat at the moment isn't very in-depth. There are no weapon pick-ups, you just have all 5 on you at once. No killstreak rewards, or class systems. Personally, I like it. It's very simple and easy to pick up and have fun with. My only gripe at the moment is the game's cap is 5 vs 5 which leaves some of the bigger maps feeling a tad bit empty sometimes, although the devs have said they plan to raise that, as well as add more content in the future, which is great to hear!\n\nThat's really all there is to say.\nOverall, simple gameplay but the fun variety of objectives and maps keeps the game fresh!","December 9, 2015","true","10.0"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","43","52","4","2"

You either create or pick a lobby, pick a side; either green or tan, you vote for a map, and the greatest war of our time begins... The fight for green or tan supremacy.\n\nThe game over all as of this review currently only has 10 maps, each map having it's own specific game mode assigned to it, ranging from capture the flag in a fish tank, to defending cookies on a train going around a Christmas tree, to my personal favorite two teams attempting to thaw out their toy dinosaurs in a freezer with flame throwers.\n\nEach game mode and map consists of teams of 5 versus 5, theirs no specific classes or anything like that, you basically spawn with 5 weapons at your disposal, your standard rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, missile launcher, and flamethrower; each with a set amount of ammo that will replenish with a cool down effect once used up.\n\n\nBut is it any good? Let's find out with...\n\nTHE GOOD\n-Maps and game modes are the star of the game and extremely unique and fun to play in and explore\n-Simple and easy to learn but effective gameplay with tons of variety in the game modes\n-Looks fantastic and runs smoothly even on mid-tier computers\n\n\nProbably the best part about Plastic Warfare is easily the map designs and concept of the game itself, heavily reminding of games from years past such as the Army Men Series and Toy Commander on the SEGA Dreamcast. Plastic Warfare's maps are absolutely fantastic, unique, and a joy to explore, but not only that the game modes that accompany them are just as creative.\n\nEverything from trying to capture your enemies flags on rubber ducks in a bathtub, to lighting more candles than the opposing team for a birthday cake, to as I mentioned earlier trying to thaw out a plastic dinosaur, all while still including classic game modes you'd expect such as capture the flag, but however now in a fish tank, to your classic death match mode but now set up on a game board originally meant for dice rolling and for plastic army men, to plenty more the variety in game modes and maps in this game are fantastic.\n\nThe gameplay overall itself is simple enough to pick up and play straight from the start without much of a learning curve to it, I don't expect this game to attempt to become an e-sport or anything but the gameplay itself is effective, each weapon you're equipped with all have their uses and right times to utilize them, none of them I thought felt over powered or unbalanced which for a new release title is a pretty good feat to achieve and depending on well your team works together you can easily dominate the match if the other team is just focused on thinking it's nothing but a death match mode.\n\nNow graphically Plastic Warfare looks absolutely fantastic, running on the Unreal 4 Engine the texture work and environments across the 10 maps look great, not to mention all while running extremely smooth even on a mid-tier computer like mine.\n\nThe environments are bright and colorful as well with tons of attention to detail and great ideas for the map designs, the character models of the army men stand out enough to spot and shoot them as well and the animations are passable, but over all the game simply looks and runs great.\n\nThe soundtrack as well is pretty decent, each map has it's own specific theme, most of which are pretty decent, but I personally hated the birthday cake map's soundtrack after about 30 seconds of hearing it. But over all the soundtrack pretty great.\n\nBut now let's discuss...\n\nTHE BAD\n-Matchmaking is a bit of pain and connection issues\n-5 vs 5 Is a bit lacking and I feel some maps could have increased the player count\n-Texture pop-in and other minor graphical issues\n\nDuring my 3 to 4 hours or so I spent with The Mean Greens probably my biggest issue with it, is simply the matchmaking was a bit of a pain, not to mention a few connection issues.\n\nTrying to actually FIND a game for me personally at times was a bit of a mess, probably because it was the weekend, I'm not sure, but I had a number of host was lost connecting issues and was booted back to the main menu more times than I can count after failing to connect, so then I had to go back into the server list again and wait some more while it refreshed again which became a tad bit annoying.\n\nThen throw in match making issues and trying to actually play with my friend, it just added to the annoyance of it all, once we were connected together, the game had trouble even finding any matches for us once we got the party system going, which more or less forced us to simply create our own lobby and server and wait on other players instead.\n\nBut honestly that's probably one of the only major complaints I have with this game and I'm sure it'll be fixed with future updates or at least here's hoping as this is a game I could easily see myself playing some more of in the future.\nMy next issue, much more minor and opinionated, I felt some of the maps could have benefited with a higher player count than 5 vs 5, as there were times I had a hard time even finding people on some of the larger more death match focused maps such as the Art Table map, but I'm sure with modding from the community and future updates this will also change.\n\nGraphically I only had the odd stutter or weird frame rate inconsistency here and there, but that's more than likely due to my mid-tier computer set up at the moment. However I noticed despite running on max settings the game still did suffer from some minor pop in issues here and there when the maps first loaded in.\n\nBut now it's time I give...\n\n\nTHE OPINION\n\nNow if you're like me and you stumbled onto this on the front page of Steam, it probably caught your eye, it sure did for me and I can definitely recommend this to anyone who maybe interested, the gameplay is fast paced, simple yet effective, and fun.\n\nThe maps and game modes are gorgeous looking and unique and if you've got some friends looking for a game to play over the next weekend or two this wouldn't be a bad choice and for only $10 it's fair on the price.\nI had a ton of fun during my roughly 4 hours with it and couldn't recommend it enough, hopefully the match making gets improved with future patches, I can definitely see myself playing this more in the future.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","December 13, 2015","true","4.0"," 51 of 70 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","51","70","2","0"

All maps are very enjoyable with each having it's own game mode, music and home inspired ambiance much like the atmospheres you'd create as a child out of ordinary household items for a proper setup for your toys to have an all out battle. With the maps offering variety there is not much favoritism towards any specific maps which means players do not vote for the same map or two over and over endlessly like players in other games tend to make a habit. There's a pretty cool freezer map and a pretty sweet cake map as well! If you enjoy fast paced third person shooters I urge you to get this game! The gameplay itself is reasonably basic which I have been really enjoying. Everyone is equal from the start due to the game not having any ranks, upgrades or perks which in my opinion is marvelous since that means you have to rely on skill, tactics and hustle rather than having an unfair advantage on less fortunate players. As I said, everyone is equal as soon as they play the game, so as long as you're a decent shooter you should be able to do just fine! The community has been very kind so far as I have yet to run into any rude or arrogant players, so no need to worry about immature elitists and enjoy yourself! This has quickly become one of my favorite games due to it's competitive gameplay and yet silly charm, I highly recommend this game!","December 15, 2015","true","35.8"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","6"

Design and stage aesthetics are incredible, gameplay...less so. Not that it's particularly bad, it just doesn't live up to the inspired art direction. Maps feel large and varied, but most are linear without forwarding spawn points, which leads to a lot of stalemates on objective-based maps.\n\nFor me, the clear passion and inspiration that went into the stages and throwback gameplay were worth the price of admission. There are no loadouts, classes, or levelling systems. Just dead-simple, fun Green vs. Tan gameplay.\n\nAs an addendum, developers are set to add at least 10 (!!!) more maps, along with gameplay tweaking as time goes on.

Well, why not, it's not like this is the first time game used those. Suddenly an onslaught of soldiers looks kind of cute, instead of severed limbs you get shattered plastic and there is no blood. So apart from the theme, what is this all about? The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is a multiplayer third person shooter in which two sides of plastic soldiers, greens and tans, fight on a variety of über cute maps with their plastic arsenal.\n\nEach side can have five soldiers at most and while you cannot pick different types of little warriors, you can pick from a variety of weapons to use. Each soldier carries an M4, sniper riflle, shotgun, rocket launcher and flamethrower from which you can choose on the go. Have you used all your sniper rifle ammo? No problem, take out your shot gun and run around for a moment while your ammo gets automatically replenished, that is if you live long enough. I would say that neither of these weapons is weaker than others maybe apart from rocket launcher; which however can fire just one rocket before having to replenish ammo. The gun handling itself is far from being unique as it is very arcade like, fitting with the theme of the game I would say. If you are a fan of realism... well, you would not be even reading this review so whatever.\n\nSoldiers can duke it out on an astounding number of 10 maps (hi SW) each equipped with a different mode ranging from typical deatch match and capture the flag to candle lighting on a birthday party. The theme of the game let the devs to come up with some really unique arenas for the soldiers to fight in which is in my opinion the biggest perk of the game. Who would not enjoy a ride on a toy train around a christmas tree or an onslaught inside a Foosball. When you are riding a little gummy duck inside a bathtub you won't even care that the graphics are not exactly perfect and some textures could use a little more work which brings me to the next part of this review, graphics.\n\nAs I have said, the game is not the "bestest" looker on the market, devs of The Mean Greens tried to bring us a fully 3D experience and as many small indie studios kinda struggle with the delivery; However for what it is, the game is pleasant to look at. It is very colorful and one will forgive it the sometimes too rough edges and blurry textures. From a technical standpoint the game runs fine and I did not notice any major hiccups on an upper mid-end desktop. In settings there are plenty of options to fiddle with while trying to get a better performance from a lower end machine.\n\nAll in all, The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is a pretty decent game which cannot, and in my opinuon should not, compete with the popular shooters like CS:GO or Overwatch; However in itself can bring a lot of joy if you are a fan of arcade shooting in an unique arenas while listening to a pretty neat soundtrack. The main question will be whether it can keep the servers running and populated and for how long. So should you buy it? For 10 bucks it is not a bad deal whether you are bored of competitive shooters and want to relax or want a not so brutal game for your young ones so feel free to grab it, it works and it's fun!","December 10, 2015","true","2.7"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

All the visuals are so good and the aesthetic and all the looks about it are just perfect! The gameplay... it could use some fixin' up.\n\nAlthough the game looks stunning when you actually play it you notice quite a few issues with it, here are the ones I have found so far:\n\n40% of the time when someone shoots you there is no way of telling you have been shot, your health goes down but there is no red semi circle or even sound effect. The circle appears sometimes and I can't even tell if there is a sound effect for being shot.\nThe flamethrowers are way way too op. Maybe they're supposed to be a replacement for the knife but at close range they can kill you in less than half a second before you even have time to react, the gamemodes where its hard to be a flamethrowing ♥♥♥♥♥ are the best.\nEXAMPLE: I was playing a CTF and on the other team there was a guy who kept using a flamethrower, by the end of the game no one even got to their flag as flamethrowers were camping there and our team managed to kill off the 2 people that actually tried to get our flag. The end results show the flamethrower guy had 32 kills 2 deaths and his other team members combined had about 7 kills (three other people). Our team of also four people had combined kills of about 20 or less. FIX THE FLAMETHROWERS PLEASE\nI don't know why, maybe its the lag in the servers or maybe I'm just really crap at this game but I have played a lot of other deathmatch games such as GTA V and I do often get MVP so I know what aiming is. Whenever I aim and shoot at someone it's a 50/50 chance of actually having my bullets land.\nLast of all I just want to say that the last time I played this game there were about 4 flamethrower guys in my server and I just got so fed up of jumping server to server just to find some honest people who actually use real guns that don't have infinite ammo :l and therefore I don't even want to play this game anymore until they do something about it.\n\nI'm not crying about being a n00b, I'm just pointing out an easy exploit that ruins the spirit of the game for me. I will upvote this game but only because I do actually like the game; 40% of the players?

There were a few exceptions for me (Halo 2, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 1 and 2), but I couldn't get into any of them. The Mean Greens, however, tapped into the part of me that remembers the aforementioned 3D0 Army Men Sarge's Heroes games [and just to be clear, I played the PlayStation versions of those games; I hated the N64 versions...), and reminded me that these games don't have to be all doom-and-gloom, ultra-realistic, or boring and gritty-looking.\n\nAesthetically, the game looks gorgeous, running at a full 1080p 60FPS [when on max settings]. The environments are just like the ones you'd find 2-inch tall plastic toys playing in. The kitchen, a bathtub, a living room, a table, a fish tank, a refridgerator... it's all here and accounted for. They're all full of wackiness and creativity, and I loved every single map.\n\nGameplay-wise, it reminded me so much of (you know the games by now). There's new stuff like sprinting, an admittedly better aiming system (simply hold down the right mouse button), and it controls very, very nicely. I was playing with both a controller (a PS4/DualShock 4 controller) and a mouse and a keyboard. While I personally prefer the latter, using a controller, at least a DS4 one, feels very natural for this game, and it works as well as any other shooter.\n\nThe online itself was fun, fast and frantic. The maps are small (or, um, a little smaller than big? Not that small but still big? How to word this... but they're by no means super small or compact) but that doesn't make them any less fun. Plus, in each map, there's a different objective. In one map, you have your average "slayer", but in another, you'll be having to thaw out a dinosaur frozen in ice (using a flamethrower) before your opposing team thaws theirs first. Every map doesn't have the same mode, which is really refreshing for a genre like this. The different modes were all fun to play and I didn't really have complaints with any of them.\n\nBut at this point this may all seem like blind praise, but these are the words I'm sticking to. Obviously, I may have a small nostalgic bias because of how much this game reminded me of my beloved Sarge's Heroes games, but nevertheless, The Mean Greens delivers in all aspects of fun, entertainment, action, and everything it's trying to achieve.\n\nI had an awesome time playing the game and I hope a lot of other people will, too.\n\nSeriously, just go play it. This really isn't something you want to miss out on.","December 8, 2015","true","59.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

Well, It's a third-person multiplayer shooter based on the UNREAL engine, featuring, as might already know, toy soldiers. Gameplay is quite simple, but this simplicity somehow makes this game even more fun. Basically, It's just simple toy-styled game where you can just play and relax in the end of the day. Of course, there are different gamemodes and maps, and, talking about maps, they are very well designed, colorful and full of decorations. Graphics is nice, however, there are some texture pop-ups, but they are not very annoying. Another good point is that game runs nice on my aged hardware (AMD Athlon II X4, 4gb ram, XFX Radeon HD 7750 (1gb vram)). There are some troubles with connecting to servers, but most of them are already fixed.\nAll in all, The Mean Greens is quite simple but solid game which can bring your childhood back to life. You should definately buy it when it's on sale.","December 25, 2015","true","5.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","0"

Re-creating the battle of the kitchen or the most infamous battle of the bathtub where an entire division drowns to death in your human mucky water!  But now, you can do these battles on your PC, isn’t exciting…? Well it is absolutely MARVELLOUS!!!\n\nThe Mean Greens – Plastic Warfare is a third person online multiplayer shooter game where you play either a Green or a Tan toy soldier in 10 unique and well-designed maps. You will play the “Barnyard Ball” map (one of my favourites) where you not only have to eliminate as many soldiers as possible but score up to 3 goals to win the game; or the “Kitchen Run’ map where you have to push the enemy cup over the benchtop to win the round!\n\nYour soldier will have a number of weapons at his disposal, 5 in total: machine guns, shotgun, sniper rifle, flame thrower and the all mighty bazooka to teach one or two tricks to your enemies. I thoroughly enjoy hiding behind the sponge waiting for a figurine to pass by and greet him with a small missile (rocket) to blow him out of the kitchen! FUN…! FUN…! FUN…!\n\nControls are really easy to use; you run, jump, crouch, roll and of course shoot at plastic figurines. The game runs very well and you will be treated with a great soundtrack. The graphics are wonderful and the game is a great price!\n\nPlenty of dedicated servers to play on, including some Australian ones!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun and addictive\n-	10 unique maps and modes\n-	Dedicates servers\n-	Great Graphics and Soundtracks\n-	Great price\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	None!!\n\nThe Mean Greens – Plastic Warfare is truly the surprise game of this year for me!\n\n10/10 +10% for good measure!\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I will list the pros and cons of this game.\nPros:\n+The game is colorful and enjoying to look at, maps like "Art table" are just riddled with colors, the lighting in the game is done right too.\n+It runs like butter on my pc, and on my cheap laptop, I can't really imagine anyone experiencing framedrops with a decent setup.\n+The music is catchy and nice to listen too, I had a smile on my face when I first heard the song during operation birthday, or hearing ride of the valkyres during Bathtub bash.\n+Everyone has all the guns at all times, there is no reason to complain being killed.\n+Each map has it's own game mode, all with different varieties. Modes like team deathmatch in the Table top wars map, FFA in the art table shuffle, Attack and defend in Operation birthday cake, and one of my favorites which is bathtub bash, a mode where you must ride rubber duckys to reach flags and deliver the flags back to your ship.\n\nNow If what I said above is convincing you to buy the game, what I say next can probably change that.\nCons:\n-While there are a ton of different game modes, some quite work out. In the map Operation birthday, the objective is to assault a birthday cake and light as much candles as you can while the enemy team stops you. After around halftime, the sides switch, so if team 1 lit 10 candles, all team 2 has to do is light 11. If team 2 lights 11 within the first minute, you've already won the game, and must wait the next 3 minutes until the round ends to be declared the winner (Which I think is stupid). Some game modes just require suicide to win. In the game modes Kitchen run and Deep freeze, all you have to do is run to your objective and do the action it tells you to (such as pushing the enemy cup off the table or unfreezing your dinosaur), so you can play the game for 4 minutes in a straight up tie, but 1 enemy touched your cup just slightly, and you lost the game.\n-The servers can be absolutely horrible at times, you can hit join game and be waiting up to 3 minutes just so it could tell you that you failed to connect.\n-The worst one would have to be-\nThe game is completely empty, I hit server browser only to find out there are 10 players online in TOTAL, if you are lucky you can find a server with maybe 6 people, and people usually leave during it. The game is fun with people to play, and no one ever plays.\n\nConclusion: I don't see the $10 dollar price being worth it up to now, I bought the game on release and I still don't feel like it was a good buy, but I can't not recommend this game, if you have a couple of buddys that will play it with you it's an excellent choice, otherwise wait for the price to be lowered. I see this more as a game that should be free to play, it's amazing but all it needs is a community to play it, and not a lot of people will pay for a game without players already playing it.\n\n(Sorry if this review was long, it's the first game i've reviewed and I felt like I had to tell people about this game.)","May 29","true","11.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Some guys just RPG and grenade spam but that's okay.\n\nMaps are very well designed, even if the game is only 5v5. Would prefer a larger player count for some of the maps, even if by 1-3 players added per team.\n\nSoundtrack is amazing.\n\nThis game is well constructed and there are tons of easter eggs that 1990s kids will love. So much humor in this game, too. The win/lose screens have me rolling every time.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game, it's cheap, and it's incredibly fun to play!

Teamwork is also important, and it makes the modes even more fun!\n\nOne of the best things about this game is the developer support. The devs TRULY care about their players. At first I thought the Steam community was overreacting. But here's a little story: I was playing a game, and a player named 'MeanGreenDev' was playing as well. Turns out it was a real developer. We talked to him in the lobbies and he said 'Rockets are being patched tomorrow, you have my word'. A day later, indeed a patch was released, containing Rocket fixes. Never have I seen something like this before. If you don't believe me: check the screenshot I made, and look up the 12/15/2015 game update. The dev was happy to hear feedback in the lobby and asked us to leave a review. Well here it is, Ashton!

Charming yet flawed.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*: Steam chats dont work with this game as of now the game uses the mic without actually using it making you unable to talk in any steam chatrooms.\n\nAs someone who has played the old Army Men games such as Sarges Heroes 1 & 2 I can recommend this title to anyone who enjoyed those even a little, as its essentially a multiplayer only version of those with far superior controls. (nostalgia goggles will never hide the horrible controls of the army men series)\n\nIt has 10 maps each with their own game mode and gimmicks which makes it quite a refreshing title to play for an hour or so. However the map "Off The Rails" is not quite well optimized and is the only map my PC struggles with. (which is quite low spec I will admit)\n\nBesides "Off The Rails" the only other map that gave me trouble was "Barnball" this map is focused on a Table Football field where the objective is to score goals by rolling the ball into the enemy barn. while that sounds great in theory it rarely works out and usually devolves into team deathmatch/ a spawncamp scenario and gets boring rather quickly.\n\nIt has all the weapons you would expect in a game about the green and tan base-bound warriors: Assault rifle, Sniper rifle, Shotgun, Bazooka and a Flamethrower.\n\nWhile fun to use they come across as inconsistent, especially the flamethrower which can go from instakilling to taking several seconds to kill, combine this with the fact that the flames dont actually show what you are hitting its not very comfortable to use. This does not hurt the game much however as its main purpose is to complete objectives eg. melting ice and lighting candles.\n\nThe game is quite fast paced with a very low time to kill on all the weapons and short respawn times. this usually works in its favour until teams become unbalanced resulting in a near endless massacre of one side until the round timer runs out. (especially on more open maps where snipers dominate.)\n\nAll in all  its great value for its price but the devs are going to have to put some work in to iron out some of the issues. but compared to most indie multiplayer titles at this price its one of the best.","January 4","true","10.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I know for a fact that people who want to play this would much prefer to buy it at a lower price seeing as bundles are no longer a thing. Or to have them pull their finger out and give us what we want. It's an amazing, fun, action-packed, goofy 3rd person artistic masterpiece filled with nostalgia and childhood wonders.\n\nMost definetly a game to play with friends, online or privately, it's a perfect party game. With each of the classic "green army men" weapons to choose from, you can flip between them all over without the need for time consuming class change.  It also has pretty awesome and various game types, not the boring stuff like you get in repetetive dull games like call of duty or battlefront. Have fun with this for sure! It IS worth the money, so get it.. just try and pursuade either steam to give packs again or your friends to do the same.. Honestly..it's a game you won't regret as long as you get the numbers, the servers are suffering due to low playerbase ...no packs is the entire reason.","January 28","true","2.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/360940/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","A highly enjoyable, casual multiplayer shooter with a fun and lighthearted style that endears itself to me.\n\nThe Mean Greens is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter which sees the two teams, the Greens and the Tans, square off in one of many different and surprisingly unique gamemodes. What makes it stand out is the fact that you play as those cheap little plastic toy soldiers that you would see being sold at the dollar store, and the maps take place in all sorts of everyday household locations, ranging from the inside of a freezer to an arts and crafts table even up to a large saltwater fish tank.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough. You've got your standard 2 teams, an objective and the undeniable sense that you should just go over there and shoot their plastic nuts off. There are no classes or character progression systems, each and every player has the same loadout as you do at all times, meaning there are no picks and counter-picks, just an evenly matched lineup in which the best team wins.\nAlthough, there are some cheap-shot handholding weapons like the rocket launcher which in essense is a one-shot one-kill weapon. But it's relatively balanced since there are no ammo pickups on the maps, and once you shoot the rocket launcher it will go on cooldown for a ridiculously long time before you can use it again. In fact it is quicker to just die and respawn to get the rocket launcher back. Many will think the rocket launcher to be a cheap weapon, and they'd be right, but its use does require some thought and timing, since you cannot instantly pull it out and fire away, instead you have to wait for a moment for your character to get it ready, giving enemies ample time to shoot you down or close the distance so you cannot kill them without killing yourself. The cheapshot weapons like this may seem like they could ruin the game and cause the most skilled players to get constantly wrecked by the biggest shooter virgin alive. But it actually doesn't ruin anything, since you also have the same weapons as they do, making this in my opinion a very casual multiplayer game.\n(As of patch 1.4, the rocket launcher cooldown is now spread out between lives, meaning you can no longer die and have it ready to go after an 8 second respawn time instead of waiting a minute or so to have it back)\n\nThe gamemodes and maps are fun and visually interesting in their designs, bright colors and massive backdrops create some outstanding environments that aren't too distracting from the gameplay itself. You've got your standard multiplayer maps like King of the Hill, Capture the Flag and Free-For-All, but also some unique gamemodes that takes full advantage of the fact that you're playing small toy soldiers in a big world. Like the birthday cake map where the objective is for one team to use their flamethrowers to light as many candles as they can before time runs out, while the other team has to defend the cake, switching at the end of a round, with whatever team having the most candles lit wins.\n\nDoes it have its flaws? Yeah... The third person perspective I feel doesn't really do the game many favors, it's difficult to see which weapon you're holding in the middle of an engagement, for example the M-16 and the sniper rifle, since they lack a distinctive silhouette when your soldier is holding them. Also, because of the third-person view the most important HUD elements are subdued, being difficult to notice when you're in the middle of a firefight. How much ammo is in your currently selected weapon or how much health you have doesn't show all too well in the middle of gameplay.\n\nI feel like this game would benefit so much more if you were allowed to at least toggle between first and third-person views, like you could in Tribes: Ascend, and I really think the HUD needs an overhaul. But all things considered, it's nothing that completely ruins anything, because like I said, it's casual multiplayer. If you're looking for some simple, easy to pick up and play multiplayer fun with an interesting design twist, then the Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is right up your alley.","December 13, 2015","true","1.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

What i mean by that is that the actual content is everything that i loved and enjoyed about Sarges Heroes from my childhood. The combat is well developed and an enjoyable experience however that does not mean the game is lacking in many fundamental aspects of its development. For one you simply cannot embark on a soley multiplayer game and have such poor servers supporting it. Me and my friend spend 10 minutes sitting in a loading screen until ultimately being told we had "lost connection to host" that we had never connected too. Its not a simple matter of joining a different server as there are only 2-3 servers being played maximum at any time of the day....this is not the fault of the game devs as simple lack of player base, advertising, or interest in the game. However i enjoy this game but could not possibly reccomend it as it boasts dozens of servers when it could focus on making 10 of its servers have a crisp connection to the few people who play and enjoy your game.","March 5","false","39.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Definitely worth getting your friends to play in a group.\n\nThe primary issue with the game is the level design, which I don't think has been playtested very thoroughly. A huge portion of the games I've played so far all end in Stalemate because there just aren't allow enough options to make a move - and in some cases, the long match time combined with stalemate just makes it feel like it's dragging a bit. I feel as though aesthetics have been favoured over design a little bit here, but the maps are nice to look at.\n\nAlso, the 'Quick Play' option is yet to find a session that isn't full, but the servers are good and there are quite a few players atm. Also noticed a lot of UE4 Marketplace / Example content here - but if anything this is a testament to how good that content is. Had a lot of fun playing it so far, and would like to see additional content!","December 13, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is how you imagined your little plastic army men battling it out when you were a kid.\n\nPros:\n\nEach map has such attention to detail that it shames AAA shooters of today. Maps like Art Table look like somone took time in laying out each map piece, unlike the boringly similar maps we see all too often. The game also looks very good, graphically. It's running on the Unreal 4 engine, so it's certainly no slouch in the technical deparment. The lighting is great, physics are fantastic, and the models are all very well made.\n\nThe development team is very active. They frequently ask for player feedback and I have seen various Devs interacting with the community on Twitch. This game is 100% a passion project, and the Devs are clearly devoted to delivering a quality experience to its players.\n\nCons:\n\nThis game is still in developement, so it is far from perfect. As of right now there are several glitches to be fixed and various tweaks to be made. Notably, the match making and conectivity is a bit wonky, hit detection is bad and surely needs a revamp. Also I would not say this game is very well optimized, I have seen plenty of random fps drops even on high end rigs. However, all of these issues can certainly be fixed and I have no doubt the Dev Team is hard at work.\n\nAdditional Thoughts: This game is very refreshing, I have not played such a fun and unique online shooter since the first time I played the Ratchet and Clank series. Nor have I ever met such a passionate Dev Team, these guys really want this to be the best game it possible can. No DLC or f2p gimmicks, the Devs actually want you to have a fun time instead of the shady tactics we've seen from AAA companies lately.","January 1","true","16.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game, The Mean Greens!\n\nThanks to a close friend of mine, this game is now on my nightly play list. To think such a simple concept could present amazing hours of entertainment and laughs. I'll go over my personal pros and cons of this game and hope it helps you decide on what's best for you.\n\nGraphics:- Don't like the colors fool you, everything in this game is done for a reason and it shows. The models look great, very much on the level of the army men in Toy Story, these soldiers run, jump and roll like you would expect them to.  The level designs are very original and immersive, you truly feel like a small toy inside a large world.\n\nSound:- WOW, just wow, if there is anything that you should take the time to appreciate is the sound.  The BG is just fitting for all stages that you play on, from the Christmas jingle on the railway to the swinging tunes that pump you up as you race across the table to push a giant cup, yes a giant cup.  If that weren't enough, on the birthday cake level, attacking sides are greeted to a jazz "attack the cake" verse while defenders hold the line with "defend the cake." Its those little details that really make you smile as you play along with the ecosystem of the game.\n\nGameplay:- When it comes movement and gun play, the game holds strong. A simple enough scheme, fire and alt fire, its one of those where its easy to play,not too hard to master. Within a few rounds you should have a great feel for all the weapons and know when to use each weapon for the situation at hand.\n\nReplay:- Loads of it, as the outcome of each match can be very different.  From capture the flag, to lighting candles on a cake, to scoring a goal on a large Foosball table, there's a ton to do and experience in this addicting game.\n\nCons:- People complaining the game has no future. The game has only been out a week, but i can tell you that this game is here to stay. I've had the honor of having a dev or two in my channel asking for feedback, that alone shows that they care about their game and wish for it to be enjoyed by all.\n\nIn the end, you should really play this one and see for yourself if you like it or not. I do feel that this a fantastic game for the price they are asking. The devs care and are listening as they too want to make sure that you're getting the best bang for your buck!\n\nCheers","December 14, 2015","true","93.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The idea of you being a toy soldier and fighting in combat is amazing idea and I give props to the developers for doing that idea. The game looks really good with amazing shadows and bright colorful visuals and it shows what the Unreal 4 engine can do. The maps make you feel like your toy soldier. From controlling the points on a toy train going around a christmas tree, to you fighting on a giant birthday cake and your trying to light the candles to win. The issue with this game is that it doesn't really add nothing new to the gameplay. It feels generic like i'm playing Gears of War but, it's still fun with it's creative idea and style.

Different game modes that you HAVE to play to believe how unique and fun they are. Seems to be extremely well designed and seems to have a great team backing it.

Keep in mind the devs are hard at work updating and listening to all the feedback from viewers. They WILL listen to what you have to say. If you ever played the old "Sarge's Army Men" games you will no doubt fall in love with "The Mean Greens" hell even if you didn't play those old games I'm sure you still will have a blast. One thing I've read/heard consistently is "Wow it's funny how an 11 dollar game (it's on sale and I live in Canada, cheaper for people from US) can be funner than an AAA title that cost $79.99" It really makes you think about the purchases you make, it does for me anyways.

The level designs are very creative and lovingly crafted, with each having its own game-mode attached to it. This ensures that you're able to play something different every round, whether that's free for all, capture the flag, or the many bespoke game types such as table-football.\n\nWeapon balance is cleverly done, in that everyone has an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, a shotgun, a bazooka and a flamethrower. These weapons have limited ammo and are renewed after a long period of time - this makes the game harder the longer you survive as you gradually run out of tools at your disposal, which helps level the playing field.\n\nCharacter movement is very fluid, and the closest comparison would be Pandemic's Battlefront games. The use of Unreal Engine 4 makes the game very scalable for different systems - I'm playing on a 7 year old PC on low settings and it runs fine, however you'll be able to attain impressive visuals and gorgeous art design on higher end systems.\n\nAn excellent low-cost title, which provides a lot of scope for future content.","December 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Between the fun maps and music to go with you will have a good time playing this game.\n\nHowever at the moment there are some gripes that need to be looked at, the biggest one is the difficulty in getting into a game that isn't already full or the host disconnects it currently take much longer than it should to find a game and actually connect to it, once you in tho the connection issues disappear.\n\nAnother is some maps feel a bit unbalenced or the objective  to difficult to achieve due to the respawn rate and close respawn point of the enemy team. Last point maybe just me but the bazooka is a free kill and needs to some how be balenced. while you only get 1 shot per life and no good way to get ammo it still comes off to strong.

Team up with friends or go solo (by not teaming via MP) in this action 3rd person shooter. Whether you're Green, Tan or FFA color, you're an army man in a huge world. Basic guns: Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Bazooka and Flamethrower. There's no store, cash, etc - you're stuck with those weapons to kill your enemy.\n\nGood looking maps and graphics for such a simple game. Some maps are small and some are bigger than others. There's different game modes with different objectives to do on different maps.  However, don't expect it to be like MicroVolts.\n\nCons- Not sure if this is Unreal or how the game was coded or setup: most people are complaining about low fps when in Fullscreen at high resolution - this is a fact (for me at least). For a temporary fix I set my game resolution to 1280x720 and put it in Fullscreen. I get very high fps when I do that opposed to 1600x900 in fullscreen (10-12fps). Yes, I have more than great PC specs to run this game.\n- No "Ouch!" sounds when you've been shot or being burnt. This is quite annoying because you don't have time to take cover because you don't know you're getting shot at (unless you notice your health going down). No death sounds either.\n\nRating: 5/10","December 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, you should buy it if you want a title to just enter and have fun, both with friends or to play alone in those moments you don't know what to do, you only know you want instant fast action.","February 29","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

I was going to bring out Pros and Cons of the game along with what I thought needed to be improved (which other reviews have done).\n\nI then realized something. One of the devs made a weapon feedback thread about a week ago, asking the community about what they thought needed balancing, what could be added, etc... Earlier today there was a patch that included some of the most requested features.\n\nFor this reason, I can honestly recommend the game. Not just because it's a great game all around, but because the devs actually care about it and are doing what they can to listen to the currently small community and make it an even better game","December 15, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Team up with friends or go solo (by not teaming via MP) in this action 3rd person shooter. Whether you're Green, Tan or FFA color, you're an army man in a huge world. Basic guns: Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Bazooka and Flamethrower. There's no store, cash, etc - you're stuck with those weapons to kill your enemy.\n\nGood looking maps and graphics for such a simple game. Some maps are small and some are bigger than others. There's different game modes with different objectives to do on different maps.  However, don't expect it to be like MicroVolts.\n\nCons- Not sure if this is Unreal or how the game was coded or setup: most people are complaining about low fps when in Fullscreen at high resolution - this is a fact (for me at least). For a temporary fix I set my game resolution to 1280x720 and put it in Fullscreen. I get very high fps when I do that opposed to 1600x900 in fullscreen (10-12fps). Yes, I have more than great PC specs to run this game.\n- No "Ouch!" sounds when you've been shot or being burnt. This is quite annoying because you don't have time to take cover because you don't know you're getting shot at (unless you notice your health going down). No death sounds either.\n\nRating: 5/10","December 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The physics are perfect and the community seems ok. This just makes me want to watch Toy Story all over again. The sountrack adds to the fun emotion and the level design is fantastic, meaning players have to try new play styles and strategies before going in.  As i said with each map comes a new objective; for example the Art Craft table is Free-For-All, and Bathtub Bash is Capture The Flag. This means players can have a different experience every 5 minutes! Expect my hours rising; and my friends. A simple lobby system can let you easily hop in a game with your mates, and find new mates. The graphics are also astonishing for a 10 dollar game, but thats just the magic we know as Unreal Engine 4; Good choice Devs!\n\nThe only downsides ot this game, and things i would definately suggest are:\n\nShooting while jumping should be put in. adds more action and an overall better time.\n\nDon't remve the rocket launcher, just tune the damage down a little bit, maybe similar to tf2?\n\nMake the main rifle do a little bit more damage here and there, but not to the extent that it is COD, this would just make firefights a little less awkward,\n\nThats really just those little things I can find wrong.\n\nThanks for such an oustanding and fun game, im going to let all my friends know! :D\n\n-Cheers for making my mornings and afternoons alot better, Dusky :D","December 11, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The physics are perfect and the community seems ok. This just makes me want to watch Toy Story all over again. The sountrack adds to the fun emotion and the level design is fantastic, meaning players have to try new play styles and strategies before going in.  As i said with each map comes a new objective; for example the Art Craft table is Free-For-All, and Bathtub Bash is Capture The Flag. This means players can have a different experience every 5 minutes! Expect my hours rising; and my friends. A simple lobby system can let you easily hop in a game with your mates, and find new mates. The graphics are also astonishing for a 10 dollar game, but thats just the magic we know as Unreal Engine 4; Good choice Devs!\n\nThe only downsides ot this game, and things i would definately suggest are:\n\nShooting while jumping should be put in. adds more action and an overall better time.\n\nDon't remve the rocket launcher, just tune the damage down a little bit, maybe similar to tf2?\n\nMake the main rifle do a little bit more damage here and there, but not to the extent that it is COD, this would just make firefights a little less awkward,\n\nThats really just those little things I can find wrong.\n\nThanks for such an oustanding and fun game, im going to let all my friends know! :D\n\n-Cheers for making my mornings and afternoons alot better, Dusky :D","December 11, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it does have it's quirks namely an odd balance of weapons and a unfathomable level of platforming for a shooter it does prove to be a throughly enjoyable experence. My favorite part and what I think will be yours as well is the level design now, granted it does take some getting used to, the playing of the maps is a bit off at first. The level design of Mean Greens is some of the most refreshing and creative maps I've played in recent memory. Now onto the weapon balance the lifeblood of any shooter the gunplay is moderately-paced though in most senarios you'll be spamming rockets (rocket spam is unreal in this game) besides rockets you'll need your flamethrower to complete objectives but otherwise I never use the other weapons.

That isn't to say it could just stand a few more features, like a better server browser and search, better party formation outside of just creating your own server, and some neccesary bugfixes. However, these small criticisms aside, the game's really very fun. The gameplay is solid, the community is already rolling pretty well, and gameplay balance is pretty much established. From a graphical and technical perspective UE4 is gorgeous (still the best AO of any engine, imo) performant, and remains my favorite modern engine, crytek and it's perpetual z-fighting be damned.\n\nI do wish you could fire while in the air, for balance perhaps with diminished accuracy (or maybe you can and it just freqently won't let me), and the game stealing the mic and forcing a team-only p2t is a bit annoying. It would be nice to have an option to not lock the mic so I can keep a call going with friends in Steam. Server browsing as a group is pretty frustrating as well since partying up only really allows you to form your own server.\n\nEven with the above notes, this game is certainly worth purchasing and playing, just from a cost to entertainment value perspective. It's as good to better than all the other modern 3rd person multiplayer AAA shooters that keep getting pumped out like Scream sequels, and it costs 1/5th as much. Plus you get the gratification of not contributing to EA or Ubisoft's slow strangling death of multiplayer gaming. With these facts in mind, how can that purchase decision even be a question?\n\nSo long as they keep out microtransactions and unlockable crap, I can see myself playing this for a while. Shame on those who, in other reviews, have suggested that sort of thing. Keep the cancer of modern gaming out of this, it's too good to die that way.","December 11, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Team up with friends or go solo (by not teaming via MP) in this action 3rd person shooter. Whether you're Green, Tan or FFA color, you're an army man in a huge world. Basic guns: Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Bazooka and Flamethrower. There's no store, cash, etc - you're stuck with those weapons to kill your enemy.\n\nGood looking maps and graphics for such a simple game. Some maps are small and some are bigger than others. There's different game modes with different objectives to do on different maps.  However, don't expect it to be like MicroVolts.\n\nCons- Not sure if this is Unreal or how the game was coded or setup: most people are complaining about low fps when in Fullscreen at high resolution - this is a fact (for me at least). For a temporary fix I set my game resolution to 1280x720 and put it in Fullscreen. I get very high fps when I do that opposed to 1600x900 in fullscreen (10-12fps). Yes, I have more than great PC specs to run this game.\n- No "Ouch!" sounds when you've been shot or being burnt. This is quite annoying because you don't have time to take cover because you don't know you're getting shot at (unless you notice your health going down). No death sounds either.\n\nRating: 5/10","December 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Has a nostalgic yet new feel to it. I absolutely love it. Kinda reminds me of Toy Story.\n\nI know this game has only been out for a week but I can tell it's going places.

You get 5 weapons which you get to switch from : the M16, Bazooka, Flamethrower, Shotgun and Sniper Rifle. It is 5v5 but some servers are bugged so you can get 10v10 or more. There are 10 maps EACH with their own game mode!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGamemodes:\nFree For All\nTeam Death Match\nCapture the flag (Traditional)\nNew Capture the Flag (Atleast I haven't seen it)\nLight the Candles/ Defend the Candles\nKing of the Hill\nBarnyard Ball (Not my favorite with more than 5v5 but still alot of fun with 5v5 or less)\nFree the Dinosaurs (One of the most popular)\nDefend the Cookies (Kinda like conquest in other games)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe graphics are great, You feel like a plastic army man.\nAlso if you liked Army Men series of old then you will like this. (IF you didn't like sarge's heroes then you might not like this as it plays very similarly)\nCommunity---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWell here is how I viewed the community over time:\nDay 1 (release): Wow everyone is nice! Everyone is talking about how great the game is and remembering the old Army Men games. Cool\nDay 2: Alright now we've found some bugs but still the Community is "small" and everyone just wants to talk and have fun!\nDay 3: Okay the community has grown and people from other games are here.\nDay 4: Wow people don't talk anymore. Lots of people getting kicked... Oh no....\nDay 5+: How did everyone become so mean and sour... why do they want this game to have so many changes? Oh wow now its a "kicking" war going on. Yep half the lobby was kicked... great...

If you've ever played All Points Bulletin, the shooting feels a bit like that (3PS feel). Definitely has a competitive aspect to it, but it's more CSGO style, compared to Quake or UT. The competitiveness lies in how well you can work as a team to complete the map objectives, and has less emphasis on your individual skill.\n\nDo keep in mind the game is a 2015 title made with UE4... so you'll need a beefy computer to max out the settings. My computer is around 5 years old (worth $1000 at the time), and I can only play the game on all Low settings, or else I lag in full server games.\n\nThe devs are excited and have some nice updates planned. I recently came across a friendly dev in-game. The toy army soldier theme was pulled off really well! I highly recommend buying this game if you like shooters!","December 29, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are many levels and game modes, there's a lot to experience. I'm personally not in favor of the third person view, I would much prefer this game be first person. I've also found the hit detection to be a bit wonky and it's also hard to tell what's killing you sometimes due to gunshots not being audible from even remotely far away. The distance which gunshots shouldn't be heard should be much greater than what it currently is.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game if it weren't for the developers appearing to care about the game and patching it. If they stop patching it/improving it, I'll likely switch this review to not recommended seeing as there were a few other quirks I had with the game as well, such as the server browser. It's not very friendly to the eyes - it would be nicer if you could see an overview or image of the map the servers are currently on next to the name. It would take up more space, but it'd be much more pleasant to view. It would also be nice if they hid empty servers from the list and simply had a check box available for anyone who is actually searching for an empty server.","December 11, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare. The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is a Team-Based Multiplayer, Third-Person Shooter that was released on Steam December 8th, 2015 by Publisher/Developer Virtual Basement LLC and Developer Code Headquarters LLC.\n\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hTm3exFmFNU\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nFun little multiplayer shooter. Solid graphics and awesome sound. Just needs the community to grow!\n3.5/5 Pick it up for that $10 it's at now or you'll regret it later.\n\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThe Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is very much like the old Army Men game series, I think I had played it on the N64. It's essentially a really fun twist on your basic Team Based Multiplayer, Third-Person Shooter game. You are those little green army men that you see in toy stores all the time. You can cycle through any of the multiple weapon types available to your soldier (M-16, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Bazooka, Flamethrower) and go to war!! Now, I have not yet been able to get in a game on each map. Unfortunately, with it being so new, there are not as many players online as one would hope. Surely with time, that will change. As is, the game is absolutely gorgeous and really brings the scenes to life. You do get the feeling that you are just a little toy running around the house. The graphics are really good. The music is superb and really gets you in the mood to march to battle. There are several maps and each of these maps appear to have a different objective, aside from just the basic "kill the other team" approach. For example, in our Kitchen Run, we had to try and push the other Team's cup off the ledge. It really is your standard squad-based shooter, but with some really fun twists. A lot of the players I played with were into the nostalgia kick, as this game does call back to that Army Men series. I think as newer players pick this up, it's community will grow and make this a keeper. On release day, even with the frustration of waiting to get into games and finding enough people, I have enjoyed it enough to give a 3.5/5 as the graphics, sound and gameplay certainly warrant that and it just needs it's community to grow some to be able to stand out some more.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","December 8, 2015","true","1.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

You have a game with map design that is unique but at the same time unbalanced for example there's one map that takes place on a train, tan team spawns in at one end & green team spawns in at the other, the objective is to capture & hold 3 cookies, they can be captured in any order, but if you manage to get to the opposite side of the train where the other team spawn, you can just camp the hell out of them and it's nearly impossible to fight back. Theres also a fair amount of exploits in the game as well such as going through walls, hiding in shallow water makes you almost invincible etc. The player base is low which is a shame, it's mostly to do with the lack of content & lack of progression (IMO) newer generation of gamers would rather work towards level ups and unlockables as it gives them a reason to keep playing. It doesn't make it a bad game though when people do come on it's quite enjoyable, even more so when it's a skilled based map and not a camp fest.","May 28","false","27.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The biggest thing that attracted me to it were the maps.. You are literally a little toy infantry soldier in kitchens, bedrooms, fish tanks etc.. The environments are amazing.. If anyone remembers the old unreal tourny maps or cs kitchen maps were you felt like a little inch man running around in rooms, that's exactly what this reminded me of! I've played 3 maps so far and to give you an idea of objectives you have to melt the ice in the freezer to unleasah your toy trex (freezer), push the cup off of the end of the counter before your enemy tips yours off all while running through a lit oven and bubbly dish full sink (kitchen), scoring goals on a foosball table while shooting the crap out of eachother with pigstyle figure moving back and forth on the foosball handle/rods(barnyard foosball can't remember the name lol).. The gameplay and optimisation is great.. I just hope to see some more weapon varieties/overall gameplay/progression updates in the future.. Well worth the $10, I would even pay $15 or more to be honest.. Just helping fund the developers is enough for me to get involved.. I hope it grows greatly!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Linko64/recommended/360940/","Linko64","Linko64","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Linko64/","296 products in account","Virtual Basement’s (Ark- Survival Evolved) latest game, The Mean Greens, does what a number of bigger games fail to do. While it may sound like some kind of Vegan juice drink, The Mean Greens is charming title that showcases vast amount of potential from a young developer.\n\nThe core concept is the classic battle between Green and Tan toy soldiers. Those little pieces of plastic, vaguely human shaped, that has entertained generation after generation. In this case, we’re no longer using imagination to act our play wars, we’re directly playing. From the outside, The Mean Greens looks like a cookie cutter third person shooter, and that’s partly right. The true star of show is not the gameplay, but the maps.\n\n\n\nThe Mean Greens is about as accessible as you can get. Simple third person shooting, no classes or perks. Variation comes in the form of different weapon types, allowing players to engage from what ever range they wish. It all works well, even if it can lead to some slight sense of repetition creeping in.\n\nVirtual Basement have a clear vision of what they waned to The Mean Greens to be. Map design and concepts reflect the exact vision and themes that were desired. Each map is set in various parts of a typical house. Kitchens, table tops, bath rooms and even the fish tank. It’s nice little throwback to all the typical places we’d wage plastic warfare as children.\n\n\n\nEach map has it’s own unique objective, from the classic to the crazy. Be it Free-for-all deathmatch or capture the flag, The Mean Greens puts a twist on it. The most notably of twists comes in the shape of the bubble bath battle for flags. Players are tasked with collecting flags dotted around a bath tub full of floating rubber duckies, with a giant octopus occupying the centre of the tub.\n\nThere’s also a play on foosball table in which players battle to push the ball into the opposition goal. Each and every map oozes with character and charm. It’s the little touches that go along way. From the popping of bubbles in the sink, to the haunting yet oddly catchy rendition of Operation Birthday’s ‘Birthday Cake’ song, it’s hard no to smirk when playing.\n\n\n\nPresentation forms a key part of the experience. In order to get that true feel of playing with toy soldiers, the visuals have to be on point. It’s a testament to the craftsmanship and care shown by Virtual Basement that the game looks beautiful. The soldiers look amazing, almost to the point you swear you could pick them out of the screen. Environments blend real life elements and colour pallets similar to films like Toy Story, resulting in some brilliant imagery. Each maps has it’s own distinct look, feeding into the concept that this is what you used to think of when you were a child, army men in hand.\n\nThe Mean Greens only real issues come in the shape or some sever connection issues and the odd bit of balancing. Within a period of 4 hours, a number of disconnections from sever occurred once the match had ended. This issue was mentioned a few times in the in-game chat, suggesting it’s far from isolated cases. A minor niggle comes in the shape of hit detection and satisfaction. There’s times in which weapons feel like they should be hitting the target. Headshots tend to feel part luck more than skill. It gives the gunplay a touch of being rather floaty instead of satisfying.\n\n\nWeapon balancing could use some work. One of the six weapons, the bazooka, is hugely overused by nearly every player in the game. The overuse of the weapon results in a number of modes becoming nothing but bazookafest, rendering other weapons slightly pointless. Additional weapons may be on cool down, but the regularity of death and respawns means you’ll be a victim of a rocket extra 30 seconds.\n\nAs a whole package, The Mean Greens is an admirable release. With 10 modes, 10 maps, 6 weapons and voice chat, it puts EA’s Star Wars: Battlefront to shame. Code Virtual Basement can be proud of what they’ve produced. It may not be packing all the fancy tricks and frills of other multiplayer titles, but it sure is packed with charm and sheer enjoyment. For less than £12, it’s hard not to recommend The Mean Greens, even more so as a nifty Steam stocking filler for Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n","December 9, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Their first release, 'The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare' absolutely shows alot of potential, and makes me hungry for more. Powered by the fantastic Unreal Engine, they have created a game that combines warfare with elements that takes us back to our childhood. The characters in the game reminds me of the soldiers from the 'Toy Story' franchise, which was my favourite back in the early days. There is one common opinion I have heard from other people that have played this game: that it gives us a nostalgic flashback from either a game or movie from our childhood.\n\nThe online gamemodes are fun and innovative. Melting down a wall of ice before the other team, pushing down a cup from the table before the other team, playing football and many other innovative gamemodes you never thought could fit into a competetive shooter. My favourite one is where both teams spawns on each of their side of a bathtub, where the object is to capture a flag located on a floating boat toy in the enemy's territory and bring it back to the spawn. A challenging capture-the-flag with a twist. There is also a CTF map under water! Besides from the modes that may be confusing when playing first time, they have also included traditional modes such as TDM, FFA & domination.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are also great. You spawn with all weapons, which are made for different kinds of situations. A traditional AK for spraying down your enemys, shotgun for close combats, an RPG that is overpowered, a sniper for long-range attacks and a flamethrower that works great for melting down ice, but not killing. These are all pretty well-balanced. Key for this is the cooldown you get after using an RPG, which would make the game broken if you could use it  at all times. The game does not have that many players (yet), so if you have friends to play it with, it would make the game more enjoyable if you don't want to spend some extra time to find a good server.\n\nThe game is constantly being updated, and the developers are active when it comes to interacting and reviewing feedback from the community. This seems to be the start of something good, so I look forward to see what more Virtual Basement may be cooking up for us in the future!","March 1","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls are better, the gameplay is better, the graphics are better, the maps are bigger, better functional online multiplayer.\n\nPlenty of ways to play.

Unfortunately, this game has one glaring issue. You see those 0.5 hours of playtime there? Yeah. 0.4 was spent TRYING TO FIND A F***ING GAME. I understand the game isn't being published by those big AAA companies but it is inexcusable to have your game launch and have it take 30 minutes to find one game. Oh, but it doesn't stop there. Once I got into a game, crash. I tried again, crash again. 3rd time is a charm, as I finally got into a game. I think I should start with the pros of this game.\n*Pros*\n-Amazing atmosphere and level design. The levels all feel unique and are perfectly catered to their respected game mode. The levels give off, to me at least, a V20 Blockland vibe.\n-OST is perfect. The 30 minutes I waited to get into a game was both frustrating and uplifting. Why? The OST is so damn catchy. The OST fits every level and moment perfectly and keeps you pumped up while you're playing the game as opposed to how other FPS games have no background music (I'm looking at you Battlefront).\n-Combat Rolling is wonderful. Combat rolling in games like Battlefront 2 was very fun and unique because not many games at the time had mechanics like it. It forced people to make new strategies and adapt to a new gameplay style. This carries over perfectly with Plastic Warfare.\n\n*Cons*\n-Weapon Balance needs reworking. Everyone has the same equipment at all times. While this means the game is more fair in a sense, from what I've played, everyone just ends up using the Rocket Launcher and Sniper. I think this could be improved by adding in a class system or having some weapons be map pick ups, sort of like Halo.\n-No Single Player mode. I can't believe I'm saying this, but even EA's Battlefront has a better single player. Why? Because there is no single player in this game. Having an offline mode with bots would greatly benefit the game, as it would not only help new people become adapted to the gameplay, but it would also make the game more playable, especially with the...\n-God Awful Connection. I was able to get into 1 game, 1 f***ing game. I would either..\nA. Lose connection to the host (even when I was the host)\nB. Server would be full (even if it was 7/10 on the browser menu)\nc. Join a game, but crash.\n-Movement =/= Control set up. The sprint is extremely fast, so it would make sense that sprint jumping would be effective. Unfortunately, there is a 1-2 second delay in jumping and sprinting, which means you end up stopping and jumping or not jumping at all. Also, double tapping forward should set the player into a sprint.\n\nAs it sits now, I don't recommend it. However, I'm sure the game will change for the most part and most of these cons will be irrelevant in 6 months.\n","December 11, 2015","false","1.4"," 18 of 39 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","18","39","0","0"

I have tried playing on servers with as low of ping as I can find, but they still don't play very well. (I am in the West Coast US, and I don't know how the game runs in the rest of the world. It could run great there).\n\nThis game might be really fun to play on LAN, but I only bought one copy of the game, and I can't see if the performence is good then. I'd either like to see better optimization server side (if possible) or some better official servers in the US (if possible).

On the train level you get to the end then you can spawn camp with the shotgun (1 shot, 1 kill at that range) until you run out of ammo. The bathtub level the ducks are the only way I can see of crossing but they are god-aweful-slow. Fall damage seems to apply in some levels but not others. As soon as you fire the RPG (it has 1 shot) you get a big "out of ammo" obscuring your view.\n\nAs you can see, it's lots of little things that just need a little TLC and this will be a great game.

Multiplayer connectivity is horrible and spend most of the time trying to connect to a game. When you do play, it has fun game types but the graphics are rough. Environment is highly detailed, but not smoothed. It's almost as if someone took a picture of something and copy/pasted it into the game. Some of the objectives need to be better planned out. Most games end up a tie because of no team spawning or way to get to the objective more quickly without starting all the way from the starting point. My biggest complaint however is when a new update is availabile, it will not let you connect with other players who either 1. have not updated yet, or 2. updated but the host has not. So you try to invite people but they will not be able to join. This needs to be handled way better. This game has far to go, for now I refunded and will wait until the game matures before giving it another shot.","December 24, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Here are a few things that I feel need to be upgraded.\n\nAfter playing a few levels, I found I spent most of the time running to the playing field, or waiting for the environment to get to them.  (I.e. rubber ducky bath)  Improving our ability to move farther would be better, for instance, capture little sections, and then when rejoining, you can go back to the last section you were in.  But something to get us into the action sooner.\n\nWho cares what server/game, I just want to play.  Since there doesn't appear to be AI, I have to play multiplayer.  But when I try to join a game, with 15/16 people, they are almost always taken.  I usually have to jump on to something with less than 60% population in order to get on.  Just give me a button to join the next immediate game.  Let the computer figure out what server is available.\n\n80% of the deaths don't feel learnable.  I.e. I died because of being shot by distant player.  The speed and ease of death in the game wouldn't be a problem if would could jump right back in.  but the game makes us wait, and then have to run to anywhere useful.\n\nEdge forgiveness in the bath.  Its hard to tell where the edge is.  It is especially frustrating in the water, where you just fall into the tub and die.  I'd like some forgiveness on it, like if you are slipping off the edge, but then walk/run back right away, then let us get back on the edge.\n\nI'm not suggesting that all my suggestions be taken as sollutions, but I would suggest taking the challenges seriously and come up with some improvement.","January 5","false","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

On the train level you get to the end then you can spawn camp with the shotgun (1 shot, 1 kill at that range) until you run out of ammo. The bathtub level the ducks are the only way I can see of crossing but they are god-aweful-slow. Fall damage seems to apply in some levels but not others. As soon as you fire the RPG (it has 1 shot) you get a big "out of ammo" obscuring your view.\n\nAs you can see, it's lots of little things that just need a little TLC and this will be a great game.

But here's what I think.\n\nFrom the video I thought it might be a class based shooter like Team Fortress 2.  Which would have made sense.  I mean army men just have a single built in weapon so the game seemed perfect for that.  Unfortunately that's not the case.  Every player has every gun.\n\nNow that wouldn't be so bad, if health was more meaningful/tankier.  Again by the appearece of the game I expected arcade shooter kind of health, where I could tank a  cartoony amount of bullets before dying.  Instead, just like 3 or 4 bullets from the assault rifle kills you.  Again, made worse by the fact every single person gets a rocket launcher.\n\nThe player count is redicoulously low. Just 5 v. 5.  I think the minimum standard these days is 8 v 8, with most games eager to reach rediculous player counts.\n\nThis game was a great idea but not executed that well.  If it dropped it's realistic shooter/CoD-like elements and replaced them with arcade shooter/TF2-like ones I think it could be amazing.","December 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of the Army Men series, and when I stumbled across this I happily put the money down. Once again I was burned. Lately when I buy a multiplayer game on Steam I'm met with just a few conclusions- It's not finished (EA, which is clear at purchase but the state of the games rarely changes), It's got 0 community, or it's got a community based in another region almost entirely/I can't get a good ping in any server and it's not my connection. This game was the latter. I found numerous servers online with lots of players, but every single one was in Europe or another country, and my Ping was well above 200. I found a couple US servers but invariably they were all too high ping, or completely empty. It's a damned shame because this concept was extremely attractive to me. I've been looking for another shooter like Army Men or Toy Soldiers for a very long time. Especially one with today's graphical potential and online play.

I'm a huge fan of the Army Men series, and when I stumbled across this I happily put the money down. Once again I was burned. Lately when I buy a multiplayer game on Steam I'm met with just a few conclusions- It's not finished (EA, which is clear at purchase but the state of the games rarely changes), It's got 0 community, or it's got a community based in another region almost entirely/I can't get a good ping in any server and it's not my connection. This game was the latter. I found numerous servers online with lots of players, but every single one was in Europe or another country, and my Ping was well above 200. I found a couple US servers but invariably they were all too high ping, or completely empty. It's a damned shame because this concept was extremely attractive to me. I've been looking for another shooter like Army Men or Toy Soldiers for a very long time. Especially one with today's graphical potential and online play.

Every time you respawn you get a fresh shot in your missle launcher that is a one hit kill with a bunch of splash damage. 90% of the combat in this game seems to be done with the one hit missle launcher and begins to feel stale very quickly. When you die it forces you to walk all the way across the map to get back to the battle. Normally this wouldn't be an issue to me but when you're constantly walking all the way across a map and getting intantly killed by a rocket launcher it becomes a little bit frustrating. I refunded this game and will consider repurchasing if they update the maps to be bigger and if they rethink their rocket launcher balance.","December 18, 2015","false","1.5"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"

With most maps, it's only 2 lanes, adding in a 3rd should help.\n4) Fishtank map has terrible spawn points. You need to focus on 2-3 low grav jumps (with a chance of dieing) instead of how you're going to attack the enemy.\n5) No shooting while jumping. This needs to be fixed but in the right way... I'd probably slow the run/sprint speed down so this doesn't turn into arena shooter.\n\nVERDICT:\nThis game has tons of potential, the small dev team did a great job however currently there's too many annoyances for any serious replay value. I'll be keeping this on the shelf and checking back in a month or two. Hopefully they address the small issues first then focus on improving the game play.","December 11, 2015","false","1.6"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

This is the first time I completely regret buying a game. I really wanted to like it too since the theme really grabbed my attention, a jolly, fun casual game but there's just so much missing. And the game isn't even early access; it's a complete game that needs work which is disappointing. First of all the matchmaking is ridiculous. There shouldn't be so many complications to simply find a game that you'll play on for only 5 minutes. The hit detection doesn't feel right either, especially if you're used to playing legit shooters; you will not settle for this game. Just keep that in mind. Despite the good reviews which I hoped I would agree with, you will realize how bad the game is if you're used to playing high end or popular games. And keep in mind, the game is boring and on top of that, they didn't implement any reason to come back to the damn thing. No ranking or levels, no unlocks, no challenges, nothing. What gives me any reason to keep playing if it's not fun in the first place.\n\nAdd some kind of reward system so the players can put however many wasted hours they played into use. After playing a couple games I gave up; I might go back one day if I'm really bored or want to give it a second try. Until then I'm hoping some improvements are made and then I can possibly enjoy the game. Maybe I didn't give it enough time to grow on me, who knows? Either way I spent $10 (on sale) on a game I am not satisfied with, and it's fine that my money is gone but please don't waste others' as well. Drop it to $5 or less, considering that's the most it's worth. I'm really hoping the developers know there's a ton to change with this game, if they don't realize then it's pretty much going no where.\n\nI suggest you high-expectation players out there pass on this game and allow it to get better even if you have to pay more later on. It has lots of potential but that doesn't change the fact that right now it's horrible. You'll be able to tell within the first few minutes of playing, a sense of just.. disappointment. It's unexplainable but the game does not feel right at all. and for $10... I'm trying not to remind myself...but yea go spend that on a few csgo cases.

The join server button results in nothing but wasted time and a "Server Full" error.  Attempting to actually join a server from the server browser results in "Connection to Host Lost" due to 95% of the servers being in Europe.   I saw two full US servers in the list and the rest were completely empty.  Also the servers are bugged it seems because several say they support 20 players but are still giving you a "Server Full" error at 10 connections.    I'd expect this kind of poor code from an early release title but not from a "full release" game.  I'll update my review when the netcode gets some more polish.","December 11, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I mean really bad.  I even went as far as starting games with friends and having them stand still. Aiming right at my friend and firing and not a single hit.  Its bad.  Also with  hit detection there is very little to no visuals when you actuall hit a target, no sounds just a little pulse of your crappy cross hair.\n\nThe second major issue is map balance.  Most maps are bascially tug of war style. When one team can push forward, the losing team will usually fail.  Spawn times and points are weird on most maps making half the map you running and running and running while only actually engaged in combat for seconds before you either die or kill off the few enimes.\n\nVisually, the game is fantastic. Along with great sound tracks makes for one of the great pros of the game.\n\nIt's not the worse game out there, but needs some polishing work before I would even call this out of beta process yet. Way over priced for what it is.  I wasted  money on a game that should have been considered early access at half the price.  Already tried to play it enough to like it and went over the 2 hour window for a refund which is my fault.","December 12, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

I spent more time trying to get in a game than I did playing this game. Absolutely unacceptable in 2015 for a multiplayer-only game. When I did get into a match, I found it all to be rather dull and uninspired. Yay, the settings are unique!! That's about the only plus. There's no progression, nothing you can level up, no real incentive for doing well in a match. You get EVERY weapon at the outset with limited ammo and are basically left to smash against the opposing team again and again. Everyone has the same gear you do, there are no classes or specialities. Half the time you don't even know where a death came from. The aiming is clunky and weird, the netcode for this game needs a serious overhaul. If you're interested in playing a wholly generic multiplayer shooter in neat settings (because you're a toy, obviously), then sure, try it out.

Number one is the insta kill of the flame thrower. i get thaqt were plastic and plastic melts. but when the tiniest bit of the flame touches you or even touches you when you know you are out of reach and die already is already a problem at best with that and should be nerfed down to not instant kill someone. kind of unfair and wonky and janky when used by player's. Number two, the rocket luancher everyone complained about before it got turned into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rubber fetish of a missle. for one, a missle is sapose to explode after when luanched from the rocket. its a point and shoot. what the rocket has turned into is a point and shoot and the missle move-hops you to the left and not kill the person you aimed at hoping to gaina  kill. Thirdly is how toxic anf dast the commute has grown since this game became a thing. you should find a way to implament mature content to fixed content meaning, those who choose to be and play immaturely should be on their own server where those that want to play the game to actually play the game for what it is and what its meant to play as on the normal server's. its stressful or stressing when your trying to play and enjoy the game for what it is and all you see is immaturity on all and past all level's past common sense. fourthly, the level fish tank needs alot of work, half of the maps environment actually kills you before you get to do anything  because you have to jump so ♥♥♥♥ing much and you run into the environment and it slides you off the map and into the sand on the bottom. kind of unfair and frankly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Also people have said vehicles are comming to this game, i hope that is true but to compinsate the land velhicles you should make an acual large open map to play on and not one large area thats box'd in and you can tell thats box'd in from forced wall's keeping you out.  Lastly i belie ve the game makers of this game should make an auto delete for all the 0/10 or 0/10 pretty much all the empty servers not a thing anymore. majority of the servers are all ut half and are totally empty 100% and not in use. should only make it so the server list has active only server's. this game is fun and has a chance to be great, but all of it needs to be extremely taken seriously and worked on more and not continue to have the things i listed. all in all atleast a 3/10 for the time being.","January 6","false","37.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Now, out of all my years on Steam this will be my first negative review. What a shocker.\n\nI don't hate this game, or the devs. Not one bit. But the sheer amount of players (literally none btw) is enough to make you want to pass up this game. That is the main reason I am giving the game a negatively based review in the first place. Okay, lets start the review.\n\nThis game is dead. I don't want to say it but its dead as a game can get because of the very low ammount of players playing.\n\nPros:\n\n-Gunplay feels okay.\n\n- Nostalgia.\n\n- Well designed maps. Actually very well designed maps, you feel like you are actually immersed\ninto a childhood if you will, like you actaully feel in a child like place. Dunno how to describe it, takes you back. Could tie into the nostalgia.\n\n- Pretty good graphics.\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of players. Seriously, I bought the game on the 1st or 2nd of January which wasn't even a month after the game released, to find only 7 servers full. I haven't played since then so you can imagine how many players are on now. Also, I just checked as of writing this review and only 75.7% of ALL the players who have bought this have the "First Play of the Game" achivement. Its what it sounds like, 24.3% of everyone who bought it pretty much haven't even played it.\n\n- Connecting issues. Trying to get into 1 match is like trying to find water in a desert.\n\n- Connection issues. Not the same as connecting issues, because I wasn't able to stay in 1 game for more than 3 minutes because of `"Lost connection to host" all the time.\n\n-Lack of content. No really, very few maps (Less than Heroes and Generals). If I recall, there was only 5 weapons at the time, the Assault Rifle, Sniper, Bazooka, Grenade, and flamethrower,\n\nOverall this game is okay.... if it had atleast more than 100 players a day. Don't buy it, you won't be doing yourself a favor. I know nostalgia is one hell of a feeling, and thats what ended up biting me back. Once again I don't hate the game, if the game had more players to fill atleast 1 server then yeah all for it, it would make up for not much content, but it doesn't.\n\n9.0 / 10 If it had alot more content and players.\n\n6.5 / 10 If it had around 400 players a day with the same ammount of content.\n\n2.3 / 10 If it still had the same ammount of players. Its just too little, and when I said there was only 7 servers full, that was when I was playing not even a month before it came out. Last time I played it was exactly 5 months and 29 days ago.\n\nEDIT: Stupid errors that Steam made, put "/" in front of all the quotation marks. And they FINALLY updated the game, so I removed that. Also a few mistakes I made.","June 1","false","0.9"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","4","14","2","0"

There's literally a level where the whole map is tan coloured, and all the tan players have near perfect camoflage.\n\nGunplay is pretty much the worst I've seen in an FPS. There are maps with 'bouncy' areas, where you never stay on the ground, but you cannot shoot while in mid air. The rifle sprays to the point of uselessness whether you tap once or spray for 50 bullets. This causes you to rely on the sniper, which has only 6 bullets per respawn, or the rocket launcher, which has 1. Both weapons are super strong and hard to play against.\n\nGraphically it's messy, but quite well done once you turn off the sickening motion blur.\n\nIn terms of interface there's far too much downtime. There are sometimes rounds of 2 minutes with lobby times of 1 minute in between. Cover height makes no sense, sometimes your character holds the weapon at crotch level, but the height of the cover is about up to your chest. Preventing you from shooting but providing no protection against snipers.\n\nOverall, needs serious work in the gunplay area before I'll consider picking it up. Even free games like the original Ace Of Spades (now Build and Shoot) had better, more skill focused gunplay than this.\n\n1/5 stars in its current state. Worth it for $2, don't pay any more than that.","December 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","12","2","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darth_paxis/recommended/360940/","darth_paxis","Kylo Ren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darth_paxis/","330 products in account","I really want to love this game, Army Men needs to be a thing again and the maps are all quite cool. The graphics are nice and it runs well. I give the devs credit for the creative objectives and gimmicks in each map, such as the foosball map which plays out like a shooter version of Rocket League and the freezer map where you have to use flamethrowers to melt the giant ice block containing your team's T-Rex before the other team can. But the execution is ultimately, and sadly, quite poor. The shooting mechanics are not good, there's bad hit detection and possibly bad netcode that makes killing enemies needlessly unreliable and leads to a lot of questionable deaths and frustration. It just doesn't feel satisfying to play, and that's not good. Perhaps one of the biggest problems for me though is that the maps which I find quite fun and endearing, are unfortunately also far, far too large for the 5v5 player limit. This needs to be bumped up to at least 10v10 badly. There's just too much downtime spent running across the maps, not seeing any enemies, for a fast paced game like this to work. Additionally, and this is perhaps personal preference, I don't like that everyone has every weapon by default instead of picking things up on the map. Ammo for them all is also on a cooldown, so once you use your 1 allocated rocket or 6 sniper rounds, you have to wait. It's an odd mechanic to say the least, though I suppose not necessarily unbalanced. The shotgun seems to be everyone's go to at the moment though because it is ridiculously powerful. Right now, as it stands, I can't really recommend this and I'm currently on the fence about refunding it. $10 isn't much, but I feel it could be better spent elsewhere. I genuinely hope the devs improve the game because I've been waiting for another game like this for the better part of the past 15 years, but until that time, I may just have to get out my N64 and Sarge's Heroes again to get the experience I was hoping to have here.","December 8, 2015","false","1.9"," 35 of 122 people (29%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","29","35","122","9","2"

It's low price means low risk. It brings with it excellent Unreal 4 based visuals, decent gameplay, and a comedic tone to all its maps that is highly appreciated.\n\nIt has its drawbacks which are described in the full review linked above, but in short spurts Mean Greens is a fun off-beat game that's worth a look, especially if you are a fan of shooters.","December 21, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each map has it's own theme and objective, all players have 5 different guns for different situations, powerhosue guns like the sniper and rocket launcher have a very small amount of ammo and do not necessarily regenerate upon death, there is a set timer that must elapse in order for rockets/rounds to refresh.\n\nThe craziest part is while I enjoy it,t ehjre were a few downfalls yesterday, such as the inability to shoot while jumping.

After about 10 minutes of fumbling around for a server (there are serverside issues), I finally got in a game. And I was in for a treat.\n\nThere are 10 maps, each has a unique theme and gamemode. There are 5 weapons, and you start out with all of them when you spawn. The weapons are all unique, from the simple assault rifle to the one shot-kill rocket launcher (which is a bit op). There are no power-ups, no killstreaks, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Period. Weeeeeelll, except for the rocket launcher, because you get one shot with it per life (unless you survive long enough for its long cooldown to reset), and so every time you respawn you get a shot. Often gameplay progresses as:\n\n1. Shoot someone with the rocket launcher\n\n2. Someone shoots you with the rocket launcher\n\n3. Respawn and get another rocket launcher shot\n\nSo theres the only balancing issue I see. The only way I can see to fix this is to make the Rocket Launcher a powerup or killstreak bonus, or some other way.\nEDIT: They nerfed the rocket launcher- cooldown now carries over between deaths. This is a noticeable improvement. Thanks devs.\n\nAdditionally, there are some gamemodes where it is impossible for either side to score, and 90% of the time it ends in a tie. Those maps are Kitchen Run and Barnyard Ball.\n\nIn Kitchen Run, neither side can make it to the cup because the map is so linear. I'm thinking you should add some more paths through the donuts at the midway point to mix things up, because the donut area is just a huge bloodbath where very few make it past. Let alone do any players make it past the stove or sink.\n\nIt is so hard to score in Barnyard Ball because the ball always ends up on the edges where the flippers aren't, and the ball always gets stuck in the corner. I'd suggest making the edges and corners of the table at a slight incline to keep the ball somewhat closer to the middle area where the flippers are.\n\nAlso, there is NO progression system. I am opposed to unlockable combat bonuses, but here is my simple idea for progression:\n\nIt would kind of work like Rocket League, in that you get a random cosmetic after every fully completed game. There could be categories of unlockables, like hats, gun skins, and "backpack" style items.\n\nHats would be monochromatic to match your team color.\nGun skins would be patterned, like tiger stripes or camo.\nBackpack items would be small real-world items, like paper clips or pencil-top erasers. Maybe even those little toothpick flags you get in martinis.\n\nThose are just my ideas. This game has so much potential, and the devs currently have a fairly big audience, but I don't want to see this game die like Titanfall and so many other games have. You guys have a captive audience, now keep us entertained! :3","December 15, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Using the unreal engine, this awesome game of plastic green vs tan toy soldiers is beyond expectations. It does not involve any kind of ranking system to unlock anything, nor does it include pay to win options. All weapons are available and is a jump in and jump out of based games. This game is a rare jewel among the pile of coal for video games and if you need that awesome replayable value of a game, then this is the choice. I will definitely be listing this game as one of my top 10 choices of 2015.\n(Cons listed below)\n\nPROS\n- Beautiful Maps\n- Smooth Animation\n- Awesome Music\n- Replayable Value\n\n\nCONS ABOUT THE GAME\n\nCertain suggestions for the game I would recommend is additional animations for the army men. RPG's blow up the soldiers into bits which is cool. However, it would be amazing if the fire from flame-throwers could melt you, or have bullets and pellets from rifles and shotguns blow chunks off of your character to show a more cool reaction from shooting/fighting. Dodging animation into walls/objects sometimes have clipping issues and camera glitches where your camera is forced into different directions. Another issue that is a bit unsettling is random loud audio popping noises that happen throughout the game. Makes it a bit unsettling for the ears. Also, another suggestion would be for the RPG's. They do not cause self-inflicted damage like grenades do when shooting at an opponent at point blank range. Although it has a cool down timer per use, it allows a disadvantage for an opponent to run into the middle of a squad to shoot the ground and kill everyone except himself. Other than that though, this game is epicly amazing.\n\nCONS\n- Loud Popping Noises With Audio Randomly Throughout Matches\n- Dodge Animation Sometimes Has Clipping and Forced Camera Moving Errors.\n- AOE Self-Inflicted Damage Should be Applied to RPG's.\n- Needs more dynamic deaths for your character models depending on weapons.\n\nAnyways, i'll be playing this more on my show for Twitch. Check out the live broadcasts here :D.\n\nCheck out live gameplay on my twitch --- www.twitch.tv/tekavor","December 16, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack just screams "HAVE A FUN TIME!" And I did have it. The weapons seem pretty balanced, though I wasn't expecting it to have all the weapons from the getgo.

The game still felt right despite that.\nHowever, it still has its issues, like some lag/internet disconnect problems or some of the animations glitching. The major one though is the Spawn camping, especially in "Off The Rails". I was spawn-killed  about 50+ times only on ONE match in the first 4 hours I was playing the game, but that was because the players on our team left, leaving us with a match of 2 VS 5.\n\nOverall, fun game, incredible soundtrack and beautiful graphics and maps.\n\n7.5/10","December 15, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/God-KingKast/recommended/360940/","God-KingKast","G-Kast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/God-KingKast/","150 products in account","The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is a faithful recreation of the Army Men games we all know and love, especially an emphasis on the multi-player chaos of Sarge's Heroes 1 and 2. The game consists of (currently) 10 maps each with it's own unique gamemode. One map may be a simple TDM while another could be CTF. Each map really emits a feeling of tininess as you wage war in a bathtub or on a mini-train. The map design is simply excellent.\n\nThe gameplay however, is not as great as the map design and overall aesthetic of the game. It's a generic third-person shooter. The shooting in particular isn't impactful or sound all that great. Every player oddly has access to every weapon in the game. 5 in total, M16, Shotgun, (overpowered) Sniper, Bazooka, and a grenade. Why the devs didn't instead go for a class based system is beyond me.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Incredibly fun although very simplistic depending on what mode you're playing. The devs have confirmed vehicles and new maps coming soon and a possible splitscreen and singeplayer campaign.\n\nConcerns: Shotgun is OP, can insta-kill from a few feet if you're lucky. Jumping and rolling should cost stamina. Classes should be added so that every player isn't the exact same. Train map should be ticket based, not who can zerg the higher cap the fastest before the game ends. And that's about it. Great game, I reccommend due to nostalgia and the promises they told us and said they will implement (Vehicles, larger maps,etc. I doubt you would like this game if you aren't a fan of the Army men series.","February 6","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may be lacking content in some places and has its bugs, but that doesn't stop it from being a fantastic game to play, especially with friends. Between its bombastic live scoring, unique level concepts, high quality visuals, and overall fun gameplay. I'd say this is a worthy spiritual successor to the greatness of the Army Men games. It may not be the greatest thing ever, but if you can look past some of its short comings you'll find a game that has a lot of heart and soul put into it. With the devs working hard on putting out patches and more content, 10-15 dollars is a very good bargain. Of course, it helps to play with friends, but it's not necessary. It's fun to play period.

I really do. But as of this writing the game simply feels unbalanced and a little rough. The game is gorgeous, exciting, and very promising however. It is sorely lacking a local splitscreen or bot mode. I kind of wanted to just sort of drop in on a game and play casually for an hour or so...but no. That doesn't happen in this game. Newcomers in this game get SLAUGHTERED. The rocket launcher is completely OP and such a cheap kill that it just feels unsatisfying. Meanwhile the flamethrower I'm convinced actually does nothing. The grenade physics are extremely dodgy. I always felt like I was kinda dropping a grenade in a general direction instead of actually throwing it. the "join game" option on the main menu is completely broken. I was only able to play using the server browser. Game was dropped almost at the end of each match I played.  I admittedly didn't play very long, but the combat is pretty simple and there are only a handful of weapons (sniper rifle, flamethrower, rpg, machine gun, shotgun). Gameplay was just frustrating and unsatisfying even when I got a kill. The only reliable feeling waepon is the machine gun. Even the sniper rifle is extremely unwieldy and severely limits your vision in a way that defeats the purpose of using it. Level design is amazing on the other hand.\n\nBottom line is this game needs some ironing out in the gameplay dept. It needs a local or single player bot mode so it could flourish as a party game (rocket league, towerfall, toybox turbos etc) and offer players the chance to practice and have fun with the game offline. It also needs a class system or something...mannable turrets, vehicles, more weapons. Something to break up the monotany of "obligatory RPG kill, dodge, roll, crouch, grenade spam, get shot, repeat". I thought I was getting a fun "sarge's heroes" style party game shooter but its much more punishing than that and difficult to have fun playing tbh.","December 14, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It brings back memories of the old N64 days of melting the tan. The maps are fantastic, the balancing weapons/updating is incredibly frequent, and the objectives for the different maps can provide game play that is completely unique to the arena that you are currently playing on. It looks great, plays great, and you can tell a lot of work was put into the game.\nHOWEVER. There is no community for this game. There are never more than 5 or 10 people playing at one time, and this is at the absolute peak. When the game first came out there were plenty of people playing. Slowly, people have just stopped playing the game. This leads to some horribly frustrating moments when you want to play this game, but are forced to play with 3 people or don't play at all. This is a STRICTLY online game and I can't even play the game with a full match of 9 other people. This speaks volumes about the difficulties that the devs have had with their servers. If staying connected in a match wasn't difficult enough, sometimes the game doesn't show ANY SERVERS AT ALL. I would naturally assume this was my fault, some error in my steam or my online connection. No. This is an issue that the devs seem to be completely ignoring. This could be a beautiful, fun game that I could spend countless hours on. As of this moment however, this game makes me wish that I could get my ten dollars back. I'm not sure how its proper to pay for something that you can't even use. 4/10.

The players assume the role of plastic toy soldiers as they try to clear different objectives across different maps taking place in different rooms of the same house (like the kitchen or the bathroom). Each of the ten maps the game is shipped with host a dedicate game mode that requires the two team to pursue a single objective while they try to kill each other: while some are derived from your typical multiplayer shooters, like capture the flag or control point capture, others are more unique and are about manipulating the level's assets in a certain way to achieve victory.\nThe Mean Greens could however really use a loadout/inventory feature for the players: as it stands, each soldier comes into play with the same five weapons (an assault rifle, a bazooka, a sniper rifle, a shotgun and a flamethrower). On top of not allowing the player to personalize his/her arsenal to fit his/her own playstyle, the stock loadout basically forces everyone to stick with the most powerful weapon for that specific patch cycle and pretty much nothing else.\nAnother issue that plagues this game as this review's writing is the extremely low number of players worldwide: while finding a match isn't impossible per se, having a series of maps with one team (or both) missing some players is something that happens fairly often.\nThe strongest suit of The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare remains its presentation: the design of the single maps is always very inspired and plesant to look at and explore as you maul other players, and the soundtrack, on top of fitting the general mood of the game well, is remarkably good for an indie game.

Using the unreal engine, this awesome game of plastic green vs tan toy soldiers is beyond expectations. It does not involve any kind of ranking system to unlock anything, nor does it include pay to win options. All weapons are available and is a jump in and jump out of based games. This game is a rare jewel among the pile of coal for video games and if you need that awesome replayable value of a game, then this is the choice. I will definitely be listing this game as one of my top 10 choices of 2015.\n(Cons listed below)\n\nPROS\n- Beautiful Maps\n- Smooth Animation\n- Awesome Music\n- Replayable Value\n\n\nCONS ABOUT THE GAME\n\nCertain suggestions for the game I would recommend is additional animations for the army men. RPG's blow up the soldiers into bits which is cool. However, it would be amazing if the fire from flame-throwers could melt you, or have bullets and pellets from rifles and shotguns blow chunks off of your character to show a more cool reaction from shooting/fighting. Dodging animation into walls/objects sometimes have clipping issues and camera glitches where your camera is forced into different directions. Another issue that is a bit unsettling is random loud audio popping noises that happen throughout the game. Makes it a bit unsettling for the ears. Also, another suggestion would be for the RPG's. They do not cause self-inflicted damage like grenades do when shooting at an opponent at point blank range. Although it has a cool down timer per use, it allows a disadvantage for an opponent to run into the middle of a squad to shoot the ground and kill everyone except himself. Other than that though, this game is epicly amazing.\n\nCONS\n- Loud Popping Noises With Audio Randomly Throughout Matches\n- Dodge Animation Sometimes Has Clipping and Forced Camera Moving Errors.\n- AOE Self-Inflicted Damage Should be Applied to RPG's.\n- Needs more dynamic deaths for your character models depending on weapons.\n\nAnyways, i'll be playing this more on my show for Twitch.

The Mean Greens will throw you for a loop, though, if you think it will just be another grey/brown/green romp through a shiny explosion-fest. The Mean Greens goes at the genre through a different set of windows. It decides to bust through the fun windows. You know the ones that haven’t really been broken recently. Everyone is all up on the hyper-realistic shooters and while a lot of them are pretty stinking cool, they all kind of merge together in my brain at least. In The Mean Greens you play as green or tan army men straight out of your childhood… if you were raised with them instead of an iPad. I know some of you may only be familiar with them thanks to Toy Story… and I’m mostly ok with that.\n\nI’m going to go with what I didn’t like first since that’s a shorter list and everyone always likes to know what they are getting into before they jump into the pool. The shooting is the only thing that troubles me here. For the most part, my friends and I have noticed a bit of a discrepancy between our aim and some of the other players. I’m fairly sure everyone at this point is on the up and up so that leaves me with a few options. Either other people have just acclimated to the spread of the guns better than some or using a controller has some added benefits over the mouse and keyboard option. Some people can just wreck with the regular machine gun while I tend to struggle with it and the shotgun (although most of my kills are with the machine gun). I’m pretty good with the rocket launcher, but that’s like being proud to win with a gun at a knife fight. I may figure it out eventually, but something does feel off about the controls.\n\nOn the bright side, with good teamwork, shooting isn’t everything. The Mean Greens is set up as more of an objective based game. I tend to only stick with maps that are not free-for-all based. Luckily that leaves me with… every other map in the pool other than Art Table Shuffle. What that means is you’re left with:\n\n-playing capture the flag in a fish aquarium\n-attacking and defending plates of cookies on a toy train driving around a Christmas tree\n-playing fußball on a barn themed fußball table\n-trying to unfreeze your dinosaur in a freezer before the other team can free theirs\n-even more, but I don’t like doing lists like this, go play the game\n\nThis game has given so many different takes on similar themes that it just makes my heart happy. Even with dying at times, I’ve found myself having a laugh at the hilarity of the situation my team of toy soldiers have found themselves in. Some of that is in part to learning how the levels are composed and where everything is. Most of it is due to the crazy atmosphere and great music. Ever wanted to assault or defend a birthday cake? Well, The Mean Greens gives you that chance!\n\nI guess I can throw out one last thing. There has been a lot of complaining about servers and being kicked and all that jazz. Yes, I do get kicked automatically from servers at times. Yes, that does suck. Does it happen a lot? No, not really once you find a server. Finding a server would be another complaint if you want to use the “find server” option. They said they’ve patched it, but as of yesterday, it will usually put me into a server all by myself instead of one with room. Yes, that’s unfortunate, but I can just as easily go to the server list and order it by ping and click into a server and Bob’s your uncle. It’s not ideal, but it’s not a deal breaker. Let’s stop being spoiled here. If that’s your only complaint, I’d say be thankful.\n\nScore: Gewd/Tasty\n\nI will reiterate what I said in my tweet in that I believe that The Mean Greens is the “best variation on gameplay in the FPS genre in the long time including Splatoon.” That is not to say that it is without its faults and when they hit you, you notice them. However, it is super nice to see a developer go and create a game in a familiar genre and not simply rehash what is already available in so many different forms already. There are a lot of shooters out there that will run you a bit of money and there are a lot of free ones as well that don’t suck. At the end of the day, a lot of them are simply the same game with a different color of paint. So much is different in The Mean Greens and anyone who even likes to dabble in the FPS genre would be a fool to not try The Mean Greens out. It’s simply way to fun to avoid.","December 18, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After about 10 minutes of fumbling around for a server (there are serverside issues), I finally got in a game. And I was in for a treat.\n\nThere are 10 maps, each has a unique theme and gamemode. There are 5 weapons, and you start out with all of them when you spawn. The weapons are all unique, from the simple assault rifle to the one shot-kill rocket launcher (which is a bit op). There are no power-ups, no killstreaks, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Period. Weeeeeelll, except for the rocket launcher, because you get one shot with it per life (unless you survive long enough for its long cooldown to reset), and so every time you respawn you get a shot. Often gameplay progresses as:\n\n1. Shoot someone with the rocket launcher\n\n2. Someone shoots you with the rocket launcher\n\n3. Respawn and get another rocket launcher shot\n\nSo theres the only balancing issue I see. The only way I can see to fix this is to make the Rocket Launcher a powerup or killstreak bonus, or some other way.\nEDIT: They nerfed the rocket launcher- cooldown now carries over between deaths. This is a noticeable improvement. Thanks devs.\n\nAdditionally, there are some gamemodes where it is impossible for either side to score, and 90% of the time it ends in a tie. Those maps are Kitchen Run and Barnyard Ball.\n\nIn Kitchen Run, neither side can make it to the cup because the map is so linear. I'm thinking you should add some more paths through the donuts at the midway point to mix things up, because the donut area is just a huge bloodbath where very few make it past. Let alone do any players make it past the stove or sink.\n\nIt is so hard to score in Barnyard Ball because the ball always ends up on the edges where the flippers aren't, and the ball always gets stuck in the corner. I'd suggest making the edges and corners of the table at a slight incline to keep the ball somewhat closer to the middle area where the flippers are.\n\nAlso, there is NO progression system. I am opposed to unlockable combat bonuses, but here is my simple idea for progression:\n\nIt would kind of work like Rocket League, in that you get a random cosmetic after every fully completed game. There could be categories of unlockables, like hats, gun skins, and "backpack" style items.\n\nHats would be monochromatic to match your team color.\nGun skins would be patterned, like tiger stripes or camo.\nBackpack items would be small real-world items, like paper clips or pencil-top erasers. Maybe even those little toothpick flags you get in martinis.\n\nThose are just my ideas. This game has so much potential, and the devs currently have a fairly big audience, but I don't want to see this game die like Titanfall and so many other games have. You guys have a captive audience, now keep us entertained! :3","December 15, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the look and the sounds/music plus the idea of each map having it's own objective is cool. Some maps need a bit of tuning, as most games end up a draw on a few of them due to it taking FOREVER to reach the objective (one linear path to get to the other side and once you die, you start all over at the beginning). Voice chat would be nice (I think it's still missing as of me typing this) and lag has been an issue a couple of times (but mostly lag free, for me at least). Yes, there is a nostalgia factor if you played the old 3DO Army Men titles and that does play a small part in why I bought this in the first place, but the game is good in its own right. I think this game is in need of minimal tuning and additional content, and I think this will happen seeing how active the devs have been thus far.\n\ntl;dr\n\n7.5/10 Decent Third-Person Shooter with surprising polish for an Early Access Title, just needs a bit...

There's the basic TDM, FFA, KOTH, CTF, Neutral CTF, capture points, but some maps have their own completly unique game types that fit the toy soldier environment such as an attack/defen map where you have to light birthday candles with your flamethrower, or thaw out your dinosaur in the freezer before the other team thaws theirs.","December 29, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/troutacus/recommended/360940/","troutacus","Airman Sly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/troutacus/","108 products in account",""The Mean Greens" is a multiplayer third person shooter from the perspective of toy army men (like those old 3DO games). This is a setting I was very excited to see again. It allows for creative maps including the inside of a fishtank, a foosball table, and a birthday cake. Each map has its own unique game mode, which means most maps are very well tuned to their mode. Unfortunately, this also means that the game may become stale; if you like deathmatch, you only have the Toybox map for team deathmatch or the Art Table for free-for-all. That said, I got plenty of value because I do enjoy objective modes.\n\nGameplay is rather simplistic, I believe by the developers' intentions. The movement and shooting mechanics are fairly standard, reminding me a great deal of Battlefront 2. Every player has access to the entire arsenal at any time (no classes or customization) meaning each soldier is able to handle every situation. Personally, I find this refreshing; there is no need to worry about unlocks or classes, and the game is easy to pick up and understand. However, progression systems are pervasive for a reason, and players may find themselves bored as a result of this omission.\n\nConnectivity is the biggest issue facing this game right now, but even then I feel the problem is overstated in many reviews. The option to have the game place you in a session was problematic and is currently disabled for reworking. I've personally had few issues with the server browser and can get into a game in less than a couple minutes at most. If this issue is holding you back, I'd recommend hitting the follow button and waiting a month or so. Patches have been frequent and I expect a few more in the next month or so.\n\n\n14/20 (A simple but fun shooter in an exciting setting)","December 29, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The UE4 has an awesome rendering on matter, lighting and reflection !\nSounds and musics are effective and efficient, and fit with the univers of the game.\nSo, why "but" ?\nThis game is only focus on multiplayer and here is the problem ! Only multiplayer isn't a problem, but if online quality and lobbying don't follow, so, there is a problem. No filter in browser, deconnection without reason, and some latency here and there.\nBut the devs seem reactive to update their game, to listen to the community, and, in addition, friendly, so I hope some improvements in multiplayer.\n\nVerdict : A cheap great game for fun parties, but needs some improvements in online, thus welcome to the green army, but be aware of this, plastic soldier !","January 2","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What looks like a fun trip through toy laden war grounds quickly looses its luster with the lack of proper visceral feedback, a cute but quickly annoying theme song (as it is the ONLY music in the game and is audible everywhere), an infuriating respawn system, and it is all enveloped by a clunky and rough UI. Overall, this game has a lot of potential, but as it currently stands, it feels more like an Early Access title where the attention was focus on level design.","December 14, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The map variety is amazing and unlike any shooter I have played before.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Every map has a unique game mode and environment\n2. It feels like a modern shooter so the movement and actions are pretty fluid\n\nCons:\n\n1. The hit box when shooting feels way off\n\n2. When switching weapons it takes a good 2-3 seconds before the weapon you selected becomes equipped. If you try to shoot or aim before your character physically equips it you will stick to the weapon you currently had equipped which makes it frustrating and slows down the pace of the game\n\n3. Nerf the rocket launcher or at least make it to where you can have loadouts and only 2 weapons per loadout (1 loadout per match). Honestly everyone just spams rocket launchers and it becomes the same thing over and over and over\n\n4. Sometimes the controls don't work (for example when I click the aim button but it doesn't do anything, or try to shoot someone and nothing comes out even though I have a full clip).\n\n5. Obvious connect to host/server issues, don't need to explain here\n\n\nOverall this game deserves to be up there with the top shooters, it is so unique and fun and has the potential to be competitive. I understand this game only came out 6 days ago which is why I know they can fix/patch things to make this great game into a fantastic game.\n\nDefinitely a buy\n","December 14, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may not be the greatest thing ever, but if you can look past some of its short comings you'll find a game that has a lot of heart and soul put into it. With the devs working hard on putting out patches and more content, 10-15 dollars is a very good bargain. Of course, it helps to play with friends, but it's not necessary. It's fun to play period.

I really do. But as of this writing the game simply feels unbalanced and a little rough. The game is gorgeous, exciting, and very promising however. It is sorely lacking a local splitscreen or bot mode. I kind of wanted to just sort of drop in on a game and play casually for an hour or so...but no. That doesn't happen in this game. Newcomers in this game get SLAUGHTERED. The rocket launcher is completely OP and such a cheap kill that it just feels unsatisfying. Meanwhile the flamethrower I'm convinced actually does nothing. The grenade physics are extremely dodgy. I always felt like I was kinda dropping a grenade in a general direction instead of actually throwing it. the "join game" option on the main menu is completely broken. I was only able to play using the server browser. Game was dropped almost at the end of each match I played.  I admittedly didn't play very long, but the combat is pretty simple and there are only a handful of weapons (sniper rifle, flamethrower, rpg, machine gun, shotgun). Gameplay was just frustrating and unsatisfying even when I got a kill. The only reliable feeling waepon is the machine gun. Even the sniper rifle is extremely unwieldy and severely limits your vision in a way that defeats the purpose of using it. Level design is amazing on the other hand.\n\nBottom line is this game needs some ironing out in the gameplay dept. It needs a local or single player bot mode so it could flourish as a party game (rocket league, towerfall, toybox turbos etc) and offer players the chance to practice and have fun with the game offline. It also needs a class system or something...mannable turrets, vehicles, more weapons. Something to break up the monotany of "obligatory RPG kill, dodge, roll, crouch, grenade spam, get shot, repeat". I thought I was getting a fun "sarge's heroes" style party game shooter but its much more punishing than that and difficult to have fun playing tbh.","December 14, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The map variety is amazing and unlike any shooter I have played before.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Every map has a unique game mode and environment\n2. It feels like a modern shooter so the movement and actions are pretty fluid\n\nCons:\n\n1. The hit box when shooting feels way off\n\n2. When switching weapons it takes a good 2-3 seconds before the weapon you selected becomes equipped. If you try to shoot or aim before your character physically equips it you will stick to the weapon you currently had equipped which makes it frustrating and slows down the pace of the game\n\n3. Nerf the rocket launcher or at least make it to where you can have loadouts and only 2 weapons per loadout (1 loadout per match). Honestly everyone just spams rocket launchers and it becomes the same thing over and over and over\n\n4. Sometimes the controls don't work (for example when I click the aim button but it doesn't do anything, or try to shoot someone and nothing comes out even though I have a full clip).\n\n5. Obvious connect to host/server issues, don't need to explain here\n\n\nOverall this game deserves to be up there with the top shooters, it is so unique and fun and has the potential to be competitive. I understand this game only came out 6 days ago which is why I know they can fix/patch things to make this great game into a fantastic game.\n\nDefinitely a buy\n","December 14, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The trailer just came out of nowhere while browsing KnowYourMeme, and boy was I hooked as soon as I finished watching the trailer. Bought it on the same day and I was amazed.\nThe fast-paced gaming, the fact that we are playing as toy soldiers in HUGE MAPS a la de_rats, and (OMG!) the soundtrack. The soundtrack just screams "HAVE A FUN TIME!" And I did have it. The weapons seem pretty balanced, though I wasn't expecting it to have all the weapons from the getgo. I was expecting a "Classes" type of game (Like Battlefront 2 or Day of Defeat). But that's just me. The game still felt right despite that.\nHowever, it still has its issues, like some lag/internet disconnect problems or some of the animations glitching. The major one though is the Spawn camping, especially in "Off The Rails". I was spawn-killed  about 50+ times only on ONE match in the first 4 hours I was playing the game, but that was because the players on our team left, leaving us with a match of 2 VS 5.\n\nOverall, fun game, incredible soundtrack and beautiful graphics and maps.\n\n7.5/10","December 15, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The players assume the role of plastic toy soldiers as they try to clear different objectives across different maps taking place in different rooms of the same house (like the kitchen or the bathroom). Each of the ten maps the game is shipped with host a dedicate game mode that requires the two team to pursue a single objective while they try to kill each other: while some are derived from your typical multiplayer shooters, like capture the flag or control point capture, others are more unique and are about manipulating the level's assets in a certain way to achieve victory.\nThe Mean Greens could however really use a loadout/inventory feature for the players: as it stands, each soldier comes into play with the same five weapons (an assault rifle, a bazooka, a sniper rifle, a shotgun and a flamethrower). On top of not allowing the player to personalize his/her arsenal to fit his/her own playstyle, the stock loadout basically forces everyone to stick with the most powerful weapon for that specific patch cycle and pretty much nothing else.\nAnother issue that plagues this game as this review's writing is the extremely low number of players worldwide: while finding a match isn't impossible per se, having a series of maps with one team (or both) missing some players is something that happens fairly often.\nThe strongest suit of The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare remains its presentation: the design of the single maps is always very inspired and plesant to look at and explore as you maul other players, and the soundtrack, on top of fitting the general mood of the game well, is remarkably good for an indie game.

I missed it. But once again. As sarge said. "GOOD TO GO!" I cant really say ANYTHING bad about it. Each map has its own unique(ish) game mode. The controls are very enjoyable. The gameplay is fast and downtime is slow. If a few more folks played, AND if they had more then ONE sound track for each level Itd be perfect. Right now its kinda low on the population. But the learning curve is NON EXISTANT. I just jumped in and everything was intuitive. As for my mention on the music The time given for any match is bout 10 min. Id preffer if each level had 3 soundtracks for it. of three or so min each. Hearing the same track EVERY time tends to GRATE on my ears.\n\nSo yeah other then the lack of diverse music and a seemingly low playerbase.\n\nTHE MEAN GREENS. is exactly what it delivers.
