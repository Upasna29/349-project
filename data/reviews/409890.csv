But it's important for me to get the information to consumers out there.\n\nVideo Footage/Port Report:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx5HWcotNGg\n\nLists:\nPositives:\n60 FPS with no frame rate drops seen. Recordings taken with both FRAPS and Shadowplay on two different systems.\nSeems stable at this time, as I saw no problems with loading times or crashes during the first 13 hours of gameplay.\nResolution options up to 1080p with full screen, fullscreen windowed, and windowed mode.\nController support (Obviously, it was an Xbox 360 game, it better have 360 controller support)\nSome good secondary options with SE and Environmental sound effect sliders.\nBindable Keys of 2 sets, which is always nice when they give an alternative set.\nNegatives:\nUses numbers instead of the actual keys to label the keys you need to use on menus. Instead of showing X for example, it refers to it by “5” if you set it up that way. Annoying.\nChange in context regarding Fullscreen mode would once in a while cause you to either quit out of it, or fool it in launching the game again, causing an ok prompt, and going forward.\nTool tip descriptions at times needed to be more descriptive.\nSome options don't seem to work, like the upload option. I'm not even sure what it's supposed to do.","June 6","true","15.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

All of that, is pretty damn good... except the shell it's put in, is one that looks years outdated.\n\nFull Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHVcfGySqc\n\nSummary:\nAs always, check the video for the best possible impression\n\nWhile I enjoyed this title's core gameplay loop quite a bit, it needs to be said first and foremost... it looks outdated as hell. This is obviously a game from 2014 that was released for a 10 year old piece of hardware… But it’s coming to the PC and here we expect our dungeons to look pretty.\n\nWhile the overall static art, portraits and monsters look great, the lack of animations, combat effects and otherwise barebones “extra’s” very much detract from the visual experience of the title.\n\nNow, the game is pretty difficult, but while that normally isn’t an issue – other games are hard! – The problem of this games grindy nature, forcing you to level new characters repeatedly to have a healthy pool of characters to switch around does also detract from the gameplay loop of running dungeons.\n\nIf you can live with the sub-par graphics and if you enjoy leveling a variety of characters through the same dungeons then this game offers a few things that are damn good.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty great. With a large variety of dungeons, monsters, items, classes and many methods of combining them together. Coupled with a unique and interesting twist on the perma-death mechanic it gives the game a sense of adrenaline during combat, while not completely messing you over if a character in your party dies.\n\nThe story and world, coupled with the artstyle are damn good. Grim and dark isn’t normally something I feel in an Anime-style RPG, but this game has it down to a T, making me notice that the world they live in isn’t nice and they just have to deal with it. It’s great atmosphere.\n\nThe story has a nice level of depth and dominions that allow for a lot of exploration and various plot twists.\n\nIt’s a game for the lover of the DRPG and JRPG, and it does a great job at that. But it’s not a perfect game, and comes to the PC already visually outdated.\n","June 6","true","12.2"," 33 of 60 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","33","60","0","3"

Given that I have written quite a bit already at the link above, I am trying to determine how to condense it.  Yes, I was given a copy of this game by NIS America for review purposes, and yes, I heartily recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a solid, enjoyable First Person Dungeon Crawler experience.\n\nBut there are issues, and these are things you need to be aware of before jumping in.  Firstly, there is no handholding here.  The game explains very little, giving you the barest of explanations about mechanics.  It has a UI that had me confused frequently (where do I find the bloody Slow and Avoid spells...9 hours later I find the tabs for spells).  What are these icons in the middle of the screen at the bottom for?  Why does it take so long to grind out levels?\n\nDespite these faults however, I kept playing, and I honestly enjoyed it.  The story is a tad threadbare but unlocked in a unique way.  The factions you have to work with are interesting.  The music is PHENOMENAL and if I had a way to get the Soundtrack I would in a heartbeat.  The art work and artstyle and sprites are unique and fun.  The combat, while basic, is entertaining (Seriously, a Samurai using Carnage Front gets hilarious) and the mechanics involving permadeath and class changing are unique.\n\nAlso, the dungeons are very interesting.  Each has a unique feel to them, from a container yard full of bandits, to a snowy forest that spins you around and has hidden pathways, and a secret underground temple palace with teleporters and false walls, each felt different enough to be fun.  I got far enough to unlock the second set of dungeons, which included an underwater temple, a ghost city, and a mining complex, but due to the difficulty of grinding XP I havent had a chance to go further.\n\nSeriously, the encounter rates are so low it can take an hour or more to gain a single level.  It gets a little absurb.\n\nIf you can handle the hardcore nature of this game, and are wanting a great dungeon crawling experience with some of the best art and music I have seen recently, you cannot go wrong with this game.","June 6","true","18.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I have a controller but I have yet to use it because I actually enjoy using M+KB for this particular game. For those of you who've played Demon Gaze, you'll pretty much would want to play this as well. Additionally, the music might remind you of Vocaloid so that's a plus (if that's your thing). Haven't experienced any game breaking issues. Pretty great experience overall. I'd say this is a good vita port.\n\nMore info: Being able to play with characters with more than 1 art style is a huge plus for me.","June 6","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few tiny hiccups like needing to unplug any controllers if you want to see keyboard input commands, but generally very good.\n\nGameplay seems pretty good, and you can switch between the western or anime style from the options menu, I much prefer the original art style, but having the switch should please everyone.\n\nIn-built full screen borderless windowed mode was a nice surprise.","June 6","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
