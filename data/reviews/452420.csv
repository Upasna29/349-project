Koihime Enbu's angle is "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", but almost every character is a girl. Guan Yu? Cao Cao? Sun Shang Xiang!? All girls. Furthermore, this game is a spin-off of Koihime Musou, an adult visual-novel/strategy game about a young man who travels back in time to this Three Kingdoms era. To be honest, I'm a little surprised that Koihime Enbu is an awesome fighting game.\n\nIn terms of game-design, Koihime Enbu is unlike other contemporary 2D fighters. Instead of having its combatants soar into the air and devastate each other with dizzying combos, this game keeps it very grounded. For the most part, combos rarely go beyond two-in-ones, or jump-in > follow-up > special. A lot of matches are determined by fighting-game basics. By that I mean spacing, footsies, pokes, anti-airs, and so on. It's not that these elements aren't present in other fighters, but players mistakenly tend to ignore them as the genre becomes increasingly complicated. If I were to draw comparisons, Koihime Enbu could be considered a faster-paced Samurai Showdown.\n\nGoing further, the moves you perform all have wildly-varying degrees of safetyness. Light attacks are generally a good idea for applying pressure, but they probably won't decide matches. Medium and heavy attacks have their uses, and with proper timing and spacing, you can control the flow of the match. However, when you hold forward, or down/forward and perform a medium or heavy attack, everything changes. Your heroine performs a high-risk attack. It's slow, can be countered in many ways, but it can also dramatically effect the outcome of the fight.\n\nNow I'm not sure what to call it. A critical-counter? A fatal-counter? A romantic-counter? Well, it doesn't really matter. Basically, when the opponent is hit with a certain move, they crumple to the floor. This gives the player still standing an opportunity to land a massive combo. We're talking wall-splats, ground-bounces, the works. Off of a single one of these counters, players can expect to lose anywhere from 30 to 60 or even 100%(!!) of their life. It sounds crazy, but keep in mind that the larger combos will require some rather precise positioning, execution, and a lot of meter. To add to this, you can't get hit by these devastating counters if you aren't caught pressing buttons. Obviously the answer to avoiding these situations isn't "don't try to attack", but you have to be wary.\n\nWhile I've just discussed what can be considered the x-factor of a Koihime Enbu fight, these occurences are few and far between. If your opponent is well-aware that you're fishing for a crucial-counter, they're going to have no trouble picking you apart. In this game, the simplest combos or even single-attacks can do serious damage. A lot of the time, you'll find that the best strategy is to stick to the basics. Aside from those mythical 75-100% combos, the execution barrier for this game is very low. This allows players to devote their energies towards understanding match-ups, looking for openings, and hopefully, winning matches. While I think that the roster could stand to have a few more entrants, it does strike the right balance between depth and accessibility. Every character is easy to use, but they can also offer some unique moves or interesting tactics. Aside from everyone having good and bad match-ups, there doesn't seem to be any truly ineffective characters.\n\nAs far as content goes, it's fair to say that this game is a better buy for competitive players. While this tends to be the expectation when it comes to fighters, a sizable number of these games still include extensive single-player modes. Unfortunately, this isn't the case for Koihime Enbu. I'm going to start this portion of the review off by admitting that... well... I got a little curious and did some research. I browsed the Koihime Muso wikia, looked up some other related materials, and now I'm interested in seeing more of the storyline. Unfortunately, the scenario mode in Koihime Enbu is a little disappointing. Each character has their own story, and dialogues with their opponents in-between matches, but the plot isn't there.\n\nI suppose I shouldn't be asking for a storyline that affects the Koihime Muso canon, especially with the omission of a few key characters (such as the male lead and Ryūbi Gentoku aka Liu Bei). Still, as a huge fan of the Three Kingdoms novel, I was hoping for something with a little more depth, rather than a handful of gags and sorta-intimate moments. Still, the scenario mode might be worth checking out, since at least it gives some insight on everyone, and will help newcomers get used to how the game works and the franchise that it spawned from.\n\nThe training mode in this game is very well-designed. It covers all of the functionality that fighting game fans are accustomed to, such as a multitude of options, the ability to practice against the CPU, and even allowing for two players to spar with each other. Alongside the training mode, there is also a challenge mode where players can attempt several combos, each more convoluted than the last. Training mode can also be accessed while waiting for online matches, which is always welcome.\n\nAs far as the online-play is concerned, I believe that it's satisfactory. There have been some instances of lag, most notably when I (an American) was playing against someone from Japan. Speaking of, expect the competition to be extremely stiff and punishing. Koihime Enbu has been in Japanese arcades since 2014, and on consoles since the beginning of this year. I've already had a few matches, where I put up as much of a fight as a training dummy. This is partly because some of the strategies I've run into, simply won't occur in the single-player modes.\n\nTo give an example, one of my opponents was a Sonshōkō (Sun Shang Xiang) player. The first round was a close win for me, my opponent won the second. After the second round, I noticed that my opponent had a full bar of meter. So what happened in the third round? On my end, everything went to Hell. Each faction in the game has a couple selectable strategists. Summoning help costs meter, but they offer some useful techniques, if you know how to employ them. Anyway, Ryomō (one of the strategists), throws three projectiles at the opponent. While this is happening, Sonshōkō has some freedom to attack or defend at will. I wasn't prepared for this. So needless to say, all of my advances were thwarted, I fell victim to some nasty mix-ups, and I couldn't even land chip-damage on my opponent.\n\nThat's not to say that all of your fights will be decided by unfamiliar tech. In every match, there is a measurable level of chaos. To explain it better, I'll post a link to a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwaDqSMs5iE . Notice how several seconds pass by in the first round without a single hit being registered. As the match progresses, both players start taking risks, and the rounds are decided far more quickly. High-level play can be extremely methodical, so if you don't have the patience for it, you'll get hurt.\n\nAlthough Koihime Enbu is lacking in terms of single-player content, I have every reason to believe that this is one of the better fighting games on Steam. It has its own style, and offers enough playability to challenge gamers of any skill-level.\n\nDisclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","May 20","true","17.5"," 74 of 88 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","74","88","0","8"

Moves have huge recovery and not everything is cancellable, on block you’ll always be minus, meaning you have to be smart with your button choice. Frame traps are non-existent because of this outside of chaining jabs together. The lack of air dash, air blocking and constant pressure separates this from the ‘anime’ style of game. Don’t worry though you have massive supers that do 40% and show the ladies in all their glory.\n\nThe game is a counterhit paradise; if you’ve played SFV it’s similar to crush counters except this whole game revolves around it. Without counter hit you might be doing 15%-20% damage, on CH we’re talking 40-75% damage depending on your resources.\n\nOverall it’s very easy to pick up and play, you can freestyle for the most part and a lot of the characters have universal systems. Training mode is solid and with a large cast size with vary archetypes that all feel awesome to play. The input system is incredibly easy also; each character has 3 special moves, 1 super and another super that can only be done during the CH/CrushCounter state. There’s universal overheads, launchers and sweeps, allowing you to jump between characters and have an understanding with no problem.\n\nThe major problem is this game has been out for some time on the JPN PSN and even longer in arcades, you might have a hard time finding games outside of launch. There are also not many resources, so unless you’re ready to create your own combos or scour YouTube to find them you’ll be in trouble. With SFV being the mess that it is it’s not a bad time to try and explore other fighting games, in saying that you might be better off trying popular anime games such as Guilty Gear or BlazBlue.\n","May 19","true","5.7"," 66 of 85 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","66","85","4","0"

The combat revolves around the basics, meaning knowing when to charge in or hold back and being able to string in small combos whenever the opportunity presents itself, will earn you victory. Like most Anime-style fighters you are able to combine dizzyingly long combos but it requires to make use of the high-risk, high Reward Fatal Counter system. The Fatal Counter system can be triggered by counter-attacking with Slow/Heavy attacks that  give opponents a larger window of opportunity for quick jabs+special moves, showing the need for patience and proper timing.\n\nLike most fighters nowadays, Koihime Enbu has a training mode in which players can test out moves against CPU opponents in a variety of situations (crouching, jumping ect...) The training mode also acts as the challenge mode that goes from basic special moves to longer complicated combos.\n\nEach character has a limited but diverse moveset which can be used with different tactics, giving each character a unique feel. Along with the 13 characters, there is also a choice between 2 tacticians per faction Shoku (Kan'u, Bachou ,Chō'un, Chōhi),  Gi (Sōsō, Kakōton, Kakōen, Gakushin) and Go (Sonken, Sonshōkō, Kannei, Shūtai) with the exception of Ryofu who only gets 1. Tacticians can fit a variety of purposes from being able to prolong combos  to the ability to create an opening needed to gain ground.\n\nThere is a scenario mode that includes dialogue before and after a fight that can somewhat show the relationship between characters, but in order to fully understand, prior knowledge from the Visual novels (or anime at least) is required. By completing a Character scenario you are rewarded with an event and a gorgeous CG that will be added to the  In-game gallery.\n\nOverall, Koihime Enbu is a solid 2D fighter thats great for beginners and advanced players, being able to teach the core skills needed in any fighting game and still provide a decent challenge.","May 24","true","15.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Most of the moves are done by simple circle combos but the ease of performing special moves means that you can pick up and play immediately. The game is a port of the PS4 release and as such the on screen button combinations are all PlayStation which when using an Xbox controller is very confusing.\n\nGameplay is something of a cross between BlazBlue and Street Fighter 3. You have 4 special gauges that can be used to trigger a number of special moves ranging from using your secondary character to combo ending anime explosions.\n\nThere are a few little issues that I have with the game most notably being the odd difficulty curve. Even on hard the arcade mode is actually very easy with the difficulty only spiking on the last fight.\n\nThe other slight issue is that currently unless you are hoping to play locally multiplayer may be out of the question. I tried on many occasions to get an on-line multiplayer game going but alas each time it simply expired.\n\nOverall Koihime Enbu is a decent fighting game and definitely one of the better indie fighters I have played in recent years. For fight fans it is a fun little game with a few little niggles that doesn't spoilt it overall. Definitely worth picking up if you are a fan of the genre and have some friends to play local multiplayer with.\n\nYou can checkout our video review this text review was based on here :  Video Review	[www.thegametutor.co.uk]","May 29","true","10.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Only gripe I might have is that for 30 bucks I would like to see maybe 4 or 5 more characters but thats not a problem.","May 19","true","2.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Way too expensive for a game that offers neither depth nor satisfaction.  And honestly the price is my biggest complaint.  If I could find it again for like 50% or more off I'd pick it up again for funsies and time killing.  But, this is my personal experiences here, I can find a game with all the scantily clad anime females I could want in Skullgirls (a MUCH more in depth fighter) which is 10$ or Vanguard Princess (has maybe one or two fewer characters but pretty much the rest of the mechanics are the exact same) which is 5$.","May 25","false","0.4"," 25 of 55 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","25","55","0","4"

The developers were kind enough to send me a review key for my channel, so I delved in expecting a mediocre fighting game, but I was wrong.\n\nIt has been one of the most incredible new and fresh experiences I have had the pleasure of having recently. Everything feels so responsive and it's so easy to pick up and play, even with very little fighting experience in the past. Not only will it show you the button guides for combos, but it'll give you a demonstration too, so every character is really easy to learn.\n\nThe story mode is filled with hilarious scenarios, that had me genuinely laughing and unexpectedly wanting to get through every single character's story just to see what happens. It's far from serious, but that gives a nice change from the usual Three Kingdoms products. The difficulty ramps up nicely, with a good challenge at the end of each path that will take some practice to overcome.\n\nI can't speak for the netcode as online play isn't enabled yet, but I will update this review once the game has been released and I'm really looking forward to hopping into the multiplayer and getting my rear end handed to me.\n\nIt's expensive and honestly you don't get a huge amount of content for the price tag, but what you do get is incredible and will keep you entertained for a huge amount of time. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer to the best of my ability.","May 19","true","23.1"," 15 of 37 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","15","37","0","1"
