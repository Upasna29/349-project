(Articial Intelligence) - I cannot emphasis or stress enough of how extremely good the A.I. is. It's probably one of the most advanced one I've seen in a 4x game genre. I absolutely love how it handles playing against me and handling my orders for planets, colonization, and etc (without the need to micromanage everything). Again, the A.I. in this game is just so good that it cannot be expressed sufficiently of how good it is. Even the developer of this game admits that hard is very tough for him.\n\nAutomating - This relates to the A.I. but one significant difference. I love the fact that I can explore the galaxy and leave behind orders to colonize it and what kind of focus I would want on the colony. I checked on their build orders and made sure it fit. I have to say that I don't think I can do it any better than the A.I. except on my core worlds, which I micro-manage personally as it's the engine to my war machines. :) With this ability, I was able to colonize very efficiently and quickly without having to waste hours on fine-tuning it.\n\nResource Management/Economy - I absolutely love the fact that credits were completely eliminated and it only boils down to about 8 resources needed (I think I counted right). What's really nice about this is that you know which kind of planets you need to get specific type of resources. Some resources are very rare but for a good reason as they are access to very powerful technologies. Along with resource management, they are used as upkeep for your fleets as well. I think the developer has done an excellent job in balancing the resource consumption vs resource generation that every decision you make really counts.\n\nThe other thing to note is population. The way the developer has set it up is to make the population really count. This reminds me of the game Imperium Galactica II, where population was something to watch as you would put them to work. The same concept works here. You can build something (don't have to worry about placing it) then have the population grow to work on it. There is a limit of how many buildings you can place and it shows you in the planetary screen. The A.I. does a beautiful job in helping you to get the population necessary to work in the buildings you want. Again, this relates to grand strategy.\n\nScience & Technologies - I'm used to a linear path for technologies. However, this is an extremely refreshing take on gaining technologies. Instead of just building labs and generating more points to research faster to obtain technologies faster, the developer took an different approach, which I truly think mirrors how this world works. You have two path, which is fundamental and applied . Fundmental allows you to open up other branches of science to gain more exotic technologies (I.E. Antimatter). Applied gives you the actual technologies to use. It makes a lot of sense and I love it. You can control the direction of how you want your research to go by setting priorities, which speeds up your ability to obtain the specific technologies you want.\n\nI think this approach is far better for an 4x game.\n\nCustomization - The ability to customize your ship is fairly common but for this specific game, they added something that I immensely enjoyed, multiple layers of the ships. If I wanted to create an spy ship, I'll use a freighter that has three layers to it. Oh, the options I could have is immense, especially when you get all the technologies. I like the fact that you have to be decisive on what kind of ship you want and you have to make sacrifices to decide what that ship will specialize in. You can't have one ship that does everything. You actually need different ship designs for specific role. I think the developer has nailed this perfectly.\nRandom Events - I have to say when I was playing on normal, I really had to slug it out with the pirates at the beginning of the game. The pirates would take advantage of you and if they got you in a position of weakness, they'd open an dialogue and ask you for 10% payment of resources "to protect you" and stop their attacks. It was a really cool thing to see that. However, it didn't just stop there but there were external threats that really shook up the game and it took every ounce of my abilities to beat it back (this was just on normal!!). However, it was rewarding to finally defeat it although I admit that that the ending was a little anti-climatic but the fight to get there was epic.\n\nTo put it in perspective, I had over 350 planets colonized and only four of them were my major shipyards. The external threat took out three of them and I only had one ship yard building my massive warships but it takes about 18 years per warship. I was forced to retool some of my planets to industralization to try to produce more warship, which caused problems with food resources and among others. It made me sweat but this is the kind of game that has me playing for 10 hours straight, just trying to beat it back.\n\nGood job on keep me on my toes, even late game isn't a guaranteed that you'll win.\n\nTactical Combat - In my humble opinion, I think this game has took what Master of Orion 2 had and improved on it. The amount of control that we have in tactical combat is unbelievable and the A.I. kicks butt in helping you to manage it. I love the fact that I can control time (speeding it up or slowing it down). Even if I made the speed too high and didn't pause it in time, the A.I. does it for you and puts it in slow-motion so you can still have time to issue orders. Absolutely one of the best feature I've seen.\n\nEven better, I can quickly sort out my ships and put them in groups then control them based on that or select all fights or capital ships. The developer has made it really easy for you to manage your fleets in tactical combat.\nCon: :  Diplomacy  - To the developer's credit, the diplomacy is actually pretty good for a game like this. I was actually impressed with the options available for dialogue. You can convince the AI to enter in treaties with you, such as economic, scientific, open borders, and etc.\n\nHowever, what frustrated me was that I was unable to ascertain how benetifical these treaties were to me. For example, I get an economic treaty but I have no indication of how much this helps me in my resources or such. I tried hovering over the treaty to get a tooltip information but nothing. I checked in my resources to see if it shows up as additional or not but I couldn't see a difference. I canceled it then recorded the number then re-instated the treaty and the numbers didn't change after 10 years. It was the same for scientific treaties, I couldn't ascertain the benefit either.\n\nEven more frustrating was the inability to see what causes their attitudes to change. I had one A.I. that had negative attitude all the way but no reason why. I couldn't tell and I tried tooltips and etc, nothing.\n\nGraphic - To be fair, it's pretty good for a one-developer show but I like aesthestic but I don't give it my full weight in negative.\nAfter playing three games, one on easy then two on normal. I'm too afraid to try hard yet because the AI is incredibly good, even on normal. Easy, it was a little work but easy. I don't think I've seen a game where the AI in every aspect is excellent. To put it bluntly, this is probably one of the best 4x game I've played in an extremely long time.\n\nWhen I was playing this, I was reminded of the game Sins of the Solar Empire because it dealt in resources (also credit but not in this game). I really liked how the game focused on allowing you to employ your grand strategies while enjoying some tactical combat.\n\nOverall, I highly, highly, highly recommend this game for your 4x game fix. :)","March 23","true","80.3"," 174 of 194 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","174","194","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/recommended/418250/","commissarbro","CommissarBRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/","1034 products in account","This game is good. I've spent a lot of time playing it over the past few months (beta testing and all that) and I'm glad to see it has finally been released. I provide 2 versions of reviews, a first impressions video version and a written version. A little something for both camps.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-mk3TXp3Vk\n\nSo let's get right down to business. What is Polaris Sector? Polaris Sector is a 4x Real-time Grand Strategy game in the same vein as Distant World: Universe or a real time version of Space Empires or even Endless Space. It features a real-time battle system where you command ships and fighters against pirates and all manner of Xenos Scum. There are 9 races which all feature unique ship types and can be customized via point distribution in over 13 passive buffs. As is usual with these sorts of games, you have research (an exhaustingly extensive research tree might I add), exploration, espionage and ship customization. You can also rename planets and systems. It's your standard run of the mill 4x Space game.\n\nWhat sets it a part from other games of the same vein?\nNot much to be honest but it does something very well that a lot of 4x Space Strategy games forget... it feels streamlined and the gameplay is relatively fast paced. You always have something to do but because you can just pause the game or slow the speed to a crawl, you never feel overwhelmed. What's better, is a lot of the processes can be automated like planet colonization, invasion planning or just building up your planets so the game doesn't become overly tedious. You've also got about 6 resources that you have to manage. While that may seem like a lot for this type of game, it's surprisingly not. It's fun trying to find planets that produce the resources you need and meeting production. For a one man project, this game feels INSANELY well done.\n\nWhat's wrong with the game?\nNot much. The game itself is pretty fine tuned. There are few things that bother me with this game like the overpowered fighters. It doesn't seem to matter how technologically advanced your ships are, fighters are practically impossible to beat in large numbers. Seriously, just field a fleet with about 10-20 carriers and build 200 fights with heavy ion guns and I guarantee there is nothing that can stop you. I'd recommend bringing down the power of fighters considerably as they are just a cheap tactic at this stage in the game.\nThe game can also feel a bit tedious later on. For example, in the later stages of the game, it can become a bit tedious having to colonize everything or invading large empires (but remember you can automate that process so that's just me being too lazy to automate it).\n\nIn summation, this is a solid 4x Real-Time Space Strategy game that I've really enjoyed my time with. The streamlined and relatively fast pace at which the game flows means I happily spend dozens of hours glued to the screen managing my little Space Empire. I highly recommend this one for fans of the 4x genre.","March 22","true","12.9"," 93 of 117 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","93","117","7","5"

This game offers several unique things that keep me coming back  to it:\n\n+ Importance of long-term planning: In most 4x games if you run low on a resource you can just shift population around to fix things quickly. Not so here. You need to carefully plan out your economy, planetary governor focuses, and so much more. The level of in-depth empire management this game offers is only matched by Distant Worlds in my opinion which is a good thing.\n\n+ Research: Finally a unique approach to research split between developing general fields of research areas that generate specific technologies over time. It takes a little getting used to, but overall it is nice to have something different from the standard tech trees most other 4x games offer.\n\n+ Combat (specifically fighters): Finally a game where I can design and build proper carriers with swarms of fighters and bombers to use in combat to overwhelm my enemies. Point defense systems can shred fighters though, so a constant balance is needed. This is a game where you can study an enemy's ship designs and build counters to those designs which is always nice to see.\n\n+ Strong AI: I've seen the AI expand agressively when appropriate and seek friendly relations when I am in a position of stength. AI can be a weak point for many 4x games, but so far I've happen pleasantly satisified with my computer opponents thus far.\n\n- Exploration: The dev tried to add in some interesting things like anamolies and wormholes to help make the galaxy feel more interesting, but most systems will feel very bland as you search the galaxy. The lack of unique things like minor races and chained events/quests makes exploration a little dull, but then again that is to be expected in a game of this scale with so many systems to explore.\n\nOverall this is an easy recommendation from me. The dev is very active and responsive and they deserve credit for the great game they've put together. If you are a 4x fan who enjoys empire management on a large scale this game is for you.","March 26","true","6.8"," 63 of 77 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","63","77","2","0"

I’m now totally hooked on Polaris Sector to the point that I would rate this game more highly than any Space 4X release in the last 12 months, including Galactic Civilizations 3 and Stardrive 2.\n\nHere are the top reasons why:\n\n1. There is a competent AI which is impressive for a new release. The AI builds decent colonies and uses well designed ships. If you are too aggressive too early an invasion will often falter and you have to think about what you are building against the AI and how to best deploy them in combat.\n\n2. The game is well balanced and avoids out of control exploitation. For example, you can't build early game unbeatable doom fleets, you don't find huge amounts of weapons late game that are worthless and so on.\n\n3. The colony governors are really good. I don’t feel the need to excessively micromanage colonies which vastly reduces the tedium mid to late game. In fact the game shines mid to late for various reasons including the ability to significantly speed up the game.\n\n4. There is a surprising amount of content for a new release. The game includes an end game threat that had me starting at the screen with my mouth open in shock (noting that I consider the Shakturi in Distant Worlds to be total wimps), a novel ship based espionage system and a good ship design system where component selection matters in-game.\n\n5. There are some really cool Spiral galaxy maps to play which can make the game really interesting strategically. For example you might start in an outer ring and find yourself blocked by other races from accessing inner rings or the core without using star tunnels and tankers to provide enough range for early to mid-game fleets.\n\n6. During the beta I have had no crashes at all and just a couple of bugs which the developer promptly responded to.\n\nSome cautions to consider:\n\n1. It’s primarily a war game and although there is some variety in the domination victories (e.g. technology), there aren’t a wide variety of victory conditions.\n\n2. The innovative research is great but it takes a game or two to really get used to it so some patience is recommended.\n\n3. There is some exploration but it could use more events and anomalies to spice it up.\n\n4. The combat is fun and tactical but isn’t as pretty as some other games.\n\n5. A Battle Arena to test designs would have been great but unfortunately not in the game.\n\n6. The tutorials are very limited so checking some Youtube videos might help.","March 23","true","8.8"," 78 of 102 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","78","102","2","5"

The other thing is when fighters missiles is finished in a battle, you have to tell them manually to go and refill, first land them, then launch them again, no auto refill.\nThe ship design is ok, i like it but still LOVE Star Drive 1 ship design.\n\nAt this moment for me the best game still is Distant Worlds Universe. I just love the scale and the private sector system. Only drawback, you cannot terraform and ship design is a bit tedious or crap way. If it had like Star Drive 1 ship design then the game would have been complete.\n\nI find the AI in Polaris Sector not so good when it comes to politics. I have tried several games now and its basically, give me this planet or these resources and if you say no its war. The AI declares war very quickly, basically like Star Drive 2. So the politics not so good in Polaris Sector.\n\nAt this moment i will give it a YES but just barely made me choose YES.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sporkmonger/recommended/418250/","sporkmonger","Sporkmonger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sporkmonger/","1586 products in account","I have mixed feelings.\n\nI think this game probably has the best tech tree of any 4X game ever and that's saying something. The tech tree is original, fun, allows for rapid adaptation of strategy, but really, most importantly, it shows us something new that we haven't really seen before in the increasingly tired and already-done-before 4X genre by splitting fundamental and applied sciences and allowing research focusing w/ priorization. True game design innovations don't really happen that often, but this game genuinely has one in its tech tree.\n\nOther people have criticized the game's tendency to go "on the rails" (i.e. the game plays itself), and I don't agree. I played in a galaxy w/ 800 stars and if you don't have macroeconomic automation, that just gets tedious. And most of the automation is around invasion and colonization, which are things I *really* don't want to micromanage. But if you do, the game absolutely lets you. The automated construction of planetary buildings seemed totally fine to me because most planets can only get a very limited subset of buildings anyway and if you wanted to micro it without going nuts, you could use build queue templates to do that. I personally found myself wishing the automation was even more automated than it is. One thing that kept cropping up for me was that some planets would max population and all population would be completely allocated. Only unallocated population can be used to colonize a planet and the automated colony ships would queue up at fully allocated planets, waiting for 1000 population to free up when that was impossible instead of just going to a planet where it was actually possible for population growth to happen. That forced me to micro a bit to unblock my expansion and by late game, that was pretty unwelcome. That said, the population growth mechanics in general just seemed really artificial and strange.\n\nFleet combat is OK. Not great, not bad, just OK. I'd have liked to see more utility modules that give more variation in strategy. Weapon variety starts to fall over near the end of the game where high damage torpedoes become increasingly critical and alpha damage starts being more important than anything else. Basically I think fleet combat in general needs more variety and balance tweaks. Shields should recharge much more quickly, kiting should be a more viable strategy, utility modules should get more emphasis, broadside combat should get more emphasis for capital ships (i.e. put all the big hardpoints on broadsides, small turrets only for 360). There should be utilities that can only be placed on smaller and medium ships to force fleet variety instead of the usual 4X late game battleships-only BS.\n\nEspionage system is utterly useless and feels like it was tacked on as an afterthought. Diplomacy system is better than average, though I felt like AI was perhaps a little too aggressive diplomatically speaking on Normal and Hard difficulties.\n\nBut I think the biggest complaint I have is the end game. I won't spoil it for you, but due to what I believe is a known bug, the win condition can become completely impossible because certain enemies have unbounded growth. That said, as I was getting to late game and essentially steam rolling everything in sight and thinking, "Man, game got too easy all of a sudden", the game flipped things around and made things much more challenging.\n\nI have very mixed feelings though on the end game. It's sort of the opposite of deus ex machina. Out of nowhere, with no prior warning, you essentially get a boss fight that you likely were not preparing for. At least in MOO, you know the Orions are a thing and you probably have to fight them at some point. In Polaris, poof, Big Bad, and now things are going horribly wrong. There's no strategy you just have to research stuff fast enough and then build up a big fleet before the Big Bad gets too big. If they get too big, welp, too bad, you lose. Or rather you don't lose but you can't win. And that sucks.\n\nShould you buy it? Depends on if you can stomach the current just-shy-of-AAA price tag. I think it's a good 4X game with by far the best tech tree of any 4X, but it's crippled by a bad end game and inconstent AI that's either way too hard or way too easy and uninspiring fleet combat. Overall, I liked it. I got a good 30+ hours out of it over a couple games. I think the endgame badly needs a patch. I think the rest of my criticism needs a sequel. I don't think this will end up being a game that I drop 100+ hours on though, and that's usually the point where I feel $40+ is justified.\n\nDepending on what the modding community releases though, I could definitely see myself revisiting the title and getting my full $40's worth.","April 10","true","32.1"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtbag007/recommended/418250/","dirtbag007","CrazyKristi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtbag007/","332 products in account","TL;DR\n\nPros:\nRelatively bugfree, easy to grasp mechanics, doesn't fling spreadsheets in your face at every occasion, easy to use UI, plays relatively fast.\n\nCons:\nMay be too simple for 4X vets.\n\nVerdict:\nFor newcomers to the 4X genre I can give a strong recommendation. For most veterans though, this game may be too simple and I would strongly recommend you to take a look at Distant Worlds Universe.\n\nHaving played quite a bit of the old Alpha version of this game which used to be available on IndieDB, I think I can write a somewhat informed review of this game.\n\nFirst of all, this game can be classified as a Realtime Pausable 4X game. It has all those elements into it. Diplomacy, exploration, conquest, empire building, etc.\n\nThe game clearly takes on a bit of a lighter footing than most 4X games. It will not shove massive spread-sheet like ui's in your face. It will not have a cumbersome UI which hampers your ability to play. As an added bonus, it has some decent automation features which allow you to focus on what's fun.\n\nYou start off with a basic homeplanet, low level technology and a single scoutship. Nothing weird or unusual here. Travel is done through starlanes (consumes fuel, non-instantaneous) or wormholes (occur randomly, instantaneous, don't cost fuel, unpredictable). The systems you will encounter contain several planets, each planet having a planet type and a size. The planet type will enable or disable various buildings, and modify production rates of items and resources. The size mostly dictates construction space available on the planet.\n\nColonization can be micro'd, but you can also just let the ai find a suitable place to build a colony ship and send it over, just by tapping a single buttom on the ui. This is one of the neat automation features which I like.\n\nResource management and economy is fairly simple, and will not bury you in spreadsheets. There's just a handful of resources, enough to fit in a small area on your screen. Resource management basically comes down to making sure you don't run out, and this comes down to setting up the right mining facilities on the planets containing these resources. Or you can just let the AI handle this by designating a planet as a mining colony. Nothing really fancy or unique there, except for the total absense of money as far as I could see (which seems logical to me in a space game actually, as USD would have little value to the Gavakens or so).\n\nResearch I find neatly done. Instead of picking a single technology to research, you allocate science points to different areas, and can split these between theoretical and applied sciences. I find this system neat because it offers a more logical and natural path of developing technology, compared to picking a single technology at a time.\n\nShip designing is in my opinion most comparable to stardrive's. You've got space on the hull where you can place modules on. Some will only allow weapons, others might only allow engines, etc. You won't place armor though, or power conduits. It just is the engines, power generators, weapons, shielding, support equipment (fuel tanks, cargo modules, troop drop pods, refueling modules, fuel generators, etc). The system is very straightforward and simple.\n\nCombat is either auto resolved or fought manually. Battles are fairly simple realtime battles where you can order your ships around. To be honest I don't find much interesting of note in this, except for that it is simple, straightforward and it works well.\n\nIn terms of bugs, I did not find any so far. Even in its Alpha state it was relatively bugfree (although content and gameplay systems were mostly lacking back then). So not much else to say there.\n\nCompared to the Alpha, this version feels way more enjoyable to play and better fleshed out. While this game is a bit too simple for myself, I do have a good general impression of it.","March 22","true","3.9"," 48 of 65 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","48","65","3","0"

I will also say that when it comes to 4x games I am an empire builder.  I strategize and try to see the big picture.  In space 4x I build two or three poweful battle fleets and station them where they can get to probable trouble spots in a reasonable and timely manner.  Polaris sector while appearing to offer similar on the surface actually falls flat once that surface has been penetrated and you get to the soft and not so juicy bits underneath.  You would think that with a map size of 900 stars it would be awhile before you needed to deal with the other major factions, but no.  The game sticks them fairly close so you will start to bump up against them within the first hour of play which makes the map feel smaller than it is, a feeling that is compounded by the stars themselves being quite close to each other and by the pirates that pop up seemingly out of nowhere to harass your worlds and shipping, seriously, turn these off as they are way too common.\n\nThe developers really should have looked at another game in the Matrix stable ( Distant Worlds ) and taken a few hints.  Polaris sector has fallen squarely into that old and tired 4x land grab.  Find colonisable world / grab it before the Ai does / try to close off choke points and build huge defences and fleets because you know what's coming.  It's been done to death and it's boring.  You will also find that after a couple of hours the game will auto-pause with nausiating regularity ( every few seconds ) that has you delving into the settings to turn most of it off, which then results in you missing information if the game speed is turned up ( something that you need to do in order to get anywhere ).\n\nOne of the main innovations ( according to the developer ) is the research system that boasts no research trees.  Yes there are, they are just displayed differently and research usually devolves into choosing which tech you want next, prioritising it and letting the game get on with churning it out.  Having said that the techs appear many and diverse but with the way the larger game is designed you will find yourself researching the military techs early on so that your ships are not completely outgunned, which is another similarity to many 4x games out there.  Again, perhaps they should have taken a look at Distant Worlds in which techs are split into three different categories allowing for more civilian techs to be researched alongside the military ones.  The ship designer is a variation on a theme first implemented in another 4x game that shall remain nameless but Polaris sector does it better and some interesting combinations can be produced.  I created a fleet of stealth / assassin ships that waited at a choke point for any unsuspecting enemy vessels to wander by.  The pirates got a taste of their own medicine with that lot.\n\nAs I said, I have not played long enough for a full review and I will update this when I have a few more hours under my belt.  Hopefully the game will get better as I delve deeper into it but first impressions matter and these have been mine.\n\n\n\nNow almost 8 hours in and I'm honestly bored to tears.  I was hoping that the game would blossom and show it's complexity as I got further into it but no, there really is none.  Polaris Sector is one of the most shallow space 4x games that I have ever played and I have played a few of them.  The couple of wafer thin strategic elements that the game brings to the table, the created bottlenecks and the combat have issues of their own and add nothing to the gameplay which is bland and uninspired.  The bottlenecks are created because of the use of warp lanes.  i know why the developers use them, it's to prevent both the player and the Ai from attacking out of nowhere ( mainly the player ) but we are in 2016 here and there are better ways of handling that particular problem.  as it is it just adds one more thing that takes away the immersion and places you on a linear road rather than the expanse of space.  The combat system was quaint for the first few outings but quickly became tiresome and tedious, leaving me to auto-resolve or to tell my fleets to do their own thing, which invariably means frontal assault and tactics be damned.  Simply look at the red / green bar and if you have more than they do then auto-resolve it, you will win.\n\nMatrix produce some decent strategy games if you can get past the decades old graphics but sadly this isn't one of them.  I have clicked 'close and continue' so many %$£^$%£ times in the past few hours while the game pretty much played itself that my index finger has developed a twitch.  If you really must have this in your library then wait for a steam sale.","March 22","false","19.1"," 137 of 228 people (60%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","60","137","228","12","26"

So even harcore turn based fans will be satisfied. "Space" button - will be you favorite to run time again (Next turn).\n\nVery well balanced ship designes.

Relatively complex and deep tactical combat system, where every action means possible change of initiative and battle odds. Finally skill and tactical sense matters, and you can either lose your advantage if you make several mistakes, or you can win even against unfavorable odds if you make a few right decisions.\n2. The ship cost is very high - they are a long and expensive investment. So, like real battleships of our era - sometimes you make a new design for each new ship, and you feel that every single ship is unique and important for you. No faceless ship swarms here (except fighters and bombers swarms, of course).\n3. Long ship production times demand strategic planning. When you meet another race - will you try to build a couple of new colony ships to occupy good spots near their border, and leave them undefended, or will you build a couple of warships and risk losing possible colonization spot?\n4. Realistic colonization process, where new colonies initially are a liability to defend, and not a source of easy expansion.\n5. Research is unique in this game. Every single discovery you make is known beforehead, and appreciated, and quickly applied to ship designs after it is finally discovered.\n\nCons:\n1. Due to long build and planning and exploration times game is not very fast-paced - so you have to be a bit meditative and patient while nothing else happens.\n\nAll in all - a solid and interesting concept, at least after several gameplay hours.","April 23","true","13.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Other games held my interest for a while but ultimately fell flat as I got bored with them.  Either those games were overly complex or too simple.  Polaris Sector seems to offer happy medium.  I've only played 5 hours at the time of this writing however this game is very addictive and is not too hard nor too easy.  There is a lot of depth in research, combat, production, ship design, etc.  I could go on but I'll save the details for when I have some more time under my belt.\n\nIn short, I would take the negative reviews with some doubt.  I'm not sure why those reviewers hate on the game.  I'm a fairly critical individual but I'm having a hard time finding any faults with this game.\n\n\nUpdate (3.Apr 2016):  27 hours in at time of this writing.\n\nI have to say I still think this is a great game for the 4x space genre.  My first game as the humans ended in disaster and it wasn't because I lost to overwhelming firepower or spam fleets of doom.  It was because I overlooked the dangers of espionage and had no way to stop the enemy from sabotaging my mining.  The end result was that I quickly ran out of a key mineral type needed to sustain and build a fleet.  My ships wasted away because they no longer had access to the mineral they needed to keep the ships 'afloat'.  I was impressed and have started a new game as the Logans with this lesson learned.\n\nThe research system is presentented in a refreshingly unique way.  It has been lauded by some and criticized by others.  If one takes the time to understand how the system works they will find that it's much more thought provoking than a typical static tech tree found in many strategy games.\n\nShip design is a joy and is not a tedious chore.  The design system focuses only on the interesting aspects of ship design and abstracts the mundane such as life support, bridge room, etc.  Those components are assumed to be part of every ship and there is no need for the player to find precious space to install those pieces.  Instead the player is going to be faced with many interesting decisions about what components is needed for the ship in question.  The many possible combinations all layed out in a fairly easy to follwo format are impressive.  Ship design is almost a game within a game as you constantly need to assess problems in the galaxy and how to deal with them via a specific ship type.\n\nI experienced no mid or late game tedium.  There is always something to do in this game.  There is no busy work or mandatory tasks that must be performed manually that you find in many other games.  The ai does a good job managing your planets for you if you decide you don't want to micromanage them.  I like how you can also plan colonization automatically and let the ai handle settling in to that nice new planet you found.  In addition the ai does a fairly decent job at planning planetary ground invasions as well.  All in all I like having options to automate certain aspects of the game if I choose.\n\nThat's all for now but I hope my feedback helps you decide one way or the other if you want to buy this game.","March 26","true","121.3"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","32","46","0","0"

It brings some fresh ideas but suffers from boring, drawn out gameplay and very bad UI. There are better 4X games out there; if you have already played those and look for something new, you might still get some enjoyment out of it.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nThe research system: Totally unique and a welcome step away from the traditional research trees and tiers.\nThe map setup: I was delighted to see realistic galaxy types, very eye-catching, also comprehensive, straight-forward and easy map customization\nThe race setup: Again, well implemented: comprehensive but straight-forward and easy customization options\nThe art style: A bit retro and goofy but (especially the galaxy map) pretty and still easy to interpret\nThe combat: Real-time (with the option to slow down and even pause) with lots of tactical depth\nWhat I do not like:\n\nThe UI: The game is heavy on micromanagement in some areas, especially fleet management and combat. That is not at all bad in itself, but paired with a UI that is big, clunky and low on actually useful information it becomes a nightmare of constantly scrolling around and opening and closing several different views to get done even one small task like finding out what replenishments your fleet needs and producing them. The same goes for combat: I have not found a way to actually make use of much of the tactical options because of a total lack of useful information once you zoom out far enough to see more than maybe two ships at the same time. Again the micromanagement becomes a real chore: Stop time, zoom in to actually see something, try to figure out what some ship is actually doing, zoom out for some reference, zoom in again... ad nauseam.\nThe gameplay: The pace is glacial, even on the fastest time setting. The most exciting thing to happen during several hours of gameplay were some ridiculously overpowered pirates. I found no way to peacefully interact with other races or otherwise influence diplomatic relations meaningfully, let alone get a useful or interesting overview over galactic politics. There are diplomatic options for trade in goods and science but I never got to the point where I could use them. Mostly the AI seemed to want to have nothing to do with me and get angry when I colonized near them.\nAutomation (or the lack of it in most areas): For some reason, you can automate planet colonization and management to the point where you do not have to look at your planets again for the rest of the game. For everything else you do have zero automation options, not even auto-exploring (ok, there is auto-resolving of battles).\nThe planets: There is a nice variety of planet types but strangely not much to do with them. There are four kinds of planet output (industry, mining, agriculture, science), then there is one planet type that is good at all of the four (but not at the same time), plus one type that is good mostly at agriculture. The rest you use only for mining several resources. This is, again, different from how most other 4X games do resources/planet types.

It simplifies things down to the fun parts, and forgoes layers of complexity.  That does mean Star Lanes, which some people hate, but I've enjoyed having the constraint because I've started playing quicker "lighter" games.

Wiping out orbital structure to deny shipbuilding. Just great.\n\nI have sunk many hours and still enjoying it. Will Stellaris be better -who knows. Sure stardive looks better (and I enjoy that too) but  somehow, this seems more real.","April 19","true","64.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

After losing your first few tries you quickly learn that researching the right equipment and picking the right starting traits for your race make all the difference. Playing agressive and spending time optimizing your ships is a huge part as well as with raw power you won't get far. You will also learn that you need to specialize planets into certain roles that fits your surrounding as you can't simply switch roles all fo a sudden, if you got a mineral problem you can't just fix it with a few clicks and that might be what I love most about this game, you have to plan ahead.\n\nThe battles are engaging although not really balanced. In the end I found out that using freighters as Heavy Missile-troop transporters was a lot more effective than clunky cruisers or other heavy battleships. Regarding the diplomacy I didn't get a hang of it yet, I tried to get friendly with a few other races but it never payed off, in the end I just used the system to force other races to give me 10% of their income which seems the best deal. Then again, I blame this on me not having tried to go all the way with trading and diplomacy.\n\n\nNow this game is not without flaws sadly enough. The biggest issue here is the in-depth of the game. You want to create a universe that is as little as possible because there really isn't much else to explore. Still, I found this a minor issue and I might just try a really large empty universe just to test my skills. Then there is an issue where one of my save-files and my auto-save got corrupted which meant that I had to start over again. A heads-up to anyone else; use multiple different save files!\n\nOverall this game is definitely worth the buy. For me who doesn't like the standard "handholding games" nor the overly complex 4k space strategy games that are out there, this game is a match made in heaven. And when in doubt wait till it goes on sale!","April 4","true","58.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Ahah well it’s funny though! Can’t be worse than Ewoks) they seem intriguing enough and all have very different space designs and quite different modifiers. Then the real fun starts.\n\nPolaris Sector is very combat oriented. It’s more more more warlike than other 4x games. You start from the ship designer tool, which allows you to customize your fleet completely. It adds a whole new strategic layer to the game, which in my opinion sets Polaris Sector apart from the other games of the genre. I had tons of fun just by designing my ships and coming up with crazy tactics for them.\n\nThe ship designer is well integrated with the research system, and researching individual theoretical and applied technical branches is a very elegant solution, one I prefer to the old “technology tree” system that other games have.\nAnd then there’s the battles: I really like them. Tactical battles are very hard to master, as choosing the wrong formation or sending the wrong orders make a HUGE difference! You will be soundly defeated if you don’t know what you’re doing, as the AI is really smart.\n\nIn short, Polaris Sector is a very combat oriented sci-fi 4x game. If war and tactical combat with an excellent and challenging AI are your cup of tea, go for it and you won’t be disappointed.","March 29","true","14.9"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Great space combats with hundreds of vessels in one battle, different tactics mastered by AI and available to player (not ideally though). My favourite ship designer where everything matters: size, weight, production and maintenance cost - not only basic parameters.\nAnd there is no money or BC`s in this game, completely! Only mineral resources, food and production.\n\nStarlane movement and single point systems can be serious drawbacks for someone, but I like to focus on strategy and tactics, not micromanaging of my empire. This game offers many options to automate routine actions like colonization and planetary development so I can focus on economy, strategy and tactic combats. Autobattle is strange, use it only with outnumbered fleets. Looks like it simply command "act on your own" to all ships and speeds up time.\n\nGame mechanics is very different from MOO-like mechanics, your limit is not command points or income, your limit is your economy. And be careful with food, earthlike planets do not have population cap and unemployed population in this game is useless and worse - it consumes food. Single earthlike or gaia planet without population limit programm can lead whole empire to starvation.\n\nUI is not always intuitive and polished, in big galaxies there are many endless lists and annoying fighter management, that`s not good. But UI is good enough to concentrate on game, not on UI gaps.\n\nI recommend this game.\np.s. sorry for my english, it`s not my native language.","March 31","true","136.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

Well. It is a 4x. So meh. I always SOMEWHAT enjoy them. This has to be the worst 4x game in my library tho, by far. And the most expensive as well.\n\nCompared to Master of Orion: MoO has A LOT less features, like really... it sounds and plays so much simpler. BUT the few things you CAN do are real choices. You can decide what you do, when you do it and how you do it. And multiple ways are possible to advance and win. Polaris Sector has one way and the automation does it for you.\n\nSo no, i will not recomment it. A 4x on rails just shouldn't exist.\n\nThe game does not get any better like i hoped at the end of my review. It stays a pure illusion of freedom. There is always that ONE best way to do something. Most of the time it is perfectly clear so you just do it, or let automation do it.\n\nAs the game progresses you are more and more a watcher only. You do some fights here and there and thats about it. The rest is done by the AI and automation. And really you simply can't do much the AI is not doing on its own.\nFew minor adjustments come into play lategame once you get all the techs. You can do some minor tweaks to planets then. At that point it does not matter anymore tho.\n\nMy playtrough ended with the "endgame threat". Let's just put it this way: The ONE thing you can choose yourself is how your ships fire. What they fire with. At up to this point i believed that. WRONG again. DON'T even hope to do a lategame ship without missiles. The endgame enemy is immun to anything but a special variation of a missile. Don't use it? Bad luck.\n\nLet me put this into perspective. I had 3 armys, each one as big as the biggest 2 AIs had combined. So pretty much invincible, right? Well no. The endgame enemy jumped in, attacked one army. I killed all their ships within seconds,... all but 2. 2 Battleships. They are immun to all but that one missile type. Those 2 battleships destroyed 30 of my battleships without any return fire.\n\nSo that is what happens if you think there is that ONE thing you can choose yourself. All my 3 armadas destroed within 5 ingame years (a few seconds), without being able to shoot back.\n\nBy the time i rebuild an armada with the right weapon choice (silly me to use something else then what the game pushes onto me),.. the endgame enemy grew out of proportion. 200 Battleships, 500 Destroyer... needless to say my playtrough ended there.\n\nAlso you better love fighters.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStart of original review after about 3 hours played:\n\nThe game has many features and looks awesome for any 4x fan on paper. I will happily admit that and i have fallen for exactly that.\n\nLet me call the game "an illusion of freedom". It fits pretty good.\n\nAll those features and "stuff" for a lack of a better word:\nBasically clutter on the UI without doing anything. Hear me out on this one: The game does an awesome job at making you THINK you can control so many aspects,... but you actually don't control anything. My whole playtime has been a kind of autopilot so far. You can turn of automation on planets, but there are no alternatives anyways. There is that one clear way to go and you just do it, or cripple yourself. Automation works just as good. Illusion of freedom.\n\nShip battles:\nLooked so awesome in those videos. And turned out to be simple rock, paper, scissor fights. Your enemy has this one ship tye? Better send in THIS first, or be destroyed. Auto resolve is less of a pain because you have this one way of doing it again. Do it that way, or fail. Automation does it better then me, since i dislike playing rock, paper, scissor in space. Illusion of freedom.\n\nShip building:\nKey aspect. Stardrive like building. Real freedom, right? No. Weapons only go into yellow slots. Any reason to plug something else in there? No. So... just plug in weapons. 3x3 take small turrets...4x4 take medium turrets,... 6x6 take 4 smalls,... you get the idea. All weapons are of the same size as well. But the other slots are freedom, right? Well... yes. If you dislike your armada and want to destroy it in your first battle. If you don't follow a strict focused approach, the ship will be worthless. So,... well. You gotta plug in x, y and z. If you can fit two x or two y,... great! Thats the real freedom. If you find a layout that takes one more module in all the wasted space. Real illusion of freedom.\n\nAI:\nNot. Exactly. Smart. I don't know yet if the AI is just dumb or it is "roleplaying" silly. The agressive guys wanted open boarders... the "never go to war" guys declared war like 30min in without having a single ship i noticed. They did have half a dozen freighters in my space when they declared war tho. Sounds smart, right?\n\nPlanetbuilding:\nTackeled it in my first point, but let me alaborate a little: You can focus your planets and you should do that. If you build something, you lock space for other stuff. Building ONE FARM out of 100 slots... locked 24 slots out of my 36 industrial slots on one planet. God knows how or why. But "balanced" is not going to pay off. Illusion of freedom again.\n\nSo i don't know. Ill still play for a while and hope i just did not "get it". Or it grows on me,... kinda sad i have spend 33 bucks on this and hope i will stop hating myself for it. Obviously a refund is no option because a 4x game is nothing you can judge after 2 hours.\n\nStay away for now. Unless you don't mind the illusion of freedom and choice. If you like a 4x on rails, give it a go. It is like watching a movie. And everytime something happens the pause key is pressed. You can read what the AI did, nod a bit and let pause go.","March 22","false","27.1"," 78 of 140 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","78","140","6","14"

Combat and ship design is OUTSTANDING with an incredible variety of weapons, modules, and tactics.  The ships, while not true 3D, are beautiful to behold IMO.\n\n\nCons: Micromanagement can be a pain (loading fighters into carriers for instance) , but there are some features that help with that (such as the plan invasion mechanic).  Exploration could stand to be better fleshed out and some better fleet organization/management tools would be nice.","March 29","true","135.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

No one has unique techs, abilities, etc. The only differences are your standard 4x run of the mill: better productivity, better espionage, better food, etc. Also you can edit the races to redistibute points, but you can't truely design your own race, not even rename the current ones,\n\nAll in all I do recommend it if you are into space 4x. 7/10\n","March 23","true","6.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

My initial review was based on beta version, but  i played alrdy 40 hours of the realease one (i think i palyed about 200 hours of the beta, wasnt steeam version so not sure). It mostly reinforces what i alrdy wrote,  no changes needed in my review.\n\nSo I really liked Polaris. Its a great 4x war oriented game with good challenging AI. I played a lot of time just for fun during my beta testing, even in its beta state.\nDespite liking to a degree both Sd2 and Galciv3 , im pretty sure i played Polaris a few times more then both Sd2 and Galciv3 combined.\n\nSo below in points what i specially liked:\n+ The AI is good and challenging. Even in mid-late game  the AI can give you trouble. Seriously its one of the better AI i have seen. (I played on hard)\n+  Great ship designing and tactical combat.\n+  Through all the game there is  something called "doctrine change" . What it means that there is no overpowered weapon/modul/hull/tactic for long.  For example hvy fighters might seem   OP  for a while, but soon new techs/ modules will change the balance back to capital ships. Its really so great, keeps you on your toes and with a varied fleet.\n+  The resources management : its pretty uniqe among games. You got  several mineral types and every module on your ships consumes different minerals, you got to plan this.\n+ Help with micromanagment: you got governors , who do a fairly good job, and if you are a max efficency micro managing freak like me :) you can define template build orders, then just reuse them. Works grea.\n+ Real time  with extensive, configurable notification system  is imho very good.  Im more of a turn based guy myself, but with that many notifications and with pasuable any time, i liked it a lot.\n+ Long and varied tech tree.\n+ Balanced tech/modules, there is no useless or uber modules like in many games.\n\nThe diplomacy is there with many options, but im not a very diplomatic guy :) so wont really judge it. The races art/backstories are pretty good.\n\nSo imho if you like war oriented 4x games with ship designing you really should like it.\n\nWhen you might not like it?\nImho think twice and watch some more videos if:\n1- In depth ship designing and tactical combat isnt really what you like in your 4x\n2- War as the main theme isnt really what you expect in your 4x.\n\nA video of Polaris i made that might be helpful in deciding:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnqDEFPeRqY&feature=youtu.be&t=2114","March 22","true","88.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","0"

Yes I am been one of betatesters this game, that you can see my name in game credits, but do not await from me that I try blame you or write untrue or prettier words.

But be ready, there is something sleeping and wait for his time to able destroy every life sign in galaxy.\n\nMovements between stars is realized by star lanes, that some players hate. I hate star lanes too but there I do not much problem with them. And I am rather that there are star lanes. Because without that will be game total challenge in this state how is maded.  You can also use some wormholes that are randomly set in galaxy, but they are dangerous for traveling, then I rather not much use it.\n\nYou can choose from 9 races with customizable abilities and conquer up to 900 stars.\nGame brings some new gameplay ways in spying, ship designing and research.\nYou do not train spies but build spy ships that can do different actions and their skills every success action slowly raising.\n\nYou can designing your ships, fighters and stations. (If you success unity with another race you can receive to able and designing their ships layouts too. Every race have his own ships with different space for equip) Designing every ship or station is like small puzzle game where you try fit your ship with different equipments to reach as best fitting as is possible for role that ship design may be used.\n\nEvery ship or station that survive battle receive experience and able reach up to 5 levels. Then every level raise ship status skills.\n\nResearch in first time look little chaotic, but you can take care only right side items listing and focus on items that you priorly want to research and soon able use.\n\nLearning curve to understand how play game is easy, and game is not ideal for hardcore players.\n\nGame is realtime but you can pause it every time when you need and make all commands that you need. You can also in detailed game settings can set when game may automatically pause or when game may ignore event and continue.\n\nGame is gently to little older hardware then you do not have problem play it on computers that been in middle mainstream five years ago. Only if you play big or biggest galaxy and have many allies then in later game you can see litle game speed slowing. (Mean you set realtime speed 20X but game run on 16X) I appreciate that game have excellent fast game saving and loading.

There's some real deph in research and war, with procedurally generated worlds adding 100+ hours of re-playability for someone like me.\n\nSome interesting settings and large maps can set the scene for some very long games (900 stars and 9 races max) of 20+ hours.\n\nShip designer is good fun, high level of customisability and a huge list of parts which are researched.\n\nTech tree is unique, and actually a very sensible contribution to the genres forumulae.\nI've still not reached the end, it is very long.\n\nTheres some strategic thought here as well, with the broad options being to focus on theory and be the first to end game tech, while remaining week for the start and mid game or vice vera. The third option is to have a some-what balanced advancement with 50% of R&D in Theory, and the other half in practical science.\n\nThe only issue I have with this title is the cost, £26.99 is perhaps a little high considering its a one-man band.

However, there are more things that I dislike about it.\n\nPros:\n1.  The starmap is quite beautiful and can be expansive.  It is also easy to understand at a glance.\n2.  The building automation AI for the worlds is pretty good.  I just wish there were more options to go with or a popup when a planet is done building with the automation.\n3.  The tech tree is vast and there is a lot to play with.  However, see "Cons" for further information.\n\nCons:\n1.  The races are not that unique.  They feel fairly cookie-cutter due to easily customizing them when starting a game.  Truthfully, you could choose one race and give it all of the bonuses of another race.\n2.  The tech tree might be vast, but it's linear and extremely hard to really plan long-term as there is no real tree to look at.  It's linear in the fact that techs will be learned in the exact same order in every game you play unless you play with the sliders to research different things faster.  However, techs are still in the same line.  The tech tree is also almost impossible to look at ingame to see what to focus on what to get to a specific tech.  The devs provided a website with all the possible techs, but it's also difficult to navigate and plan with as well.\n3.  Here is the biggest problem with this game:  Racial ship balance.  Certain races have pathetically bad ships due to having either vastly lower number of slots, or having much higher build costs, or both.  Terrans are an example of the "both" category.  It's a really bad game design that needs to be fixed for this game really to have any long-lasting appeal and replayability.\n4.  And, finally, the AI is truly blood-thirsty.  Even peaceful races see military-weak races as targets for conquest.","May 8","false","16.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","8"

The right amount of complexity and simplicity depending on how much you want to micro-manage your worlds.  I was a little skeptical with the real time aspect of the galaxy map but it mixes well overall and still feels turn-based.\n\nShip customization is similar to gratuitous space battles or star drive, but it takes it on another level by adding multiple decks.  Ship battles may not be its strongest point but you can control the ships manually in a 2d backdrop.\n\nResearch is done uniquely with two separate fields; theoretical and applied sciences.  Ultimately you want to research applied sciences to get all the neat technologies, but to get there you need to get through the theoretical aspect.

Depending on the galaxy type, you have a preset number of AIs and planets. Wanted to play a rectangular galaxy, 1vs1 and couldn't.\nMaybe in time the game will evolve but for that to happen we need to wait for patches/expansion or mods.\n\nThe exploration is mediocre, mostly due to star lanes. Being real time does not help with immersion, unless you like to wait and play on low speed. I would've liked the star names to be hidden until you actually get to that star.\n\nExpanding is really slow and boring, especially in the beginning. Not really a problem but because there is not that much to do early game, only explore/refuel and repeat, you really need to speed the game up.  You can let the AI manage the colonization process, which is nice to some degree.\n\nCombat is ok, even tho it feels a bit sluggish but you can speed things up for a fast resolve or even auto-resolve. Mid-late game you are kinda forced to use a type of weapon/tech or you can end up with a useless fleet.\nThe AI is decent but at some point you get the feeling that he's playing the game using different rules. I know sometimes the AI cheats but here it can get really frustrating.\n\nThe research is different but messy. I'm not very fond of the system but some may like it.\n\nThe interface is a bit messy as well. The tutorial gives you nothing and for a new player can be very confusing. I like that the font is nice and clear, easy to read. Yeah, I'm looking at you Distant Worlds! This is how you should font a game. :)\n\n\nA lot of buts for a game that looked really good on paper. I still hope for an expansion or some really good mods.\n\nAt this moment, there are better and more fun alternatives to play until Stellaris. I think everyone is waiting on this one. :)\n\nHappy gaming!\n\n\n","March 26","false","11.4"," 32 of 63 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","32","63","0","5"

Pirates will spawn and head right for you and destroy your orbital manufacturing facilities.  Most of your opponents will declare war on you pretty soon as your explorers will probably cross there space and aggravate them to no end.\nThe science is confusing and will take you a long time to research and if you are lucky enough to get an opponent to agree to a science treaty they may have one tech they will exchange and pretty much nada after that.

What is bad is what you get for the price.\n\nBefore release Slitherine games said they had a "system" for setting price on games, and they were an expert because of all the games they have released. They said if game was too cheap people would not take it serious. I almost laughed at this.\n\nI personally refunded the game because I felt it was too much money, and certainly would have kept it had the price been more reasonable for what is offered.\n\nSo what is offered? Well basically a streamlined combat focused 4x. It has all the elements of a 4x, but simplified. There is still a learning curve, but not a steep one. Combat is where this game shines the best, with a half decent combat viewer and some tactical choices that can be made during battles. I also personally enjoy the fuel system for ships, though last I knew the AI ignored this system (free fuel), so it was only a restriction on the player, which is a bummer.\n\nI enjoy doing a lot of the aspects of 4x's that were streamlined in this game. (meaning I dont want them simplified like this game does) Its kinda hard to explain unless you watch a video of gameplay. I hate to bring it into this review, but (almost) everything this game does, Stellaris does 4x better... pun intended. Though to be fair Stellaris has more people working on it, and Stellaris is not perfect either, but Polaris Sector is missing so much in comparison, I will not even bother to compare the 2 games, except to say that they are the same price, which should say something about the price of Polaris Sector.\n\nOne good thing to mention, although I have not been active on the forums recently, is that the developer was very responsive and friendly last time I was lurking about. I also did not experience any bugs while playing the game.\n\nOverall it is a good streamlined 4x title but priced too high. I would wait for a sale to pick it up. If the price was 20 bucks or less, this game would still be in my library.","May 13","false","1.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

I watched its development for the last 6 months, played several betas and there was huge progress in absolutely right direction (at least for me). I think it could be released later to become more polished, pricing tag is too big from my point of view, but one developer is only one developer and publisher decides this things. As I said, I see here a potential which developer realy strifes to implement and part of this price is a mean to invest in the future of this game.\n\nCurrent version best sides:\n- Challageble AI, which can deliver real pain. It has some gaps in diplomacy and sometimes delusion of grandeur, but in overall it is plesant to play with.\n- Ship designer is a pinnacle of evolution in my view. I like to design and customize ships and here each ship becomes unique. I never played twice with same designes. The only gap here is a lack of default designs for lazy players and lack of battle arena for testing, which I think will be fixed soon.\n- This brigns me to another major side of this game: tactical combat. Dozens of ships in one combat, hundreds of fighters - easy peasy. Flexible designer grands huge amount of variations in tactic. Carriers, fighters, battleships, anti-fighter ships, torpedo carriers, stations and so on in many variations - you need to adapt your fleet to opponent, his style of combat and technological level. Some technologies can dramatically change combat flow. Animation is nice too - nothing fancy, but plesant.\n- External threat implementation in late game :)\n\nDownsides:\n- Exploration is most underdeveloped part of this game. I like big glaxies, but there is nothing to do in big galaxy here. Small maps with early opponents are preferrable. Pirates are unconvincing, need something more, like minor races. I think external threat could become huge exploration drive if intoduced sooner in the game.\n- Governments are non-existent. I would like to see political/economical systems specific to different races.\n- There are no planetary upgrades except of abstract mining techs which are applied automatically. Game strategy itself is too much colonization-driven. No way for some small empire to win concentrating on quality, not quantity of colonies.\n- No ability to continue game after external threat.

Fantasic, absolutely fantastic!\n\nOk, that's 2 words.\n\nIn all seriousness though, Polaris Sector does something that no other Space 4X game has done in years. It simplifies the rubbish often found in 4X games, and also adds a new twist on the genre's often seen staples.\n\nMy favourite Real Time 4X (and overall PC title) game has always been Imperium Galactica 2. Polaris Sector comes a close 2nd. Whilst it may not have an implemented storyline or the polish of IG2. It's unique enough to hold its own ground in a very solid manner. The UI is very well implemented as not to confuse the mechanics and the general gameplay is easy enough to follow without having to concern yourself with a Distant Worlds: Universe kind of depth.\n\nSome may be turned off with the slow burn of the game, as depending on how many races you place into the game and the number of systems, a single game can take many many hours. But since this game does have 9 races, as well as the ability to customise these races, plus a number of galaxy types.. With the added bonus of random generation, this game's replay value can be considered immense, and this is well worth the asking price!\n\nAll in all, as a verteran of the 4X genre, this is a game I could highly recommend. Whilst it could likely do with more random encounters and some elements of a storyline to increase the lore of the entire universe further. It certainly wins my personal reccomendation.","March 22","true","13.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

This is not a 4X game, this is a tactical fleet simulator with a 4X veneer slapped on.\n\nYes, you can expand and build an empire, but that empire has no meaning by itself, being defined solely by its ability to produce fleets of warships. Yes, you can micromanage your planets to your heart's content, but the problem is that planets only have four roles:\n1) Building ships.\n2) Producing resources to build ships.\n3) Researching new ship parts or ways to make resource extraction more efficient, so you can build more ships.\n4) Producing food to support the population that is used to power the facilities that perform the above three roles.\n\nYou cannot, or at least, you should not, colonise planets for the sake of colonising planets. You should not grow your population as large as you can for the sake of having a large population. The game mechanics will penalise you if you do, because in order to do what the game wants you to do, you only need JUST ENOUGH population to man the factories, mines and farms that are all geared towards increasing your shipbuilding capacity.\n\nDiplomacy and technology are a joke, both existing solely as a means to further your ship production ambitions. There are NO technologies that perform any role beyond unlocking new ship weapons and modules, or a means to increase your production of physical resources.\nCan you research to improve your research ability? Nope. Can you unlock different forms of government with different empire-wide bonuses to production, diplomacy, morale or research? Nope. Just ship parts and mining equipment.\n\nThis game is geared entirely towards designing and producing ships and enabling you to design and produce ships. The strategic layer could be removed and this game turned into a purely tactical game that allows you to begin battles from a Skirmish setup screen and nothing of value would be lost.\n\nIf you're looking to buy this game because you want a good 4X game, DON'T. This is not a 4X game and it should not be advertised as such. I honestly regret spending money on this because of that one massive lie.\nIf you're looking to buy this game because you want a good tactical fleet simulator with a anaemic strategic layer that only exists to make tactical battles happen, go right ahead, chief.

I had one entrance to my clusters with stations&ships in it, but enemy ships just ran right past them (even with radars there, etc.). Then they just run around blowing up all your orbital stuff and bombard your planets. It's not like you can afford the upkeep to have a standing army/stations on every single planet, and when you try to kill enemy ships they just retreat and there's not a bloody thing you can do about it. Also, enemy ships seem to cheat with fuel, they can patrol your clusters forever without ever running out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mujtaba/recommended/418250/","mujtaba","Danny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mujtaba/","91 products in account","I am coming back to review the game after playing it for a while. Don't go by my steam hours since I don't play the steam version that much. Its not stable for me.\n\nTLDR; Worth $9.99 at most. If you pay $39.99 you're an idiot and you don't deserve to have money.\n\nAs I previously stated the game mechanics are new and fresh. I hate turn based games so the auto pause feature of this game is the most appealing for me. This game has a ton of positive things about it but a few key negative things that make it unplayable late game. I will list only those and hopefully they get patched.\n\n1 - AI is highly imbalanced and can screw you up early game if you dont' get lucky with planet types and pirates. The pirates are really annoying and you basically have no choice but to agree to their protection. That's not a deal breaker because I'm used to that from DWU. However, if you ♥♥♥♥ off the Enemy AI and goto war its really hard to defend against planetary invasions since their ships have no fuel/range restrictions or cost. It take such a long ♥♥♥ time to conquer a single AI planet because they amass massive armies. (Note: I know I can chose to be friendly but remember you can get choked into a corner and you can't colonize planets or grow. They get really ♥♥♥♥♥y if your ships start going through their space.)\n\n2 - Auto colonization is very easy in this game. But the Empire managment console is horrible. Its hard to change most settings quickly. Instead of having drop downs to select the options per planets from a list, you have to rightclick left click your way through multiple popups to enact edicts or policies. Also if you have an AI governer, they ignore defenses and enact a stupid population cap on every god damn planet. So your pop won't grow as fast and you can't build extra buildings because their only requirement is a certain amount of people, like e.g. 1k for a new mine.\n\n3- Fighter and Carrier managment is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ in itself. Its so bad that its pointless to rant about it. Please Devs remove the current fighter building and just integrate them as autobuilding.\n\n4- Upgrading ships to a new design is painful. Takes ♥♥♥♥ing forever almost the same time as building a new ship of the given type.  Why can't I just select the fleet in orbit and select upgrade. Why do I have togo to the god damn planet construction screen.\n\n5- When I play GalCiv 3 or Civ 5 or DWU I know why I am prioritizing certains research nodes. I know 100% the strategic advantage they give me. The particular stats they enhance on my units or boosts they give my economy. In Polaris sector we have a research screen with sliders and I have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what I get out researching anything. And the time it takes to get a new tech is just absurd. Apart from researching certain type of domes, nothing else makes sense. I know that I need better fuel economy on my colony ships. But there is no way to tell how much of an improvement is a gravity fuel tank over a standard. How many squares it takes on a ship hull. since ship design is grid based. e.g components are 4x3 squares or 6x5 etc etc.\n\n6- I was against 2 enemies they become allies at the beginnig of the game and there was no way for me to break their allaince even though I whupped both their asses. I trashed all of their planets and they were left with zero orbital structures. I conquered alot of their planets as well. I agree to peace because I had the whole galaxy turn against me for bombing planets. Next thing I know in 50 years my planets are dropping like flies. I have no idea how they manage to rebuild their armies so fast when they barely able to stay in the game. (BTW 50 years is nothign in game. it takes like ♥♥♥♥ing 8 to 10 years to build a proper bad ♥♥♥ frigate. Just one god damn frigate.)\n---------------------------------------\n\nOld Review\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nFinally a 4x game that satisfies. Perfect Balance between game mechanics and ease of use. UI is awesome. The real time / pausable battle is probably the best feature.\n\nThis game is not dumb like the new MOO4. The combat require some actually thinking and planning. A true 4x strategy.\n\nWill come back to edit after playing some more. But for now 5 stars all the way. Double thumbs up for sure.","March 22","false","18.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

It didn't give me a good sense of progression.\n\nPlanetary management is somewhat unwieldy, it's hard to get a good overview of the position (but see my further comment below), and the stuff you can build on planets is quite bland. The fuel management system doesn't appeal to me personally , because there's too much micromanagement of the logistics - not a flaw in the game, per se, but it's something I didn't like.\n\nOverall, I'm just not having fun, and I can't see myself playing the game again, although I might give it another try in a couple of months, to see how it's been improved. It's not a terrible game by any means, but it's not for me right now.\n\nUpdate to take into account Iain's comments below:\n1. I take back my point about getting an overview of planet management. I hadn't noticed there was a button to expand the view. To be fair I don't think it's shown in the manual, so I'm guessing it's a relatively recent addition, but it is welcome.\n2. On tech, my complaint isn't that it's too fast or too slow, it's that the system doesn't give a real sense of excitement about getting new techs. There's no great sense of 'oh, I've got this tech now, and now I can do these cool things I couldn't do previously'. I'm not saying there are no techs like that, but there are too many that are just a stepping stone to something else, or provide a tech which isn't all that useful.","March 23","false","11.4"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","13","31","2","1"

Empire management is very difficult because you just don't have the right information on the screen without wading through other screens which also dont really tell you anything.\n\nIt's also entirely based on star-lanes, which i find to be a tedious mechanic, but i knew that going in. If there were a rating scale, I would give Polaris Sector  6/10. It is quite playable, but a bit expensive for what it currently delivers.\n\nThe developer appears to be very committed though, and takes suggestions well. With refinement to the interface and some automation improvements it could be a much better game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ad_meliora/recommended/418250/","ad_meliora","Meliora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ad_meliora/","175 products in account","Another dud.  I just may be done buying in this genre because "space" seems to be a marketing buzzword that substitutes for polish or balance.\n\nThe AI is so heavily cheated that you'll either stomp it or your empire will be a hopeless case.  There is no balance at all, and what I'm calling the "AI" really consists of a function that spams stuff at you.\n\nThe interface is confusing.  The parts you could probably stand to be reminded of show up on your first playthrough and never again, but you're reminded of the easy stuff every playthrough.  It's overly complicated and fiddly, time has almost no sense of meaning at all, and trying to plan your technological development alongside your production means you'll always be upgrading fleets that you never get to field, and the AI's will always be better.\n\nIn battle, sometimes your ships don't attack at all.  You have to use autoresolve to stand a chance because it's that bugged.  You'll command your ships to attack, or even tell them to act on their own and tell them to attack, and they'll just kind of fly near the enemy and do nothing, even when they're fully mounted with weapons that have no ammunition requirement (ie, missiles need ammo; lasers don't).\n\nYour corvettes are made of tissue paper, but from the very first pirate fleet you encounter, enemy corvettes are made of the strongest stuff imaginable, with the best weapons.  Or, so it seems.  No matter how you outfit your ships, the pirate corvettes tear through them like nothing.\n\nThe settings menu for the launcher is so bugged on 4k screens that it manages to crash twice at the same time, unless you disable the Steam overlay.  Yeah, that should be impossible, so this one actually has cutting edge, ground-breaking levels of failure.  If you don't disable high DPI, the settings menu for the launcher will only appear offscreen.  If you have a modern system, you'll need to edit the settings CFG manually, which isn't really pleasant because it's a jumbled mess.\n\nResearch is divided into theoretical and applied sciences, which is nice.  Sadly, the interface is so badly designed with such an obvious lack of thought or effort that it's next to impossible to plan your research.  It's as if the developers forgot that players don't know the source code. Ship modules in the tech tree don't show their stats, so even when you manage to find them, you can't tell what you should be pursuing first.\n\nSettings for the galaxy are hard-coded such that you don't actually have options beyond the space between your primary planets ("Earth-like," and oceanic, typically).  Want a big galaxy, where the distance between empires is enormous, as if space is big?  Too bad.  If you lower the number of opponents, the maximum number of stars you can set it to is lowered as well.  On top of that, the AI cheats so heavily that while your empire is wasting decades or centuries building and dispatching fuel ships, the AI just kind of teleports around the map free of cost.\n\nThe colony management system violates its own rules sometimes, blocking you from building things like factories on Earth-like planets that have nothing else built on them, even if you have the population to build them.  This bug happens if you initially set the planet to "agricultural" and let the AI fill it up with farms.  Even if you destroy every building on the planet except the base colony building, the game will never let you construct another building there.\n\nThe AI is the most war-loving I've ever seen.  You'll meet them, and unless the RNG decides they're already at war with each other, you will usually very soon after have them demand half your resources and declare war on you when you don't provide them.  The developers claim that only happens on "hard" mode, but I've seen in repeated games that it happens on "normal" difficulty.  They ignored my posting that.  These developers don't even know their own game, which suggests that most of the development was outsourced to the lowest bidder.\n\nYou can't defeat enemy fleets because retreat can't be stopped.  In the rare case when you do manage to do well (which involves zerging very small fleets), there will always be at least one remaining enemy ship that you have to chase all over the map, will never be able to kill, and if you don't keep chasing it then it will go destroy your orbital infrastructure.  So, battles ultimately can't be won at all.  The appearance of an enemy means you've already lost, either thanks to the massive buffs and cheats the AI has, or because the game will never permit you to destroy all their ships anyway.\n\nThe forums are filled with developers for the game outright lying about the mechanics and rules of the game while demonstrating in regard to bugs that they don't actually know how their own code works.  It seems like most of the developers' work on this game involves using sockpuppets to convince players who complain that they're basically hallucinating and what they see happen in the game doesn't happen.  Rather than develop a game, they try to use the forum to con the would-be buyer into thinking it's already developed.\n\nAnd this, you get for $40.\n\nSo, here's what's happening with this genre.  Developers slap "space", "4E", and "Grand Strategy" labels on it, release unpolished, unbalanced, lazily thrown together garbage, hire a PR firm to post good reviews, sockpuppet their forums to shout down anyone who has problems with it or (if they go the polite route) simply lie about the game, and by the time you know you've bought yet another dud, it's too late for a refund because the games are designed to take a long time to find out whether they're ultimately playable, with nothing but timesinks.\n\nThis genre is dead.  Steam killed it.  I just wish I could get back all the money I've spent trying to find one of these that's actually fun without it ending up just a blatant clone of the bare minimum design first created twenty years ago.  In all honesty, it seems that if you see "Space" together with "4E" and/or "Grand Strategy" tags on Steam, you might as well withdraw your money from the bank and light it on fire because you'll get more for your buck that way.\n\nI don't know why I'm bothering to post this when the devs, the PR firm they hired, and a few fanbois and friends are just going to rate it down.

It's empty in a lot of fields that i feel are needed to have an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe combat an unit designing aspect of the game is very fun and fulfilling. You need to chose an build your fleets well to survive. As well as that the research style is pretty awesome. Fresh way in doing research that means you may not have the same things researched opposed to a tree style research style which means most races have the same tech.\n\nOther then that the universe building is lacking, all the races are very cartoonish and bland at the same time. The empire building isn't all that interesting either as the races feel all the same as none of them as any benefit over the other nor failings. There's pretty much no micro management in game as you don't have really anything to do except pick the tech to research and planets to colonize. Once you do pick them thats it, the game runs itself. You just move fleets to different areas as enemies do to block them.\n\nAs i said the combat is very good but everything leading up to it is lacking.

I'm not sure there actually is any empire AI at all, in fact, as none of their systems have any sort of development.  In addition, the UI is clunky, and the constant pausing the game forces on you just grinds the game to a halt beyond sitting there, staring at an unmoving screen waiting to hit space to unpause the game (which the game likes to do with such trivial things such as when your fleets reach their destination, or finish refuelling)\n\nIn short, the game seems quite broken at this point, maybe later patches will help improve it, but beyond the bugs and poor AI I'm not sure if that will be enough to combat the total lack of engagement I found in any aspect of this game.","April 2","false","105.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I did not even realize i can self distract ships before someone wrote about that on the forum.\n- Slow, tedious and visually repulsive tactical fights require insane amount of micromanagement.

There are also a lot of UI issues, and for the most part the game feels like it could be a real good game but falls short in several area's (ship designer, empire management, etc). Honestly this game made me want to Space Empires 4. It just doesn't get the right information to the player, it feels wonky and clunky like they weren't sure what would work.\n\nEDIT:\n\nPolaris Sector feels like it took a lot of idea's from different 4x games (Space Empires 4, Master of Orion, Stellaris. etc). This is what attracted me to it.\n\nThe strategic screen looks like that of the upcoming game Stelaris but doesn't have that polished look. I feel like the game tries hard to get the correct information to the player but falls short and the UI just feels smushed and not clear. For example the resource panel on the strategic screen are stuck in a box and only have the icons with current production levels. There is no explanation as to what resources are what, no sense of how a deficit in one resource impacts or doesn't impact the player. I also feel that there is a lack of information given to the player about what buildings to build and planet management. The descriptions don't actually convey what the benefit or loss of building one building or another is. I very much had to guess that one building was a military building and so on from the description with no real idea of what it actually does. Also the amount of buildings you can build is not explicitly stated and I found myself fumbling with what to build and why. The ship designer also feels the same way, that I am not sure what to use and where and how much of specific parts. I found it repetitive, boring, and frustrating. The research tree I found as a black hole, basically just a big giant pile of stuff to research with no real goal in sight other than "something" that I assumed was better than whatever I had. I understand they were going for a feel that was for focusing on a certain research path and it would reveal techs related to that path in no specific order but I feel this was the biggest pitfall. Not because this was a bad idea but because of how it was implemented. The research is not really searchable, I'd have to get through 2-3 or more clicks before I would get to a description that really only describes a technology and doesn't tell me why it would benefit me. So I would search the descriptions of the varied researches available looking for something like "shields" or "phasers" but after about 10 minutes of searching, it was the last straw and gave up then asked for a refund.\n\nOverall it feels like it could be a lot better, but it lacks some basic functionality. Like hovering your mouse over for tool tips. Or searching the tech tree. Or the game telling you what to do and why. I have no problem trying to figure out how these things work, but when I feel like I "need" to read the manual or play a tutorial in order to get the basic fundamentals of a game that maybe it wasn't put together well in the first place.\n\nAlso the main menu screen has no "Options" menu (or at least it wasn't obvious to me) and the music is terrible and too loud, I wanted to shut it off immediately but I couldn't. So I rushed through an empire creation to get in game so I could merely shut off the music.","March 27","false","0.8"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","6","21","0","2"

Most are way too slow for the build and research times of early gameplay but the faster options mean you get spammed with alerts that either auto pause the game, or if you turned the pause off, disappear before you can read the first word. There is no comfortable middle ground as far as I could tell.\n\nTurn pirates off unless you like swarms of ships that kill all your early game tech based ships in seconds and appear at random one system out from your settled worlds. Seriously I had not even researched the first few weapons techs and my home world was attacked by a fleet of 15 pirate ships with 90 fighters.\n\nWhen they say they don’t use a tech tree, they mean they use a tech tree that doesn’t look like a tech tree. Ok, yes it’s not the old standard of basic laser> ok laser> good laser> OMGWTFBBQ laser. Instead they fill the list with numerous meaningless middleman techs that are prerequisites for several other useful techs. The path you take to get the a better laser may also result in you getting some other tech you didn’t expect but its convoluted enough that the end result for gameplay is you ignore the various sliders and simply tell the system to auto prioritize the tech you want leading you right back to the old standard of basic laser> ok laser> good laser> OMGWTFBBQ laser.\n\nThere are a few new ideas in the ship design function but I didn’t get far enough into the game to see if they are well executed.  One thing I did not see was any way to easily update ships from one design to another. Unless there are better ways with better techs in the later game it looks like you have to send each ship to a system with a ship yard and tell each hull class to upgrade. That will get time consuming if you have a huge empire with hundreds of ships.\n\nOverall the game feels like it could use a lot more time in the oven.","March 23","false","3.7"," 9 of 28 people (32%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","32","9","28","2","1"

The ship designer is awful, it adds modules automatically in positions you don't want them making it really fustrating and dificult to optimise a ship design. I will try this again in a few months time when hopefully this has been sorted.\nThis was a Steam pop up issue, now I can design stuff I'm getting quite engrossed","April 1","true","41.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Plainly, I finished learning how to play and took it a bit further.  I found the game intuitive enough to learn without much difficulty.  The game is responsive, beautiful, and a more accurate in terms of time scales than other similar games I have played.  By timescales, I am referring to ship movements, and building.  This fact alone made me want to play more, and I will as I have more time to do so.  Overall, I wholly recommend this game to those who enjoy an expansive and in-depth experience into this genre.","June 5","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
