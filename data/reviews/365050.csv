It seems like it might be a mistake more than intentional, but there are some jumps I can't seem to get past without using this. Also, IDK if maybe my setings are just wrong, but I heard NO sound, which is kinda offputting.\n\nAnyways, 6/10 I guess, not bad. Worth a shot if you're bored.

Most of the jumps over spikes I failed them lots of times because it's like the square is going on ice: it doesn't stop when you stop pressing A or W keys, it keeps moving for a few more inches, even when you jump (also, it never jumps when you press the spacebar; it takes a few seconds to get the memo), and that always ends up in your death.\n\nAt some point, this problem got in the way really bad: it wasn't that the platform level was very hard, it was that the controls didn't respond like they have to, so I kept dying because I couldn't control the square properly.\n\nEDIT: scratch that. Some levels are impossible. I've tried most of them, and a lot of them the game doesn't give you an explanation: it just expect you to find out why the exit point is bouncing so fast, or why is going away from you, or some levels where everything is prepared so bad you can't pass them no matter what you try.\n\nI'm afraid I won't play it again.\n","April 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","20","35","3","0"

To answer the question no it's not. Escape is a rage platformer where the goal is simple you need to get to the portal at the end of the level without dying. This game also has puzzles but a lot of them are quite stupid when you do figure out what the solution was. The game requires a lot of perfect jumps and with the really crappy controls it's not really possible. Those jumps will happen only by dumb luck or the game bug's out and let's you win. Some of the puzzles are really stupid and to explain and the hints the game gives you barely make any sense. Overall for a free game this game is nothing really special. Terrible controls, bad level design and no music or sound effects really make this game nothing special. Only play this game if you're incredibly bored otherwise skip this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowlordapprentice/recommended/365050/","shadowlordapprentice","Stack Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowlordapprentice/","6 products in account","0/10 Would not play again. This game is complete and utter malarkey. Zero clue how it ever ended up on steam. The menu is quite dull and boring. While it seems cool at first,you realize that it is extremely stupid. It always introduces new mechanics and they NEVER are seen again. Especially the fun ones. A lot of levels are extremely hard, and not in a good way. Just a completely unfair way. Some of the levels are completely broken, starting with level 15, there is a jump way too high, and if there was a clue in the words "Die once, win once" I never understood, and trust me, I died over 50 times, and never won. The only pro is that you can go to levels from the menu or ESC menu and skip any level. At level 16 there are walls you can walk through, and only parts of the walls. You have to find your way through. The thing is that in a floor you can jump through you have to jump through above it, but it is too high for you to reach. Some of the walls and fake walls aren't even lined up properly, and the grid isn't even by far. At level 17, I kind of forgot, but I remember it broken as well. And level 18 makes no sense. Some levels require youto die, and that isn't very fun. There are some levels which do not coinside with the others. and I feel like the developer was completely messing around. Like having to press the letters K E Y or having a bunch of you in order to glitch yourself out. The final level sucks, and is by far the easiest, save the first level. All you have to do is enter the exit and leave a bunch of times until the game "breaks" according to some mysterious text on the wall. The entire screen tilts, and everything falls out the side, accompanied by the only sound in the game (Did I mention there is no sound? Or even Music? Well I don't think I did, so I'm warning you now.). All in all,I think this game has a neat idea, but it didn't explore it to its full potential, and explored too much into other mechanics in other games, and just plain messing around. In conclusion? THIS GAME SUCKS. Totally not worth the 0.00$ I put into buying this game.","April 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","9","19","3","0"

How are you suppose to pass the level? Flying nor double jumping isn't available. And about every level (counting by ten) is accessible: so you could skip every level there for destorying the purpose of trying to deafeat the game. In the end I maybe possibly incorrect that there is a way to solve a few of the levels and that this game is a perfect for some people out there. I would not recconmend this game if there are people out there who enjoy a purpose of defeating a game. Dislike the pressure of screwing up over a simple mistake.

Actually, as a small, fun puzzle game, this would have been pretty nice. The problem lays in the platformer part. The controls are rather fitting and flowy, but - as other pointed out already - the wonky collisions tend to make a handful of levels unbelievably frustrating.\n\nAs a free game however it's a great pastime. Levels are skipable, too, so you may spend a few minutes on the ones you like.

If you choose to download this, make sure you enable vSync for it (you'll have to do it through your graphics driver's control panel) otherwise the game is literally unplayable.\n\nPros:\n- Fun\n- Good puzzle aspect in some parts\n- Great ending (seriously, if nothing else, just download it for the ending)\n- You can skip levels\n- Free (obviously)\n\nCons:\n- Ledge hitboxes are strange. Despite being depicted as right angles, they actually have curved hitboxes that you can slide off of. I'm not sure whether this was intentional or not, but I'll give the creator the benefit of the doubt.\n- The game is extremely short and has little to no replay value, but it's up to debate whether this is a con because of the rage this game is capable of producing.\n- Controls aren't as tight as I would like. Your character (square, whatever) feels very slidey, making it hard to land in very specific locations.\n\nFinal verdict: 7/10\n\ntl;dr: The game is worth downloading, just make sure you enable vSync in your graphics driver's control panel.","August 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
