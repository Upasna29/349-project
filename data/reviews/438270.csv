I'm not very far into the game yet but the explanations and quizzes are good. The battle system helps with memorization by repetition. It starts out with the most basic of basics and logically builds from there. I wish the stroke order followed the in game font more closely, it can be confusing for some to see two different representations of the same characters. Repetition is an OK method of learning but I would have liked to see it coupled with mnemonics to give the player a little rhyme or picture to associate with the character. However for 7 bucks this is a fun and engaging way to learn Hiragana, while there are free alternatives that work just as well they aren't as fun.","February 16","true","4.8"," 228 of 247 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","228","247","5","7"

Putting it in this simple JRPG format did the trick. I ended up having a lot of fun and took down about 20 pages of notes in the process, and that's not counting side quest vocabulary I didn't bother writing down but probably should have.\n\nOn the plus side:\nIt's simple and accessible, especially if you're familiar with traditional 2D JRPGs\nMoves at an easy pace, only throwing a few new characters at you per area\nHas some humor and plot to it without being dumb or overly cheesy\nActually helps you learn Hiragana\nClear explanations of many subtle aspects of the language, like dakuten or particles.\nOn the negative side:\nDespite the presence of several buff skills, they don't see much use, so the combat's missing on depth most of the time\nGear is likewise mostly linear upgrades with a few unique pieces here and there\nThere's no way to limit encounters. You'll sometimes trigger 3 fights in 10 steps and wish you had Repel or something similar to halt them for a while as you search for an item or NPC. An Escape Rope mechanic to quickly return to town would be great for the very few times you need to backtrack into a dungeon as well. (The game teleports you out nearly every other time.)\nOn the hit/miss side:\nVoice acting is usually great, but sometimes it's unclear or too abrupt to understand.\nDemonstrates stroke order and gives tips for how to properly write all characters, which is awesome. But in-game font, character image used for enemies, and handwriting tutorials often differ from eachother and occasionally cause confusion. (I'm looking at you, り!)\nMy best moment in the game: When it started throwing words at me instead of just isolated characters and I realized I could read most of them. You start running into people who speak Japanese and items with Japanese names and you get to figure out what's being said or what the item is called not because some tutorial or textbook told you to, but because you want to know what is being communicated and you know you have the tools to figure it out. (Because you were taking notes, right? Right?)\n\n10/10, because as far as I know this is the only game in this niche that works. Get it and support more games like this if you want to learn languages via videogames.","February 20","true","20.2"," 87 of 90 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","87","90","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexmarston/recommended/438270/","lexmarston","Lex Marston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexmarston/","181 products in account","Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r8lC0TTLAE\n\nJapan produces some pretty cool stuff. Some of the best games of the last few decades have been either first released in Japan or exclusively released in Japan. A lot of the times, nice folks who know the Japanese language will translate Japanese games so that we can enjoy them to their fullest. However, that may take a while, if it ever happens at all. Besides, self-reliance is an underrated thing. Now, if you’re a chowderhead like me, then you only know one language, and that’s ‘murcan. But what if you want to broaden your horizons? You could take a Japanese course at school. But only if your school offers it, and if it’s a college course, you may be spending quite a bit of money on the course and books. You could buy Rosetta Stone, but that could cost you up to $200. I don’t know about you, but I’m not a great learner in the normal classroom setting. I’ve tried games before like My Japanese Coach, but I was bored and frustrated soon after starting. I’ve always wanted to learn Japanese, but have never found a way that works for me.\n\nAnd now this is starting to sound like an infomercial, and as much as I love me some infomercials, I purchased Learn Japanese to Survive: Hiragana Battle from the Steam store on a whim the day it launched. I didn’t even know this was a thing until the day I bought it, but I saw the $7 price tag and good early reviews and figured I’d give Japanese one last shot. It’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made.\n\nHiragana Battle is an educational game. It teaches the player Hiragana, one of the 3 forms of the Japanese language, in the wrapper of a traditional JRPG. Misaki, your Japanese instructor, gives you lessons. You’ll then set out to the world map and fight Hiragana characters by selecting the matching sound they represent.\n\nThe story, which isn’t of much importance, goes like this: Noboru, a strange, unkempt man, is summoning Hiragana characters into the real world in hopes of taking over the land. It’s up to you and your friends to fight off the Hiragana Warriors and seal the gates before Noboru gains too much leverage and conquers Japan and all around it. But of course, you don’t know any Japanese at all, so you have hit the books before you’re able to save the world.\n\nHiragana Battle is made using the RPG Maker engine, an engine I quite like. And the game looks very good, for that sort of style. It does have an aura of being generic, mainly because this is how most of the games made with the RPG Maker engine look, but it’s well-done nonetheless. I never looked at anything in the game and said, “Oh, that’s just ugly.” It’s a good looking game, even if it isn’t the most impressive looking game.\n\nThe lessons are nice. Calming music plays in the background as you’re told about each Hiragana character. Unfortunately, you are going to have to break out a notebook and do some old school learning, as Misaki will ask you to practice writing each character. Even though this is by far the least fun part of the game, it's actually very beneficial as you'll more than likely need to recall back to earlier sets of characters later in the game. And although you have the option to revisit an earlier lesson with Misaki, it's a lot easier to be able to flip through a notebook. Throughout my 15-hour playthrough I took several pages of notes which gave me a much needed crutch.\n\nYou see, Hiragana Battle doesn't do a great job of mixing up all of the characters throughout the game. You'll go hours and hours without seeing some of the earlier characters and if you don't have a great memory, like myself, then you're going to have to look back in your notebook to see which character is which. There are many characters that look nearly identical with the only difference being the stroke of a final line.\n\nWhich brings me to my next qualm with the game: the confusing font. Most of the time, we see Japanese characters typed out. Whether that be on a website or in a game, you usually see the same font. Hiragana Battle includes this font in the game in their menus, but when Misaki teaches you how to write the characters, and when the characters show up in battle, they’re a more stylized version. Often times, they look different than what we read as normal Japanese font, and this can also make things very confusing for beginners. However, it does teach you to recognize the characters in different fonts, so it can be a good thing.\n\nI was able to triumph over all of that and push forward, and soon after, I started recognizing Hiragana characters on Twitter from all the Japanese wrestling posts I see and from the man himself, Mother/Earthbound creator Shigesato Itoi. And I kept going forward. And then I started recognizing Japanese words, and that excitement continued to push me through to the end of the game. One of the more interesting things that Hiragana Battle does is, towards the end of the game, it’ll start listing items, weapons, and armor in Japanese only, so you’ll have to be able to read the word in Japanese to understand what you’re buying. There was a side-quest where some dude in Japan really wanted a Manga issue, and I had to go down to the convenience store, look at their items that were only listed in Japanese, and then read and buy the correct item to give him. The feeling I got when I read “manga” in Japanese was euphoric. It was a sign the game was truly working.\n\nAlong with the main quest, you’ll have side-quests. Most of these are fetch quests, but all of them teach you new vocabulary. You can also acquire special points from these side quests to help boost the levels of your party members.\n\nEvery RPG element about this game is pretty standard and basic. You’re not going to see any new functions. You fight enemies to earn money, you spend that money on better weapons and armor, you level up to get stronger, and you save after every battle. If all of your party members die in Hiragana Battle, it’ll reload to your last save, so make sure that you’re saving every few minutes.\n\nHiragana Battle isn’t a perfect game by any means. It has issues both on the RPG side and on the teaching side. I would have like to have seen some form of mnemonic teaching in the game, aka helping the player remember by relating the character to something else, like a kangaroo for ru or a pig tail for su. But then again, maybe it’s best to leave that up to the player.\n\nEven with its flaws, Hiragana Battle is well worth the $7 asking price. $7 will teach you all the characters in the Hiragana set, plus grammar and punctuation, vocabulary, and even some common phrases. And it’ll do it in a way that keeps you engaged. It’s about time someone used the grind of RPG’s for an educational purpose. I’m sure it’s been done before, but learning the Japanese language through a traditional JRPG is just about the best combination you can come up with.\n\nThe developers, Sleepy Duck Educational Games, have plans for a sequel that will teach the next phase of the Japanese language, which they plan to call Katakana War. It’s good to know that you can invest in Hiragana Battle and be able to continue forth at some point in the same style. I will definitely be buying Katakana War, and if you’re interested in learning Japanese, I highly recommend you pick up Hiragana Battle.","March 4","true","16.7"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","37","42","2","1"

I ran across it as I was searching for anything RPG, and the title caught me.  As a servicemember living in Japan, with a japanese girlfriend, I decided I would like to try playing a game to help me learn to read/write hiragana.  I already speak a liittle, but I can't read a thing living here.  So far the game has proven to be very helpful, and I can't believe how much I've learned in so little time!\n\nThe lessons are at your own pace, and you get the options for repetition of drawing examples and speaking examples.\n\nThe combat is simple, but it reminds me of my old days of playing Golden sun on Gameboy Advance.  It engages you enough to keep you thinking, but also quizes you constantly on your knowledge of the written characters.  "You can use a cheat sheet to make sure you are memorizing them.  I first try to figure them out in my head, then review my notebook to make sure I have it right."\n\nIt's a little adventure, and has gear upgrades...  What can I say?

I was at the end of lvl 2 and I could barely remember more than 10 or so hiragana. I just couldn't get them to stick. Then I saw this on sale. I figured,"Eh, why not?" and purchased it right away. This was by far the best descion I have made this year\n\nSo going in I was a bit ahead of the curve knowing a bit of hiragana and a booty ton of the spoken language, I thought that I might not get much out of this.

Well I usually power through it, but with the way of presenting it as grinding I just did what comes naturally for any jrpg...

Do not expect to speak Japanese after this.\n❥ Played: 7 hours\n►Currently located: Ghoul Ruins\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nI have had a positive experience with this game.  I currently have worked and lived in Japan for about a year now, and have had trouble learning the language. This being said, I have been exposed to the everyday Japanese language, and I can say this is a good starting place for people who like to play games and want to learn Japanese. Below is a list of pros and cons I have found within the game so far.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n✱Pros:✱\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n❤ 1.)  The order the lesson is presented to you.\n\nDetails: I really like the order they present the material(s) to you, and I think it is one of the best styles I have seen for a beginner learner.\n\n❤  2.) Defeating the "hiragana."\n\nDetails: Although, this might be a minus for some, I like it. You have to constantly kill the same hiragana, but there is enough of a mix, that it does not get boring to me. Repetition is key to learning a new language.\n\n❤ 3.) The side quests\n\nDetails: The side quests are optional but give you the option to expand your vocabulary. I really like how they just don't focus on the hiragana alone. This and visuals are sometimes shown through out the side quests, which help! I have also learned a little culture from it, like types of food and drinks in Japan.\n\n❤ 4.) The "lessons"\n\nDetails: The lessons have a listening and writing part, which I really enjoyed. If you actually read what Misaki says, it gives you a lot of good tips! I highly recommend not skipping through it. The quizzes are nice. They don't grade you, just check your comprehension and do not let you go to the next question until you select the correct choice. (Although the monsters are not as forgiving. haha)\n\n❤  5.) The humor\n\nDetails: As you start in the game, the humor is quite funny. *At least to me*. (SPOILER: Leon's story about the pumpkins. The snowman in the town and the dog in snowleaf village, etc.)\n\n❤ 6.)  "Bonus point crystal"\n\nDetails: As you do side quests, you get bonus points which you can turn into the "bonus crystal" next to Misaki that you can exchange for levels.\n\n❤ 7.) Option to review with Misaki\n\nDetail: I like the option to review when you want to!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n✱Cons:✱\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n✘ 1.) The story\n\nDetails: The story is a bit ridiculous and it is sometimes hard to take the game seriously, but if you remember you are here to learn the language versus playing a game, a lot of this cons can be overlooked.\n\n✘ 2.) The interface\n\nDetails: There is some features I think that can be added to help the game be a little more smoother for the learner. One  is as you progress and learn more hiragana, the list obviously gets bigger. However, as it gets bigger no arrow/scroll is shown, so as a beginner you are searching through the big list of hiragana and not realizing there are more choices. I got stuck for a good 5 minutes the first time this issue arose. I could not find the choice, so I thought I had remembered incorrectly. Load and behold, I scrolled down on my mouse because I became frustrated and the list scrolled down and there were more choices! This seems so obvious now, but it might be a similar problem to someone else. In addition, I think the hiragana should have an hp box. It is a bit annoying not knowing how many more hits I have to do before I should pick the next pair. (For example: I might pick answer "ko" for the hiragana "こ" for ALL my players, and than the hiragana dies...and the player still attacks with the answer "ko" to the next mob...even though it is "か". I found this to be VERY annoying.) However, one you are in the area a bit, you start realizing how many hits the hiragana needs before it dies.\n\n✘ 3.) Too easy to "escape"\n\nDetails: For me, I like a little strategy in a game. So this might not be a con for some. Whenever you click the option to "escape" you always do. There is no real struggle. So I could go through a dungeon without practicing any hiragana. (You need to for money and exp though.)\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n✱Other suggestions to the game that I feel are not critical but would help the game.✱\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1.) ❥ Customization\n\nDetails: It is a bit boring to not see the characters change at all as you give them new equipment or items. I wish I could name the main character too.\n\n2.) ❥ More variety earlier\n\nDetails: As I have progressed through the game, I did see change; however it is a bit of a too slow of a pace in my opinion.\n\n3.) ❥ Features to include:\n\nDetails: Things that I think that should be added but not necessary. I wish as they attacked there was sound effects. For example when you answer "e", it would be nice if the character pronounced the hiragana. This gives repetition and makes it easier for the listener to remember how it is pronounced. There should be a feature where you can turn it off too, for the people who think it would be too annoying. Secondly, when you are getting exp, it will show a bar and +number of exp earned, but there is no numbers on the bar. It is not too annoying, and it might be cleaner for some gamers, but I like seeing the numbers. Maybe you can include a feature to add or remove numbers to both exp bars and hp/mp bars. Thirdly, when going to the inn to rest, it does not show you how much money you have. Although it is very cheap (only 10¥ and you should have it), it still seems weird not to see it. I would feel differently if it was free.  Lastly, I think when you save the game it should say where you are located. The only way I can tell the difference between the files is by the hours I have played.\n\n4.) ❥ More side quests + order they appear\n\nDetails: When the side quests are first introduced they all appear at once! I am an eager learner, so I tackled them all at once, hoping more would come as the game progressed. So far...NOPE. I think the pacing of the appearance of them should be fixed. The learned might either get overwhelmed or bored due to no new variety.\n\n5.) ❥ Stealing the little boy's  life savings from the vase\n\nDetails:  I just think it is a sad feature, that maybe we should have the option to give it back.\n\n6.) ❥ Starting a new game (Option to skip dialogue or repeat it)\n\nDetails: Although you can mash the "esc" key; It would be nice to skip, as a return player.\n\n7.) ❥  Double checking (Are you sure you want to quit?)\n\nDetails: The game doesn't ask if you want to save or if you are sure you would like to quit, when clicking the "x". Same with selling things, it just sells it.\n\n8.) ❥ BOSS fights\n\nDetails: I think it should be a BIGGER hiragana that changes as you hit it. This would be a bit of a variety OR you should introduce kanji!!  It can review the vocabulary we already learned....like "犬" (いぬ) [dog].  How to attack: the boss comes in and it shows the kanji + hiragana + english. After the monster gets to 75% the hiragana disappears, Than the english at 50%. I think it would be fun and challenging!\n\n9.) ❥ In game notepad\n\nDetails: Just a suggestion, but not needed.\n\n10.) ❥ Equipment tutorial.\n\nDetails: It is a bit confusing. I self-taught myself but it is a bit frustrating not having a bit of a guide.\n\n-------------------------\n\n► Additional remarks:\n\n-------------------------\n\n✿ Great for the "gamer" learner!\n✿ The game is just $6.99 (at present), why not give it a shot? It is far cheaper than other options out there.\n✿ Remember to save your game a lot!","February 18","true","27.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

But, In the short amount of time I've been playing this game, I've learned 15 hiragana letters. The random encounters really help solidify the concept of the symbols since it gives you a reason to keep coming back to it and understanding what it is. I first scoffed at the thought of writing it thinking that it's simple a joke to do so. I'm telling you, it's probably not as easy as it looks! (At least for me). You will want to take out pen and paper to go through these these. It will help you remember better. And, most importantly, have fun and take a break every once in a while.

In my opinion this game progresses very well.  If English is your first language, then Hiragana looks alien. It can be Intimidating at times.  Early on, you don't get the impression that "This is all over my head". Each lesson is small with the right amount of repetition to keep you interested. Everything you learn in each lesson is easily accessed for reminders.\n\nOn the game side of things, I think it was a really nice touch.  We can face facts. If you like JRPG’s, you likely buy imports since it’s not a very popular genre outside of Japan (Hence the "J" part). Some of them don’t exactly offer English as an option for Subtitles.\n\nI think the point the developers are trying to make with this game is crystal clear.  I also believe they have succeeded.  Ive enjoyed my time with it. I’m continuing to enjoy my time with it.

Within 10 hours of gaming split across two days I was able to master all the hiragana and learn some basic vocabulary. I spoke some japanese phrases beforehand but never bothered learning how to write so this was totally new to me.\nI found the lessons to be very well paced and never felt over- nor underwhelmed.\n\nGaming:\nLikely made with some version of the RPG Maker, so adjust your expectations accordingly.\nI always liked the RPG Maker games so this was totally fine to me.\nThe graphics are nicely done and quite fitting. Sound and music are your typical 8-bit retro RPG sounds, so don't expect an amazing OST.\nThe story, while absolutely sufficient for this kind of game, is the only weak point. A very very basic RPG story that tries to take two interesting turns, but those are easily predictable. For this kind of game I don't see this as a bad thing though because you can easily take a break and absorb what you've learned without wondering all day how the story will continue. If the story was too good you might end up rushing to the finish in one session (which is totally possible) and end up with way too much to learn.\n\nOverall I can only recommend this game to anyone who wants to learn hiragana and I'll definitely buy the Katakana sequel.","May 15","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Weebs ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).\n\nIt's your average RPG with Yen as you currency. You earn Yen by defeating the Hiragana characters that pop up when you run around kinda like Pokémon. If the enemy looking like the character あ pops up you must choose "A" from the attack menu as this character is the equivilent of A in the English Language. If it's wrong you do 0 damage and if it is correct then you do the damage that your character(s) can achieve.\n\nIt has a surprisingly good storyline to it, and it has a good amout of repition in it to help you learn the characters. It has good graphics and the way it teaches you to learn these characters is pretty effective. I WOULD recommend writing them down on a note pad as you will certainly need some kind of reference to help you along with the new characters in the beginning. Mine looks like this puu.sh/nblSN/4b6e41845b.jpg .\n\nI recommend it, it's only £5 and I bought it because I said to my friend before I was interested in it but I didn't really have an incentive to learn, but this is great because I actually want to play it since it's a game.\n\nTL;DR It keeps you entertained, it's a good story and It has good ways of teaching.

You can also access every lesson from your inventory after you complete the lesson and quiz.

I've only played up to the first boss and completed the first two lessons, but I'm guessing the structure of the game won't change much.

It takes way too long of a time to navigate and it's frustrating. The people who defend it with "It was made in RPG maker" or "It's a JRPG, that's what it's supposed to be like" are missing the point. This game could have been made so much easier and more user friendly.\n\nWhy does it HAVE to play like a JRPG? It can mimic the graphical style and look like one but there's no reason for it to play like one. Why couldn't I be able to just select the Japanese character on the screen and then select the correct corresponding romanji in a menu at the bottom, an entire attack made with TWO clicks of the mouse? Does anyone REALLY think it's better to have to go through menus clicking "Attack" and then "Answer" and then the correct answer in a list that covers the entire screen and THEN the character the answer is for. And for EVERY character in the party?\n\nThis is far too slow and awkward to be effective learning.

Its a great tool to use to learn basic Japanese and its a lot of fun while you do it. Buy it. It will be one of the best $6.99 purchases you have made in a while!\n\nThis game focuses on teaching the player Hiragana, one of the more basic japanese writing systems, while still maintaining the old pixel RPG adventure games. It has a good story line for what it is and some pretty charming art and music.\n\nI haven't played it a ton so far, but from what I got out of that short time is actually pretty good! This game has you learn japanese you've learned from previous lessons to take down all of the enemies in the game. So,\n\nThe more you pay attention, practice saying the Hiragana and taking notes, the better you will do.\n\nThat brings me to the note taking. If you are a beginner in Japanese, notes are ESSENTIAL. The game even tells you to go get a pen/pencil and a piece of paper. Though while you are practicing the Hiragana strokes as it has you do, they do seem a bit tedious in the beginning. It isnt enough to make the game feel terrible and not worth it but you do have to put in a good amount of effort to learn and play the game.\n\nSo to sum it up, the game is good. If you want a rating i'd give it a 7/10. It has great music, good art, you can go somewhat at your own pace and the story is pretty good from what it is. For $6.99 its worth it. Definitely. If and when it is on sale then pick it up if you dont have it. Or better yet, buy it as $6.99 as it is normally.","February 16","true","1.2"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","10","26","3","3"

The menu system is uninuitive, and requires an unnecessary amount of input to navigate around.\n\nEach battle involves correctly identifying Japanese characters for the enemy you choose to attack.   This requires the player to click Attack, then navigate a menu of Hiragana characters, select the character, then select the enemy.  Easy enough...except that these steps are required for every attack, and for each of the attacking characters in your party.  By the second or third battle, you know the correct characters instantly, but have to navigate the same tedious menus for each character in your party repeatedly.  Despite a lot of potential here, It's simply not fun.","February 17","false","1.2"," 41 of 117 people (35%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","35","41","117","4","8"

They should consistently morph or do something slightly cleverer.\n\nAside from that, wasting your time with clunky JRPG mechanics from the 80s while you're trying to learn is annoying.\n\nThe concept is cute, but just focus on making it exclusively a learning game next time. Nobody who's up for learning a writing system needs to be entertained by junky JRPG mechanics like a child.\n\n\nLonger edit:\n\nI can't go too in-depth as I've only put about 40 minutes into the game before I dropped it.\n\nThe battle system is very simplistic - you slap the Hiragana character icons repeatedly with their corresponding english sound and use typical video games skills that have nothing to do with language learning like heal skills.\n\nIt's simply a missed opportunity. The battle system hasn't got any depth, there's no reason the Hiragana characters shouldn't just die in one hit to their corresponding sound and/or replace themselves with others, and all the video-gamey stuff is very detracting from the actual learning.\nBeyond slapping characters around there doesn't seem to be anything more, for example an integrated drawing tool to recognize that you can draw the characters.\n\n\nWhat I learned in 40 minutes of playing this I could have learned in a youtube video of 5 minutes. And it shouldn't necessarily be that way. Yes, I get that it's a game, but it's a learning tool first. Nobody's gonna get into this game thinking "hmmm I crave a real good JRPG right now", it's purely for the learning in an enjoyable way - it is neither a good learning tool nor enjoyable.\n\n\nSeems like this review is garnering a lot of traction. I say judge for yourselves, and refund it like I did if you don't like it. But let me tell you as someone who speaks multiple languages fluently - this is a very poor learning tool, even for something as basic as this.

I truly loved it! It truly helps you out to learn. I was surprised it even teaches you how to write each hiragana character. Great tips too! I'm in love with it!\n\nMy suggestions would be:\n\n1) Once you finish an area or specific quests, it could be great to have quick shortcut portals to move to other cities faster.\n\n2) Music gets repetitive when in fighting mode with Hiragana Warriors at the beginning. Keep in mind we want to repeat areas as many times as possible until we fully memorize the characters. So it would be great if music were random and with a wider selection. Not just same everytime. I truly loved the music at the ending and overall!! Cutie Anime style :).\n\n3) If you are a woman, japanese pronunciation should be studied from a Japanese female voice because male japanese voices are really different. If the player is a boy he should learn male pronunciation. It could be good to be given this option too.\n\n4) More vocabulary quizes :).\n\nThank you!","March 18","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nothing more than a small first step to actually learning Japanese though, so don't expect getting a lot out of it.\n\nSome specific things I disliked:\n- Game felt short.\n- Hiragana enemy groups are not random but preset, so after a while you just know the group of monsters you face, rather than knowing the characters\n- Because of the way the menu is set up, sometimes you can guess a character by the place it has in the menu rather than actually knowing it. I tried to circumvent this for myself by not opening the menu until I knew what I wanted to answer.\n- I would have really liked if there was a post-endgame dungeon where all the characters are present and you fight them randomly, rather than preset groups. With the game right now I don't really come away feeling I mastered all the characters, and feel like I still need more and better practice.\n\nSo all in all I do recommend the game, I learned from it and it was fun, but it's not perfect or comprehensive.","March 20","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nothing more than a small first step to actually learning Japanese though, so don't expect getting a lot out of it.\n\nSome specific things I disliked:\n- Game felt short.\n- Hiragana enemy groups are not random but preset, so after a while you just know the group of monsters you face, rather than knowing the characters\n- Because of the way the menu is set up, sometimes you can guess a character by the place it has in the menu rather than actually knowing it. I tried to circumvent this for myself by not opening the menu until I knew what I wanted to answer.\n- I would have really liked if there was a post-endgame dungeon where all the characters are present and you fight them randomly, rather than preset groups. With the game right now I don't really come away feeling I mastered all the characters, and feel like I still need more and better practice.\n\nSo all in all I do recommend the game, I learned from it and it was fun, but it's not perfect or comprehensive.","March 20","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Awesome if you're learning hiragana for the first time, although the battles may take a little longer, and even better if you already know hiragana and really want to seal it in and increase your reconition speed. It does teach some vocab words and phrases and is a really awesome tool that I think anyone who likes games and is learning Japanese should definitely have. Besides the teaching aspect, it's just a really solid, cute and well done RPG so either way you'll have tons of fun with this.

If you like JRPGs or RPG maker games, this could greatly benefit you as well. Mouse controls are very useful- after figuring them out I found myself using them more or less all the time.\n\nBut I'd like to give some spoiler-free constructive criticism for the game.\n\nLack of variation in waves: I'm to understand that when making a game in RPG maker, one would have to create set "troops" of enemies(Making this a difficult point to improve upon), but I find myself sometimes remembering Hiragana characters solely upon their placement within their troops, which isn't a practical way to remember Hiragana.\nTakes itself a bit too seriously as an RPG: Having to keep track of a storyline and stats is commonplace in a typical RPG, but here is just feels strange. Sorry if this is a bit of a nitpick!\nMore boss fights would be very welcome: I found the most fun (and rewarding) parts of the game were the boss fights with Noburo, where a stream of characters would spawn (even better with the final boss's final form- I may go back and play just that a few more times), but I felt like these weren't really explored enough. A boss fight per "world" would be a welcome change in my eyes.\nMore "other dimension" areas: These were among the most challenging segments of the game in my eyes, and I would have loved to see an area where you have to translate english words to their Japanese equivalent.\nGreat job, I look forward to the sequel!","April 21","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So why do i still recommend this?\n\nBecause this game delivers what it advertises. It's teaching you a pretty complex language in a fun way, by going step by step and repeating the important parts often enough to keep them in your head. You're not only taught the writing system Hiragana along with the pronunciation of the characters but also basic conversational skills, important words and a bit of japanese culture. And the rudimentary RPG style is an additional motivation to keep going. "Just five more battles until i can afford that new sword" means that you voluntarily repeat a lesson 5 times more.

As in, go to the text passage prior, it's nothing major but it saves the player needing to review an entire lesson to read only one passage. I think this would be a practical addition to a great learning resource and fun game!\n\n2. For the writing segments to use only one image of the character, or to have both images side by side and to have the drawn image stay on the screen until a button press. Currently the different 'fonts' being used for the writing section add a layer of inconsistency that can make stroke placement uncertain.\n\nAll in all, this is a great way to lay the foundations of future language study.","May 22","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I truly loved the music at the ending and overall!! Cutie Anime style :).\n\n3) If you are a woman, japanese pronunciation should be studied from a Japanese female voice because male japanese voices are really different. If the player is a boy he should learn male pronunciation.

To english people all this at the start feels very alien like. to me in the past it has felt as if it were next to impossible to pick up but after playing this and practicing writting the charecters that it trys to teach you it sticks, and constantly running into the "Hirigana Warriors" as they are called helps an awfull lot because its throwing these charecters youve learned at you all the time and as you progress it still throws some old ones at you again and you think oh yea thats one ive already learnt. So you dont literally forget after 20 mins off not seing it. Other than that i will say its good to take breaks and refresh your mind like the game says to do iff your strugling as it does help.\n\nAs for Story its quite fun actually the game will keep you entertained, You start off in this litle peacefull village and end up in a tavern talking with some friends, when your finished you go outside and a mysterious man appears and thats where the journey will begin. You travel around a map to new places and from what i can tell you end up in a distant land called "japan". For me its not like going to school and just having a teacher tell you do this and do that, and the side quests aswell are cool because they tell you a litle bit about culture in japan. They Can also teach you new phrases aswell.\n\nI feel you will  have to play the game yourself to see what its like to be honest as i know alot off people learn in different ways, for me this is a good way for learning and i am enjoying it at the same time.","April 22","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A very good resource for beginners like me.\n\nI have two suggestions for the dev:\n\n1. For the player to be able to go back in text. As in, go to the text passage prior, it's nothing major but it saves the player needing to review an entire lesson to read only one passage. I think this would be a practical addition to a great learning resource and fun game!\n\n2. For the writing segments to use only one image of the character, or to have both images side by side and to have the drawn image stay on the screen until a button press. Currently the different 'fonts' being used for the writing section add a layer of inconsistency that can make stroke placement uncertain.\n\nAll in all, this is a great way to lay the foundations of future language study.","May 22","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are unable to enjoy the actual gameplay, I am sure you will at least be pleased with the speed at which you learn the hiragana.","May 27","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played almost seven hours over the past five days and I feel like I've learned so much. The one downside is that it's crashed on me a couple times. The last time it crashed, it crashed from me hitting the "Save" button. But other than that I've been absolutely satisfied (ESPECIALLY for such a low price tag). Nice work, really.","May 30","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I was searching some random games on Steam and saw this special game. It is hard for me to find a way to start and here it is, a game for the beginner to learn Japanese characters and vocabs. However, I can't fully recommend this game for everyone to play because it is not easy to learn-and-remember in this game, even I take lots of notes and keep practicing on writing the characters. It is a method for me (maybe including anyone) to 'Learn' Hiragana but not 'Remember' Hiragana. Maybe it is just me having some learning problems, but seriously, the game's battle system is quite boring that you focus on defeating the enemies and get money to buy stuffs, then go to the next area and do the same thing. The aim still is still finishing the game and have a happy ending after a while I may forget all I have learnt and wasted several hours. I don't mean that playing this game is wasting time but it is not a choice to keep learning Japanese. Like I said, it is a good start for learning Japanese language but if you have already had a bit or more knowledge of this language, this game may not perform effectively.\nLet me sum up this long freakin' review:\nPro:\n- a choice for someone who would like to learn Japanese but don't know where to start\n- suitable for someone who like playing RPG games\n- educative\n- feel fun to learn Japanese name of the daily stuffs\nCon:\n- quite boring battle system\n- not easy to focus on learn-and-remember the Japanese characters\n- some of the stuffs in game are useless or unable to use (spoiler alert!)\nAll above are just my unprofessional review and give a big support to the developer if you enjoy this game like I do :)","June 4","true","11.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
