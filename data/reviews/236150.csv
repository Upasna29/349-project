See this game as EVE offline. You fly your own ship (which you can upgrade or just buy a bigger one) around a HUGE universe that has highway like wormholes and natural wormholes. You can also move around anywhere under your own power so just traveling on highways or through wormholes isn't a must. There are hints of fleets in thwere but haven't been able to start one, although you can already by extra ships and leave them in your garage.\n\nYour Ship:\nUpgrades for your ships are plenty and the weapon systems include, lasers, plasma cannons, railguns, missiles, and much more which you can freely add to any supporting hardpoint on your ship (light for guns, heavy for ammo consuming launchers). All upgrades and repairs happen on the station and I've noticed you really need to shop around the stations to get the best stuff.\n\nYour Crew:\nYes, this game has crews as even your starting ship is more then the usual fighters you get in other games. There are 3 shipstations which you can hire crew for. The crew gives you boosts on weapons or ship systems like engines, shields and cloaks depending on their skills. Again every station/planet offers different crews with different skills.\n\nGameplay:\nRandom missions are generated all the time wich includes simple "go there and shoot.." missions, scan anomalies and bringing around cargo and passengers. You can visit many many stations (and planets) to upgrade, repair, hire crew, trade and lots more. The universe is very much alive as you encounter friendly and non friendly ships all over the place. Some sectors and stations really don't like you and can form a real challange when fighting in those sectors (enemy reinforcemants and stations blasting you). Fighting is mouse controlled, aim and shoot your light weapons by clicking the right mouse button and fire your heavy ammo consuming weapons with X. Also you can give the command "Fire at will" which will basically unleash all weapons on all in range enemies (this can be very much fun to watch while you just fly around avoiding damage with guns blazing).\n\nTrade is already present in the game but is still in it's first stages so you get very little info on prices except for a news scroller that is viewable on every planet and station.\n\nDevelopment:\nPatches are rolling out in a steady pace and the devs are very active on the forums (Post a question, suggestion or comment and you'll likely get a reply within the hour). This just gives you extra confidence to buy this game in early access and help in it's development.\n\nCurrent Verdict July 18 2014:\nHighly recommended early access game that is only getting better with each update.\n\n*My above opinion still hasen't changed, latest update is again full of content. Recommend to pick up on current sale :)\n\nCurrent Verdict September 16 2014:\nLatest patches have added full controller support for fans of those things. Also the game is nearly complete as release is almost here, they've been busy with optimizing the game and adding final features, complete campaign/story mode is not finished yet but devs have indicated it's coming soon! (And in the past they've proven time and time again that they uphold their word!).\n\nSo still a big fat recommend from me at this final stage of early access.","April 25, 2014","true","46.3"," 449 of 479 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","449","479","0","8"

There are ships.  The ships come in different sizes and configurations.  You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships.  Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off is the only one that makes it.  There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses.  There can be a story/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining/piracy.  The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy.  It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.\n\nBeing a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options.  There are less than other space games I've tried.  Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is.  You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything.  Aiming is done via turrets.  Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space.  That's what you're here for right?\n\nIt took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged.  Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy.  I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut.  I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons.  I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds.  I enjoy exploring.  I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought.  I enjoyed this game.  And the free DLC.\n\nSpaaaaaaaaace.  What's your favorite thing about space?

It is eating away at my soul here. Like I need to sacrifice another small vessel for creds so I can sleep again.\n\nI bought this game cause I had a gut feeling it was what I needed in a game right now. Yeah sure there are others like it, but I just wanted singleplayer and something really solid and fun. An man was I in for a treat! I had no idea I could enjoy a game so much again, like back in the day with all the old systems around and gramps was trying to figure out why the TV is calling him.\n\nSo far the story has been very engaging with some smug and unsavory characters, not to mention a bunch of stuff to do on the way. Clearing asteroid fields for some spare loot to fill that cargo hold, capturing enemy ships to either sell or dock for your own collection. Beaming aboard your crew to steal stuff for you on a old mining field or enemy ship in battle to turn the tide an steal it for yourself, you will have to tractor beam it the whole way at impulse speeds to the nearest planet or station of course, who wants to do anything the easy way any way? Psssh.\n\nYou have your classic worm holes you can use to travel or them good ole relays for cash, but who wants to waste money?\nAlso you will run into random slipstreams in which you can use to traverse.. well the verse, by steering your ship properly through it. Be warned about worm holes though you can loose people, but don't worry you can get more red shirts at the nearest docking bay :D.\n\nEven combat is savvy. Tell your people to fire at will, take the helm do it yourself or root all power to engines as the words of Firefly's Jane "Let's Moon'm" cascades from your lips like lavander and oats. Be a commander, be THE commander. Hire merc ships to roll in your space posse, have a fleet of some bad to the bone misunderstood ship captains looking for redemption and love among the stars. You can of course also customize your ships colors and a few decals, but the real bread n' butter is the all the parts you can fit the ships with. An there is a lot of parts ranging from pulsar cannons to rail guns.\n\nYou are not constrained in anyway wanna be that scruffy looking nerf herder? You can! Got that Serenity Smuggling Fever? This game has the cure my friend! Wanna travel across space corralling convicts like Cowboy Bebop? See you space cowboy, I'll be chilling with Jet. Wanna make enemies of a gang Outlaw Star Style? Look no further time to pop that space cherry Gene Starwind! Need to feel like you're back in Star Fleet Academy with Kirk? Picard? Riker? Janeway? Tuvok? Classes start as soon as you hit the buy button cadet! An tell Neelix I sent ya ;D.\n\nWhat is also great is that the devs have been very responsive and helpful working with the community to solve issues, active devs have really made this product shine and continues to better. I do hope you get the game and enjoy as much as I am.\n\nIn my conclusion yes I recommend this amazing game, I have spent the last few years just really yearning for something, but sure what exactly. When I saw this I knew my sacrifice to the Game Satan had finally been heard. The graphics are solid and just breathtaking, the gameplay is as smooth as Bruce Willis's bald spot in The 5th Element. An steam workshop also? All I can say is beam me up Scotty, we can do it Captain this time we have the power.\n\nTL;DR: Game good. Combat fun. RPG Loot Funsies. Space much of. Do lots o' stuff. Very shiny graphs. Much impressed. You should buy it too.","September 27, 2014","true","68.9"," 395 of 439 people (90%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","90","395","439","42","7"

Its been years since these games were released and perhaps, for you, just like me, they left behind a massive void. I've leapt at EVERY space sim/rpg that been released in the hopes, that one day, they'll replace what I lost with Freelancer. Sadly they never did. So I saw this on the front page of Steam and thought, heres another disapointment. Well Starpoint Gemini 2...blew me away. This game is THE best space sim I've ever played and its in beta!!\n\nBeta will always be beta, that said, this game is solid. When you read the description and see theres only a dozen planets, don't be fooled. The galaxy is ♥♥♥♥ing huge. Absolutely enormous. Open world to boot. No loading screens. Just you, your ship and the stars. There are some absolutely amazing locations, zipping through asteroids, cruising the nebulas...its awesome.\n\nTheres a diverse choice of ships for you to cruise the stars with. Gunships, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Freighters and freightliners. Each ship category has multiple choices and each of those choices allows you to build your ship in the fashion you want. Do you want a ship decked with heavy batteries, rain missiles and torpedos down on people. Do you want a majority of light batterries, decking your ship with railguns, beams or plasma cannons? Perhaps a ship that can deploy a large number of soldiers to board the enemy ship and take it over. Yea, you read that right. You can board an enemy ship, take it over and either destroy, loot it or sell it.\n\nPerhaps the trade life is for you, with a vast hold and fast engines to shoot you away from the pesky gunships. Trade hasn't been completely implemented atm. In Freelancer if you remember, you could see what planets were buying what for what price etc etc. That hasn't been implemented yet so you have to find them yourself. Perhaps your a miner at heart and want to reap the profits from those floating rocks. Go right ahead, blast away. If you want a huge yield you can buy missiles especially dedicated to obtaining larger yields.\n\nYou can tailor your ship to fulfil what ever role you require. If you need more energy to fire you weapons, buy system attachments and upgrades to improve their energy reserves and recharge rates. Missing that little gunship too much, you can increase their accuracy or their damage against their shields. You can hack the enermy ship and disable their systems if thats the approach you like. You choose a career role. Each role has various abiliies for use that augment your fleet, turrets, shields, movement and various other cool things. Yea, thats right. You can build your own fleet to travel around the galaxy with you.\nSounds perfect for a bounty hunter right? Your going to need it to tackle the toughest bounties in the galaxy. You track the bounties yourself and take them down. Be warned though, they aren't alone and they're prepared to fight.\n\nSeriously guys, I can't praise this game enough for what its doing. Yea, theres only free roam available atm but you can do WHAT EVER you want. Want to be a pirate, theres a huge array of choices for you and they're everywhere. You want to own your own carrier and deploy fighter wings, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING CAN!!! THIS GAME IS IN BETA and despite that, you can do soo damn much. I've crashed twice and that was in the first 2 hrs, since then, I haven't had a single problem. The galaxy is yours for that taking atm. I highly reccomend this game to all Freelancer, Privateer and Wing Commander fanatics. Even to those who are new to the scene. This game is so diverse and intricate in all its details...but god damn its so easy and simple to understand and master.\nThis game is in on-going development, if its this good already, I can't wait till its finished!!","April 27, 2014","true","20.4"," 243 of 262 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","243","262","0","13"

It was a great learning experience for them and it paved the way for their next game - Starpoint Gemini 2, the sequel. It entered Steam Early Access program in September 2013, and a year later after what most would consider one of the best Early Access communities on Steam, Starpoint Gemini 2 hit the shelves on Steam in Sep 26, 2014.\n\nOn a personal note, I was honored to have been with such an amazing community. Both players and the Developers worked together so well that I myself strongly believe it was the best early access game on Steam! I made many friends and I truly enjoyed the journey...\n\n======================================\n\nPros	+Huge dynamic game world that can be explored as a whole!\n+Can play the story campaign or go free roam sandbox style.\n+Workshop with plenty of cool mods.\n+A ton of ships to fly and tweak!\n+Combat in big ships with fleets...\n+Did I say Mining? Yep, you can mine asteroids...\n+Very well done Faction system\n+You can Trade with a good amount of commodities\n+Developer support that sets a new standard\n+Best Community on Steam\n+Awesome Replay value!\n+Free content updates\n\nConsNone really. Yea, the game is THAT good :-)\n\nNeutral+/- Average voice-overs (This is a good thing to me)\n\n======================================\n\nIntroduction\nStarpoint Gemini 2 is an action space-sim combined with diverse RPG elements. Control various space ships, ranging from small and agile gunships to lumbering, but deadly carriers. Explore, trade, mine asteroids, and research in a star system no longer hindered by loading points. The entire Gemini star system is now one giant area thanks to the implemented streaming technology. Gain experience and upgrade your skills to change the tide of even the fiercest space battles. Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system with skills and perks to customize as you see fit. This also gives great replay value, you can literally spend many many hours just trying different styles...\n\n======================================\n\nGame-play\nI have played EVE online, Elite Dangerous, and lots of other games in the space genre. Out of every space game in my Steam library, this is the one that keeps me coming back for more. Deep, immersive, beautiful. It is the perfect open space sandbox game. To elaborate, yes there is a story campaign mode that will guide you through the lore of the game. It does this via story-missions, in-fact at the start of a new game you can choose to play campaign or free roam(sandbox). A great feature is that even in the campaign you can do the story missions at your own pace. There is a great many of freelance and side missions.\n\nI played the first Starpoint Gemini so I was going into this quite excited, but you don’t have to play the original in order to enjoy this sequel anyway(They made the first one playable with the free DLC Starpoint Gemini 2: Origins). It is a space game all about exploring, mining asteroids, trading, capturing, and flying multiple ships and getting lost in a massive dynamic universe. It is the kind of space game I love to get lost in for long periods of time just roaming through space and immersing myself into the game world. This game certainly provides many ways to do it, such as gearing up a ship to go on a mining run. There is so much to do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. (But in a good way)\n\nWhen you first launch the game, you will be introduced with tutorial tip screens. These can, of course, be ignored, but I would strongly advise that you read everyone of them. The interface can be quite complex and there is many ways you can customize the ships so no need to go in blind by turning off the Tips!. You want to survive for more than ten minutes in space for your first captain. There is another matter I would like to clear up as well, this game is not EVE Online or Elite: Dangerous. It is a unique tactical space sim with exploration and missions. Many people including the Dev's would say that it is more comparable to Freelancer in all the good ways...\n\nMastering the ship controls is not that easy at first, because there are a number of ways to view the action. There is the turret view which allows you to swing around the ship so you can track everything around your vessel, the mounted view which puts you just above the ship, and a third person view which puts you just behind the ship. All of them have their own advantages depending on the situation you may be in and half the battle is understanding when to use which view. It takes practice to master this when the combat gets hectic and you need to start switching rapidly between them. As ships have location based shields, being aware of what is attacking (and from where) can be the difference between life and death.\n\nThis game really shines at immersing you into the life of a deep space merchant, miner, pirate, or whatever you prefer! There are so many options and the awesome guys at LGM have done a great job at making every path fun and viable. There is a ton of customization to help you really fill the role you choose as well. I personally spent several hours just looking at my options the first time I leveled up. Any hardcore RPG fan will have a ton of fun just building and tweaking their character and ship into their very own ultimate space hero... Or a feared pirate. So just let your imagination run wild.\n\nI mentioned customization earlier and this game has a ton of it. You can hire staff for your ship which affects its performance: For example, you might hire a crew member who increases your propulsion speeds. You have complete control over your equipment load-out and their enhancements. You can even customize the look of your ship to some degree. All of this is generally handled when you anchor yourself to a space station or planet. While docked, in addition you can buy and sell trade goods, read news clips, access a garage which houses your ships, and more. It sounds like a lot to deal with, but between all the tutorials, which are accessible at any time for reference, and the well-designed interface, you’ll have your hands around it in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n======================================\n======================================\n\nConclusion\nStarpoint Gemini 2 is a game for space lovers made by space lovers. This is by far one of the best open space games I played and it will delight you with its gorgeous visuals. There is a true sense of adventure as you discover new areas of the star chart, with opportunity and danger lurking around every corner so you are constantly encouraged to build yourself up in terms of power, wealth, and relationships with the various factions.\n\nLGM and its great team have created an instant classic that will be around for many years....\n\n======================================","November 18, 2013","true","84.8"," 256 of 284 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","256","284","0","25"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sVoxxx/recommended/236150/","sVoxxx","supersixty vox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sVoxxx/","212 products in account","I have been playing SG2 since EA (with many breaks in between...) and it is one of my favorite games in a long time. I've had a hard time getting into Elite, and SC is a long way out, but SG2 has filled the void admirably. I always loved space games and the WC/Privateer/Freespace trinity is pretty much my past.\n\nPROS:\n\n++ Best community on Steam. I own a lot of games and visit nearly all the forums - but this one is the best. Devs are active, the community is friendly and helpful, and some of it is satisfyingly weird (meep...) meep. MEEP.\n\n++ It's not overly complex. Which doesn't mean it's simple or dumbed down - it just means that you can jump right in and have a great time exploring space.\n\n++ Combat sequences can be exhilarating! I've been in many skirmishes that could have gone either way, frantically deploying sinks and coming around to line turrets up to open fire. Enemies coming in at all angles and PTE disrupted...\n\n++ With just a couple of mods (skyboxes and nebulas) the game can be breathtaking visually. I play with the lights off and the surround on and it is very easy to get lost in the moment.\n\n++ It's just fun. You can do a lot of different things with it and have a great time doing them. The voice acting is infamously fun bad, and the story is a kind of canned - but who cares, it's fun running through it all.\n\n++ Ultrawide!!! 3440x1440 - no problem and gorgeous!\n\nCONS:\n\n++ The economy is kind of not really there at all. I wanted to be a trader but the derelict mechanic made it more profitable and efficient to be a bad ♥♥♥ with scavenger bots. Which is kind of too bad, but it is what it is.\n\n++ Playing the campaign like it is freeplay means you will be so OP that every enemy the campaign throws at you will be trivial to weak. Wish there was more scaling here, but it's not so bad to destroy waves of ships with out much thought because you outclass them by a mile.\n\n++ The UI is kind of crap and it's all raster so you can't mod it out to be better.\n\n++ Once you've played for a while, you start to realize that there isn't enough ship variance to keep it interesting. Some ships are clearly better than others, and you just sort of play the game out with that ship until the next tier - and its obvious captain, become available to you.\n\nI give this game an honest 10/10, even with the cons because it is a space game that you really can fall into. It really only asks for your time and patience - and doesn't require twitch muscles to play at a high level. The fire at will mechanic is great for it's tactical benefit, and for me I like to think about positioning in the large scale battles, rather than target/fire and positioning. To some it might seem like an "easy button" but for me it really makes the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cobaltdragoon/recommended/236150/","cobaltdragoon","Cobalt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cobaltdragoon/","34 products in account","SHORT SUMMARY:\nStarpoint Gemini 2 is a bit shallow and a bit pricey for what it offers, but it is still enjoyable. Overall the story was okay enough to keep me going, and the combat was fun enough to make my stay in Gemini enjoyable. If you are itching for a space sim that is pretty easy to get into and doesn't require a large time commitment to win (around 24 in-game hours for me), this will scratch that itch pretty well. Otherwise, you may want to think carefully on buying this game unless it's on sale.\n\nHowever, the developers appear to be actively working on improvements to the game as time goes on. Some concerns raised in this article may be addressed as time goes on. Keep an eye on the updates page if you're interested in this product!\n----------\nLONGER REVIEW:\n\nThe good:\n\nVisuals are nice, music is nice, starship aesthetics are good too, and the combat is solid. The universe feels big, and provides a pretty immersive experience of traveling through space. Said universe is also populated by various starships as well, usually around space stations and various other miscellaneous space structures. There are many different factions that like to use certain types of ships and lay claim to different areas of space, and you can easily see heated space battles taking place at faction borders. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but is pretty nice once you learn it.\n\nThe game itself is a bit grindy as it uses RPG levelling mechanics to determine what ship you can pilot, but I personally didn't mind it that much since the combat was pretty fun.\n\nThe not-so-good:\n\nThe story is okay. The Voice Acting for the story dialogue ranges from terrible to okay.\n\nSide-story missions boil down to "repair structure there for $$$ and XP" or "kill enemies here for $$$ and XP" or "ferry person over there for $$$ and XP" with little fanfare. After you finish the main story, all you can do are the missions described earlier.\n\nDuring the main story, certain factions and places will be purportedly destroyed or crippled, but what this actually means is that you will just pretend that the story happened while in practice the universe remains largely intact and unchanged.\n\nCertain mechanics are a bit shallow (i.e. hiring crew = looking up which dude/gal has which bonuses, click hire button). Also, while you *can* be a merchant or asteroid miner in this game, it seems to be much eaiser just to capture enemy ships and tow them back to a planet/station where you can sell them.\n\nCharacter progression is RPG-like, yet character skills/perks can pretty much be ignored. Your character's power is MUCH more dependent on what type of ship you are piloting and how well it is outfitted. The RPG mechanics are more akin to a gating system, where your level determines the type of ship you can pilot.\n\nFor me, the entire game was a bit grindy. This was how it went down: capture/sell ships until I can afford the next weight class of ship, do missions (sometimes main storyline) so I can meet the level requirement of said ship. Repeat until I have achieved highest class of ship.\n\n\n\n------\nLong segment about what I would have liked to have seen in the game:\nMultiple plotlines in the game.\n\nThe "Escape Velocity" series of games (plot-heavy 2D shooter space-sim) implemented this rather well; there were multiple plotlines for each main faction AND there were also a lot of side plotlines too.\n\nExamples of side-plots: testing prototype weapons for a starship arms company, or ferrying vacationing CEOs to a jungle planet for big game hunting, or helping a rockstar go on tour throughout the galaxy only to discover that he's a robot! Or picking up a random stranger and ferrying him to a planet only to discover that he's a leader of a small sect of colonists who are trying to resist pirate incursions, and he implores you to help them with their plight since the Powers That Be in the universe are far too busy (or corrupt) to deal with the pirates.\n\nI didn't just do these missions for cash, but to see the story unfolded; to see how these characters reacted to these sometimes tragic events in their lives, and how they would deal with it.\n\nI think it's good to have a big Main Storyline as the main attraction, but there's plenty of room in Gemini for smaller guys with fascinating struggles and dramas in their own lives that an aspiring starship captain can be a part of.\n\nBeing able to hail and talk to other ships and planets.\n\nYou don't need to have dialogue trees for every one. But it'd be nice to be able to beg for mercy from a pirate and buy him off with credits, or just say hi to random ships and planets. In this vein, they'd also have a message for when you greet them, with each faction having a different way of talking to you. Perhaps even with a random pool of different types of responses from each faction that vary in tone depending on your standing with them? This is a bit small, but I think it would help with game immersion.\n\nThe ships, planets, and space stations could use more flavor text.\n\nThough it might seem like a huge hassle to write up descriptions for every space station/planet/starship, you can build an EXTREMELY immersive narrative with these and make the game feel alive. Again, the "Escape Velocity" game series (mostly Escape Velocity Override and Escape Velocity Nova) used flavor texts/descriptions to great effect.\n\nWhy is this station in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by hostile space? Are they revolutionaries or sympathizers with another faction, or are they just badasses? Why is this Frigate cheaper than this other one? Oh, the company that manufactures this one wanted to push out a model to get an edge over their hated rival company who was taking their sweet time with their own model. Hey, this Corvette saved an entire company from the brink of bankruptcy! This Carrier design looks like a UFO because of a revolutionary new frame that allows for rapid fighter launching while providing overlapping fields of fire from all of its turret batteries? Cool. This Dreadnought looks like a eldritch abomination because their designers desperately welded a lot of spare parts together and accidentally created a ship that could challenge all previous starship design conventions? Neat!\n\nPlanets and some space stations presently have short descriptions with a little flavor text. But it doesn't help that these blurbs are only accessible via starmap. When a player is on the starmap, their first instinct is not to click "info" and read; they want to get somewhere quick. I think it would have been better if you saw the write-up in an unobtrusive static text box on the bottom of the screen. This provides incentive for an exploration-oriented player to land/dock on every planet/station that they find so they can see the little blurb there. These descriptions can really flesh out the factions and gives you an idea of why they exist and how they conduct themselves (i.e. how they treat citizens, local planetary economic problems, policy problems, military actions, natural disasters, etc.).\n\nOverall, more flavor text would be nice so that the universe that the player travels in would feel more alive.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to have an in-game chart of which ranks correspond to player level.","November 5, 2014","true","33.8"," 171 of 183 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","171","183","0","3"

Even then, I rarely ever use them.\n\nCrew members do not have special abilities, but rather only bonuses.  A single slot for a special crew member.  Assuming only one special member exists in the game and is almost impossible to gain because the blueprint takes 20.\n\nBlueprints are super difficult to find, but very rewarding IF you ever complete them before becoming near god strength already.  I completed one for a nice fighter hangar jet, but the rest remain far out of reach while I am practically invincible with all the best enhancements and warship.\n\nThe only truly useful weapons in the game are rail guns and maybe missiles.  I say maybe missiles because they are only really useful if the shields are already down and rail guns can usually take care of it anyway.  Lasers are useless.  Plasma is too slow to be useful except for mining.\n\nLevel 70 bounties are easy kills for a level 50 that has a good battleship with maximum upgrades.  I think I may have beaten one with the next class down at a lower level too because you can stay behind them and they cannot fire back.\n\nTravelling outside the known universe area leads to infinite enemies and loss of whereabouts on the map.  Travelling too close to the sun does the same thing except enemies will start to randomly die from heat damage.\n\nCannot see what is on a captured ship until it is transferred to the garage and crew is transferred as well.  Crew losses will occur if the captured ship has less.\n\nThere are three kinds of heavy weapons, but I failed to see any real difference in shockwave damage.\n\nExploding ships nearby do no damage.\n\nHas lag and slowdowns most of the time.\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n\nMake traveling without gates a little faster when in full engine mode.\n\nMake some artifacts that last indefinitely / bonuses or useables that fit in equipment slots.\n\nChange the decimal enhancement descriptions, eg. 0.5, with percentage values, eg. 50%.\n\nPlease fix weapon range.  Bonuses are not being counted.\n\nAdd a barrier on the edge of the map to prevent getting lost in the void.\n\nGive a warning for pending heat damage when getting close to stars.\n\nShow radiation areas on the map.\n\nShow map sections that are partially visible on the edges of the map.\n\nAllow transfer of weapons and cargo from ships in the garage without transferring crew.\n\nMake plasma weapons hurt shields more, but damage hull less.\n\nMake lasers damage both shields and hull with shield punchthrough for damaging systems.\n\nMake railguns work best on hull, and less on shields.\n\nDo a similar rock paper scissors with heavy weapons.\n\nFix the pathfinding.\n\nImprove AI for wanted bounties.","November 17, 2014","true","55.3"," 186 of 205 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","186","205","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HoboElf/recommended/236150/","HoboElf","Hobo Elf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HoboElf/","370 products in account","My initial reaction to the game was "Wow, this looks like a massive sandbox space sim! Just look at how big the area map is and how many factions there are. I'll be playing the game for tens of hours!"\n\nWell, after a while I started to realize the game had lots of problems with being a LOT more shallow than what it promises at first. Setting aside the optimization issues and how easily the game can be prone to crashing, It boasts and impressive ~50 factions with a reputation system that ended up being nothing more than a glorified Good / Evil alignment system. If you do missions given out by the good factions you get +rep and they will be friendly to you an the evil ones will be hostile. Vice versa you do missions given to you by the bad guys and your rep shifts to their side making them friendly to you. Unfortunately that is as deep as the faction system goes. Factions don't change opinions as they are completely static.\n\nThe static factions leads me to the next problem. The whole world is static. There is absolutely NO sim element in this game to speak of. The game has NO economy, NO dynamic factions, NO dynamic world events. When we speak of sandbox you think of open worlds with things to do in them, but all it is here is the same map as the campaign, just without the campaign missions. Since the game lacks an economy and dynamic factions it makes trading all but a dull and soulless experience. Also, since the world isn't dynamic, there is no real territory control for the factions either. I mean they have their own territories, but they are completely set in stone. You cannot capture territories for the differenct factions. This leaves you with the same Assassination, Taxi, Cargo ferry and Repair missions to grind over and over and over again.\n\nHow is the combat then if the other aspects are non-existant and hollow? Well, the combat is rather decent, but what kills it for me is how the game is level scaled. Each time you level up so do your enemies. After certain points their ships get upgraded. If you do like me and other people may have done and only grinded missions for money and XP you'll quickly find yourself in a situation where you don't have enough money to upgrade your ship but you are starting to be too weak to do missions and half the time you simply have to turn around and go away since the RNG pitted you against enemies that simply outclass you. This can be avoided if you salvage derelict ships for parts or capture them and sell them, but then it means that the level scaling system is balanced if you play in a certain way which is horrible, horrible balance in a game that claims to be a sandbox. Simply put if you aren't maximizing your money gains per level then you'll find yourself running into some issues.\n\nIt just isn't a good game in the end of the day, and it certainly is no sim either, which is what I was lead to believe. There are no simulations happening behind the scenes, everything is static. The game is hardly an open world sandbox either. It seems to be a loose term that gets thrown around a lot these days. It's a sandbox world if all you had was the big open box without any of the sand in it to be shaped and sculpted by your hands. The game COULD be good, because the flying around, the skill system, the ships, the combat etc. feel good and are fun, but the content within the world is non-existant, unless you want to count repeating Kill X (Assassination and Rescue missions but both work the same. In rescue missions it means that you have to save an NPC ship, but so far they have served as reliable allies that help me take down the enemy ship faster rather than someone who needs help), Fetch Y (there is fetching and delivering cargo and serving as a taxi for VIP, but it works the same mechanically for either mission type so it's only different by name) and Repair Z (there's also Scanning anomalies as missions, but mechanically it works the exact same way as repairing so there is no real difference here either) missions as robustful content.","September 30, 2014","false","8.3"," 196 of 241 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","196","241","4","13"

Seriously, if you want EO you’ll need to go log into EO. There is no online multiplayer, no gate camping players, no griefers and no gankers.\nThat being said, this game offers something EO and many others, online or not, have simply forgotten or just don’t care about. Interactive Devs.\nYep, you read that correctly. The Devs are extremely active in the forums. I’d hazard a guess and say 99% of all issues, questions, comments etc. are answered near instantly.\nThey take concerns very seriously and look for ways to address them as quickly as possible, faster even it seems.\nWhile this isn’t to say other Devs aren’t around, personal experience has shown they just don’t answer, are too busy, don’t care and on more than one occasion… are downright obnoxious and rude.\n\nSo +1 for Dev support seemingly 24hrs a day every day…\n\nCommunity… holy crap, where to begin…\n\nThere are a lot of helpful people. One or two I have noticed try to step in when the Devs FINALLY get some sleep. This doesn’t mean there aren’t more filling in those roles, only that I can’t read, re-read, and re-re-read each and every post over and over to see who is filling those roles. Though, I will admit, sometimes the forum reading is an exercise in hilarity.\nSerious questions for the most part get serious answers. Once in a while they spiral out of control with loose jokes, odd references and such, though more or less after the issue has been handled.\nRemember the active Devs from earlier? Yeah… they contribute too.\nDon’t be surprised to find one or more of them plowing into your thread to partake of whatever silliness is afoot. Oh yes, my friend, they are characters indeed.\nOn the whole, the community is developing into a large group of knowledgeable friendly people looking to help out any way they can. Yes, some can be offended easily, but I have yet to see an all-out flame war like everywhere else. In fact, most people just apologize if they upset someone and move on, including myself.\n\nSo +1 for a truly friendly and helpful community.\n\nGraphics…\nNothing that will stress your system too terribly. High end or low end, it seems everyone can find a setting that fits the bill and allows them to play. I have seen one or two instances where certain systems (read Laptops) refuse to allow the game to run, but I have yet to see more than those.\nEven then, the Devs are still trying to figure out how to get it working on those couple of problem machines. Interesting, since most would just tell you that your system doesn’t have what it takes and to go get something bigger.\nAll in all, the graphics are very nice indeed. Nothing mottled, disjointed or misaligned. No missing pixels here and there or stand in objects for missing items.\n\nSo +1 there for that…\n\nNPC’s…\nWhat do you expect? They are NPC’s. They shoot at you, they kill you and they keep doing it. Unless you kill them first, in which case, they die rather well and don’t whine about it. I seem to remember an account of griefing done by NPC’s, though I believe that was a one-off. Funny though.\nThey get tougher as you progress through the game. Different levels, different types and different areas. They fight each other if they are opposing factions and will turn on you if you are low enough rep with one, or both. In which case, run.\n\nSo I give a +1 for good NPC mechanics.\n\nMissions…\nLots of them. They are everywhere in both aspects of the game. Free play or Story line there are tons. Decent rewards for the time invested as far as I can tell, probably a bit too decent considering some missions you just have to click a button and repair something.\n\nI’ll give a +1 here too.\n\nStoryline…\nFor as much as I have done, it progresses well. Seems to have substance and a bit of plot for as far as I have gotten.\nBut…\nIt is buggy. Missions sometimes fail out. Sometimes you overshoot a zone and they get canceled, dropping you out of the storyline and into free play mode. Other times, you just crash out of the game.\nThey are working on the bugs as fast as they are made aware of them and that helps out a lot. More often than not, you can just reload from a save point and try to continue.\n\nNo points for this one, still needs work.\n\nMods…\n\nThere are more than a few. Something for everyone I suppose. Uber ship, got it. More money, got it. Star Trek themed ships, go those too.\nFrom Star Trek to vastly improve (overpowered) beginning station inventories, there is something to fit most everyone.\nThe game has a mod community growing faster than the game itself. Even at least one mod I saw that will completely change the game to Mass Effect themed ships and even a new storyline that appears to be in the works.\nThe Devs seem to support unlimited, no holds barred modding.\n\nSo definitely +1 here.\n\nOh, lest I forget...\n\nCommunity input...\n\nLook in the game. Look at achievements and improvements. You will see all the signs of active community involvement that has been taken seriously. (mostly)\n\nYeah, +100 and some Oreos for all you community peoples that report bugs, request content changes and overall general improvements.\n\nAll in all, for me, this has been one hell of a ride… and it’s just beginning. The game is only getting better and more is on the way.\nIf you’re on the fence, get off it. Buy the game and join the fun in the community.\n\nAnd the insanity? Glad you asked...\n\nThere are the elite few who can claim this. They watch you at home while you play. They see you in your boxers. They wear your boxers, like I am right now. The Devs are part of this group, I know one, whom I shall leave nameless, who has watched me in my boxers. Yes, some of us are insane... And that is the fun of it all.\n\nSincerely,\nVirikas\n\nP.S. +1000 to the Devs for allowing us to be insane, taking us seriously when needed and for being on top of everything, everywhere, all at once, every day... always.\n\nNow... which one of you took my boxers, Meep.","September 27, 2014","true","16.4"," 127 of 151 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","127","151","7","2"

The longer I played it, the less I liked it.\n\nWhen it started, it took me back to the wonder of games like Privateer.  Sandbox, big galaxy, lots of options.  And it's really gorgeous, from the ships to the planets to the nebulous backgrounds.  Some of space stations look oddly low-res compared to everything else, but that's minor.\n\nHowever, things went downhill when I started to follow the main story campaign.  The voice acting is truly atrocious, and the writing isn't much better, from the minor (bad grammar) to the median (dialogue) to the major (an incoherent plot with characters whose motives don't seem to correspond to events).  And when you get to a more difficult mission that you have to try several times, the lack of any button to skip the dialogue becomes truly unforgivable.\n\nSpeaking of retrying, there are several design decisions that make sense on their own, but quickly become annoying when you have to replay a mission because it's difficult or bugged (like the infamous mothership mission).  First, you can save only at stations or planets.  OK, there's a sort of 'realism' sense to that.  Second, there's a lot of empty space between points of interest.  That actually worked for me at first, because it added to the sense of scale and exploration.  But when you have to retry a mission and reload to find you are about a 5 minute cruise from the action -- and then remember that you'll have to sit through 3 more minutes of unskippable community theatre auditions when you get there -- it gets really difficult to stick with it for the next attempt.\n\nThere were also a number of minor annoyances, like the fact that missions seem to get reset when you load a game (so if you pick up someone or something to deliver, you must do it before you end your current session or forever have that passenger or item in your non-cargo inventory), some inscrutable elements, several mechanics that seemed incomplete, and a handful of crash bugs.\n\nI think there are the ingredients of a good game here, with a good core and beautiful graphics, but the lore side of things really lets those elements down.  Perhaps the best strategy would be to ignore the story and play only in sandbox mode.","December 5, 2015","true","67.8"," 95 of 110 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","95","110","12","2"

Here is why:\n\n1. Unengaging story\n\nThe story consists of a lot of text (white on color, not very legible) and really really atrocious voice acting (which sometimes just cuts out). There are so many factions with text descriptions I did not bother to read all of them. Honestly I did not understand half of it because I have not played the predecessor. The game did not present its universe in an engaging way.\n\n2. Simple missions\n\nThe free missions are all randomly generated but they consist  of either go to A and kill / capture or go to A and scan / repair (same menu button) or go to A and transport to B.\n\nThe campaign missions are the same. Go to A and usually kill everything there...done. Sometimes you need to ferry stuff. But the whole involvement is detached. You arrive...the game cuts to sequence and some voice acting..suddenly to reappear with enemies around...you kill them...cut to the next short scene...done. There is no drama, no real action, no emotional involvment. I did not respond emotionally to the characters, who are just pictures with horrible accents.\n\nTrading and mining is a horrible grind if you like it. It is certainly helpful in the beginning but not worth your time later on. Just take the "kill pirates" mission and blast everything to hell.\n\nOnce I got capturing ships down...I had so much money I could have bought ships that were not yet unlocked for my character level.\n\n3. Simple combat\n\nUsually you fly somewhere, click F for "Fire at will" and maneuver a bit around. There is not much strategy involved. Starfleet Command or Space Empires Starfury had more interesting combat. Manal aiming is cumbersome because you can't really see the ships at longer ranges and there is no help with aiming. Due to the turret placement your shots might not go where your reticle is...so automatic fire it is most of the time.\n\nAlso medium difficulty is way to easy. I had a destroyer that could easily defeat a dreadnought without breaking a sweat (loosing shields).\n\n4. technical stuff\n\nAlthough the combat is in 3D the star sector is actually in 2D. The map is in 2D. You can fly "up" and "down" but it feels like all planets and stations are on the same plane. It is not a globe but rather a "thick" square.\n\nFlying around especially in the beginning is tedious because jumpdrives or jumpgates are way too expensive and when you have the money to buy jumps you can get a perk that allows you free use of the jump gate system.\n\n\nAfter about 10 hours the game just felt like a grind to get better ships and more weapons and do all the story missions (usually just killing enemies). It simply got boring.\n\nYou can watch a few missions to make up your own mind:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/r06mDczfimk?list=PLAnrJURskPRuT6nCDyAkWZicXzYemOJMA","July 22, 2015","false","18.4"," 236 of 320 people (74%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","74","236","320","14","13"

Felt like Privateer 2 without the cutscenes and sadly missing Clive Owen with Christopher Walkins :-( Freelancer should've been more like this. SG2 is a lot more open world than Freelancer which has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I found it purely an advantage. Unlike Privateer 2 and Freelancer you can truly just be a merchant if you want and switch effortlessly to being a badass kill everything murder ship at any space station/planet. Sometimes it's just the little things that make you happy... The graphics are great, the music not annoying, the abundance/ease of quickly accepting missions is a serious plus, and most importantly the flexibility of the game to allow someone the ability to play  the game how they want w/out the need of trainers, cheat codes, or cheat engine.\nJust like in the real world there are easy ways to make a quick buck with minimal returns or riskier methods that garnish heavy monetary rewards. I love that this game isn't afraid to make the playing field drastically uneven when it comes to rewards. Harder, almost always (there are times you get lucky/learn to exploit advantageous situations), means greater rewards! Learning the in game market is very beneficial. But it gets better, should you disagree w/me all you have to do is download any of the many mods and change how the game mechanics work. This game is a literal win-win. Small minor bonus pluses that I think are worth mentioning are; 1.) Achievements actually give you in game bonuses 2.) Blueprints that give better stuff that can't be bought 3.) Bounty hunting ( this is a mixed bag. this system could better implemented but I'll be damned if i didn't end up hunting everyone down!) 4.) Buying of certificates/licenses (w/game money and not real money) that give-in game bonuses for no other reason but to make the game fun (personally, I think it could have been better implemented but I sure as ♥♥♥♥ was excited to find a new one!). 5.) A good array of ships to pick from (potentially unlimited if you count mods... Just saying...) 6.) Personally, I found the system upgrade gimmick confusing at 1st but once understood, it opens the door to a lot of options that becomes unlimited if you include modding (just saying...).\nNo game is perfect and this one isn't either. This is the disadvantage section of SG2. SG2 has some pretty poor optimization problems. 4-5 years ago my PC was a champ so it's aged a bit meow. Still, w/the level of graphics/visuals/objects it should run better. Especially since the video/graphics adjustment is bugged/non-functional. It's only a moderate complaint because the game allows mods and several are designed to reduce the toll taken on your PC. The rest of the comaplaints are mild at best because all are easily adjusted w/mods or are drastically overshadowed by the game's massive, bulging, make you scream in your pillow as you take it awesomeness so here goes- 1.) The voicovers are almost all a joke. They're done w/the stalest emotion possible. 2.) The story is kinda flat. Open ended games are prone to this a lot so it obviousley shouldn't be a huge unseen problem here. The game brings up interesting things here and there so kudos for the Devs for trying but it is still kinda... ummm... blah most of the time (kudos for the DEVs for doing such a good job to make the game so fun I really didn't care!)\n\nIn short, my complaints are minimal at best and I had countless hours of fun playing it. I found it quick and easy to learn and SG2 left a lot of options for me to explore for future play throughs. I can't ask a game to do more than that but w/mods this game could be literally different everytime I played. I got it on sale and felt like I stole something. I would have happily paid full price and been more than content. This game is awesome, WOOF!","November 28, 2014","true","86.5"," 76 of 89 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","76","89","3","0"

It's like asking if Diablo 3 is like Skyrim - they simply can't be compared fairly. The only thing in common between this game and the game you want to compare to is just that the action takes place in "space". How it makes the gameplay fun is different from the one you want to compare to.\n\nIf you want to ask "Does it have <this feature> like <the other game you want to compare to>?", don't. Go back and read my previous comment.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that this game feels like an RPG more than a Space Combat game. There is a story. You upgrade your weapons and armour. You kill your enemies and loot their corpses (derelict wrecks). You use what is better than yours and you sell what is not. See? Just like an RPG.\n\nYou can do some trading, but I don't concentrate on it like I would have in X or Elite Dangerous.

Does it make you want to see what happens next?\n\nThe answer is YES for me.","October 1, 2014","true","35.1"," 65 of 79 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","65","79","0","0"

Docking at stations and visiting stations is one of the most disappointing events I ever encountered in a space game. There is no radio chatter, no clearance for docking; you never hear anybody over radio nor do you see more than one or two ships (even near well populated planets!). This game feels so incredibly dead and empty, that travelling and exploring just simply isn't any fun at all. It all feels so static. Add to that that planets and stations you visit are not animated but all just have a static, bland screensaver in the background of dull buying menues. There are no bars or other places that give you the feeling of really setting a foot on a place. Rather it all feels so incredibly generic and it doesn't get better if you add the boring "go there and kill pirate x"-missions that we all have seen way too often now.\n\nThis game is nowhere near Freelancer and if you look for something like that, you will most likely be as disappointed as I am.

There are similar mechanics: do some basic trading, have a ship...\n\nTBH it is a bit of a disappointment after the hype you hear about it from fans. To be really blunt in its current state I think this is a $10 max game. It feels a bit like it would be a good iOS space game, but as yet isn't a good PC space game. It needs an additional layer of depth and polish to become anything more than average. I'm playing it a bit but it's mostly as a time filler and because its a pretty massive grind to get anywhere (which I assume covers for a lack of content).\n\nThe forums seem to be an unadulterated love fest for this game and that was one of the main things that swayed me, but it's fairly average so far. I think it has something to do with the developers being active on the forums, big-upping anyone that says anything positive. Will update this review if my opinion changes, but I have a pretty good picture of the core dynamics: capture till you get a bigger ship, capture till you get a bigger ship until you get the biggest ship. Do really boring missions until you get your rank up. Otherwise you might do the really boring version of trading or mining (compared to other games).\n\n\nTHE BAD Tutorial and the campaign to date are pretty bad and unengaging (I kinda know what I'm doing but just don't care).\nVisuals are mediocre, although the ship art is okay.\nUniverse feels empty in a bad way.\nVoice acting in the plot is amateur.\nYou can only save in certain places which is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ (there are some lackluster excuses about this)\nCombat seems fairly one dimensional\nRPG elements are lighter than I expected (4 skills that you level, and some perks)\nCrew are just stats bonuses\nTrading economy and mining seem extremely basic\nOverall I think a game like Starsector has far more RPG depth.\n\nTHE GOOD...You can customise ship colours, decals, and names so we can all call our ship Stormbringer, however, I haven't tried naming one Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath - it might be possible.\n\nThe cosmetic stuff like naming the ships and changing colours seems to be my high point so far.

With a lot of potential.\n\nSecondary impressions: It's an acquired taste. It does grow on you. But it's lopsided. Strong gameplay props up a (very) weak campaign.\n\n\nInitial review:\n\nThis game may be out of early access, but do not be fooled. This is NOT a finished product. Not even close. It is sorely lacking in decent voice acting, and the campaign hangs together by the thinnest of threads, and liberal deus ex machina. Frequently you will look at the screen in confusion and ask "Who is that? What is happening? Why am I supposed to do this?" The game approaches storytelling in a very basic, almost childish way.\n\nEven in my short time in the game, I have already encountered several borderline-gamebreaking bugs. Such as non-functional campaign triggers. And equally game-breaking, though no bug, is the games tendency to assume the player knows more that he does. This game needs a softer introduction, not to mechanics, but to world-building. As it is, it's a mess.\n\n\nI am giving the developer the benefit of doubt, and I will continue playing. I do believe there is a lot of enjoyable content to come. But "it gets better later" is not a defence that a genuinely good game would need.\nLet me put it like this: I am playing the game simply because it is the only game of its kind currently available. If it weren't for the fact that I have played Freelancer into the ground repeatedly, I would be playing that. It is a superior experience in every way.\n\nCurrently, I still regret spending money on this game. Therefore I am choosing not to recommend this game.\n\n\nUpdate #1:\n\nAfter a few more hours, I can only confirm my first impressions: I have absolutely no idea what is going on in the game, and my enjoyment of it suffers as a result. Time and time again, I am told I need to go to some place I don't know of, to meet a person I've never heard of, to get a thing which I know nothing about, for reasons that are never made clear. To call it frustrating is an understatement. The game is seemingly an unending series of unanswered questions. Primary among them: "Why am I doing this?"\n\nThis is not intentional mystery, this is just really, really bad writing.\n\nWhich is a damn, crying shame. Because the game itself, mechanics and graphics, are solid. Ish. A little shallow and clumsy, perhaps, but the closest I have come to Freelancer since Freelancer.\n\nI wish this game was better. But it isn't. I wish I could love this game. But I can't.\n\n\nI have given this game more than its fair share of chances. I have given it more than the benefit of doubt. I have acted on faith, on the belief and the hope, that this game "gets better". So far, this has proven to be wishful thinking.\n\nI'll research the Gemini universe, and see if that gives me enough points of reference to piece together just what the hell is going on in the game. Then I'll give the game one last chance to pull itself out of this confusing funk and make some damn sense.\n\n\nUpdate #2:\n\nThat helped a lot. A now have a fair grasp of what the game was assuming I knew by heart all along. It made the campaign bearable, though still not good by any measure. But at least I'm no longer tearing my hair out (as much) over the lack of proper world-building, exposition and adherence to storytelling 101.\n\nI still can't recommend the game, despite that I am now beginning to enjoy it. Chances are that you won't be as patient as I have been, and I fail to muster any decent arguments as to why you would wish to be.","September 26, 2014","false","20.4"," 116 of 171 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","116","171","0","4"

SPG2 brings back many memories of quite a few spaces games I have played since the mid 80's onwards.\n\n\nStar Point Gemini 2!\n\nDLC - Secrets of Aethera - Adds in new ships, new storyline arc, tweaks and updates to game systems.\n\nRiftways - Oh my, something to experience yourself! - Rollercoaster rides in Space.\n\nFighter wings for ships with hanger bays are a blast to play with.\n\n70 ships to buy/capture/destroy\n\nEquipment/Weapons that can be modified with enhancements\n\nCustomizable ship - Can re-color certain parts of your ship, add decals etc.\n\nConsumables - Shield boosters, damage boosters, repair nanobots, etc\n\nPower ups - Boost your Railgun damage, or Beam weapons etc for a few seconds to turn the tide in battle (Use them wisely though as they have a cool down for re-use)\n\nShip cloaking (Ships that have cloak devices) - A lot of fun with this one :)\n\nHero Characters to hunt down and kill for excellent credit reward. (You can kill a few of us Forum members now as Hero Characters! - Thanks to LGM's competition)\n\nGlobal events - More fun things to do outside of freelance missions etc.\n\nJunk yards - Cruise the junk yard like a junk yard dog looking for some possible cargo and or poor unsuspecting ships that might contain some nice cargo to liberate from them.\n\nTrade your wares in stations and planets that you either bought elsewhere or collected from combat or mining. (Price balancing to still be finalized)\n\nBoard and capture ships - Hire troopers and grapple a ship, send in the troops and take over that ship for some extra credits or to take as your own new ship.\n\nWorm Holes appear around the galaxy and can whip you to somewhere else in no time (Be warned you might turn up somewhere "You dont want to be")\n\nAI Security forces scan you ship for contraband and give you an option to dump it or duke it out (Pirates life for me, damn the pollice hehe)\n\nT-drives work as personal T-Gates to quickly jump to other areas very quickly (Same as using T-Gate, but on the spot usage, instead of finding a T-Gate)\n\nAbility to hanger (Personal hanger accessed via stations and planets) upto 5 ships, which you can swap out when needed. Have a freighter parked in your hanger when you want to do those big commodity runs for the big bucks, or some large scale asteroid mining. Drag out your carrier to go out and take on fleets of enemies with your weapons and your fighter wings.\n\nTravel the Galaxy map by normal engine power (I have done this and it takes quite some time - grab a coffee and some food), Power to engines (faster travel speed) or by Fast travel ways (Real fast movement across the galaxy)\n\nFreelance missions, Combat, repair, scan, VIP Courier, Cargo courier the list goes on.\n\nSteam Workshop - Mods are coming along and many more to come as modders get busy!\n\nDid I mention how bloody good the galaxy looks, Nebula's are amazing, Asteroid fields are real special (I like to play a pirate, so I like to hide in the dust clouds of some asteroid fields and wait for passing freighters/mining ships for some easy kills and loots. Junk yards look great, and just a reminder again don't run into them they not hurt hehe :)\n\nOh and Mod Tools,\nWant to add a new ship into game, can do!!\nWant to add new sectors into game, Can do!!\nWant to add anything virtually into game, can do!!!\n\nProbably the best thing of all about SPG2 is the Dev Team, These people are one of the best I have had the pleasure of enjoying an alpha/beta release with. They are always responding to members posts, questions, technical help, and ideas.\n\nThe Dev Team have even taken ideas from members and have put into game those ideas, what more can you ask for in a Dev Team who cares just as much for the player base as their game, that is simply priceless and a quality lacking in many AAA title Dev Teams.\n\nAll I can say is, "If you enjoy space gaming, Buy SPG2 today. You wont be disappointed"\n\nAnd drop by the official forums and say hello as well :)\n\nhttp://www.starpointgemini.com/forum\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/webferret - My Stream of SPG2 most nights 8PM AEST (GMT +9:30)","September 18, 2013","true","219.2"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","12"

However, there should be an emphasis on the word "adventure" more than action on this one.\n\nThere is story here, but I find the game play is slightly lacking. The idea of controlling a modify-able ship is awesome, especially with the ability to turn auto-firing and auto-pilot on and off - but I just find this game lacks a bit in depth. There is a lot to do, a lot of side missions, main missions are intriguing enough, but SG2 just fails to deliver amazing game play. Maybe it's because I'm playing with a controller, but I find from the stuff you can do in game to scanning or teleporting is not quite there. You cannot walk around space ports or your own ship which is really disappointing because what captain doesn't want to see what's going on - on his/her ship. I find myself always chasing new nav points and flying in circles and turning on auto-firing.\n\nI like the game, but enough to pass time or keep me busy. I do not think it's worth the stated price and recommended to buy on sale.\n\n\nRATING : 7/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	C+	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+","December 19, 2014","true","3.1"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","39","47","4","0"

So at the time I’m writing this I got 43h+, and just finished the game.\n\nMy favorite space game of all time is probably Freelancer, and other games I’ve tried haven’t even come close to it. But when I heard about Starpoint Gemini 2 I got my hopes up a little. Started following the game, checked in-game videos and such, and I got very interested.\n\nSo I decied to buy it a week before the release cause it was on sale.\nIt’s a good game. If you, like me enjoyed freelancer then you will no doubt enjoy this aswell. It’s not as good,  but it’s definitely not a bad game. The RPG elements are an interesting addition to the game.\nYou start of by choosing your “class” which are:  Commander, Gunner and Engineer all with different set of skills. Depending on your play style if you prefer being in a small group of ships or just pure loner/dogfighter etc, I think most players will find these classes interesting.\n\nAlright, now to the positive and negative aspects of the game: I really liked the “feel” of the ships, smaller ships are easier to maneuver while the bigger ones are heavier, and I like that “feeling” it really does feel like you are flying a ship. So the developers got that down quite well, spot on. I do wish they would have added like a secret ship(s) that could only be found and bought at a specific place that was hidden.   And continuing on the topic of ships, there are A LOT of them to buy. Allthough you will be very discouraged with the prices in the beginning, but don’t worry cash will eventually start flowing in. Just do side missions or if you prefer mining or trading etc.\n\nThe map is huge, and you have a lot of exploring to do if you’re into that. Just wish there were more things to explore, more secrets and mysterious anomalies etc. There isn’t really any suprises or “wtf” moments in this game, which is sad. No mystery.\nThe graphics are awesome, no complaints here it’s a living world and the designs are nice.\n\nThe sounds and music are awesome. But…I really wish they would use at least more than just ONE battle tune, cause it gets reaaally tiring to be hearing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. Specially since battle is a big part of the game. Would it have hurt to put in at least 2 more songs in? Other than that the rest of the songs are awesome, it really suits the mood and game.\n\nThere are also enemy heroes in this game, which all have bounties on them. And they give you a lot of cash, I totally missed this feature when I started playing so it took forever for me to get cash in the beginning.\nSo that’s a nice feature, but would have been even more interesting if they had like one final hero that was nearly impossible to beat, unless you were leveled up to the max with the best ship etc.\n\nNow to some of the negative aspects of the game: Map travel, when you press M or whatever button to bring up the map, the game pauses…so while you check your map and try to plan ahead for your future travels, the game is on pause and you don’t progress at all. So while I was travelling to this planet, and checking the map at the same time I noticed I was right where I left of. So that’s annoying.\n\nThe autopilot fails a lot of the times. It only does this after you have docked with a starbase and you click on your next destination to go there autopilot, most of the times it just freaks out and takes you in circles.\nThe voice acting in this game is a big joke. And not in a good way either, cause sometimes bad voice acting can at least make you laugh, but this was just…ugh.\n\nThe storyline is nonexistent. Which is really sad cause of the big universe the developers built up they could have written such a better story for this game. So if you buy this thinking it will have a nice or at least mediocre story, rethink why you want this game. Im not saying not to buy it, beacuse the good things outweighs the bad in this game.\n\nSo to end this I’d say it probably is the best new single player space game out right now.\n\nI’d give this game a 7/10\n\n+Many ships to buy\n+Huge map, a lot to explore\n+Pretty graphics\n+Music\n+Enemy Heroes\n+RPG elements\n\n-Maptravel\n-Music\n-Bad voice acting\n-♥♥♥♥ story\n-Autopilot fails","October 18, 2014","true","44.9"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","0"

You can easily get 20 buck worth of enjoyment out of it, plus some. When the game is done, you will be glad you did get in on early access. Fun ships and plenty to choose from, even now. Good fight and flight modes of flying. Great space eye-candy. No loading screens to get from one side of the map, to the other. Unless you are using the jump gates, then there is a small load. You want that ship the npc is flying? Just board it TAKE IT!!..lol Over all, I cant give much of any complaint. As a reference, its like a graphics smak down, with a upper cut in gameplay, to Freelancer!!..lol (only SP, no co-op multi..-1/2 star..lol)\nI give it 4&1/2 stars out of five: with it, as it stands, in Alpha\n\nEDIT:\nNow that this little gem is fully released, I can go ahead and say I wasn't wrong in my EA review. There may be a bug here and there, but the Dev team is really on top of it. It's about all been flushed out. So if you have been on the fence, and want a feeling like playing Freelancer for the first time. You should give this a go. And, with a active Mod community, Im sure there will be years of fun in the future of Starpoint Gemini 2!!","March 9, 2014","true","130.2"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","37","46","0","0"

I played that religiously at least a year and after that again every now and then. The graphics were underwhelming (green wire graphic), the plot practically non-existent. There were only 8 "missions" I knew of and the grind to get to Elite level was enormous.\n\nI looked for such a game a long time after that. Freelancer was a good try. The direct Elite successors were overdone and technically underwhelming. After a while I gave up.\n\nThen I stumbled over SPG2. And here it is again. Nearly. The freedom to do what I want, the grind to get to the top and a vast universe. For such a game it is important that the combat is interesting, and it is. If you are level 20+ you will encounter more than one enemy at a time, and then you will have your hands full.\n\nHere a pro and con list:\n\n+ Graphics are good. Not brillant, but good.\n+ You are free! You may do what you want. You can safely ignore the main quest if you want.\n+ You can capture ships. That is not only very profitable but also fun and later on you have to be quite skillful to pull that off (with battleships and the like).\n+ The map is huge.\n+ Fighting feels great.\n+ Your character has levels, perks and skills. And they are surprisingly useful (I play an engineer). And fun.\n+ You have to learn the UI but after the initial learning process it is very functional.\n+ You can change all keys. And you should change at least some.\n+ There is a nice levelling curve. It could be even slower, to be honest...\n+ There are secrets in the game. A secret station I just discovered (named after an astronomer, won't spoil it too much), sectors with radioactivity, anomalies and so on.\n+ If you don't know what to do you can do an automatically generated mission. They are endless.\n+ You can save only on a station. I like that because it means you risk a bit if you venture outside. But only a bit. Just the right amount :)\n+ The developers are very active and really trying to please their customers.\n\n- Trading is not risk free (there are enemies out there) and not profitable. That is not well designed because either you avoid risk and gain or take risks and get profit, but the trading option means that you take the worst from both worlds.\n- While there is a reputation system it is not individual to each of the factions. You are evil or good (or something in between). If you are "good" you are liked by all lawful factions. If you are evil you are liked by all evil factions. That could be more individualized.\n- The main quest has quite a boring plot and is not written very well. The voiceovers are horrible. These accents!\n- The map is not endless. That is not a big disadvantage because it is huge as it is. But it would be nice to have an option to generate a new "universe" procedurally.\n- If you land at a station the graphics are disappointing. It is nothing more than a greyed-out picture of you in front of the station. You don't feel you are on the station, you feel you are in a system menu.\n- The full screen mode does not work every time. On Windows 8.1, NVidia 760, full screen mode is only achieved after I start the game the second time. That is a bit unprofessional...\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nDevelopers: 10/10\n\nMain Quest: 3/10\nCombat: 9/10\nFeeling of Progress: 9/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nGood: if you like Elite or Freelancer.\nNot that good: if you like X, X2, X3.\n\nI bought it in a sale but it is worth its normal price and then some.","May 30, 2015","true","61.7"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

I have to say that I haven't played space sims for a while but do have fond memories of Freespace 2, Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer and Darkstar 1. The good news is that SG2 has some interesting elements. Could it be better? Sure, but let's get to the nitty-gritty. There are 3 things I'll comment on: RPG elements, SIM elements, and GAMEPLAY elements.\n\nRPG:\n\n·	Not great -- voice acting is poor, and I don't really care much about the storylines (I have Origins, Aethera and Titans DLCs), which I feel could be better or more compelling.\n·	Not enough random events by NPCs, etc. The universe is constantly changing economically, politically but it doesn't feel ALIVE. The characters seem dead.\n·	There is a points/perk system where you can improve your character but that's about it.\n·	You get some credits and blueprints for completing campaign missions (no medals or other perks). The blueprint reward system is interesting but really tough to complete a whole set, so what's the point, really?\n·	The NPCs you deal with are flat and uninteresting. Oh and the voice acting sucks. Or did I mention that already?\n\nSIM:\n\n·	This is supposed to be a space sim, but many controls are lacking. e.g. You can't coordinate attacks with wingmen or give them specific orders.\n·	Other sims even let you contact NPCs/wingmen over comms; not here.\n·	Combat is simplified -- which may or may not be a good thing. i.e. You have an auto-fire button for your light weapons, and a key for your heavy weapon. You have to be facing your opponent appropriately before other non-frontal weapons will fire. Sometimes the AI fires at other targets even when you're locked on the nearest one.\n·	There doesn't seem to be full support for my Thrustmaster -- I can't map the buttons, nor does it allow me to use a Joystick / keyboard combo. There is a turret cam view that can be useful, but without my joystick, it's pretty pointless.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\n·	Pretty graphics\n·	Fun sandbox (free play) mode. I actually spent more time here than on the campaigns.\n·	These are cool: Space stations, T-gates, T-drive travel, worm hole travel, boarding ships,\nofficers and mercs you can hire\n·	Lots to explore\n·	Faction/reputation tracking system\n·	Very useful star map with overlays and filters\n·	Game seems skewed towards battle; i.e. hard to get rich through the economic model\n\nOverall:\n\nThe game world is pretty. While the devs try to create a decent economic model, I'm not quite sure it succeeds. You can't really make much cash that way. The quickest way is to board and capture ships with your troopers, then sell the vessel, or through bounty-hunting. This skews the game towards a combat model -- not complaining, mind you, but if you want to have a robust economic model, well, then make it workable. Players should be able to make MORE money through mining, gas clouds, and trading. There's a fair bit of grinding involved if you want to play a merchant. This is a shame because there is an excellent transport infrastructure -- i.e. you can travel vast distances using T-gates, rifts, worm holes, etc.\n\nI like the fact that there's sandbox mode and campaign mode. Having hangars and your own fighters/bombers is a nice touch; and being able to beam your troopers to enemy vessels to try capturing them is fun.\n\nAll in all, SG2 is an entertaining and pretty game, but it falls short of being great -- more RPG elements would help, and of course, proper joystick support... and yeah, the voice acting sucks! I would recommend getting it only if it's on sale.\n\n\n6.5/10.0","March 13","true","98.3"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","0"

In saying that the combat is very rewarding with many battles containing the fast pace action (if you manuver your ship properly to avoid incoming damage and allow your weapons to target correctly while adjusting speed, shields and/or gunnery). Interface gets the job done but can take a few minutes to understand which isn't a negative with a great tutorial that can be accessed at any time if you forget something.\nThere are not many camera angles which I look forward to an update on this to make a more fluid experience especially in combat (there is free move camera angle which can hinder while flying and looking around). I truly would enjoy a cockpit view from the captains chair to feel really immersed while mining or ship to ship combat. I also want to see more interactivity with planets and stations ( one suggestion would be allowing the player to approach an enemy planet to try a diplomatic or subversion mission to change the flow of power/status of that planet).

The game also has a tendency to crash during or shortly after finishing a story mission which makes it a race to reach a save point before the game crashes and you need to redo the mission. So the redemption from story doesn't apply. If anything it just makes me more frustrated.\n\nLooking further into the game, you realize it is a single player MMORPG, ship upgrades are gated behind arbitrary level requirements. Ships handle basically the same except for the top speed, so your carrier is just as agile as the starting gunship.\n\nWeapon upgrades follow a similar MMORPG route, some weapons are poor and you go through the game trying to find better weapons. Weapons that are described in awkward and sometimes even incorrect ways, such as "rate of fire" being the delay between each shot. Once you get over the initial hump of how weapons operate you realize you need a calculator to figure out which weapon to use.\n\nSure I can play this, but all the time doing so there is a thought in my head asking why I am playing this game when I have better games available.\n\nEdit: 2015-11-25\nI just wanted to add that this game isn't necessarily bad, if they fixed the weapon descriptions and the crashes I'd actually consider recommend it.\n\nI consider the X-series, especially X-3, to be more enjoyable. I do not want to advertise for other games in a review, which is why this was at first omnitted, but since so many replies have been about it I'll add it.","June 13, 2015","false","26.4"," 94 of 145 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","94","145","8","9"

LGM has done a great job keeping the game fun and challenging without making it a nightmare to learn how to play.","November 4, 2014","true","95.8"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","0"

I don't even know how much time I sank into freelancer or the x3 games. Yet this one I am dropping after a bit more than 10 hours of playing.\nLet's start with what I like about this game: The graphics are good, the different ships with their various layouts are cool, you can customize your ship through enhancements and hiring officers, the energy transfer management (engine, weapons, shields) is interesting, and on the surface the game feels like it is trying to marry the best parts of freelancer with those from the x series (which means many things immediately make sense if you have played those games before).\n\nHowever. Somehow the game feels like a chore; something I am willing myself to play in the hope that if I continue a bit further it will finally become exciting and turn into the great game it has the potential to be.\nThe story is inherently boring. Fly from A to B, listen to some terrible voice-overs, destroy a target (ambushes being optional), get an (uninteresting and unusable) item and no real information other than "fly to XYZ to get more info". But you need to grind a few side missions first to level up enough for that. Rinse and repeat. I have lost all interest in the main story and there is just nothing that compels me to continue playing it.\nThe other sidequests and missions are okay, but also very repetitive. The difficulty rating of these is useless, as some missions (e.g. science, maintenance, taxi, ferry) are childishly easy, whereas others (e.g. assasination, station defence) become really hard quickly unless you sink all your money into your fighting capabilities. Importantly the missions don't pay enough in my eyes to make them worthwile. I found boarding other small ships much more lucrative. And flying through space feeling like you are a towing service is just not fun for long. These side missions quickly turn into mindless grinding.\nThere are many other things that bug me (not even to mention the numerous bugs I encountered already) that make this game a "no" for me:\nThe fighting is super boring; most of the time I just sit there with my turrents firing automatically and I don't do anything other than watch. Ships feel very small and their speed and maneuverability do not seem to decrease with size as far as I can tell (there is no "speed" property you could check when buying a ship). There is no good fast travel: gates are too expensive, wormholes regularly throw you out at the wrong location (and what is it with that terrible, terrible animation you are shown after you have flown into a wormhole?) and those "green highways" seem a bit pointless; most importantly while all of these move you long distances quickly they don't allow to quickly travel to something that is say halfway of that distance. Factions have no character and no individual story making them pointless really. The energy transfer management can only be used effectively by dragging it around with your mouse; there are no customizable settings to be activated through a button, e.g. a "hit and run" (50% engine, 50% weapons). Skills have no real impact: I have put all my skillpoints into one particular tree (beam weapons) and I still can't tell the difference before and after I activated the skill, with the promised increase in range definitely not working. The game cannot be played effectively with a joystick: some button commands cannot be changed (e.g. closing window, using skill, cycle through tabs in the store) while others simply are not recognized or don't work; also you can't use a mouse to quickly navigate say the store and star map.\nThere are many more things that have added to me not liking this game, but those are probably too specific to me to be really useful for other players.\nTl;DR: Repetive missions, bad main story, boring fights, lots of mindless grinding, terrible voice acting, the whole universe feels characterless and the joysticks can't be used effectively. While it is trying to combine the best things of previously succesful spacesims (freelance, x3) it does not get it right.","April 3","false","13.0"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamtots/recommended/236150/","jamtots","Jamtots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamtots/","459 products in account","Starpoint Gemini 2 recently left Early Access, and it is now one of the few games of that honour to actually turn out well. If I was to compare it to anything, I'd say it's like Freelancer or an offline EVE, though not quite as complex as the latter. Complete sandbox freedom. Go wherever you want and be whatever you want, whether that be a trader, pirate, mercenary, miner, fighter, explorer etc.\n\nThough it is a space sim, it also plays a lot like an open world RPG. You pick from three different classes - COMMANDER: has a focus on buffing friendly units, GUNNER: all about maximising firepower and ENGINEER:  boosting your own power systems and hacking/debuffing the enemy - and go around doing freelance missions, mining, fighting or exploring, and it all gives you XP (and sometimes money) to level up your character. Levelling gives you the ability to spend points on improving your class skills, which can be used in battle, and attaining perks, which provide buffs to a number of things like increasing troop strength for boarding ships or improving trade prices.\n\nBesides the sandbox 'Freeroam' mode where you are able to freely explore, there is also a recently added Campaign mode. This provides you with story missions, but you lose the ability to pick your class, character portrait or choose from one of the three starter ships (it forces you into a Taurus ship, arguably the best of the three anyway). The story isn't great, and it's a little buggy, but you can still freely explore and do whatever you want while doing it. The story missions are not particularly interesting (go from point A to B, kill target, deliver package, meet NPC etc), but they give you something else to do. If you're feeling aimless and not sure what to do next, the campaign missions can be a good way to provide yourself with a sort of goal or objective. Each mission will advance in level and difficulty, and you will often find yourself needing to gain XP and a more powerful ship in order to advance. I found that It added to the feeling of progression, albeit in a not very interesting way. It's completely optional, but I personally had no interest in it.\n\nThere are nearly a hundred ships to acquire by either buying them or grappling and boarding an enemy ship, killing the crew and towing it back to a nearby station to either sell ( for a very high price ;] ) or place in your garage for use, and they are all customisable. You can equip them with a variety of different weapons like railguns, plasma cannons, beam weapons and heavy weapons. You can enhance your systems by purchasing upgrades for things like your propulsion engines or shield generators. You can even give them a new paint job and add decals, though the colours don't stand out too well and the decals are just a short list of basic emblems. You do have the ability to add your own custom ones, but I didn't mess around with that feature. They're nice cosmetic touches, but nothing to rave about. The boarding is also fully automated and you don't actually get to see anything happening. It's nothing more than watching troop numbers rise and fall and choosing whether or not to send reinforcements. Quite unexciting to say the least, but stealing ships this way will be your main source of income, and managing to capture an expensive ship still gave me a lovely feeling of satisfaction despite the lack of a more involved system.\n\nYour ship is freely controlled, you can fly it yourself wherever you wish with the WASD keys and your mouse. You also must manage your power output. Do you divert all power to engines to give yourself a speed boost, to shields to make them hold out longer, to weapons so they fire for longer or do you try to balance between them all? It's very situational and you will find yourself having to tweak it back and forth very often when travelling and in combat. It's a system I quite enjoy as it keeps you occupied and helps with keeping the combat and travel feeling busy.\n\nSpeaking of combat, it's very fun, though not too complex. You can aim and fire your weapons yourself or have it done for you with autofire (though it can be inaccurate at times) and positioning is key. You and your enemy have four directional shields, one for each side, and each decreases under fire accordingly, meaning you should focus fire on one side if you wish to do optimal damage. If any of you have played Star Trek Online, the shielding is pretty similar to what that game has. You also have a choice of four skills, which differ depending on your choice of class. Each provides some sort of combat buff and can be levelled to add more effects. On top of that, there are then a multitude of items you can purchase and use whenever you wish, such as temporary speed boosters, repair drones or T-Drives (these allow you to instantaneously jump great distances) and a variety of other things. If used right, they can really save you when in a tight spot.\n\nOne issue with the combat however, is balance. I often found myself easily destroying ships marked as 'impossible' targets to beat due to having bought a reasonably expensive weapon or by managing to acquire a powerful ship. This can really mess with the early game and make it far too easy. It does begin to even out the further you level due to enemy scaling, but as long as you continue upgrading, it never gets difficult enough. This is tricky to do however and really only becomes a problem once you're comfortable and good at the game, which takes time.\n\nOverall, and despite some flaws, I believe this to be a good game with a lot of love and care put into it by the devs. It is just oozing with content and interesting, well polished mechanics. If the developer's words are anything to go by, a huge list of future content is still planned for Starpoint Gemini 2 and all of it will, supposedly, be completely free of charge. Hopefully a game to keep your eye on.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of space sims, sandbox titles and even people who are awaiting Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen. It's not overly complex and it does lean a little more on the arcadey side of things, but despite that, it's still a deep enough experience to sink some enjoyable hours into.\n\nScore: 7/10","September 27, 2014","true","19.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","2"

An yet I did not like this one. This has mainly three reasons:\n\n* The story (what little I have played before giving up on the game) is not riveting and seems to follow already trodden paths (trodden by games far superior). The whole "The system is riven with conflict and there is some hidden threat only YOU can uncover" is nice and dandy, but again, done better by previous games. The voice acting is .. unethusiastic. I know, I have been spoiled by world-class actin as in Mass Effect, but still...\nThere is a lot of grinding - trading, mining, doing freelance missions, to get a ship that you need to NOT be blasted to smithereens by the next main mission,. There ALWAYS is. It is a core principle of the game, and usually, one that I like. In this game, it feels like a chore. This has again to do with the story, which just does nothing to make me want to reach the next mission.\n* The steering. This is a MAYOR point. I did not think one could botch follow-the-mouse-steering. Sadly, one can. The point you fly to is somewhere in the upper third of the monitor. Which KINDA makes sense given the perspective and the axis of the ship and all. BUT the neutral zone of the mouse-steering is in the center of the screen. Which means that when you point at an object an try to fly towards it, you will pass OVER it (for given values of "OVER" in 3D space).\nThis is annoying, to say the least. It is also unintuitive. I remember when Freelancer made me use the mouse (for me, it was the first time then) to steer the ship. I took to it in seconds, because it was so intuitive. Well, this one is NOT.\n* The mission system is bugged, if not broken. "Yes, you can take this mission with level 6" Great. They WHY is there a friggin' CRUISER waiting for my gunship at the mission point, blasting the living hell out of me? This happens regularly, and it is annoying. "Nooo, THIS science mission is WAY to dangerous, it requires you to be level 11." Ah-ha. So floating in space, with NO enemies to pop up (I have yet to meet one on science missions) and waiting for the scanner is something only my higher-level self can handle..\n\nAll those points make me kinda regret the purchase. Oh, and one final note: it may be okay with copyright law to use the theme from the mining minigame of Mass Effect 2 and use in the score, for me, it was just an INSULT to the ME franchise, because this game is not even doing the same sport, not not mention playing in the same league.","May 17, 2015","false","44.9"," 76 of 119 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","76","119","7","5"

Core mechanics are grind, fetch&kill 'quests' and exploration. You also pick up things and sell them off at the nearest friendly station, or buy things at one point and sell them to a trader across the map for profit. The game world is huge and fun to explore at first, but given the lack of variety (it is space, after all) it will get boring afer a while. Combat is nothing like a proper space sim - you either get projectile weapons and miss, or directed energy (beam) weapons and hit 100% of the time via automatic turrets. These make the whole combat thing ridiculous - all the fun is outsourced to your onboard computer. The game seems to be balanced with this in mind - you can either turn on the auto tracking and let the computer do the fighting or die.\n\nFun parts:\n\n-exploration. the playing environment is huge!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brandongunn/recommended/236150/","brandongunn","Critical Hit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brandongunn/","313 products in account","Starpoint Gemini 2 is a complete turn-around from the quality of the first game. It's prettier, it's satisfyingly complex and most of all, it's a lot of fun. It's blend of RPG elements, freeroaming gameplay and atmosphere is great, and pretty well refined. While the voice acting isn't anything to write home about, the simple joy of adjusting the loadout for your ships, hiring officers, mercs and troopers, and leveling up can be downright intoxicating.\n\nA couple small issues nag at me, however. At the time of this review, the ability to adjust shadow quality or post-processing in the video options menu is still locked. There are some balancing issues that make themselves painfully apparent within the first hour or so of gameplay, namely the rate at which you accrue money. Tackling big number bounties might seem like a great idea, but they're prohibitively difficult (as of level 7, all the available bounties were way way out of my level range) and grinding freelance missions can sometimes feel monotonous. Additionally, the lack of communications chatter between ships can make space feel somewhat sterile. When rescuing a ship from pirates, it would be great to hear a panicked captain's voice pleading for assistance, or thanking me for the help. These are minor gripes about what amounts to an overall great experience.\n\nGranted, I haven't played through a ton of the story campaign content, and my time with the game might be small compared to others, but having seen such a triumphant turn-around from the first entry, I felt compelled to gush a little bit, and congratulate the developers. Well done, guys!\n\nI tend to not be one to jump on the early access titles very often, but it was honestly really cool watching the development of this game, seeing community input being utilized, and watching something grow from nothing. I can say truthfully that I don't regret purchasing this game during early access in the least.\n\n4 out of 5 stars.","September 29, 2014","true","20.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

I believe the biggest culprit is turrets. While it is possible to partially blindside a less maneuverable ship than yours in 1v1, ultimately maneuvering and dodging in combat is best done by spinning around in circles. When you're spinning around in circles, you can't effectively target and attack targets manually, and so you rely on fire-at-will auto targetting to do that job for you. This is boring.\n\nThe economy is workable, but not that interesting - different stations have a set low-mid-high value for all of the commodities. Buy and sell appropriately.\n\nThe storyline is workable. The Gemini universe is interesting, and is worth reading about if you're into that sort of thing. The storyline does an almost adequate job of immersing you in that universe. The voice acting/writing is awwwwwwful.\n\nThe good: All around, this is a workable game that will scratch your spacefaring itch, though will likely not leave you satisfied. The graphics are beautiful, each region of space is very well stylized in the coloring, asteroids, and various anomalies. Plenty of the starbases and ships have pretty unique detailed models. Music and sound are good, although the short soundtrack for the music is a mild disappointment there.","November 8, 2014","false","18.5"," 52 of 81 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","52","81","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsilverblood/recommended/236150/","rsilverblood","raven_silverblood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsilverblood/","108 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverall, it's a very, very good game. I've split this review into a few categories, so maybe that'll help you find what matters most.\n\n- Gameplay\n\nLet's be honest here. This game is about space combat, not about mining or scavenging or being a space taxi man. That's where the "meat and potatoes" of this game is. So this is the most important thing for this game to get right. If it fails at this, it fails as a game.\n\nAnd to its credit... gameplay is superb. Combat is fun, if a bit monotonous once you get a really powerful ship. It only keeps you on the edge of your seat when you're in real danger of losing your ship, such as when facing a really strong enemy while you're flying a much weaker ship, or a large fleet of enemies on your own.\n\nCapturing an enemy ship is very satisfying. Unfortunately, towing ships takes a very long time and can be quite boring, especially if you're being attacked by enemies the whole way there. This game is still in early access, so balancing will still happen, so we'll have to see where it goes. But for now, its an amazing game and I can't wait for more!\n\nThere are a few immersion-breaking issues, though, such as the large delay, stutters and pauses when starting up the game, when entering a new area, when receiving new missions, or when auto-saving. However, since this is early access and not full release, we'll have to see what will become of these bugs.\n\nScore: 9/10\n\n- Storyline\n\nNone. At least none that I could find. While the game is tremendous fun on its own, with farming resources, capturing enemy ships and destroying enemy outposts, there doesn't seem to be any real purpose to it. At least not until the game is finished.\n\nThe story is still being developed, as this is still an unfinished product. But if this turns out to be a game where the war between factions can have the tide of the war turned either way depending on the player's success or failure in certain missions, it could be very cool, especially if areas become owned by different factions thereafter.\n\nScore: Unknown (Not yet finished)\n\n- Controls\n\nThe controls are nice and solid, with ships feeling very responsive (small ones) or sluggish (large ones) depending on size. The way a ship accelerates and breaks is also much more believable and immersive than you might believe from early footage. Trying to get a carrier to stop within 100m of a target feels like a feat of piloting at times.\n\n3D space combat has been perfect by this game. I've played many space combat games like Homeworld, Star Trek Online and several others. But this game nails it and then some. At first I didn't understand why all the buttons and controls were needed for. But after enough time playing, I get it. And the position of the keys and what they do really helps give you a great feeling of control in the game.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\n- Graphics and Sound\n\nLet's face it, as time marches forwards nobody wants to see ugly-looking games (unless they like Indie or retro games). And this game has some of the finest looking graphics one could hope for. They look beautiful, and even at 1440p on my GTX 650 Ti Boost 2GB it still performs smoothly (except when there are a lot of ships).\n\nConsidering that this is on the low side of a mid-tier graphics card, I'm impressed. With more graphics settings I should be able to increase framerate, and coding optimizations should also help make the game run smoother in the long term.\n\nSound wasn't much of a focus on this game, but the chatter and computer voice are really nice, and remind me a lot of the voice of the Enterprise-D in Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was a heart-warming surprise, and I can't wait until we get a total conversion mod for Starpoint Gemini 2.\n\nThe lack of a large variety of background music did feel a bit annoying and lackluster, but time will fix that. I'd love to have this game include beautiful symphonic and orchestral music, like Star Wars, Star Trek, and other great SciFi series. Music could really help take this game to the next level.\n\nScore: 7/10\n\n- Challenge\n\nThe game felt off-balance at several points during my dozens of hours playing so far. Capturing a large ship early on and using it felt almost like cheating on Normal difficulty. I'd like to see more balancing, such as not being able to use more than X amount of turrets on a ship depending on how many ranks below its minimum requirement you are. (So, if you're level 25 and trying to use a level 35 ship, you wouldn't be able to use 2 turrets in each direction.)\n\nThe long-term replay-ability right now is hindered because the game hasn't really given players much of an end-game challenge or reward system. Once you have earned 50M credits, and have several Dreadnoughts in your garage, the game just doesn't feel challenging anymore.\n\nI'd like to see something to give the players the ability to hire commanders and bridge officers to command the ships in their garage, to they can join the player in large scale battles. This way it helps the player build his very own Armada to wipe out large (and challenging) enemy structures.\n\nRight now all the fun is at the first 30 levels of the game. Once you reach that, it gets monotonous. But given the early development of this game, I think we can expect great things from it, especially with modding support.\n\nScore: 6/10\n\n- Fun\n\nWhat can I say? I had a blast (no pun intended)! It was exciting and challenging for a long while, and it's consumed me for the past few days. I've lost sleep planning what my next ship upgrade should be, or where to lurk around under cloak waiting to capture the ship I wanted (but couldn't afford). Few games drag you in and hold your attention like that. All I can say is that I'm beyond impressed!\n\nScore: 9/10\n\n- Conclusion\n\nI guess here's what I've got to say. For a game on Early Access on Steam, this is as much promise as I could dream of. (Unless you count Star Citizen, but that isn't fair.) It's fun, exciting, supports modding... it just isn't finished.\n\nIf you're looking to buy a whole package that's neatly wrapped up, ready to go, this game isn't for you. When you play an Early Access game, you're getting a sneak preview, you're beta-testing a game that will (of course) be filled with bugs (and your job is to report them), and your feedback this early on will also help shape where the game goes. You get to be involved in the creation of the game, and if it succeeds you get the satisfaction of knowing you helped a little.\n\nThis is a sneak preview. It's a taste of what's to come. And so far, I like what I see. They've got the game where it counts. Now it's just a matter of the final touches like faction warfare, dynamic economy, trade blockade, storyline, and so on. But given how far this game has progressed, that shouldn't take too much longer. I haven't seen many bugs, and for 25$ right now this game is a steal!\n\nI give this game a wholehearted approval, and my recommendation to buy it. I can't wait to see what kind of amazing mods we'll see. Here's hoping the team that did the Star Trek Armada III mod for Sins of a Solar Empire can start working ASAP on Starpoint Gemini 2.","July 1, 2014","true","46.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","6"

If you enjoyed the freedom that the X series gave you, but absolutely hated the UI(or lack there-of), this is a game to rectify that.\n\nFlying your ship is quite easy and fun, combat is rather fluid and in-line with the class of ship you're currently flying.  Combat is definitely part of the game, but certainly not the only aspect.  You can shoot asteroids for resources, scan anomalies, salvage wrecked vessels(of your own making via combat, or derelicts you find), send troops onto enemy ships in attempts to capture and then tow them to a station(strip them of fittings, sell them, or keep them for yourself), there's also trading between stations and planets.\n\nEverything you do awards some experience points(running missions, scanning anomalies, killing things, etc), which is then used to upgrade your character's abilities(weapon skills for railguns, lasers, plasma and heavy weapons; want your railgun shots to have a chance to fire twice with one volley?  A chance to penetrate shields and hit hull?  Longer bursts for your lasers?  Put points into the appropriate skills.)\n\nThe devs are very active on the forums and always listen to the community, even adding community ideas into the game regularly.  They also really want the modding community to have as much control as possible to expand the game; as evidenced by the Steamworkshop support.\n\nI expect great things to be afoot for this game in the future, and even in early access it's fun to tinker around and see what you can get into.  The engine is solid and the dev team is very much hard at work, the community following the game is strong.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world space games with no loading screens.","April 24, 2014","true","27.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Im an avid fan of X3: Terran Conflict and the X series in general.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has so many things right and is fun, simple, and rather elegant.  I highly recommend it.\n\nHowever, as with all games, it does have drawbacks and a few not so great things.\n\nFirst off, Voice Acting-\nYou will likely notice it straight away when you start the campaign.  The voice acting is certainly better than that in the original, however it is still poor.  Most characters have strange accents or inflections, strange pronunciations which are inconsitent between characters (specifically the word "stasis") and no emotional connection.  The main character, Adrian Faulkner, is basically monotone with no depth nor feeling thruout. As a man who just lost his father and is out for revenge, he is VERY boring.   So do not expect the story to be compelling on that count.\n\nStory/missions-\nThe story in SPG2 is better that is was in the original, and seems more streamlined, however it still remains quite boring after a short while.  I understand the game is mostly freeroam/sandbox, so take this as you will.  However, the missions are a bit more diverse than the original with some capture stuff added in as well as some scanning and transporting.  But it still remains the standard "Go Here, Kill/capture/scan/transport, Return, Listen to more dialogue"    So dont expect alot of diversity in missions.  Its pretty much the same with side missions and freelance.\n\nGameplay-\nThe gameplay is terrific. Its nice, simple, and easy to use.  Its easy to jump into the game and not have to learn 1000 controls or things to do.   However I personally miss some of the depth of controls and other minor things for the sake of immersion. (Thinking of X3)\n\nShip models / aesthetic -\nThe overall design, and texture of all ships and stations were fantastic and very intricate.  I might have to say they are some ofmy favorite ship designs in a long time.   Planets are ok, but lack proper scale.  Vigo at the start is almost the same size as planet trinity or at least pretty close.  Go look at planets in X3 and see proper scale.  However I understand such an accurate massive scale wouldnt work in an sandbox single system. Its something that many space games (mostly strategy games) do.\n\nIn the end I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a nice, simple space sim with a bit of RPG elements thrown in.  You will get a good 40 or so hours out of it, then will lack anything to do. There are freelance missions that will repeat forever.","September 25, 2015","true","61.2"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","1"

I have played the X games and enjoyed them, however, I always found them obtuse and very difficult to learn.  SPG2 is simple by comparison but this in no way a bad thing.  They have found all the elements I found fun and pulled them out and made an awesome game.   Combat is fun, I feel like I am in control of a mighty star ship, not some egg with guns.   However, if your not careful you can be over run and taken down.  The ballance is great, I have died but never have I said "but why" or "that wasn't fair" .   There is Traiding in the game but its simple, again not a bad thing.  If I wanted Stock market sim 2015 I'd have gone and bought that.   This is a nice system to make money with that I don't have to spend weeks reserching prices and locations.    Mining and salvage as well, but again, I don't have to spend a week trying to find a station that sells mining or salvage mod for my ship.   Weapons are again Simple.  havinge 300 different items that all do basicly the same thing isn't a plus in my books.  3 weapon types with several items for each class and clear choices which is better.  Ships are again simple with up to 10 systems to worry about.   I find no fun in the need to have 100 different system for a ship.... simple is better.\n\nI Now have 35 hours in this game,  one of my top single player game in my libray now.

You're flying tripulated ships with several guns and missiles to fire on your enemies and sometimes even fighters and bombers to assist you! This is not another stupid "dogfighting style camera view". It's more tactical and I love the devs for making that choice.\n- Combat is very interesting and you can decide how you want your engine/shields/weapons focus in the middle of the fight.\n- Graphics are very good and the design is "colorful".\n- You actually feel like you're evolving as you advance in the game and have access to new ships. There are many options to suit your playstyle.\n- You can fly Capital ships (dreadnoughts and carriers) and they're not useless sitting ducks like they're in EVE online. In Starpoint Gemini 2, you can actually destroy smaller ships in the blink of an eye flying one of those, as it's supposed to be when you're flying a freaking Battlestar with fighters and tons of guns at your disposal.\n- Devs are constantly looking from feedback from the playerbase and they're very active on forums, taking players advices and questions and participating on the debates in a polite and helpful manner.\n- You can send your troops to board enemy ships and try to steal them in a very interesting and original mechanic. Nothing like trying different strategies and escaping with a nick of health from a battle after taking your former enemy's ship with you in tow back to a station.\n- Capital ships!\n- DLC at a very low price that offered some new content.\n- Did I mention Capital ships?!\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Several things are not clear on the tooltips and there are no manuals inside the game. There is no "ship encyclopedia" as you'd expect on a title like this.\n- The difference between weapon types, bombers, fighters and interceptors is not clear.\n- There are not too many weapon types in the game. It seems like it lacks some variety.\n- There is no clear DPS indication. There's an "average" indicator on weapons, but you have to calculate the firing rate manually to figure that out, apparently, so it's hard, at a glance, to know which weapon to use as an upgrade.\n- The management of your shields could improve and be something more like Star Trek Online, where you have to define what side gets the bonuses.\n- The way "Fire at will" works should be improved on. You could mark targets (as you do with fighters) and your tripulation would shoot them, instead of firing on everything and everyone around randomly as it is right now.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n- A few bugs still annoy me, such as not being able to launch the game if I have Teamviewer service running on the background or not being able to run the game in window mode simulating full screen. If I alt tab while in fullscreen, the game will switch to a window mode, and I have to close and reopen the game to load the fullscreen again. Another bug happens when you take a mission and you're unable to complete that, such as the missions that tell you to patrol and when you get to the place you're supposed to go, nothing happens.\n- Voice acting is TERRIBLE.\n- Missions get repetitive quickly, so you'll be unwilling to play after the grind for the big ships is over.\n- Strongest ship unlocks at level 40, so nothing to look forward to after that level.\n- Story is poor.","June 15, 2015","true","29.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","2"

The game looks nice, plays well (albeit at a slowish pace), has enjoyably 'space-y' ambient music, and offers a ton of different content that may not always 'wow', but will definitely satisfy.\n\nStarpoint Gemini 2 reminds me of a giant, sword-wielding turtle.  No, really! Just let me explain...\n\nWaaaay-back-when, in those wonderful 8-32 bit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle video games, you could play as one of four characters, each with different strengths and weaknesses: Raphael, who had tiny, short-range, but superfast attacks; Donatello who was really slow but could whack-a-ninja from half a screen away with his staff; Michelangelo who specialized in... I don't know, making pizza with nunchucks? Or something?  And then there was Leonardo, who didn't attack quite as fast as Raphael, and didn't have quite the reach of Donatello, and didn't (pizza?) quite as well as Michelangelo - but hey, he was a very close second-best at *everything* and pretty dang awesome as a result.\n\nSooo... if space games were mutant turtles, then Starpoint Gemini would definitely be Leonardo.  Sure, some dedicated RPGs have better character development in stats and story (and DEFINITELY voice-acting), and some starfighters have more intuitive controls without the need for a gazillion tuturial screens and HUD informational windows, and some trading/exploration games have a more lifelike economy that can fully support your character as a pacifist (read: cowardly) trader... but Starpoint 2 offers ALL those types of gameplay and more, and all done extremely well. This enormous range of enjoyable gameplay content is the greatest feature of Starpoint Gemini 2.\n\nAll-in-all, SG2 is a huge Space-Based-RPG/Combat/Trading/Strategy/ShipBuilding/Sandbox-Simulator mashup that may be slightly flawed and a bit slow-moving compared to games that 'specialize', however the astonishingly vast scope of gameplay content is all well-done, nicely polished, and most importantly... fun!   With a large campaign and moddable freeplay mode spanning half a dozen genres, Starship Gemini 2 is second-to-none in being second-to-all - but hey, so was Leonardo, and he became the leader of the Ninja Turtles for a reason!\n\n(*SIDENOTE:  Despite evidence to the contrary in this review, Raphael was actually the best turtle.  Of course, comparing Starpoint Gemini 2 to a giant mutant *sai*-wielding turtle would have been utterly nonsensical, so I went with Leonardo.)\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

It is in a playable state already; you get a fairly powerful ship at the start, you can fly around, explore, get missions like repairing space bases, destroying pirates and playing taxi between distant bases. There is a good(ish) tutorial on the start to which you can go back any time, so you are not left alone to find out what is where.\nMy biggest problem was having the ship not powerful enough, not fast enough and not having strong enough shileds until I found out about the quick and very handy power distribution feat - this is in the tutorial, but the information was so overwhelming that my attention slipped by the end and learned as I went along with the missions. I think (hope) there will be a smoother tutorial in the final version, perhaps like the one we get in Eve.\nEverything I have seen in the game so far makes me think it was a good buy and worth every penny.

I think their biggest issue was releasing this so half finished originally.\nIf you enjoyed old school games like privateer, you'll find some neat similarities, mixed with freelancer style controls. Its got a lot of good structural things going for it, but still feels light on content, which is understandable given that its a small dev team working on it. Never the less those guys managed to put together a fun space sim that doesnt take itself too seriously. If you are looking for a hardcore space sim, this isnt it, but if you are looking to fly around blowing things up and occasionally have an interesting battle, then you are in the right place.\nI continue coming back to this game to see new updates, and if the dev guys continue to produce content, I think this will flesh out quite nicely, so that the universe doesnt feel so barren with the same 3 mission types everywhere.","May 2, 2015","true","19.8"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

The original game was very easy ot use and not too overly complicated to use. The game was in 3D, but only flew in 2D, so it wasn't hard to get form point "A" to point "B" with little effort.\n\nStarpoint Gemini 2 takes the original game several steps fruther. The concept is sitll the same. You are a space pilot looking to make a name for yourself in the age of space trader. You can either play in campiagn or in freemode.\n\nSome of the things that have improved since the first game are as follows...\n\n1.) Flight is now in 3D instead of 2D\n2.) You no longer have to use jump gates to get to your destination\n3.) A lot more ships to choose from\n4.) Ships have a lot more upgrades to choose from\n5.) Some ships offer a "Flight Deck" where you can send small fighters out while you battle\n6.) Not only can you have a flight deck, but you can also choose which kind of fighters you want\n7.) This time, you can also land on planets as well as star bases\n8.) Combat is lot more "tactical" than before\n9.) You can now make friends and enemies, this determines if you are able to land on stations or planets\n10.) There are now factions, each with their own likes and dislikes about you and other factions\n11.) More items to buy and trade\n12.) Major improvementts on comba, flight, and trading system\n13.) There is now a fully viewable starchart you can use to determine where you are versus where you go\n\nOverall a much more enjoyable game with added features that allow a lot mroe to do as well as a lot more offer. The added bonus of flight decks is also very helpful for when you need that added help durig combat. If you are into the Space Trader system that has true 3D concept of space flight, this is a good game to get. If you loved Starpoint Gemini, you will love this second part. The added benefit of landing on planets is a major bonus from the original game.","January 22, 2015","true","21.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","5"

Starpoint Gemini is probably one of the most fun space games I've played. It feels reminiscent of the X series in a much-welcomed third person perspective(Though you have the option of using a mounted cam perspective instead if you prefer), with the noticeable lack of any empire-building elements to speak of; likewise controlling a fleet is very limited by comparison, and as far as I'm aware you have to be pretty far into the game to even start a fleet.\n\nThe game, much like X, has a campaign option(Which I haven't played and therefore cannot comment on) and a sandbox mode. In the sandbox mode, you pick a starting ship and get thrown out into the universe with the usual obnoxious tutorial screens, and then it's pretty much straight into the action. Your prime objective for most of if not the entirety of the game will be to make more money, which you have several options for obtaining, such as mining, hunting criminals, trading goods, or pirating goods. It's all quite fun, but the payouts are generally small in comparison to the price of ships and equipment upgrades, meaning you're definitely going to have to spend several hours chauffeuring sales reps and diplomats through hostile territory and mining asteroids by the hundreds to ever afford that ship upgrade, but this is balanced out by the fact that the starting ships are pretty powerful generally speaking, and should last you as long as you'll use them... Though that doesn't mean that the money grind is any less monotonous.\n\nI'm not saying it isn't fun. It's just not as rewarding as it could've been. You grind money for the sake of getting a bigger ship, for the sake of grinding more money more easily, for the sake of getting a bigger ship. Perhaps the campaign provides more variety, but the sandbox is in desperate need of some more money-sinks.\n\nGraphically, the game is a joy to look at, though the fact that I rarely dabble into anything this modern could be skewing my opinion here a little. The art style is reminiscent of a cartoon or an anime, and colours are very vibrant, making literally everything stand out dramatically. The only thing worth complaining about in terms of graphics is the little debris particles that fly past your ship during movement, as they're practically the size of my tiny gunship's cockpit, but thankfully there's already a mod to remove them.\n\nAll in all... It's definitely not a bad game. There are better games out there for the price, but I'd still recommend picking this up if you have money to blow, especially if you're a fan of space games. And if it's on sale right now, slap yourself for even giving it a second thought and then buy it. Just a forewarning however, it will definitely annihilate your social life.","September 30, 2014","true","4.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The soundtrack is pretty cool too.\n\nIts quite fun and addictive for now, but I can see it becoming quite repetitive. I'm sure later on in the game things become a bit more interesting with bigger ships and fleet battles, but the early game requires a lot of grind it seems.\n\nI recommend buying this on sale, as it is at the time of writing this review.

It also featured some of the worst voice acting / writing I have heard in a long time. Thankfully the sandbox of different mission types, trading and exploring more than makes up for it. One of the more enjoyable scenarios is ship capture where you have to whittle the targets shields and hull down to the limit and then board the ship with your troopers with the aim to capture it. This has big pay off's and lets you bank huge sums of money to buy new ships and gear.\n\nThe ships are the main stay of SG2, they are nicely varied and do not fall into the EVE trap where every ship has to have its trade off's, in SG2, a Dreadnought can kick serious ♥♥♥ against all sized ships as you would expect and is a blast to play with.\n\nThis game is a solid 8/10 and had me hooked all the way up until I had the best Dreadnought and Carrier available and could just mop up.

Having been disappointed by the original Starpoint Gemini, this mere Alpha of Starpoint Gemini 2 really blew me away.  The dev comment "hugely improved sequel" is very much an understatement.  I barely got my feet wet, but this game is literally a decade ahead of its amateurish predecessor.\n\nForget all the wrongs of the original Starpoint Gemini (or just forget that game entirely), SG2 fixes all the terrible compromises it made:\n\n1. No longer locked a 2-D plane, you have full six degrees of freedom.  As the developer blurb says "everything now is in 3D!"  *shock, horror*\n\n2. No wierd incremental steering. (I guess you have to play the original to understand this one.)  As I said earlier, full six degrees of freedom.  Pitch, yaw, and roll to your heart's delight.  There's even a toggle to steer with you mouse for more precision dogfighting.\n\n3. No amateur voice actors reading non-native English scripts.  Not a lot of voice acting in the alpha, but what it did have was professionally polished.\n\n4. No hideous 2002-era low poly character renders.  Hand-drawn 2D portraits FTW!\n\nIn general, the production values are up to what you'd expect from a modern game.  Those screeenshots don't lie, it really does look that good in-game.  The soundtrack and sound design is also very well done.  The UI is beautiful, handles well, and very user friendly.\n\nIt's still alpha, so there some key content missing (mainly the campaign, and the the trade system is very under-developed), but so far this looks like the first promising successor to the Elite/Privateer/Freelancer legacy in years.","March 16, 2014","true","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This game puts you in the boots of a newbie starship captain in one of the most volitile areas of human colonization, and it's your choice as to what you will do with your newfound freedom.  Will you avenge your father and find out why he was killed in the storyline?  Will you go off and discard your past in the free-roam sandbox mode?  The choice is yours.\n\nYou start out with a very basic gunship, but the game doesn't limit you to one ship like some others (Darkstar One, X-Rebirth), but instead gives you the option to upgrade and upgun in one of several ship classes.  Do you like the thought of zipping around in a fast, maneuverable stealth corvette?  You've got several to choose from.  Maybe you'd prefer to roll into a hostile area in one of the mighty dreadnaughts or carriers and outgun everything in the zone (except perhaps another dreadnaught or carrier)?  You can do that, too.  Or you'd like to be a trader, working your way from your starter ship to a freighter, and then a freightliner, ferrying cargo, buying cheap and selling high.  Again, your choice, but remember to pack guns to keep the pirates off your back, as they have the same choice in ships as you do!\n\nYou'll do all of this in a *very* good-looking setting that has NPC ships doing their own thing according to their own agendas.  My personal favorite example of this was the time I was attacked by a group of pirates.  I was in a destroyer, which is fairly middle-of-the-pack in speed-to-guns/armor, and flying with a group of trader ships.  The pirates jumped us, I engaged...and the traders *bolted!*  Left me there and ran, as they weren't going to stick around and slug it out with pirates that outgunned them (being businessmen in freighters rather than naval officers in warships, it seemed their AI told them to GTFO).  Just as I was swearing to hunt them down (if I survived this and didn't have to reload halfway across the map), security forces from the nearby station arrived with battleships and cruisers and what was a brutal last stand became a lopsided pirate turkey shoot.  Brilliant!\n\nStarpoint Gemini does a lot of things right, and the devs have shown a lot of interest and support in the community.  There were a few bugs on first release, but continual support has polished this into a real gem most space-sim fans will enjoy greatly.  9/10","January 18, 2015","true","76.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You can board another ship.\n4. Station defense / Station assault type of missions.\n5. Launch fighters/interceptors/bombers from your ships.\n\nThe thing is that it's a very short game with a ton of good gameplay that'll keep you hooked. Unfortunately, you find yourself doing repetitive things (like boarding, mining, etc.). You'll eventually find yourself with more money than you can count and you've basically done everything there is to do in the game.\n\nCompared to other gaming simulators, this one is a junior.

X: Rebirth 3.0 (I know some of you space sims fans HATE this game, but in reality, this game had a very shaky start with bugs that would render the game useless, but in version 3.0, almost all of these bugs have been fleshed out, there's a ton of new features, and it's a GRAND game).\n\nI've been playing X: Rebirth 3.0 for a month now and I have yet to do everything it offers. It's beautiful!","February 23, 2015","true","51.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

I'll try and be semi-objective as I have interacted with the dev's, their moderator and the community for some time. But please read on and judge for yourself.\n\nSpg2 is a tactical space combat sim. I joined in EA and didn't play it for long due to hardware limitations on my account but liked the idea of a big massive universe where the player doesn't end up being the "King of the Hill" but just a small piece of a bigger universe. And Spg2 filled that need for me.\n\nThis is not the most epic game I've ever played and I didn't expect it to be. But from a small ~10-ish Croation developer team I've been surprised. Not only have these guys made their own engine which shows beatiful graphical capability but they also constantly updated the game for almost a year after release with steady patching and a nice and cheap DLC while being constantly (I can't express how crazy these dev's are when it comes to listen to player feedback and troubleshooting with the community, it's unheard of) active on forums and responding to any bug report they received and fixing it with each new update. This is more than half the reason I'd buy any game they'd ever release.\n\nWell about the game; There are more in-depth Space Games out there, more epic stories to be told. But this game doesn't pretend to be any of that. It knows it's limitations as a huge space universe where the player is just a small piece of the puzzle. And it does that extremely well. Imagine being in a single-player MMO ( yeah kind of contradictory) but that's how this game treats you. You're nothing more special than the next dude around. You won't change the Universe all by yourself but you're just a small part in a bigger scheme. I love that sense of relating to your own existence in the world.\n\nHow many games dares that anymore? In an age where we all feel we're the turning point and center of the Universe this game is a fresh breath teaching us the Universe doesn't resolve around us but we're just here to try to survive and do the best we can.\n\nThere's no classic story arch to this game. You don't end up feeling like you're the king of the world. You're just a captain in the void trying to fend for him or herself. That's it. And from a philosophical perspective I love that notion. Too many games rub your need for being the "one and only". Not this game. This is reality expressed through a game. You're not gonna matter more than others but still need to claim your place in the world. That's beautiful and invigorating and  ... well poetic in some sense.\n\nThere's a story (campaign) in the game that lends itself to the lore created in Spg1. But former knowledge of that is not required. I am still on the last mission of that storyline but that's not the reason I play Spg2. I don't relate that much to the story as such but enjoy the stories I can make with my own captains more.\n\nThe game lets you choose between story and freeroam missions at a whim. You can always wander off to do randomly generated missions even when playing the campaign (campaign has a fixed character while freeroam lets you generate your own male/female character) and explore as you see fit. My preference and love for space was to be more of a "freelancer" doing randomly generated missions for different factions making friends and enemies along the way depending on my choice of the missions I'd carry out for different factions (help one faction=lose reputation with another faction and vice versa).\n\nThe game can be a grind for some, other cherish that type of neverending possibilities and in Spg2 the ever-changing possibilities for changing your reputation and the constant randomly generated missions can keep you playing this for hours on end.\n\nSome days I just log in, cloak my ship and enjoy the scenery. Other days I just log in to take my temper out on whatever faction I'm currently in bad standing with and make them suffer.\n\nFor a better description of the game check some videos on Youtube or other reviews. I'm still sold on this thing and the constant updates, a very nice and cheap DLC plus the upcoming FREE DLC makes me wanna recommend this game to everybody. Best and coolest development team I've ever meet and a hell of a positive and friendly community.\n\nThis game is Steam History for the books. The reason I still get into EA from time to time is because of these guys right here.\n\nThis is a game made by gamers to gamers. And a hella lot of respect for their interaction, back-and-forth, constant updates and pleasent attitude.\n\nIf you're in doubt visit the forum. These guys are the future of gaming and a pinnacle of how developers can make gamers trust and cherish them again (yeah plenty of jaded gamers out there seeing bigger companies ♥♥♥♥ all over their customers or make highly dubious decisions).\n\nEdit: It should be noted that this game twists a few familiar concepts of games and how to progress the best possible way. There's not much "hand-holding" here but the forum is pretty active to anyone needing a tip or two on how to get the most of it and learn those "different" mechanics/understanding from what other games usually bring. So remember to pitch in with questions if there are any or you don't understand something. The early game in particular can be a bit rough for new players but once they get a hang of it it's really not that hard to understand.\n\nover 9000 / 10","January 3, 2015","true","139.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Then Xrebirth came out. Luckily i did not jump on the hype wagon (learned my lesson) and when the first videos came out i was stunned by how terrible the whole game was.\n\nYesterday I saw this game on Humble bundle for a few bucks, so I took a look at some videos on YouTube and found that it looked pretty decent. Then I read a few reviews, and found that this could totally be the one game that can fill the X's place.\n\nI was not disappointed!!!\n\nTHIS is how X3 should be done. Everything is done right, even though many features are still missing, like the ability to create fleet, owning stations/player faction, more ways of modifying weapons (custom mods maybe). There is not really much content in the game right now, but the promise of it shines on the horizon like a new day's sun (especially story mode) and i can only hope, that the devs continue to be as awesome as they have been so far in communicating with players and using their feedback to make the game better.","July 6, 2014","true","17.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

As it stands, the game is not only playable, it's stable and fun!\n\nEveryone compares the game to Freelancer, which makes a lot of sense.  The input for flying is similiar with mouse and keyboard.  But I like the fact that you captain a capital ship instead of flying a starfighter.  Even smaller ships (like the Destroyer you start out with in the Alpha) have a sense of weight and inertia in their movements.\n\nIt's a fun game, with a slower, more deliberate pacing than a starfighter game.  There's time to decide your own fate while being pounded on by your opponents.  You end up feeling like the captain of a tall ship at sea.  Which means they must have done something right.\n\nThere's no campaign yet, but sandbox offers a complete game in and of itself.  It's a career mode, so there is persistent progression, kind of like a campaign might have.  There are tons of ships to buy, and plenty of missions to run.  Or you can run around getting into trouble, and you'll progress just as fast.\n\nSo far, I haven't needed anything that isn't implemented yet.  In fact, the only things I've actually missed up till now are the jumpdrive (T-drive) and cloak.  Other than that, nothing feels like it's missing.\n\nIt's well polished at this stage, which makes sense since it's one week from Beta.  The graphics and UI look slick.  Anything that's actually implemented at this stage is almost always bug-free.  The game is very stable, too.  I don't think it's crashed once on me.\n\nThis is March of 2014, and as it stands the game provides a satisfying experience to play repeatedly.  It is on sale till the 17th, but will have a price hike immediately afterwards as it goes into Beta.  Also, buying it before Beta will give you 1 free copy of the original game.  A fun tide-me-over till this game is complete.","March 12, 2014","true","32.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Doesnt apply to people with super memory\n- you cannot purchase spacestations or other type of stationary npc controlled objects. not yet.\n\n\n\nTLDR, summary : the game runs smooth and not many bugs for its state, gameplay wise there re many things to add. lack of variety atm might be boring but combat is fun and makes up for it. im pretty sure as it develops, many new features gonna be added and this game has potential to beat X3 in future in open beta. only if devs keep the game updated just like now.","July 13, 2014","true","29.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The game is rendered in a beautiful 3d environment and, while fiddly to get used to (it's a little more clunky than the X series of games), once you're used to it, you won't encounter much in the way of problem. Right now, there's not a whole lot to do other than explore the universe but then, what did you expect? It's a pre-release game!\n\nI decided to support LGM because, quite honestly, I didn't with SPG 1 and, in hindsight, I wish I had because it's a company that hasn't forgotten the golden rule in the gaming industry;\n\n"Listen to what your fans want, then make it for them."\n\nSo many authors make the game THEY want and then wonder why the game bombs. In my own experience, Mass Effect 3 was that game but I'm sure most of the readers have at least one recent title they can apply that to. LGM listens, they adapt and incorporate into the game and they're not shy about it, either.\n\nSo, if you're after a non-mmo space simulator (Elite springs to mind), this is definately for you. Hell, for less than £20, you're not going to do much better at the moment. Get it while it's hot because it promises to be an amazing experience.

The game play is smooth and intuituve. And being fully supported by the Steam Workshop allows the players uninhibited creativity. Many have paid twice as much for a "finished" product that promised the galaxy but couldn't deliver the moon. SG2 delivers the solar system, the galaxy and the cosmos for half the price.\n\nThe responsive developer team never let's too much time pass before they're reassuring the community that they're forging ahead to a quality release.

That tends to be an enormous expense in any game, and it's still better than the voice acting in Just Cause 2 or Strike Suit Zero.\n\nHowever, even with two years of steady work, the game still suffers of performance issues and frequent crashes. I can accept a lot of problems but I really hate having to restart the game so many times in one evening. Last I heard, the devs are still actively working on the game - I hope they'll find these last crash and lag sources and fix them someday soon, because until then I won't be able to play this thing more than maybe half a hour a day.

The ship handling reflects this and the control scheme works really well. I tried it with a flight stick, but it's not really that kind of game, the mouse controls just feel right for the pace as you seem to spend more time targeting, selecting systems and activating powers and perks, rather than 'hands-on' flying. There is a strong RPG element in terms of building up your character and ship with equipment, skills and perks to develop. There is a lot going on and I'm sure I barely scratced the surface.\n\nTechnically it's excellent, great graphics and effects, and not a massive system hog either. The soundtrack is very nicely ambient and helps to immerse rather then distracting.\n\nThere is great community around this game, and the developers are obviously very keen to make improvements so I can see that there is a lot of potential for future enhancements, but the game that is on sale now is a totally complete and functional product\n\nMy only criticisms would be that the universe seems a bit impersonal, and the setting poorly explained, being a sequel to a game few have played, and the script a bit weak and generic. The English voice acting is very flat, and it might have been better to stick to text to be honest, but it's farily sparsely used and doesn't spoil the game.\n\nOverall, great game, well worth the price which is very reasonable for the amount of content and the mod support and supplied tools mean that it will have plenty of new content  to come.","September 28, 2014","true","8.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Ugly visuals, awful voice work, uninspired gameplay, I just couldn't stick with it.\n\nImagine my surprise when it got a sequel.\nA really, really good one.\n\nI've been playing since Early Access and, though a little messy at first even then it had put right all the wrongs of it's predecessor and was blowing away the other Early Access space-sim I had my eye on at the time (yeah I'm looking at you Kinetic Void!)\nWhat we have here is:\nGraphics on par with the X3 series. Actually abit better - there is some fantastic lighting happening here, stormy nebulae to make FSopen jealous. My god it's full of stars! The ship models are wonderfully textured  down to turret details and the little holographic projector on the Ageba frigate.  I was particularly impressed  that you can name your ships and see the name decaled across the hull, little things like that are awesome. Also the tactical overlay was a really nice touch!\nFull 3D plane movement (and and handy key to reset planar orientation)\nA much improved interface with hotkeys for all the important stuff and nice RPG-style perk system for your captain. The skills need a little balancing but the devs seem to be on the path.\nReliable camera control - stick it in Turret mode and make judisicous use of the Space and K keys and it feels just like EVE Online!\nA well fleshed-out free-roam setting with enough side-missions, customisation, exploration and combat to keep fans of Freelancer and Edge of Chaos happy.\nAnd a much improved campaign with some okay-but not-great voice acting and dialogue that I'm more than happy to overlook because...\n...The combat is fantastic. The UI is a little clunky but when you find the right set up it's truly a joy to play. Wether weaving a speedy corvette through a torpedo run on a convoy of freighters, weapons blazing like a battlescene from DS9 or cruising a small flotilla through a gas cloud to scan a subspace anomoly, this as close you'll get to EVE Online offline. It plays somewhere between EVE and Freelancer  with more than a bit of old Star Fleet Academy.\nActive devs and built-in mod support. The devs have been really active and communicative all through Early Access and look committed to tweaking and balancing Starpoint Gemini 2. The whole game feels like a true labour of love for them. Steam Workshop already has some mods available and a a Mass Effect ship mod is in the works, as well as Star Trek ships and some small UI and balance tweaks from the community.\n\nStarpoint Gemini 2 is a space cadet's dream, in a time when genre is still only tentativly coming back from the grave.\nIt's focus on capital-size craft instead of the more common starfigther cockpit is most welcome and fills oft an over-looked niche in the genre. I would've like to see a subsysem targeting mechanic more in line with Nexus: The Jupiter Incident where I can tactically pick apart my target but that's really small potatoes and the damage model here works just fine with critical hits offlining ship systems.\n\nIn the end as a sequel SPG2 far surpasses, and on it's own it's a triumph, capturing everything you love about epic space operas in a wonderfully realised package.\nTrade, fight, mine, command and enjoy!\n\nHighlights:\nEngaging in a battleship dual in the middle of a lightning wracked nebula, desperatley jockeying for fireing arcs as our ships burn. KHAAAAN!!!!!\n\nJoining the defense of a besieged battlestation leading a rag-tag squadron of gunned-freighters to back up small armada of warships as beam weapons cut the night.\n\nThe first time you're pirate away-team boards and captures a faction frigate and you tow it back to the shipyard as prize. Take what you can, give nothing back.\n\n\nDrifting gently through the corona of a blue giant as a gentle acoustic guitar track plays you ponder the best place to peddle small arms and battle mechs and what the odds are you'll get spotted sneaking planet side.","January 21, 2015","true","54.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You get a ship, fly from port to port, buy and sell commodities, mine asteroids or take on freelance missions for fun and profit.  Your ship is upgradeable with an assortment of weapons and buffs available at any port with a drydock; there seems to be a pretty decent variety in the different planetary sytems.  Hiring officers (up to 3, at least on my frigate class) will give you additional buffs; each officer has different strengths, and no two are exacly alike in my gameplay so far. You can add to your fleet by capturing enemy ships after boarding them with your troopers, or do it the old fashioned way, and save up your credits.

Getting lost in this universe is just great. Can't stop taking screenshot.\nSome of the ship just have great design and the artwork just add an extra touch for the immersion.\nSmuggling, fighting, mining, trading, bounty hunting, capturing ship, escorting convoy or attacking space base. And much more...\nI have to say I am seriously hooked, and the Dev are taking good care of their baby with quick reply and patches.\n\nThis is not a a space flying simulation as the game is optimized for mouse and keyboard. But that the way I like it, giving the game a nice tactical touch. It take a bit of time to get used of all the control but once you get them, you can get into amazing space battle : Surviving the  assault of an ennemy fleet on an allied Space station is just so rewarding.\nYou start the game with a fast but fragile gunship then after earning tons of credit anyway you want, you might control a fleet of Dreadnought and Carrier with fighter jet... Or just be a pirate with an op Ronin Destroyer (Best share ship in my opinion) cloacking and raiding any fat cargo ship or illegal space laboratory... All of that with a bit of role playing and a nice background with faction conflict and alliance.\nSome might say that the game is not perfect : Voice acting sound a bit weird but I got use to it and actually I like it now; some other talk about empty content : like in Elite Dangerous, use your imagination, add some Role playing... Being a pirate for exemple and try to be friend with the evil faction is an interesting challenge :)  And the campaign will keep you busy for some time.\n\nThis is silver that could change into gold with the rights patchs and dlc :)","January 13, 2015","true","99.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you can get it on a good sale, then it can be a fairly fun experience running around a small system of planets, doing odd jobs, buying new ships, and upgrading weapons. There's some decent stories involved and the devs have made some nice DLC's available for pretty cheap/free.\n\nDownside: this game is buggy as hell when it comes to the control scheme, especially if you want to use a controller with the game. I happen to like using a controller; I feel like it's very relaxing and I can kick back in a chair. Using an Xbox One controller with this game, (or any controller) is going to lead to a hell of a lot of mapping issues that don't get resolved easily.\n\nAlso, loading up the DLC's can be kind of weird, since you're selectively activating them. Unlike games like Skyrim, where you can just roll up and jump into a DLC once you add it to your game with whatever save file you're using, this game like to cordon off the DLC's and have you jump sandbox to sandbox. They can be fun, but it's not always ideal.\n\nThat all being said... there's a ton of ships in this game and ways to arm them out. Whatever your playstyle, you'll eventually captain a ship that meets your needs, whether that be overwhelming destructive force, a carrier that houses a fleet, or a ship that can drop out of stealth and put the hurt on. It can be pretty addictive. It can ALSO be extrememly repetitive. You mileage may vary!\n\nFinal Verdict: yes, I'd recommend this game, but it really will appeal only to a specific type of gamer.","May 13","true","69.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you're going to get this game, you better read on.\n\nI tried to return this game after five hours of trying to make enough money to even by the next better laser in order to break the asteroids faster.  And, I can tell you I'm very happy that I passed the hours played deadline for returning it! This really is a quite fun game if you know the right way to make money!  If you think you're going to make money trading or mining, you got another thing coming! Forget about anything except capturing enemy ships.\n\nWhen you go to a space station, on the upper left you can select hiring troops or mercenaries. Hire as many troops as you can, and then go find an enemy ship. Find an enemy ship that has as many or less personnel than the troops you hired.  The number of personnel is listed to the right of the 'lock on' information.\n\nDestroy most of the enemies hull, but leave about a quarter. Then from your 'center mouse button' menu select send troops. Over on the right side of your screen a small flag will appear showing your troops are boarding the ship and how many troops are left on both sides. At this point you can click on the green arrow to send extra troops, if you don't send extra troops you will probably lose the battle.  If and when you capture the ship, and you must learn how to capture ships, use the tractor lock on in the 'center mouse button' menu. Then head back to a space station and sell it.\n\nIn the beginning ships get you about $100 K, maybe a little less. But that beats the $10 K per trip of breaking rocks. Then use that money to buy better lasers, missiles, and systems upgrades. You do not get experience points for capturing ships though.(unless it finishes a mission) Destroying ships gives you experience points. Once you have upgraded your ship as much as you can, then go start doing missions to gain experience points.\n\nMake sure you save at least one of every higher level ship to use as you rank up. If you are good enough at combat, you can capture ships larger and better than yours. Then once you rank up you can start using them instead.  I have succeeded capturing ships with one third less personnel on my ship than the enemy ship. I think the worst damage to the enemy ship the less troops you need.\n\nDefinitely read the instructions in the upper right ? Icon.\n\nPros:\n\nIt definitely is a well-made galaxy. It's pretty, large, has lots of planets, anomalies, and wormholes. The wormholes can be a little crazy when you're in a battle and one grabs you and sweeps you away!\n\nIt has lots of great ships to choose from.\n\nPlenty of different armaments to choose from.\n\nSome armaments work well in some situations and then do not work as well in others.\n\nLots of side missions to choose from.\n\nThe campaign story is really good.\n\nCons:\n\nEven though it has a good campaign story, the voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard in most of the characters.  It seems like they went around from high school to high school looking for the worst of the drama students they could find to perform the stories.\n\nThe mission text portions have obviously been poorly translated. I think it was originally in German. A lot of the stories and side missions are just given to you in text form, and because of the poor translation it can be hard to understand what they are trying to say.\n\nConsidering the size of the galaxy they provide, the main campaign was too short. I did tons of side missions, finished the story, and still had half the galaxy unexplored. Since I find no point in just roaming around the galaxy for no particular reason, the rest will remain unexplored.\n\nAll in all:\n\nIt was totally money well spent! I also got the two extra campaigns which I will now go and play.","April 7","true","48.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I get to fly around a large universe, exploring, trading, collecting bounties or mining and still feel like there's more out there to see/do. Maybe these things are available in EVE, but I wouldn't know as I don't get enough gaming time these days to justify a monthly subscription.\n\nThis game is about captaining a ship; the piloting and gunning controls work best if you select a target/destnation and tell the ship to attack or move.\n\nHere's my first impressions after 20 hours:\n\nPros\nBig open world (might have mentioned this already)\nCustomisable ships\nVarious factions to befriend / hunt down\nFreedom to choose between merc, trader, explorer, etc\nNo game breaking bugs (so far)\nCons\nFeels like a late beta - the DLC prompt EVERY SINGLE TIME I start the game, despite my saved games already using the DLC. There's also missing voice files for some conversations and custom key configurations aren't saved between sessions.\nVoice acting, when it's there (some of the voice files are missing)\nTutorial - be prepared to click through screens of dull text every time you mouse over a control the first time you play and still have to look things up afterwards.

The tutorials could still use a bit more work, though the game is a lot of fun once you get a handle on what you're doing.  It's a bit like Freelancer and other like-games in that you can explore different sections of the galaxy, do missions, mine for resource, buy/trade commodities, and so on.  The middle mouse radial menu, coupled with the starchart, makes interacting  with objects a cakewalk.  I still find combat to be a little tough because I have trouble figuring out and observing the available weapon arcs, though you can set the ship on "fire at will" and fly around while the computer does all the shooting.  All in all, worth the asking price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBUwubN0keE","October 1, 2014","true","13.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

If you feel a bit burnt by another recently released space game, give Starpoint Gemini 2 a try - I really think you'll like it. If you are a Star Wars fighter jock you'll have to get used to flying a heavier ship. The UI is both intuitive and beautiful. This feels like a sort of dystopian 29th century Star Trek.\n\nEdit: Now 15 hours in and this game just keeps getting better all the time. I took down a "hero" a.k.a. a large ship with a threat level of "Impossible." The fight took 20 minutes and alternating between targeting the enemy's heavy batteries and subsystems. This ship jumped me and was not part of a mission.  My little ship a small Pegasus class gunship wore this bad boy down and the reward was 4 million credits! I decided to step up to a Corsair class rather than an even more powerful Frigate.\n\nThis is really a game to be savored and frankly, I am so happy with Starpoint Gemini 2 that I really couldn't care less for Elite: Dangerous especially with today's (18 Novemeber) announcement that Elite: Dangerous will require constant online even in single player.\n\nYou can play this game as you see fit and don't be fooled into thinking that the explorable area is small because there isn't a whole galaxy to explore. I've only seem a tiny part of this game. Somewhere in the Community Hub of this game someone had posted a complete map of the game and suffice to say it is M A S S I V E.\n\nLimit Theory is now the only other space game that I think will force me to divide my time if it turns out to be as good as it looks. CNo Man's Sky is still a long way off and Star Citizen is so bloated that I believe it can't possibly live up to the hype nor the budget which I think equals  the budget for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.\n\nSimply put, Starpoint Gemini recaptures the magic of the great space games of the past like Indepence War I and II, the Freespace series, and the legendary Tie Fighter and X-Wing and all from a small studio. If you love space games,  get this. Ignore it at your peril.\n\nGreat job devs!

I would give this game a "5". In my continued quest to find a game of equal or greater quality to old WIndows game "Freelancer", I was hoping I had found it with this one. I was NOT sorely dissapointed, but it's kinda a rather bland game...It's like getting a coffee but no cream and sugar, or a turkey dinner with no mashed potatoes. The core concept is there....just they didn't cook it long enough.\n\nMechanics are good, the idea is great, beautiful graphics and awesome full 3D flying, and I love the slip-stream "Surfing" idea, but I just can't get my attention to be held.\n\nFor my limited playing, I felt the story dragged, I could not afford to be a trader and spent most of my time jacking pirate ships, looting them, dragging them back to a nearby base to sell. (FYI: Your crews DO NOT take over the ship and fly along with you as an escourt - At least from what I experienced during my limited gameplay. It took me about 3 lost ships before I realized you had to tractor the ship back to a station :P )\n\nI am hoping either these guys do a MASSIVE update on this game, or maybe they will get it right in the next game they are making. I'm certainly willing to give their next one a chance.

In many ways this game does things exactly right.  So why the thumbs down?\n\nBecause it does one thing wrong and that one thing is enough to drag the rest down with it: It tries to use MMO logic in a single player game.  Which is to say that the grind is the whole of the content.  Do this mission to get credits to get a bigger ship with bigger guns so that you can do a mission with a bigger enemy to get more credits to get an even bigger ship etc etc ad hoc infinitum.  Once you hit max level and get the best ship there really isn't anything left to do except mindlessly blow things up at random.  It gets old really, really quick.\n\nYes there is a story option but the missions in that story are hardly any different than the randomly generated ones from freeroam.  They just add voiceovers to some rather poorly written dialog.\n\nStill, the price is cheap and they game is entirely without it's virtues.

For serious, it took four tries just to make it launch and once it did launch it took two restarts to make it launch without messing its big boy pants. Finally, I got into the game, started playing, and immidiately strangled myself with my own mouse cable. This will happen, don't panic. Just unwrap yourself or, if you have to, find an adult to help. At first the controls feel as stable as a drunken donkey with the skurvy, at least with a mouse. I flopped around for quite a while, but eventually not only was I flying circles around the bad guys, I was...no, I was just flying circle cause that's how I dodge enemy fire while keeping my guns trained on them. The point is the flopping became on purpose, cause stragedy; now the controls seem alright to me. The map is roughly six times bigger than something really, really big (a house, a small country, yo momma, etc.). It's big, like hugemongous. Think of something really big, and then know that this is much bigger. The game has two modes: Campaign and Freeroam, although a Campaign save can abandon the story to go chase space squirrels once you realize that space rodents are much more interesting. I played the Campaign for about an hour, then made a new character in Freeroam who is a morbidly obese, one-eyed robot smuggler with a ship so fast that no one has thus far been able to catch it and I regret absolutely nothing. Freeroam is why you buy this game. Freeroam will consume you. I have accepted that this game is my new family, and you must too. Don't fight it.

It tries so hard to give you the complexity one desires in a space sim with features like capturing ships using marines, scanning anomalies, and coming across derelicts just waiting to be scavenged, but in the end, these activities are very superficial.  They eventually become very routine and the rewards are often limited to money or experience.  Levelling up your character doesn't grant much satisfaction, except for when a perk point is given.\n\nNot much is required before you'll be rocking around Gemini in the biggest ship the game has to offer, decked out with the biggest guns, with all the best upgrades.  Luckily, this doesn't make you the ultimate end-all-be-all combat god of the universe.  Combat appears to be balanced in such a way that you will always be vulnerable and dealing with this turns out to require very different strategies depending on the size of your ship.\n\nCombat is one of the things this game does very well, and a challenge always awaits you as the game throws squadrons of enemies at you routinely, even the periodic Legendary or Hero ship, which offers an even greater challenge and huge money rewards for the latter.\n\nOtherwise, this game seems like a pretty casual space sim.

No real problem though since it´s uncommon and you can always use quickbinds for targeting stuff.\n- I´ve had a few crashes since I bought it but since the game is being actively patched (and I haven´t crashed for a few days) it might have already been fixed or I feel confident they'll fix it.\n- Might get a little repetitive after a while\n\n\nHaving played it quite a lot the past weeks I'd say it's one of my best purchases in a long time and it deffinitly deserves a strong 4!\n\n1 - Crap, don't buy\n2 - Fun for an evening\n3 - It's an alright game but not my taste\n4 - Great game\n5 - One of the best I've ever played","March 2, 2015","true","93.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

It totally captures the essence of space games and fictions like Star Trek with a level of polish unheard of for an alpha. Constantly updated, and with a developer community unlike any I've seen; go to the community hub and find any conversation and I'll bet the developers have listened and participated at least once.","February 15, 2014","true","21.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

X3 (Non-Steam) was the best one I've played so far, and Rebirth I've never touched because it looked pretty disappointing.\n\nMusic: The tracks so far are good and fit the game well but there's only 4 tracks I've heard so far but hopefully more will come.\n\nGameplay: Depending on the class you pick, you'll have a set of skills that you can utilize in combat or other purposes, there's a leveling system as well which you progress by doing missions, mining, exploring new sectors, repairing ships/stations, scanning anomalies and blowing other ships up, with this in mind the game felt like it was a Space Sim/RPG mix to me. Combat is good, I have freedom of movement and aim. It's also cool how you have troopers on your ship and you can get them to board other ships, unfortunately I never succeded.\n\nGraphics: Ship/Station models, anomalies look decent, the background looks excellent, planets look ok but overall the game looks great.\n\nSingle Player: So far there's only a Sandbox mode where you can do whatever you want, there's no story mode at the moment but they have said that they are working on it and we'll probably end up seeing it sooner or later.\n\nSummary: Starpoint Gemini 2 has alot of potential and It's pretty good for an early access title, so far I've enjoyed my time with and will continue playing it. One thing I would love to see is the ability to actually fly into the planets and explore the landscapes, not just dock on the planets with a menu and what not.\n\n","August 17, 2014","true","16.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has a lot of potential but also a lot of stuff to work on.\n\nMuch of what the others have said is absolutely right. The money/combat balance system is so wonky at the moment. There have been times I fought 2 'impossible' ships and knocked them out almost immediately, and then 3 'trivial' ships have taken me down a little while later. Using manual aiming is a massive handicap because you can only fire from a few turrets at a time and trying to lead a ship is next to impossible at many ranges. I have yet to come across another gun, light or heavy, that is stronger than the ones I started with.\n\nThe skills and perks are lackluster at best, you start with all the skills and simply increase the efficiency slightly. Every five levels you get a perk, and again, that just adjusts your efficiency with one thing or another, 8% more money when trading, or 8% more damage with railguns, etc. Very uninspired stuff.\n\nAnd then the money, over the course of a week I got about a million, which isn't enough for any ship. Then when I get to a particular station I kill a bounty without even realizing the ship was one. After selling at the station, I get another bounty, and another. In the course of an hour I get 17 million and can pretty much afford whatever I want, except I can't fly much at the level I'm at.\n\nAll in all it is a game on the cusp of having something really good going for it. There's a lot of potential here and I'll continue to play and explore because I do find it entertaining.","September 25, 2014","true","53.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This does not reflect the new content added in the update, but once I play the retail version enough, I will be sure to update!\n\nFor a while I have been looking for a good open-world space game, with nothing really looking like a decent game. For me, spore is the most experience with a space-style game, which I really loved, but I wanted to move on to better things. Then I saw Starpoint Gemini 2 in development. After watching some videos and seeing how fantastic the game looked, I decided to buy it, which was an excellent decision and one that I recommend anyone reading this review to follow.\n\nLittle more needs to be said about the visuals. They are fantastic. Combat is also really well done, and content is surprising since it is still in development and only has one gamemode so far.\n\nThe most disappointing thing about this game for me was that there is no option to actually explore planets. This is purely a space exploration game, which of course is why the price is not rediculously high and is very reasonably priced especially for a game so modern that it is still in development. That limitation is really the one thing which is keeping this from being my dream game, but it is definitely fantastic for what it was designed for. Just make sure to dock whenever possible so that you can save and not lose a ton of progress!\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game whether you are new to the space scene or a veteran. Especially at this price point, it is an excellent buy!","September 27, 2014","true","5.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

As for a suggestion, I love the open world sandbox feel, however a more effective fast travel would be nice.

Is it "as good" as Freelancer? I'd say it is a little early to tell, but I feel like this is going to be a huge time sink like Freelancer in a good way.\n\nOther reviews say this is Eve "Offline" and I definitely see where that is coming from, and in a good way. Trading so far does take some thought, there's random pirates that you can mostly evade if you want, and there's local defense forces around that will jump in to help (even if you don't want them too). Right from the start you can start doing whatever it is you feel like doing without feeling too "new" for lack of a better term.\n\nI started with the Campaign, and I'd say I'm not overwhelmingly enjoying the story, but it's still early so I can't fairly judge it.\n\nAs far as free roaming, which I've spent more time on, I can tell I'll be spending most of my time doing just that. I managed to capture a ship I was planning to buy when a pirate attacked me, and so the mechanic for that is interesting. I've done some repair missions, bounty hunting, salvage work, and some trading. You can mine both gas and asteroids, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. No idea if there is any exploration to be had other than wandering around.\n\nIt would appear there will also be a huge variety of ships in the game, as different areas have offered different ships for sale. So far, I've seen perhaps 4 or 5 factions of ships and the faction list is pretty long. Also, these are only the small ships which your skill will correspond to purchase ability. How hard it will be to obtain the bigger ships I cannot say, but given how many credits I have versus what the prices are on them, it does not appear to be a grindfest.\n\nThe map feels pretty large, and it takes some time to get around each sector. At first, the map did not look all that large fully zoomed out, until I started panning around. Then I realized there was a LOT more and I've barely scratched the surface. 3 hours in, and doing a fair amount of travelling, and I have only made a small dent in the map BEFORE you pan anywhere!\n\nCombat takes a little getting used to, but I was also learning the controls, and I'm pretty competent now which was why I tried boarding a ship. The boarding mechanic is more or less getting close enough to grapple the target ship, then send boarding parties aboard to kill their defenders. Larger ships have more troops, so don't expect to successfully board a battleship with a gunship. You can also go into a "turret mode" to keep your guns trained on an enemy ship. While you might have some turrets blocked depending on ship design, you might also be able to deliver a nasty broadside!\n\nSpeaking of those troops, you can replenish those troops at stations, and you can hire officers for your own ship to automate some things and make it more efficient. You can also hire mercenaries to fly alongside you, each with their own ships. So, as long as you can pay the salaries of the officers and mercs you hire, you can have a good leg up on some encounters. This also means traders and miners can have escorts, while the combat pilots can have some wingmen, and the fleet leaders can lead the way if they so choose.\n\nTrading is pretty straightforward, with each station having commodities in various states of supply and demand, which change from time to time. You can check what's in your cargohold against the last known prices of stations you've visited to gauge if it's worth making the trip. I should also note smuggling is an option, as different sectors have outlawed one thing or another, and you can "sneak" illegal goods if you have the right conditions.\n\nOverall, I am really happy to have picked this up, and I definitely look forward to exploring everything this game has to offer.","September 27, 2014","true","48.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I have played a lot of Freelancer over the years and always looked forward to a second comming if you will. With the recent surge in SciFi games I have tried my chances with a few and been let down (X-Rebirth I am looking at you). However this game keeps the syplicity of Freelancer with ideas from today. Honestly it really takes the best from Star Trek Online and Freelancer in that it allows you to be what you want but gain levels along the way with a pretty good skill tree. I really enjoy the freedom to do what you want combined with an RPG element. That way I actually feel like I am getting somewhere. Ordinarily I would wait to post a review however with these types of games I can usually tell if I will like them based on my love of Freelancer (hence the constant name drop). This game also has a full workshop so there is the possibility of endless content. There are already Star Trek mods and I am sure that more are to follow. All in all, if you need to scratch the Freelancer itch and you are tired of waiting for Robert's new game, please try this one.

I tried to play using my controller but found it impossible to shot because the controller buttons for the menu were the same buttons to fire and target, this meant I could not manually fire my guns. If I am missing something maybe a video tutorial on how to play with the controller would help so maybe a member of the community could help here.\n\nOnce I switched back to the mouse I found flying around quite enjoyable. You do not have to fly far to run into some action which I liked. Over all I like this game very much, and did I mention the great sound effects and epic music.\n","September 28, 2014","true","30.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It shares many similarities with the aforementioned game, as well as some enjoyable improvements, and will probably be the best single player Freelancer-style space sim available for a good while. With Star Citizen focused on multiplayer, look no further than Starpoint Gemini 2 to fill the gap between the two.\n\nLike Freelancer, you can play with keyboard and mouse, with a rather familiar flight control style to Freelancer players. But although SG2 offers support for other gaming controllers, it's far from polished right now - it's near-enough unplayable with the popular Saitek X52 HOTAS, given the rediculous deadzone on all axes. However, if anything, the keyboard and mouse feels more natural to use in this game anyway, given you're playing the role as a ship (and later, fleet) commander.\n\nComparing this game to the failure that was X-Rebirth, SG2 comes out on top. Although more arcady, SG2 is significantly more enjoyable from the getgo.","September 28, 2014","true","6.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There's a Commander class that benefits fleet and the best you can do for a "fleet" is hire 2 mercenaries later in the game.\n2. The map is THE BIGGEST FREE ROAM I'VE EVER SEEN. And it takes forever to get anywhere even with the PTE speed.\n3. First 4 campaign missions are travels (you kill like 2 ships) that take 5mins of travel time each if you don't get sidetracked. (Haven't gotten further yet)\n4. When mining, debris containing your precious loots flys everywhere faster than your ship moves, slowing the process.\n\nUpsides:\n\n1. The map is THE BIGGEST FREE ROAM I'VE EVER SEEN. I've spent almost 6 hours trying to open 10% of the map up. I've explored basically none of it, but now I know where the faction structures are for a little bit of a corner of a section of the map.\n2. Auto-aim from Open Fire actually leads the target instead of dicking around with straight shots based on current location. Awesome job.\n3. The ship types are easy enough to learn and yet there are enough of them to still have a good enough variety.\n4. Graphics are decent.\n5. You mine the same way you fight. By blowing ♥♥♥♥ up with your weapon systems.\n6. The ship you start with is more than enough to ♥♥♥♥ around and get work done for a while (so far all I had to replace was the weapon system).\n7. Enemies spawn/warp in often enough you don't have to explore to find cargo to sell. And they won't persue you fast enough that you can get away fairly quickly without much worry.\n8. The radar/scanner/mini-map is easy to understand as long as you're not a brick.\n9. Middle Mouse Button is your friend.\n10. Controls take a minute to get used to during combat, but you'll pick it up pretty quick since you just have to worry about positioning/dodging instead of aiming your light weapons.\n11. There's still a challenge when you're fighting in big fights.\n\n\n10/10 worth my money and time so far. Haven't played far into the campaign but I'll see how that goes, also. Awesome first empression and I definitely suggest dicking around in freeroam instead of starting with the campaing to figure stuff out, then turning off tutorials in campaign for a smoother ride.","October 13, 2014","true","7.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Like all space sim/action/whatever, it takes a little to get comfortable with all the controls. There is so far only one real thing I'd change. There is a sense of "I'm never ever gonna be able to afford that...". The experience gained from freelancer missions is way too freaking small, and the upgrades to weapons are insanely expensive, not to mention I have no real idea how much of a boost they are giving me, because the data doesn't have % signs or adjustments shown.\nSo really, it's a great game. Period. It seems like it would never end really, which is great. But I still have no sense of how long it will take to get to higher levels, because right now I'm level 3 (so like 6300/9000 points to next level) and each of these freelancer missions gets me like 50 freaking points! So I'm asuming never.\nI know I am just griping about that over and over, but that's it, that's the only drawback. Other than that, it has everything you want in a space RPG.

So far things look good and this might even be the case in the future, but as of now there's still plenty of work to be done. That doesn't mean SG2 wouldn't feel good to play. Does it?\n\nThe game features a rather large open area The Gemini Star System. It's filled with stations, shipyards, bases, asteroid fields, junkyards, enemy ships, friendly ships, planets, anomalities, practically everything you would expect from a sandbox-type space game. It feels like there's a lot to do out there but at least for me that's not the case. This is because the game features very few different types of missions for the moment. There are freelance missions which you'll accept over the map view and then start them by docking with the correct facility, ship or planet. These missions usually involve hauling passangers or goods from the dock point to another. There are also scanning, repairing, patrolling and I think I even saw an assassination mission. These might keep you busy for a while but the samey repeating content of each mission type quickly lose their charm.\n\nThe game's main emphasis is on space combat which for the most parts feels good. Ships fly in space and trade fire with missiles, beam weapons, plasma and railguns. Fighters fly out from the bigger ships and engage the enemies and boarding parties can devastate the enemy ships from within. You can fire manually or tell the game to target and fire on the target for you. I find this helpful since handling the ship in combat can be a real pain.\n\nYou control your ship through two different control mechanics. The default one uses WASD to steer the ship while the mouse is used to target, shoot and activate buttons on the GUI. The second method is using the mouse to steer the ship. The ship turns along your mouse movement much the same way the default steering in Freelancer was handled. I prefer the former method in this game since using the mouse flight feels overly sensitive and I can't seem to make the ship fly straight or stay on target.\n\nIn combat you also have to keep your ship from taking damage and face the stronger shield at your enemy while also focusing on distributing fire from your weapons evenly enough so you can have a sustained stream of fire at the target. I'm not sure if this is the intended way to fight but I've found it effective. You can also enter the turret view to move the camera and aim targets around your ship freely, this helps you to shoot targets your ships is not directly facing at.\n\nThe combat is fairly entertaining, although like I mentioned above, steering the ship can be difficult and the default camera angle isn't helping much. When you need to fly on target it seems you have to place the target somewhere above your ship, close to the top edge of your screen. This is the actual direction the ship is moving towards to and it might take a while to get used to that. Also because of the odd camera angle I often had to keep the enemy "above" my ship to be able to fire the majority of my weapons at it. This just feels wrong, at least to me.\n\nThe GUI is what really bothers me the most. It's overly colourfull, oddly clunky and the sound effects are horrendous. I have a tendency to go for a "minimalist" kind of look when it comes to user interfaces and such. In this game the UI makes me think of children toys, the large plastic kind with full of teeth marks and bright flashy colours. Actually, now that I think of it, the overall design and look of the game is overly shiny and gleamy. The ship designs could also be a tad more imaginative. Even the large battleships just look and feel like one-man fighter crafts even though they are supposed to be much larger than that.\n\nOverall the game has potential to be extremely entertaining. I like it so far even if the things I mentioned above might feel a little harsh. I've got great expectations for this game, although experience has taught me not to, but I can't help it. I'm longing for a good space combat/sim/whatever that has the feel and openness of Freelancer.","May 1, 2014","true","5.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's not as complex of a game as they would have you think. In fact, it's quite easy to learn once you know the basics. I'm new to the genre myself and read comments saying this game is too simple and dumbed down. So if that's true then this game is a good place to start, because I had fun playing the free roam sandbox mode.\n\nLots of stuff to explore. Good controls. Nice visuals. Cool soundtrack.\n\nThe negative:\nEarning money is slow until you're strong enough to take on heroes. You'll have a hard time earing enough to buy a new and better ship (which is important). However, once you start killing those heroes for rewards, you will quickly earn more than you need (which in turn feels a little imbalanced).\n\nSandbox mode was a little repetitive. Short framrate drops when the game loads a new area in front of you (which in turn have lead to a crash here and there).\n\nIf I was to play again, I'd start the story mode instead of the free roam.\n\nCool game!","July 18, 2015","true","44.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has many of the elements the former Star Trek games had, Ship command, 360 degree views, power management, repair, officers, ability to go anywhere in the galaxy, trading. The great thing aboiut Starport Gemini 2 is it improves on all that with 360 degree freedom of the camera and space maneuvering. Its no longer 2d in that regard. Even in beta it feels polished compared to the earlier game. I can't wait for the campaign to come and I do hope someone makes a mod so us girls can play as female in it.

There are aspects of this game that are in need of improvements. Specifically: the point of view difficulties with turret mode, fixing balancing issues with mission level and mission difficulty, sudden explosion of ship which occurs randomly for no apparent reason either in combat or not, and a revamping of the money making process as capturing ships is the only effective way to progress due to missions and mining not being profitable enough to support ship progression. I have only played the freeroam with a starting zero reputation mod. I have played Rebel Galaxy before purchasing this game and found this game to be different and not necessarily better than Rebel Galaxy.

So first things first id recommend this title and hope you enjoy it as much as i did.  This however will just be a general impression not a rating or in depth review.\n\nReasons : I'm coming from the original Starpoint Gemini and really enjoyed it for its single player freelancer style of gameplay. I picked it up in early access which i dont usualy go for but due to my experience with the original i toke a chance, this was not a mistake though as the title has come along way since i originaly purchased this.\n\nGraphical: not cutting edge but still a really good looking game. fx to physics all of which are well made and are still being refined even after full release.\n\nSound assets : I have no ear for sound effects but they where up to standard, no odd sounds that ruined the experience.\n\nPerformance : Runs great. I dont have a uber rig, i run a very avarge system and this game runs great even in larger battles.\n\nContent: A good solid campaign backed up with a freeroam mode that allows you to strip away the main story and play the universe in the way you want to. So many ships that you wont get to fly them all in one play through i reckon even with a few play throughs you will find some new ship to fly, some new mission, enemy to beat up on. Also the ability to play as a peace keeper or as a bandit.\n\nfaults : no borderless window mode and lack of a multiplayer.\n\nOverhall: Solid singleplayer title that if you like freelancer / startrek online / x3 then your gonna be at home with this title. Defo pick this up and i pretty sure you will enjoy whats here and whats coming in the future as the team behind this is great and im sure this game can only get better.\n\nStay Frosty","October 13, 2014","true","16.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This is an awesome space sim/ fighter game in which you command one of many space worthy vessels against pirates, factions and even natural elements like radiation which will wreak havok on your ship and crew. There are missions, faction missions, mining and salvage operations, and if your more about chaos and destruction then you can go around hijacking other ships to add to your own collection or sell, its all up to you. Currently the game is still in Beta and the game has its bugs and balancing issues but the Devs are always hard at work bringing constant updates and answering questions from the community, which is a major plus these days. The game at is current state is beautiful to look at with many various galaxies, planets and space stations, this game easily surpasses other sims that have already had time to mature. Future updates include strory lines, more complex missions, and ships, also the list as the devs have called it is always growing from ideas of players and the community as a whole. So if you love space, ships, fighting, customization, looting, selling and RPG elements then this is the game for you, trust me when I say you wont regret it.","July 28, 2014","true","143.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The singleplayer campaign leaves a lot to desired, as the RPG elements are limited, and it is essentially a "fly here-destroy" "fly there" destory game. I did not get the impression of a complex game, but merely a simplistic space simulator, with very little depth. Worth it for a bargain, and only if you are interested in space sim games that are not too complex or fascinating. Factions only differ in name and equipment, and the presentation is shallow overall.\nOverall, this does not feel complex and finished enough to reccommend for a full price, but I would recommend buying for  a bargain.","May 12","true","24.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I am currently playing through the campaign but I am also conducting side missions.  The side missions include (from what I have seen so far): assassination of trouble makers, repairing installations, bounty hunting, and transporting VIPs. I mine asteriods and trade at stations frequently to balance my finances.  Capturing and selling enemy starships have proven to be the most lucrative transaction.  Combat is somewhat confusing at first but the games excellent tutorial guide and fully customizable control menu is very helpful.\nPros:\n-Good graphics.\n-Intense space combat.\n-Can easily change viewing settings - Rudder control"bridge" view, Rudder control third person view, and turret third person view.\n-Ability to purchase and upgrade several starships.\n-Can hire mercs and form a fleet.\n-Large open world to explore.\n-Many unique ways to "jump"around the map e.g. rifts and wormholes.\n-Story is ok.\n-Background music is pretty good and varied.\nCons:\n-No NPCs to interact with at space stations.\n-No first person perspective.\n-No ship interior perspective.\nMixed:\n-Fairly steep learning curve to become proficient with all of the games functions.\nOverall a great indie title!

Reminds of Rebel Galaxy but offers more control.\n+ Capturing enemy ships feels satisfying\n+ Looks good enough. I somehow love the battle hud(blue ring thingie around your ship, appears on some of the screenshots) and miss it in other similar games.\n\nCons:\n- Probably the worst voice acting in game history. Some voices are really irritiating, especially protagonist's.\n- Even though all ships are capital ships, you don't feel their scale. For example if you play X3/X:Rebirth, you do feel that your massive capital ship is a massive capital ship. Here all ships are basically the same size and you don't have anything to compare them to.\n- RPG elements are pretty lame\n- Story progression is sometimes very confusing. Like you won't have enough crew on your starter ship to capture any other ship (and start earning significant amount of money) or you'll simetimes find that you need 10 more levels to actually pilot a ship you've just earned. Or later in the game I kept getting way more levels than I actually needed.\n- Limited ship customization options. You can arbitrarily choose any weapons for your ship which's good, but its subsystems are predefined for any given hull and you can just upgrade them slightly via enhancements.\n- Even though I did rush the game in the end, I have completed it(without DLC stuff) in 32 hours on the hardest difficulty which's a little underwhelming for this kind of games.\n\nGrab this game if:\nYou want a little arcadish broadside-style capital ship combat driven by a campaign scenario.\n\nAvoid this game if:\nIf you're looking for a very in-depth experience similar to X3/EVE or physically plausible ship controlling similar to Elite. This game has a strong indie feeling to it, don't expect anything of AAA-like scale.\n\nMy overall rating is 7/10, I did enjoy this game and I'm really looking forward to its successor Starpoing Gemini : Warlords.","May 1","true","32.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

There is a story ark mode available and freeroam option where you can try and emulate a raider, trader, mercenary and more. Combat in this game is extremely satisfying and blowing up combatant ships nearly never gets old. Even though this game is slated as a finished product the developers are still adding in more functions to add to the replayability and longevity of the base game.

Huge space.\nShip customization similar to Mechwarrior's mech customization.\nMine asteroids, hunt bounties, play with the market, buy better ships, better equipment, etc.\n\nStreamlined user interface.\nCombat is good. There's several weapon types for you to try out. Rockets, laser beams and plasma cannons to name a few, each with their own properties and upgrades. Get on your gunship and chase enemies by their tail or line up your battleship and bombard them mercilessly. Your choice.\n\nExploration is good. The game gives the player a huge world to explore. Planets, space stations and shipyards that offer different products depending on their region. Planets and space stations act as hubs, you can't set foot on them and explore. Not as huge as Elite Dangerous but huge nonetheless.\n\nMusic is good. Too bad there's not much to go around. If you have a space exploration playlist then add this game's music to that playlist and play that instead.\n\nEconomy is there. Trade clean goods or contraband. You can take advantage of rising and falling prices of materials but the economy isn't deep enough to make it an engaging enterprise. You can mine asteroids or scavenge space junk while going about your trade route, I guess.\n\nCAN'T FORM A FLEET. You can capture enemy ships. You either sell them, keep them or scrap them. Keeping them puts them in your garage. You can switch between ships YOU CAN ONLY USE ONE SHIP AT ANY TIME. The closest to a fleet you'll get is by hiring mercenaries to fly with you for a price. Even then you can't command them. This is probably the worst negative point of the game in my opinion.\n\nLight RPG elements.\n\nA good space game overall but if you're into trading, playing with the economy or empire building then this game won't satisfy you.\n\nI bought this on sale at 80% off so it's more than worth the money.","April 3","true","63.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

So playing now, seeing that it is full release form, welllllll....it's still empty. I mean, there is absolutely almost nothing going on except for an occasional enemy ship flying in to a friendly territory that gets obliterated in a second. Other than that, nope, nothing. People that hate you, hate you and people that like you, like you, not much else. I thought it'd be awesome to be the revered space pirate captain who steals from all and gets in the way of people to scavenge as much money as possible, even between factions. Which is another huge problem, factions do not feel like they have bad ties between each other, it's as if they are both completely isolated with their borders set in place without anything in between. And there aren't even any huge battles as well, the closest one I got was between myself and 30 other enemy ships. So you might ask, "What is there to do?" Well, exactly what I explained at the beginning, you do missions, kill enemies, blow up debris and turn it into a station for some money, like, a little amount of money. And the most money you get is from ship debris -floating ship debris and destroyed ships- which on maximum with the stock ship which can only hold 45 units is about $30,000 maximum give or take. So how much does an upgraded ship minus weapons cost? Depending on your preference from the different types, a direct upgrade would be from 2-5 mil even though it can go higher to prices of 30 million. So with mining and missions ranging in price from 10-20 thousand, you're looking at doing this 66 times to afford a new ship and that's at the maximum you'll get from mining and missions just for a 2 mil ship. Yes, there are hero ships that give you about 5 mil if you destroy them, but so far I've found no real way to track them other than hearing the news saying they are in so-and-so region, and even if you do find them, they are at impossible difficulty and usually have other ships around them so good luck. Did I have fun though? Yes, I had fun in some parts when I tried to dodge enemy ships while firing, but after your first few things to do it gets incredibly boring.","May 20, 2015","false","30.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

What Starpoint Gemini 2 seeks to accomplish is finding a healthy balance of it's predecessors without leaning too far in any particular direction.   Make no mistake,  SG2 will take you hours to accomplish anything substantial,  but it won't take you hours to start doing something fun.\n\nWant to be a trader?  You can do that.   Want to mine for rare materials?  You can do that.  Want to be a pirate?  You'll eventually be able to do that.  Want to be the force of good bringing bad guys to justice while getting paid for your bounty kills?  You can do that to.\n\nMy 7 hours have been mostly spent divided between the three classes that you can choose from in the freeform game.  There is the Leader,  Gunner and Engineer.   Each class provides a fairly substantial difference on terms of feel however the common objective between most of these skills is all the same...   kill your enemy.   I was a bit disappointed to see that many of these skills are not overly helpful for more mundane tasks like mining,  trading,  or exploration.  Seeing as how the game puts heavy emphasis on providing you options - this particular part said to me "We're only truly designing this game with combat in mind".   While the other things to do are definitely not afterthoughts,  they're not quite as fleshed out and as robust as I would have liked.\n\nThere is a story mode but unfortunately the voice acting is horrible.  Normally I can manage some bad voice acting but found this to be a bit too much.  This turned out to be alright in the end as the sandbox aspects of this game are fun and easy to get into.  The tutorial or lack there of was at least filled with a pop-up tips menu which got me rolling quickly enough.  I had to spend some time rummaging through the keybind menu but after that I was off and racing.\n\nThis game still feels very young with a lot of possiblities.  My 7 hours is definitely not enough time to even have a completely firm grasp of what the late game or even middle game will be like but I have a hunch it's going to just be more of the same but with higher stakes involved.  Instead of combat with 3-6 ships,  it'll be more along the lines of 10-20 ships if the trailers and other various videos are telling a truthful tale.   Scaling of this nature is not altogether a bad thing if you're having fun with everything you're doing at the start of the game.  Essentially,  it's not going to mix up the formula a whole lot as you get deeper into the game.  Sure you'll be able to use more skills due to having higher energy and more points to place down extra turrets and systems...  but most of those tools could be used at the start of the game as well,  just within limitations.\n\nIf I could pick one thing I wish this game had, it would be co-op support.  Sharing a universe with 2-16 friends could serve for some amazing lan or house hold family fun.  Luckily the mod community seems to be getting behind this game so at the very least the variety of things to do will be getting mixed up a lot.\n\nIf you're still on the fence of this game I'd say just keep checking back.  Look at what the devs and the mod community are up to.  There is already a decent amount to do here and it's just done well.   If I had to give it a 1-10 rating I'd say we have ourselves an 8.2 with the clear opportunity to become a 9-9.5 if they continue to add features.   If you're someone who enjoys smelling the flowers and doing assorted tasks with some grinding mechancis involved due to large credit costs to purchase anything substantial,  then this game is the game for you!\n\nGive me a thumbs up if you found this review useful.","September 29, 2014","true","40.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicbush/recommended/236150/","magicbush","MaGicBush","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magicbush/","132 products in account","One of the first Space-sim type of games I have found fun in quite a while. The controls/UI wont scare you away and are very functional, and the game feels pretty polished for a new release. While combat only missions are getting slightly repetitive I find the combat itself is very fun if you use manual aim and avoid just getting into a rythym of auto-fire on locked targets. It adds more challenge to the combat and keeps it fresh every encounter trying to dodge incoming fire while positioning yourself correctly to fire your batteries and having to stay on your toes while aiming. I have been seeing a lot of threads calling combat "lackluster" or boring, but every one of them have been people using auto-aim and most likely just flying circles around the enemy ships haha. Of course that would become boring quickly, and the manual aiming is what makes me like this game more than a lot of other space sims that do not even have that option.\n\nOn top of the combat there is trading(though not really worth it right now, but patches will surely improve it), mining, and boarding enemy ships to capture and haul back for good cash or to use it yourself. Mercenaries have been fixed in the latest patch as well which I have yet to try so cannot comment on that(allies that fly with you and help in combat which you can control to an extent).\n\nThe campaign is pretty basic, but it has a decent story going on and gives you something else to do on the side when you get bored of freelance missions, mining, or trading to get into better ships and better upgrades for each ship.\n\nAll in all I am enjoying the game and can't wait to see what else is added down the line(devs have already confirmed they want to add more endgame with station ownership and faction warfare). And to top it all off you can already mod the game and there a few complete revamps already even though the game has just released. Highly recommended if you liked any older space-sims like Freelancer or the like.","October 8, 2014","true","44.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am an older gamer and I am very picky about the games I get obsessive about. This Game is not finished, but the available content is more than enough to keep you busy. This is not a straight up shooter... this has more of a quest rpg style where you can be what you wanna be. The game reminds me of a game I used to play way way back in the day called starflight. You can customize your ship with colors and logos and plenty of weapons to choose from. Very Eve-escent with the loadouts. Nowhere near as complex as EVE though... and nowhere near as boring of a start like EVE... you can start shootin from the onset - and if you do a little research before you begin, you can hijack ships right from the start... Remember boys and girls, strip the captured ship before you sell it! The content that is coming is intriguing in the possibilities... I have been playing it hardcore now and I am still not bored.

I just roam around and upgrade my (Weapons, shields, etc). Doing random mission trying to save up enough money to buy a new ship. There are so many ships with different stats, so its nice to find a ship that fits to your game-play. Like one that has great guns and shield for dogfights. Or huge freighters used for trading and mining. Also as you do more missions you began to improve your rank, What that basically means is you can control bigger and badder ships. Eventually you will feel the awesome power of Dreadnoughts or Carriers. These ships have more slots for weapons and diffrent weapons, just to customize it the way you like it. Also be careful there are high level ships out there. Some with bounties of 5mill, it's a gamble but if you can defeat them, you get paid bank! I personally love seeing an amazing ship and attacking it, bring it down to it knees. Weakening their defense and killing some of their troops in the process but before I kill them I latch the tractor beam and order my troops to board. If you have more troops (stats) then them you can capture their ship and tow it to the next star base to put in your garage or to sell for good $.

Hmmm it had a menu button that braught me to this screen, I guess I would recomend it, but this game needs alot of work still.. Has a bunch of unclairfied options and skills/perks etc.. and other actions that overlap like collecting loot in space next to a station , overlap the same instance on the main screen and docking at the station takes precedence, Plus alot of activatable skills and perks that are uneccisary.. but on the good side the people that published endless space is sponsering this game.

Not only can you see what various commodities are trading for at the stations you have visited, you also see the distance you currently are from each of those stations. This adds another level of decision making – is the extra distance you might have to travel for a ‘best’ price worth the time it will take to get there, or is a slightly lower price actually the better deal? A small thing, perhaps, but it does make you approach your cargo manifest a bit more critically when deciding on what and when to trade.\n\nThe second thing this encourages is exploration. You only see the prices for the stations and planets you have discovered. I find myself compelled to push into unknown territory on that never ending quest for the ultimate trade route. And the commodity information screen itself is wonderfully easy to use. The filters are a tremendous help, eliminating the need to scroll through every item available. Are you a miner? Click on ores. Love to hunt down pirates? Quickly discover who is offering the best price for those contraband items.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I’m a merchant at heart, not a fighter. But I’ve found the battles to be well-balanced and a simple click will tell you if that tantalizing enemy ship you have your eye on has the capability to turn you into so much space dust. Not that the knowledge will necessarily stop you, but at least you’ll know what you’re up against. And for those times when you do take on just a bit more than you can chew and yet somehow manage to pull it off by the skin of your shields, well – you know the feeling.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is addicting, and personalizing your ship is as much fun as creating a new character in most RPGs. At this point the only thing I’m hoping for is that we may eventually see a larger collection of avatar portraits. The new group was a nice addition, but as a female gamer I find the two current offerings lack some of the personality that the male portraits possess. And that something so minor is the only flaw I can find says a lot about how truly innovative and honestly fun this game is.\n\nNow if you’ll excuse me, I have a trade empire to build.\n","October 4, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I consider my self a supporter of 'Little Green Men', because I've always enjoyed their games ( at least the few I have).  However... I feel this one is falling a bit short, and I'm unsure if these are problems they are having issues resolving... or have just given up.  However... the problems that I've seen thus far, are more inconvenient than Game Stopping.\n\nThere's a serious issue with early game over powering of the enemy.  While I've heard a claim by the developers that this was a Development decision, I personally believe this is a Bug that they haven't been able to resolve.  Basically, when taking a mission which is marked at a specific level, the mission turns out to be impossible to complete even though your level made be higher than the recommended level.  Option:  Run and find another mission and hope this doesn't happen too often... but it will.\n\nAnother issue deals with Enhancements which can be added to ship's equipment and weapons, but the Enhancements do not actually enhance the item.  Note:  some... not all.\n\nLicenses, also, which should provide specific bonus do not work.  Note:  some... not all.\n\nOther than the above I have no other negative issues with this game.  It has all of the elements of a Good Space Sim, with many choices on how one wishes to play... Fighter... Merchant... Miner... Salvager... or even pirate.  I usually don't play pirate until I get bored with a game, but don't want to stop and need a new challenge.  however, the problem with being a pirate in many space sims is the limited choices you get; often being more of a headache than anything else.  But with this game I've seen the pirates (or more correctly, the Hostile Factions) have as much territory to operate in as the 'So-Called' Good Guys.  I'm actually looking forward to trying my hand as a pirate.\n\nThe merchant side of the game is IMHO as well done as it seems to be possible based on the many games I've played, and wanted to be a Merchant.  In short... I don't feel like it's Great... but it does seem Very Good; just haven't got a decent size Cargo Ship for really trying it out.  However... for the little trading I've seen and done... it looks like it has "Very Good" Potential.\n\nMining for both Ores and Gases was done in a very fun and unique way... which I've been enjoying for the most part.  It doesn't really seem to make as much money as Combat... but then again, this is a Combat Game; I just like mining; with a touch of combat to give me a reason to wake up in the morning.  But you'll still need to focus on combat fairly early just to get a decent ship for mining.\n\nCombat was a bit disappointing at first because of the mechanics used to control the ship.  I found it was best to turn on Auto-Fire on all turrets... which seemed a bit Impersonal to me.  However... as I got better with all that you can do to Protect and Enhance you ship in battle... Aiming my Laser became the least of my problems, and I was rather happy I didn't have to worry about that anymore.  But that is a matter of Personal Preference.\n\nAlso... the Skill and Perk system is fun; I like the fact that you can "Sort Of" custom build yourself for the type of Player and Character you choose.  I'm not a fan of being forced to play a specific character as is done in the Campaign (I feel disconnected to my Character while following the story line), but that, again... is just Personal Preference.  And the fact that I can build him the way I choose is far more important to me.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this game "To Me" is that Money, thus far, is maintaining it's value.  Too often in Single Player Games you find that Money loses it's value far too soon.  Once you get to your 3rd or 4th ship -or- 20th or 30th level, you find  you start ignoring ways of making money... and just focus on leveling... because there just isn't anything left to buy that you can't afford.  I'm current level 43, and still find myself occasionally trying to scrap together a few Bit Coins to buy that Blaster with the Extra Kick.  I find that once a game's currency loses any real value (or more directly; Need) the game heads down hill from there.  At the time of this writing I have roughly $17mil, and trying to get to $29mil for the next for the next ship I want; but not the last ship I'll fly.\n\nAll in all; while I got this game on sale, I would not have been disappointed if I had paid full price (assuming full price was under $40).  I definately would recommend this game; with hopes of certain issues being resolved.. but with confidence it's still a Fun and Addictive Game.\n\nEnjoy!!!","April 9","true","198.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can!\nIf it flies, it is there for the taking!\n\nAs a captain your first and foremost crucial choice will be your class.\n\nYou can either be a Commander, featuring buffs for your fleet, empowered strike craft, retaliatory attacks and defensive boosts.\n\nOr you can try to outgun the enemy by becoming a Gunner, who can specialize his offensive power by adding effects like disabling hits to his beam weapons, firing more shells with railguns, adding a higher refire rate to his high damaging plasma canons or boosting his heavy weaponry (schockwave cannons, missiles and torpedos).\n\nLast but not least the Engineer, a very versatile class with a lot of debuffs.\nEver got tired of fast moving corvettes and gunboats dodging your railgun shots?\nJust place a Rift-Anomaly and slow them down, then hit 'em hard!\n\nYour second decision might be to specialize in a ship-category, as you can boost the efficiency of your ship by spending perk-points granted every 5 levels.\nWhat will be your choice?

I've tried a few other space sim and space sim-like games such as "Galaxy on Fire 2", "SpaceForce: Rogue Universe", and (sadly to say) "X-Rebirth" and in my opinion and experience I have found them to be full of frustration and disappointment for me.\n\nBut Starpoint Gemini 2 feels very intuitive. I'm not lost trying to figure out the controls because the tutorial at the beginning clearly and plainly explains them. I've had few issues with bugs or glitches. Iv'e only had to make screen resolution/graphics adjustments in the game settings to prevent slight lag, which I'm sure that it will either be sorted out soon or my pc just needs an upgrade. I am also thankful for the leveling out command so that when I am upside down or slighlty off level I can let the game level me out without me screaming/freaking out. (Which in space, no one can hear you scream... lol!)\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a good space sim game don't waste your time on other ones like X-Rebirth (especially not X-Rebirth!) because S♥♥♥♥lso has a reliable dev team. So it's not just because of the graphics, controls, etc. that makes the game great, but also because there is support. I've noticed that the devs for this game actually care about user input/feedback and work on the game updates in a timely manner which makes me want to play more and get invovled in the developing.\n\nThis one is truly promising and fun to play as it is now. I am eager to see this game finished but not rushed and with lots of new options, features, and plenty of storyline/campaigns to play through.","May 20, 2014","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Even though it is in it's alpha phase, it still has a lot of fine points to keep me playing for the time being.  There is one point about this game that is going to kill it for me, but I'll get to that later.\n\nThe graphics are well done.  I have several hours into it, and have yet to experience a graphical glitch.  The ship models are well done and the stations aren't bad to look at.\n\nThe flight controls are a bit weird at first, but it really doesn't take much to get used to them.  The biggest gripe I have is that there is no first person view so you can't fly directly at something.  If you try, you actually fly over it.  Not that big of a deal and after you get used to it, it works out.  If you are flying mouse mode, there isn't enough dead space for level flight.  Your ship is always changing direction.  I ended up not utilizing the mouse mode and stuck with WASD.\n\nAs it is still in Alpha phase there are only a few different types of missions to work on.  These are called Freelances.  They are usually quick and easy.  It looks like there will be several different types of missions put in later on, so this isn't a slight, just an observation.\n\nAlso, the money doesn't keep up with your pilot level.  I'm currently level 25 and still can't afford to buy another version of the same ship I'm currently in.  I should have been able to upgrade ships a while ago.  I'm sure with the advent of other missions, the money thing will probably work itself out.\n\nThere needs to be more tutorials.  There needs to be something on Grappling and taking over ships.  Might be offered farther down the road.  Also on derelicts.  Try as I might, I can't figure them out.  I don't seem to get anything off of them.  I might not understand their mechanics, but since there is no tutorial on them, I don't know.\n\nNow for the part that breaks this game for me personally.  I do enjoy combat and exploration.  I've never been huge into trading or diplomacy.  However, I love games where I can create things.  Crafting is huge for me.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has these huge asteroid fields that if I spent years playing, I wouldn't be able to empty them out.  However, all you can do with them is shoot them for ore and then vendor it...for a very small price I might add.  There is nothing else to do with all of this ore.  Now, your saying...wait, it is still alpha, they might add it in later.  Well, I've read up in their forums and one of the developers has already stated that they don't plan on adding in any kind of crafting utility to the game.\n\nIf I could put a station out in the fields, and have them manufacturing ship equipment, weapons & and ships themselves, this game would be one that I kept and played for years to come.  As it is, I'm going to get tired of shooting random encounters pretty quick.\n\nAs a single player game, I need something that is going on in the background while I'm out exploring and building for the economy would be great.  Without this ability, the game gets stale, at least for me.\n\nFor most people, this game will be great.  I know that a good majority of people don't care to craft anything.  For me, without it, it is a game breaker.","December 12, 2013","true","31.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game has some potential but right now it is still a bit lacking.\n\nFun factor: You will have fun fighting and dodging enemy fire. Having troops board enemy ships and take them over. Looting dead ships. Seeing how different ships are and act. The joy of dragging a captured ship to a dock.\nUnfun factor: You are very much alone, yes you can hire mercs, up to two, but the only person you can talk to is the ship computer who in fact will only say anything to you do an action (move command, fire at will) or when an enemy teleports right to you. The world is pretty empty, NPC's are just sitting there really, and they tend not to do anything else unless an enemy happens to be around.\n\nThe makers have stated they plan to add expansions which will lighten things up, but those things are in the future.  They also stated they have plans to change things up, shields will matter later on for boarding and such. Time will tell.\nI have put in 13 hours and so far feel a little worried. I ran most of my time in a Frigate capturing ships to sell. I even in fact captured a battleship by running back and forth between two stations to fill my troops and relaunch new boarding attacks.  It took very little time to level, and as well I fear I may never enjoy all the ships this game has to offer in the long run.\n\nSo is it worth it?\n\nPositives: Somewhat fun, feels semi-polished, the devs are hard at work fixing bugs very fast, what seems like a bright future for a game.\n\nNegatives: World is full of things, but they might as well be boxes floating in space. No life really. It seems like the same type of AI as Minecraft. Seems a bit short so far even with Freeroam (world is open, no story).\n\nI feel the game's price is sort of almost right at 25 bucks.","September 28, 2014","true","16.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has everything that any space-fan would enjoy! Anomalies, planets, asteroids, nebulas, and tons more! You can trade, customize your starship, upgrade, and fight against pirates as well as enemy factions. The gameplay is unlike anything I've played before, in a good way, and makes it feel like it's ship-on-ship combat. Fighting in space is dynamic, involved, and intricate so it can be challenging at times but never too difficult. The variety of weapons you can add to your starship also helps to give the game a unique feel in combat. The game has the look and expanse of Eve while remaining a single-player only game.\n\nFinally, it is workshop/mod friendly!

This game has some potential but right now it is still a bit lacking.\n\nFun factor: You will have fun fighting and dodging enemy fire. Having troops board enemy ships and take them over. Looting dead ships. Seeing how different ships are and act. The joy of dragging a captured ship to a dock.\nUnfun factor: You are very much alone, yes you can hire mercs, up to two, but the only person you can talk to is the ship computer who in fact will only say anything to you do an action (move command, fire at will) or when an enemy teleports right to you. The world is pretty empty, NPC's are just sitting there really, and they tend not to do anything else unless an enemy happens to be around.\n\nThe makers have stated they plan to add expansions which will lighten things up, but those things are in the future.  They also stated they have plans to change things up, shields will matter later on for boarding and such. Time will tell.\nI have put in 13 hours and so far feel a little worried. I ran most of my time in a Frigate capturing ships to sell. I even in fact captured a battleship by running back and forth between two stations to fill my troops and relaunch new boarding attacks.  It took very little time to level, and as well I fear I may never enjoy all the ships this game has to offer in the long run.\n\nSo is it worth it?\n\nPositives: Somewhat fun, feels semi-polished, the devs are hard at work fixing bugs very fast, what seems like a bright future for a game.\n\nNegatives: World is full of things, but they might as well be boxes floating in space. No life really. It seems like the same type of AI as Minecraft. Seems a bit short so far even with Freeroam (world is open, no story).\n\nI feel the game's price is sort of almost right at 25 bucks.","September 28, 2014","true","16.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It draws inspiration from both Starfleet Command and EVE online without being nearly as complex as either one. Think of it as StarEVE Offline Command - the Animated Series - and you will get the idea.\n\nIf you are an experienced gamer in this particular genre you will probably pick up the basics in an hour or so, get a feel for the extent of the content in about 4 to 6 hours playtime - and feel sufficiently masterful after about 10-12 hours.\n\nTo enjoy this game you have to patient, enjoy slower paced exploration coupled with quick bursts of fairly asymetrical combat (both in your favor and otherwise) - and be ready to allow for a certain quirkiness that comes from game devs whose native language is not English. On that point the devs are super nice peeps who love to get feedback and talk about how to improve the game on their forums.\n\nLike most games these days, SG2 is evolving. I think what we have now is a solid foundation for many expansions yet to come and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.\n\nThis is definitely a great game for people who, like me, enjoy playing for long stretches at night with groovy techno / trance music in the headphones while watching the beautiful space scenery slip by... without the constant combat of SFC or the massive timesink (and perpetual 2nd class citizen status) of EVE.","October 8, 2014","true","55.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is a vast universe, seamlessy connected* so that you can fly between them without having to load at a "waygate" like almost every other space game out there. Sure there are gates and wormholes and all the other staples, but they're not necessary.\n\nThe starter ship is gorgeous, and you can customize the look of your ship in small ways. Combat uses a lot of showy glowy beams that seem to trade off well against each other balance wise, short-ranged instabeams, blaster/plasma-beam-ish projectiles, glowy-trails-having missiles and so on. Your turrets don't just magically fire through your ships, so firing arcs are a concern, and multiple turrets with mismatched areas of defense are possible. You can enlist specialists in your crew who cost you extra expense but provide bonuses, in addition to an amazing range of customizations. You can reassign power between guns-engines-shields on the fly.\n\nIt's currently an open-world, with promises of guided story plots to come. At the moment you can mine and take run-of-the-mill and short missions, kill this scan that ferry those. You can buy hunting licenses for different groups froim their enemies. The game needs longer more immersive plots, but the dev has already stated there's more to come int hat regard.\n\nThere's the controls. There is a wide range of things you can do in this game, giving somewhat detailed commands to your fleet and crew, cloaking, grappling (best to shoot the enemies' guns off first), instructing your crew which guns to shoot off first. It is... daunting... looking at your control customization options. I recommend playthrough with the control defaults at first until you find which controls you will actually use best in your personal play style. You will be using just about every key on your keyboard make no mistake.\n\nThat takes me to the tutorials. Just suffer through them they are awful annoying popups but informative.\n\n*this is beta and there's a slight hiccup when moving from grid to grid","August 27, 2014","true","126.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Hatched a plan... equip a gunship w/ a cloak and heavy shielding. Observe trade routes and traffic to a wormhole. Wait for lost lamb transport indy with no escorts ( they are tough as nails and heavily armored ) ... decloak, target, fire a grappler, boost shields and tear their ship apart until they surrender, kill everyone on board, towed it to station under a salvage license since it was an independent, now it's mine. All repaired and with a new coat of paint & trade license ( my main job, trading is awesome and dynamic, you need smarts and a good memory of hundreds of stations / planets )\n\nRight now I'm flying across the universe in a heavily armored trade / transport ship carrying passengers, 2 vips and sipping a tea on autopilot. 100 thousand K to go, it's going to be a long flight.

Have not stopped playing it since I downloaded it. Shows a huge amount of promise in terms of gameplay; the visuals of the spaceflight scenery, ships, asteroid belts, stations and nebulae are brilliant and very atmospheric. Even the icons and equipment images are polished and impressive.\n\nThere are the inevitable comparisons to games like Elite and X, but even in this early incarnation I feel that Starpoint Gemini has the capacity to surpass them; I haven't seen much of the trade mechanic yet, but have enjoyed myself immensely with the freelance missions and grappling enemy ships before boarding, capturing and selling them.\n\nSome other memorable moments so far are the sound of the engines powering up when you leave a station, or slicing up asteroids to mine ores.\n\nI also really like the dimensions in the game - the stations are big, but the planets are massive and I like that you can land on them. I'm about 20 hours in and have covered maybe a quarter of the map (and most of that was a fleeting visit).\n\nThe gameplay gets sticky on my machine moving between sectors but  this is only the Alpha build and I imagine there is still a lot of coding spit-and-polish to come.\n\nMy wishlist for the finished game would be to be able to reduce the number of turrets as well as increase them (have been a bit overly-optimistic with power management for my Myrmydon weaponry) and for alliance ships to stop shooting at my captured enemy vessels while I'm trying to drag them back to port.\n\nHighly recommended if you like space exploration/combat/trade games.","February 1, 2014","true","152.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

First, the music distinctly reminds me of some of the tracks from the show. There are no jazzy interludes, but the background music reminds me of some prog songs accompanying the space scenes. The music is seamlessly woven into the background noise of your lasers, phasers, engines, and missles. Most of the time it is barely noticeable above the ruckus but it is a soothing distraction during a long sprint across the map. It simply suits the game, perfectly conveying the mystery and the solitude of space. The more obvious callout to the tone of Bebop is the types of missions available so far. Most are bounty type missions and trading runs. All taking place in fantasitic locals with cool space stations. The game has a very awesome setting. And the scale of which really makes you feel like a plucky captain trying to scrape by in a much larger universe.\n\nAll in all I was looking for a game that would let me feel like I was flying a spaces ship.

The game is best described as a tactical space simulator in an open universe. The game in early access has no story mission i have found yet but a lot of small missions, exploration,mining and combat. The combat is a joy once you get used to the tactical use of gun turrets and weapon usage. The game has some really interesting ship to ship combat that is easy to get the hang of.\n\nGraphics at this stage are  excellant. Ship models are good and the effects are nice and are a lot more polished than what you would think for a game not completed yet. Sound and music are good with a nice musical track (although limited just now but will be increased when ame is finished)\n\nWould i recommend this game.

But one thing that sets this game apart from those other games is this:  Noob friendliness.  This games UI and setup is so easy/simple that even someone who has never played any space sims before can get the hang of within an hour or so, and that's FAST.  The UI may be simple, but it's still got the same flexibility to let you do what you want.  Every time I start a new space sim, I always think 'oh god, i gotta relearn the whole system again.'  but not for this one.  Also, that map UI reminds me soo much of google chrome.\n\nCurrently, the gameplay is extremely fun even for not being complete.  One could hardly tell, except for the fact that skill, equipment, and fighter keybinds don't work--but that's okay, they're all just a mouseclick away via the easy to use UI.\n\nI haven't played long enough though to figure out how deep this game is, whether or not the trading system is static or dynamic, or whether or not what you do affects prices.  I haven't played long enough to see whether or not the universe is 'alive' like in other games, but this is good enough for someone who wants to pick up their first space sim and not be overwhelmed.","February 2, 2014","true","54.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is best described as a tactical space simulator in an open universe. The game in early access has no story mission i have found yet but a lot of small missions, exploration,mining and combat. The combat is a joy once you get used to the tactical use of gun turrets and weapon usage. The game has some really interesting ship to ship combat that is easy to get the hang of.\n\nGraphics at this stage are  excellant. Ship models are good and the effects are nice and are a lot more polished than what you would think for a game not completed yet. Sound and music are good with a nice musical track (although limited just now but will be increased when ame is finished)\n\nWould i recommend this game. Hell yes even at this stage and i look forward to seeing the end product.\n\nOne other interesting note is the developers are always on the forums answering our questions and listining to our input and shows how dedicated they are to both the project and to their customers.","March 15, 2014","true","60.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But one thing that sets this game apart from those other games is this:  Noob friendliness.  This games UI and setup is so easy/simple that even someone who has never played any space sims before can get the hang of within an hour or so, and that's FAST.  The UI may be simple, but it's still got the same flexibility to let you do what you want.  Every time I start a new space sim, I always think 'oh god, i gotta relearn the whole system again.'  but not for this one.  Also, that map UI reminds me soo much of google chrome.\n\nCurrently, the gameplay is extremely fun even for not being complete.  One could hardly tell, except for the fact that skill, equipment, and fighter keybinds don't work--but that's okay, they're all just a mouseclick away via the easy to use UI.\n\nI haven't played long enough though to figure out how deep this game is, whether or not the trading system is static or dynamic, or whether or not what you do affects prices.  I haven't played long enough to see whether or not the universe is 'alive' like in other games, but this is good enough for someone who wants to pick up their first space sim and not be overwhelmed.","February 2, 2014","true","54.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Even though it is in it's alpha phase, it still has a lot of fine points to keep me playing for the time being.  There is one point about this game that is going to kill it for me, but I'll get to that later.\n\nThe graphics are well done.  I have several hours into it, and have yet to experience a graphical glitch.  The ship models are well done and the stations aren't bad to look at.\n\nThe flight controls are a bit weird at first, but it really doesn't take much to get used to them.  The biggest gripe I have is that there is no first person view so you can't fly directly at something.  If you try, you actually fly over it.  Not that big of a deal and after you get used to it, it works out.  If you are flying mouse mode, there isn't enough dead space for level flight.  Your ship is always changing direction.  I ended up not utilizing the mouse mode and stuck with WASD.\n\nAs it is still in Alpha phase there are only a few different types of missions to work on.  These are called Freelances.  They are usually quick and easy.  It looks like there will be several different types of missions put in later on, so this isn't a slight, just an observation.\n\nAlso, the money doesn't keep up with your pilot level.  I'm currently level 25 and still can't afford to buy another version of the same ship I'm currently in.  I should have been able to upgrade ships a while ago.  I'm sure with the advent of other missions, the money thing will probably work itself out.\n\nThere needs to be more tutorials.  There needs to be something on Grappling and taking over ships.  Might be offered farther down the road.  Also on derelicts.  Try as I might, I can't figure them out.  I don't seem to get anything off of them.  I might not understand their mechanics, but since there is no tutorial on them, I don't know.\n\nNow for the part that breaks this game for me personally.  I do enjoy combat and exploration.  I've never been huge into trading or diplomacy.  However, I love games where I can create things.  Crafting is huge for me.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has these huge asteroid fields that if I spent years playing, I wouldn't be able to empty them out.  However, all you can do with them is shoot them for ore and then vendor it...for a very small price I might add.  There is nothing else to do with all of this ore.  Now, your saying...wait, it is still alpha, they might add it in later.  Well, I've read up in their forums and one of the developers has already stated that they don't plan on adding in any kind of crafting utility to the game.\n\nIf I could put a station out in the fields, and have them manufacturing ship equipment, weapons & and ships themselves, this game would be one that I kept and played for years to come.  As it is, I'm going to get tired of shooting random encounters pretty quick.\n\nAs a single player game, I need something that is going on in the background while I'm out exploring and building for the economy would be great.  Without this ability, the game gets stale, at least for me.\n\nFor most people, this game will be great.  I know that a good majority of people don't care to craft anything.  For me, without it, it is a game breaker.","December 12, 2013","true","31.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I like the controls, highly customisable, flying star-fighter style seems equally as easy turret-based capital ship combat( depends only on the style of ship, which can be better suited to either, which is exactly what it should be). HUD and contextual control panel pack a LOT of options and info into a simple, streamlined system. Graphically it's easy on the eye, won't praise it, but there's nothing I can think of that would need pointing out.\n\nThe thing that would need tweaking is a detail, but impacts the game heavily, since it does with navigation: The waypoints do not say WHAT they point to on the map. Can't tell whether it's my active mission, accepted but not active or a completely new one. To be fixed ASAP, as going from point to point IS the game.\n\nThe only other minor thing doesn't impact gameplay, but would make it a bit more interesting:\n*Refine the weapon mounting system. Grouping them together for ship sides is a good idea, but it would be good to have access to all single individual mounts anyway, also showing where they are on the ship, Star Wolves style (since they avoid fireing THROUGH the ship, which is as unexpected as it is brilliant), for enabling a more tactical loadout.\n*Connecting to the former, make the whole drydock/store/exchange window bigger and clearer. As it is now is not very intuitive and requires spending at least a few minutes just studying it to finally grasp what half the options actually are, much less taking advantage of them.\n\nIn general, a good game even at this stage, just needs tweak and a good plot implemented. The latter would make a good game a great game.","April 27, 2014","true","22.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are a million ways you can outfit your ship and plenty of variety in ship types - how you outfit it matters, and the weapons you choose need to suit its strengths and suit how you will be piloting it to be effective.\n\nNot everything is perfect (I felt like the different factions were somewhat faceless, and felt like it was a little too easy to pass through hostile territory) but the small, indie studio that developed it is already planning on plenty of post-release changes.\n\nThe game has clearly had a lot of loving care put into it, and is a definite recommend.

I've mixed feelings about this game. Since I got it at a reduced price and it managed to enthral me long enough to finish it, I hesitantly recommend this game.\n\nI'll give you a list of things that, in my opinion, are well done (from + to +++) or bad (from - to ---).\n\nStability: +++\nI've encountered not a single crash. Good work.\nBugs: +\nThere are some minor bugs but no show stopper. Most of the bugs are only slightly annoying or are gone once you restart.\nGraphics: ++\nNot cutting edge, but there are some nice visual effects that improve immersion.\nAudio: +\nOk, but nothing eartshaking.\nCharacter development: -\nI didn't feel that there's anything that I really want to "reach" with my character, except maybe getting better ships. The skills are dull and consist mainly of "tier 1 gives you +8% dmg", "tier 2 gives you 16% dmg" and so on.\nHUD: --\nBad HUD. You want to know what kind of ship you've just locked as a target? Well, better turn your giant Dreadnaught around and find out that it was just some tiny gunship that gets destroyed by your automatically firing canonns before you can take a look at it. You can't really scroll out while flying your ship, so that your view is basically reduced to what's in front of you.\nAiming / Target selection in combat: ---\nThey really dropped the ball here. You either enable automatic fire, which means that all your guns fire at will at a target of their chosing (no focus fire), or you take over manual control over your ship's weapons and try to hit your designated target. Unfortunately, this is so badly implemented that you will stick to auto fire 99% of the time.\nMissions: -\nYou level up and get money from missions by activating the star map and click on a mission marker that has become available there. Missions are the entire content of the game. If you play the campaign, these mission markers may either be part of the main mission or they are a side mission. If you play in free mode (no campaign just pure exploration), there are no main mission markers. The side missions are repetitive as hell. Go there, kill that, finished. Go there, repair that, finished. Go there, take the item and bring it elsewhere, finished.\nRole playing / Character immersion: --\nNope. No. There's none of that here, move along.\nFights: +\nFights are often balanced, sometimes not, but generally they are somewhat fun. Have a "meh" from me here.\nTraveling: --\nPirates. Pirates, everywhere. Have you ever played an MMO where some frenzied rabbit may bite your horse and rip you out of travel mode so that you have to squish that little bug with one hit and then wait until you can enter travel mode again? Well, SG2 gives you some nostalgia here.\nCampaign: -\nThe campaign is nothing special. You character is rather lethargic and just stumbles from one event into another. You can't make any choices either. The ending is rather unspectacular. I was like "and now? that's all or what?". There are no epic story fails, though.\nReplay value: --\nSG2's replay value is the same as the reeat value of a pizza.\nCustomization options of your character and ship: +\nYou can't customize your charakter except for his skills, but there are some nice options to personalize your ship, which is nice.\nModifications: ++\nThe fan base is strong in this one. There are some decent mods out there that give you new ship skins or that modify game values.\n\nIf you can get SG2 for less than $15 and like the genre, go for it.","January 1, 2015","true","28.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Just Wow! I bought this game back when you could basically do a little mining and fly around attacking small craft. After coming back after so long, I am truly impressed in what they did with this game. I loved playing Eve, but not paying monthly subscribtions for months of mining, grinding, and training, only to get a Tengu and have it blown up in minutes by a swarm. Those days are over! I had always hoped for a single player game like this with a sandbox option. Hopefully, they might add co-op or being able to take over a space station and starting your empire, pirate kingdom, etc. They may have that, b8ut since I started playing the game I have been too busy playing to take the time to read the change docs. I even bought the DLC. I'm just so glad for the early access games. While I did buy a few early access lemons, games like SG 2 and 7 Days to Die have made the investments well worth the risks. Finally the type of space game that I've always wanted as opposed to the RTS type!  I feel the game is well balanced. I love the boarding option and the progression from miner to caputring ships to sell and hunting down "bosses" (bounty hunter). I get to the story line when I want to, as well as running side missions and other replayable missions (escort, assasination, etc) that pop up. The map is large and there are many factions. I can't wait to see what else they are going to do next!  A definite buy for space gamers!","February 22, 2015","true","75.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Every time I resume my game the first thought I have is that this is a great, immersive game. It's really frustrating to see negative reviews because I love this game so much. The developers continue working on it and it keeps getting better which is really saying something since I loved it at early access. recommend for any sci-fi fan that wants a single player open world experience with a ton of ways to play. It's viable to be a miner and buy ships and outfit them just for that. I personally spent several fun hours just doing that, it was great. You can buy and upgrade ships just for smuggle or escort or freelancing. People complain about the expense of ships versus reward of missions; these people simply don't get it. There are lots of ways to build your bank roll and the time and effort it takes make the game more rewarding and immersive. The balance makes it so much better as you progress, you can't just jump from the first ship to the most powerful ship or even the most powerful weapons right away, and that is good. You actually get to enjoy and explore each level of progress , as you get a new ship, or a new upgrade and you slowly work toward that next purchase. All the while playing however you want, avoiding combat in favor of mining and trade which is super fun, figuring out how to avoid destruction or detection while making the kesel run in under 3 parsecs. Or you can be a pirate, good or bad, hijacking ships with a ship optimized just for that sort of activity. So good. So highly recommended.","May 17, 2015","true","76.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

Which means credits.  Trading, pop-up missions, side missions, capturing ships and mining are your friends now.\n\nOnce you get you fingers trained on flying it's a lot more fun...fly in hard and fast and then slow down to stay on the tail pipe of your target, watch out for the explosive radius of your own missiles.\n\nTrading/Mining could use some TLC. The small cargo space and low margins on items makes for a lot of trips for those playstyles to make a lot of credits.\n\nA dedicated mining ship would be a good idea, with maybe a compressor item or mining laser enhancement or something so that you can fit more than 1 ore in 1 cargo slot.\n\nThe trading screens in the map could really use a mode to show best to/from, rather than a per-item best buy/sell, also remote buy/sell ala Eve would be great.\n\nBut trading and mining isn't what this game is about. The real fun comes with capturing ships and running the various types of missions.\n\nCapturing takes a while to figure out, I suggest youtube and practise.  Basically, grapple, burn the hull down 2/3rds of the way, transport your troops and keep transporting them as long as you have troops. After you get the hang of it, you take every mission around your level just to try and capture another ship.\n\nThe pop-up missions are rather generic, about 10 or so different types that I've found and they differ only in the difficulty of the enemies. Some are out-right free credits and XP (science, repair).\n\nThe Side Missions are quite variable from the few I've done, more credits and XP and more difficult than the pop-ups.\n\nThe Campaign Missions are similar to the Side Missions in reward and difficulty but advance the story-line.\n\nExploring the map is a lot of fun, it's huge...also more areas to find capturable ships and missions.\n\nOne downside, when you play windowed, if you focus off the game, it will pause. This is non-condusive to setting a long waypoint, maxing your engine power and doing something else on the other monitor.\n\nVery fast save/loads.\n\nThe fights can be quite intense, the AI seems to be aggressive, but not stupid, it'll gang-tackle you quite happily. The auto-firing works great, but I'm not a fan of the way it keeps shifting targets to closest enemy as opposed to the target you've selected. I guess I have to learn manual firing.\n\nI suggest staying with the Tauris starter boat, pick a weapon type, level that type up  and stay with it for the first 20 levels or so. The gunboat is a paper-tiger, so you learn a lot about dodging, firing, and your equipment needs. Lot's of save and reloads figuring it out. ++Shield Boosters, Repair Nanobots, Hull Plates.\n\n66hrs, 8.5/10 and am still playing. It's not solo-Eve, but darn close.","June 22, 2015","true","164.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Out of every game in my Steam library, this is the one that has most surprised me.  It surprised me because I hadn't heard much of it, and I got it at a very reasonable price.  It also has the polish of a game by a much larger developer, and depth galore.  Campaign is nothing super special, but there are so many side missions or freelance things, I don't see it as a big deal.  That said, I am pretty early in the campaign so I don't know how it ends up, could get better.\n\nI rate this as a must buy if it even looks remotely enjoyable to you.  Give it a bit of time for you to figure out the intracies, and for it to impress you.  Things might seem simple on the surface, but the game is actually just the right level of complexity.

You will be flying around undertaking side missions and smaller assignments, upgrading your ship size and firepower.\n\nFirst I will start with good things:\n+ Proper 3D movement, your ship rotates in all directions\n+ Huge map full of objects in space, except planets and spacestations space is full of ships of various factions and other space objects like solar power plants, gas collectors, prisons, etc. All of those obejcts come with few designs so the feeling is that most of them are unique. In addition there are clouds of radiotion of electric storms.\n+ In dept ship command. In addition to guns your ship also has tractor beam (you can pull enemy ships), teleport and marines (you can board enemy ships and pull them to nearest station to sell them), launch bays for fighters, slots for various consumable items (bombs, AI turrest, boosters, repair bots etc)\n+ Power management. You can direct power between 3 main areas of your ship - engines, weapons and shieldsm by default power if directed 1/3 to each, but you can channel it to one of them in order to receive +100% bonuss to speed, reload, recharge etc, at a cost of -% to others.\n(PRO TIP: always channel power to engines when you fast travel for +100% boost, since you cannot shoot in this state anyway)\n+ Large selection of ships and weapons as well as system upgrades to treak your ship as you like it, weapon types are really different (plasma are slow firing, slow flying, hight damage, hight power consumption; laser are 100% acurate, quick firing, low damage; projectile are quick firing, medium damage, fast flying) as for missles you can get some with huge area of effect or long distance small area of effect etc.\n+ Campaign is not so bad, but lack of options, alternative solutions etc makes it a less fun.\n\nNow to negatives:\n- Bad voice acting\n- Poor mission reward system - if you wanna by new ships and top weapons you better learn to board enemy ships, do it for few hours at start then start campaign fully equipped. (for example: low level assassination task will give you 4-10k credits, while if you board enemy craft, kill the crew and pull it to space station you will get 80-120k plus you will complete the mission), just doing missions for money is mindless grind and gets boring really fast.\n- Not involving space combat, this will require some longer explanation.\nYour ship has turrests, shields and missile weapons in 4 sectors (front, aft, port and starport). You can manually aim turrets, but odds of you hitting a tiny little black dot on black space around you are virtually none, the only thing you can hid manually are destroyed ship husks and space station with are not moving. So in order for your turrest to do anything you set them to auto-fire then they will randomly pick a target and shoot few bursts at it, then change target and go on. In the end during combat you can only select target and manually fire guided missles at it and rotate your ship so that more turrets and fresh shields are facing the enemy. After 10h of playing this is damn boring !!!\n- Not interesting PTE (power to engines, which is a form of quick flying), as to why it doesnt set power distribution to engines for 100% and has to be done manually for a nice speed boost is a wild guess. And you dont get this fancy visuals of super fast travel like we know from movies, it is just that, your ship flies faster.\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend this game as it is quite fun to play for space exploration for 10-20h of fun, therefor I advice get it on discount because it is not worth 40€.\nThen I advice you to learn how to board enemy ships quickly so you can make some good credits and try out weapons and ships.","May 15","true","32.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And it has some nice customization you can do to personlise your ship with unique colours and markings and abillity to name your ship.\n\nOverall i have to say i would recommend and seriously look forward to the up comming content  and i'm sure this game will give you plenty of hours of solid fun , just like freelancer did !\n\nAlso there is an active mod community and the Devs seem active, these are promising signs for life beyond the single player mode and game life in the  long run.","July 22, 2014","true","198.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

While in the current early alpha stage gameplay focuses more on "make stuff asplode" rather than "trade for all the things", the action gameplay that's already there is right at home with such greats as Starfleet Command paired with the frenetic nature of Freelancer.  Even if you aren't a sci-fi geek (EXCELSIOR!), I'm willing to bet that once you get past the learning curve you'll absolutely love this.\n\nWhere Starpoint Gemini 1 was rough around the edges and everyone talked in broken English that would make even the European Union cringe, this is a finely-polished brilliant-cut gemstone with actual English-as-a-first-language voice actors -- so if you're expecting your ears to bleed, then you're wrong.

Besides that, everything I was told would be in this game is here, and all the fun I saw coming back in EA is also here. This is early access done right.\n\nIn case you haven't read any other reviews, the game is very similar to EVE or X3 in sandbox mode. In story mode it feels quite a bit more linear, but as I said, this is simply because the method of presentation is just not my style, and you may find it's exactly what you like.\n\nStill, lots of fun, lots of freedom, and lots of beautiful, beautiful space in which to make your own story. Good use of your money if you like spaceship combat/trader/adventure sims.\n\nOriginal reviews:\n\n\nEven in beta, this is a good game. Not only is the game very playable, but the graphics are good and I personally find even the beta to be more stable and friendly to my recommended-spec rig than many full releases of other games I've played. Great forum community too and the devs are very open to feedback. There is not quite enough to do yet for freeroam to be worth $30,  but if you are reading this after the full release, then you should buy this!\n\nEDIT:\n\nWorth noting that the devs are so active on this that right now, only a few weeks after writing the initial review, enough stuff has been finalized or added to the current beta to probably make it worth your $30.

This is not to savage the work that Little Green Men did on this game, but rather to emphasize the positive bits later.\n\n"Starpoint Gemini 2" has some pretty rough areas. The campaign, framed through (sometimes yawn-inducing) text boxes and uneven voice-acting, didn't connect with me very well. There's an interesting twist here and there, but I just couldn't manage to care that much about what was going on. The necessary "gloss-n-polish" doesn't exist, especially with the game dialogue writers having a strange aversion to using the word "the."\n\nThe game's difficulty curve is lumpy and strange, with the procedural mission generation apparently taking into account your level, but not what ship you have. This is also aggravated by a lack of mission information. Especially with the campaign, you don't know that much about what you're heading into. It's possible to get to a point where you just "hit a wall," and get thrown into an engagment that you simply can't win without (at least) having gotten into the next class of ship. There's nothing wrong with this if you have some sort of warning, but for it to happen suddenly and with no advance notice is a kind of "fake difficulty" that I dislike.\n\n(I can appreciate a game that's not interested in hand-holding, but there's also a point where it all turns into sloppy experience design. "Freelancer" got this right by walling you off from taking the next campaign mission if you didn't have the prerequisites. "SG2" gets it wrong by basically telling you nothing aside from the story's flavortext. I simply don't equate legitimate game challenge with failing to communicate effectively.)\n\nI finally got to the point where seeing what happened next in the story was insufficient incentive to work my way up to a more durable spacecraft.\n\nBut here's the thing - the above happened more than once. This is where things go positive; That I got pulled back into the experience is a testimony to just how well the basic gameplay loop was crafted.\n\nWhat the developers really managed to do beautifully is to create an addicting "travel, do, upgrade, repeat" cycle that keeps dragging you back in. The space you fly through is nicely crafted, with a sense of scale that is large without having interminable length between interesting features. The combat is generally satisfying (as long as you're not in a situation where it's overwhelming), and the other game mechanics manage to be pretty deep without being clunky or hard to get your mind around. Other free-roaming space games give you all kinds of controls, and then those controls don't behave consistently (or at all) as you expect. This title, on the other hand, is very solid in terms of behaving intelligently when you give commands.\n\nIf Little Green Men Games built a sequel that was basically the same core mechanics, but with a far more refined mission (both campaign and procedural) experience, they would be in the same league as "Freelancer." The foundation is there - it just needs to be built upon.\n","January 22","true","31.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

It's fun to play and offers you a lot of things to do and ways to play. For instance, you can focus on the story, pirating, freelancing or trade goods that you either buy legally or gain by looting other ships. You can even specialize in mining asteroids and gasclouds and sell the gains. Or do all of the above!\nThe game gets updated regularly and now has a very extensive tutorial library to help new players get started. You're able to customize your ship's weapon loadout and, to a certain level, it's color and decals.\nThe only things I've noticed so far that could be improved is the voice acting in the storyline (which is pretty hilarious at times) and weapon impact effects.

While no longer an Early Access title, Starpoint Gemini 2 - as of October 2014 - is not quite the finished article. The game still has a number of items turned off in the options menu. Certain gameplay features seem to be half-finished, and the AI does not seem to be taking advantage of all the tools available in combat. In fact, many newcomers are bound to be turned off by the obtuse UI design and the text-heavy, non-interactive tutorials that spit out seemingly unending streams of text on things they have no idea about.\n\nGet past the initial frustrations, however, and you will find an absolute gem of a timesink. SG2 nails the three key elements of a good space sim: simple controls, a massive universe full of activities, and a million paths to success on your own terms. Starting off in a tiny gunship and a poorly-voiced campaign mission, you are quickly set loose and given freedom to roam the absolutely gigantic map to mine, trade, explore and fight to your heart's content. Veteran X players may be disappointed by the comparatively static world, limited fleet building options and inability to set up your own industrial empire in the stars, but everyone else should be more than satisfied with the wealth of choices at hand. This is more than worth it at full price, and absolutely unmissable in a sale.","October 19, 2014","true","25.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

This game allows you to change alignments based on your actions.

So much so that I got a SG2 background for my desktop. I feel like it really grasps the true beauty of space. The music is deep and emersive and it changes based on the situation in a smooth manner.\n\nCons: The learning curve was pretty tough in the beginning.

Oh wait, Captain there's something wrong.."\n\nHonestly, I like it. It's a decent game, it has a strong core and does have entertaining values inside of it. It's pretty, runs well on my AMD machine, and keeps you at least somewhat busy. However, there are some very odd issues and difficulties I have with the game, I'll list them below.\n\nGame is too light; When I say this, I mean that the game is not that deep. The statistics for ships is relegated to a few simple stats (such as hull, cargo and crew). I feel that if I'm going to be driving around a big ship, I'd wanna know more about what's going on with it's internal systems. What makes ship A better than ship B? Well look at hull, cargo and troop capacity. That's it. Where's my statistics?\n\nScaling for ship size; This is actually a big complaint. The ships don't look..big. They don't have imposing statures or good camera angles. They don't refelct how big (or small) they actually are. I have a small gunship and I'll go past ships marked as frigates or destroyer and I can't tell a size difference. That makes no sense to me. Sure, if I get within "I'll melt you with point blank lasers range" I'll notice a very small difference, but otherwise it's hard to tell. Reminds me of Star Trek (the show).\n\nLots of loot, nothing to do with it; There's a plethora of loot in the game. Computers, drugs, minerals and ores. ALL YOU CAN DO IS SELL THEM. You can't craft, you can't allocate them for energy on the ship, they are just fluff. They don't have any real impact on the game other than that they can be sold (and what's worse, caputring enemy ships is far more benificial). I wish there was an in depth crafting system, something.\n\nNotifications; The game does not notify you when you pick up loot, meaning, that when I loot a ship with the "auto loot" function, it does not tell me what I got! I have to go into my menues and see what was put in. A prime example of how this is bad. I looted a big ship once, got an AMAZING missle system. I didn't know I had it, it never notified me. So I spent 250,000 credits on a missle system (worse by the way) and then, while equping it, realized I had the other one. Bye bye money!\n\nCamera angles; Not dynamic, not good. No cockpit view. Sadface.\n\nNo real interaction with the universe; I will have to state, this is one of my biggest issues. Doing freelance quests gives you no satisfaction. When I'm picking up a VIP to transport, no chat initiates. It's a simple grab and go. Even the quest text is shallow. "Pick up A, drop off at B." There's no context as to what I'm doing this for. When I have a mission to go kill some pirate, there's nothing to it. It's just "We of the Such-and-such want Pirate dead". That's it! There's no interaction with the universe around you, it's all text and empty requests. You can't even interact with the ships system officers!! There's never a point where I feel truly a part of a living organism, I feel like the ONLY living organism in the game.\n\nDifficulty; Thus far, it makes no sense. I'll take on a quest to kill a pirate that's my level. Then I'll go to said zone and find that the pirate has two or more friends and he himself is listed as "Impossible" for my skill level. WHY? The game never notified me on what gear I should have when. The ships I'm going up against are a cool 2-10 MILLION credits, where as in my entire game play, dedicating time to making credits, I've made roughtly 800,000 at most, at one time. I read a forum post stating that some people ran into a sinkhole of difficulty, they leveled up too fast and the game scaled their enemies up too high, too quick. My point is, leveling should be more fluid and less wreckless. Don't allow me to level up to level 20 when I can't afford/fight level 20 ranked ships. EXP needs to be reworked, slow down leveling.\n\nClass "System"; It's strait forward and dull. No real custiomization other than "Put point here, see marginal benifits". It's like old school WoW. Funny enough above I listed the games not deep, but it has a +% based level system. That's okay, I get it. But my skills don't feel impact, even against trivial ranked enemies, they still melt through my shield and kill me.\n\nI could go on, there's a lot to complain about with this game. However, give it a shot. If you really like space-sandbox-adventure action, you can't go wrong here. But there's better out there.\n\n"General Statement. These are my thoughts on the game. Any opposing or likeminded feelings are welcome to be directed and discussed at me, however, don't be an idiot about it."","October 4, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In a nutshell, they did a great job on the graphics and the 3rd dimension in the 3D environment can now actually be used. They also took away the seperate sectors and merged them into 1, with sometimes undesirable lag but no more loading screens and the feel of a huge area to play around in. Big plus there.\n\nThe gameplay has suffered greatly though, as you can no longer buy/sell individual ship systems as would in the previous game, since a somewhat different system has been employed, but worse yet, there no longer is a significant subsystem targeting system, but from what I understand that is yet to be implemented.\n\nBare in mind though that this is still in Beta when this was written, but it should give a general idea about what happened. With Starpoint Gemini in mind, I am a little bit more optimistic compared to my last edit.

Its went so fast and so smoothly I hardly noticed it, though looking back you could be forgiven for thinking the alpha/beta releases are a different monster from the full, and you'd be right. Shortly after typing this I shall be making a brand new "from the start" video and stick the link here. Check it out whydontcha?\n\nAlso if it wasn't obvious already I whole heartedly 100% recommend this game. It oozes polish and shines as bright as Gemini's twin suns thanks to everyone's (with a special thanks to the early access-ors without whom this probably wouldn't have been half as good as a game that it is) hard work and dedication. Excellent Job Team SG2 (LGM, Iceberg Interactive, Steam and of course the Early Access-ors)\n\n\nEarly Access Review begins:\nDespite this game being in alpha, it plays very well and is extremely fun. There is lots of work still to be done to it for sure but with and active community and devs that engage with their customers this is sure to be one of the best space sims around.\n\nDefos worth the price, was worth it back when it was in alpha, doubly so now\n\nIf your still not sure feel free to check out my lets play on the game here:\nhttp://youtu.be/ePQn_QRItTQ","September 30, 2013","true","86.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

How I came to this game? In elite, I was fascinated by the cool-looking fighters, the dog-fighting with HOTAS controller and hype of Horizon. I soon realised the game was time-consuming and i was unable to accomplish as much as I would expected. I loaded up X3 (I bought during a steam sale) and started playing. This game also had dog-fighting, tons of ship classes but the main draw was the scope and depth of the game. At the midpoint, I coud lead a wing of fighters, setup space stations and managed a fleet of trading freighters. It was really cool but I spent way too much time and the graphics were not as cool. I hopped over to X: Rebirth and got a headache navigating in the engine. I hopped back to X3 for a short while and finally got to SPG2.\n\nSPG2 is a Space-Theme ARPG. In free-roam, you control a ship and navigate through a gigantic starchart map. You can pick up alot space-thremed missions, mine asteroids, trade between space stations and planets, be a pirate or police. It cover much of everything you can think of in a space sim game but to a limited depth. I won't not say it is a shallow game because you have a pretty good idea of what a space sim would be like after playing this game.\n\n+ Tons of playable ships\n+ Beautiful ship designs\n+ Space combat is flashy and exciting.\n+ Tons of things to do, you won't get bored of things to do\n\n- Limited functionality in several aspect of a typical space sim game\n- Reputation system, licences and bulletin news interface seems like a mere after-thought\n- Shield system is surprisingly 2 dimensional\n- No real space dogfighting\n- It is definitely not SPG1 or starfleet command\n- I had this feeling it is designed to be played on consoles since it is evidently simplified, not a good thing for PC players.\n\nThis game shines when you play at it as a ARPG in a space theme setting and not as a typical space sim. Its greatness comes from the sum of all the parts it has to offer. For its vast contents and production value, I disagree it is a poor man's Free Space.","October 11, 2015","true","65.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

How I came to this game? In elite, I was fascinated by the cool-looking fighters, the dog-fighting with HOTAS controller and hype of Horizon. I soon realised the game was time-consuming and i was unable to accomplish as much as I would expected. I loaded up X3 (I bought during a steam sale) and started playing. This game also had dog-fighting, tons of ship classes but the main draw was the scope and depth of the game. At the midpoint, I coud lead a wing of fighters, setup space stations and managed a fleet of trading freighters. It was really cool but I spent way too much time and the graphics were not as cool. I hopped over to X: Rebirth and got a headache navigating in the engine. I hopped back to X3 for a short while and finally got to SPG2.\n\nSPG2 is a Space-Theme ARPG. In free-roam, you control a ship and navigate through a gigantic starchart map. You can pick up alot space-thremed missions, mine asteroids, trade between space stations and planets, be a pirate or police. It cover much of everything you can think of in a space sim game but to a limited depth. I won't not say it is a shallow game because you have a pretty good idea of what a space sim would be like after playing this game.\n\n+ Tons of playable ships\n+ Beautiful ship designs\n+ Space combat is flashy and exciting.\n+ Tons of things to do, you won't get bored of things to do\n\n- Limited functionality in several aspect of a typical space sim game\n- Reputation system, licences and bulletin news interface seems like a mere after-thought\n- Shield system is surprisingly 2 dimensional\n- No real space dogfighting\n- It is definitely not SPG1 or starfleet command\n- I had this feeling it is designed to be played on consoles since it is evidently simplified, not a good thing for PC players.\n\nThis game shines when you play at it as a ARPG in a space theme setting and not as a typical space sim. Its greatness comes from the sum of all the parts it has to offer. For its vast contents and production value, I disagree it is a poor man's Free Space.","October 11, 2015","true","65.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm finicky about buying games, and no space offerings in the last few years have captured my interest enough to buy them. Now it's 2014, and two games in development have had me seriously interested: Elite: Dangerous and this one, Starpoint Gemini 2. I have to say, although this game is in Beta stage, it's quite beautiful and very functional already. It seems very stable at this point. The freelance missions are plenty to keep me engaged as the game begins to blossom for official release. Space feels huge in this game, and I really get a sense of a living, breathing Gemini system. Also, the MUSIC. It's wonderful, and I really love that there is no cliche "combat music" when I inevitiably run into skirmishes enroute on my mission. Developers- please don't change this. The music really captures the vastness of the universe, making it almost surreal. The game also lets you soak in beautiful surroundings and lets you play at your own pace. Sure, there are a few hiccups being that it's in Beta stage, like the occasional short freeze while loading new territory and a few framerate slowdowns when near a lot of stuff like asteroid belts. But those are so few and far between, they don't really take anything from playing the Beta, I highly recommend this game for anyone who is interested in space and space games.

Graphics, interface, play controls, sound, and music are all better. As it stands now, SPG2 is a somewhat plain but serviceable space sim. You can play in a 'sandbox' mode, roaming the system exploring, trading, pirate-hunting or doing freelance missions and work your way up to bigger and better ships. The game's 'RPG class' system has been implemented, allowing you to choose one of three captain 'types', each with four distinct skills, and there is an array of perks that you can choose from to customize your character.  Navigation and combat are straightforward and can be mastered fairly quickly.\n\nThere are still a number of annoying bugs and alot of memory leaks, so it tends to be up to chance whether you'll have a stable experience or a lot of crashes. Certain aspects of the game design (particularly the economy and enemy AI) still have to be tweaked and balanced. That being said, the game is still heavily in development (just entered beta stage) and many planned features have not yet been implemented. SPG2 is nowhere near complete, and yet I feel it is still good enough to provide an engaging experience. The dev team is clearly enthusiastic, determined, and appreciative of all their beta testers - they are definitely quick to respond to forum threads and e-mails and are quite good about accepting feedback and suggestions.\n\nI definitely think that Starpoint Gemini 2 is worth picking up if you are a fan of immersive space combat/starshiip command sim games, even in its early, unpolished state. It is an enjoyable, well-designed product with a lot of potential that will surely be realized in the near-term by a dedicated and passionate team of developers.","April 13, 2014","true","67.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The getting started basics youtube vid I found helped alot.  ship fights are enjoyable.  haven't ships are almost priced out of reach, and the game isn't real clear on the best ways to earn money.  selling cargo captured from enemy ships is kinda slow as your first ship has limited cargo... I wish they just gave you a starting balance and let you decide how to start you game.  I haven't tried capping a ship.  but i would figure turning off "Fire-at-will" would be a critical portion.  I would recommend this game if you liked the first one and also if you like open ended space games.

It's transitioned out of beta nicely, with minimal bugs, and improved optimization. The game has two modes, story and sandbox, and both are quite enjoyable. The control scheme feels a little like Nexus the Jupiter (but not exactly), in the sense that you're the commander of a large ship with various systems (and not just a fighter). Much better than the X series imo.\n\nThe game excells at allowing you to create the kind of space captain you want to be, and the kind of ship you want to fly. There are three classes, commander, gunner, and engineer, and each excells at different specializations. Commanders are great pilots, and augment their fleets; while, gunners excell at blowing things up; the engineer can create space anomalies like vortexes that suck enemy ships in, deal radiation damage to crews, or they can hack and shut down ship systems.\n\nThe ships are fantastic. Nearly a hundred different ships of varying classes that you can customize and taylor to your play style. You can control frigates and battleships - and command squadrons of fighters (but there are no fighters you can fly). Place different systems, weapons, and then tweak those systems and weapons with different modules. So, for example, you can tweak your teleporter to improve its capacity, or give it a defensive characteristic, and use it to block enemy teleports. (your ships have troops which can defend against and invade and take over other ships which you can later keep or sell.) Do you install a module with better accuracy, damage, or, for a little more money, both?\n\nFinally, there are a variety of things to do. You can be a trader, a smuggler, a pirate (raid and steal ships), or a fleet commander of some sorts. There are anomalies in space that you can simply go out, explore, scan, and document, and gain experience from this. You can ferry VIP or desparately needed supplies between stations. As much variety to the missions as in any space game.\n\nMy only real complaints, and by no means are these game breaking, is the lack of documentation (there's very little information available on what different game mechanics do, exactly. Which is frustrating, since they obviously took the time to put different mechanics into the game. For example, some guns do "emp" damages, or "radiation" damage, and no where does it say exactly what it means by this, one is just left to assume that radiation hurts crews and emp drains batteries or shields.\n\nMy second complaint is that there's just too much clutter. Don't get me wrong, the game is beautiful, but everywhere you look there's some beautiful nebulae, star, or simply space debry all around you. Your eyes get overwhelmed by the clutter, never are you allowed to enjoy the simplicity of being amongst the stars. You never get the sense that you're exploring unchartered territory, as there are ships and stations everywhere you go.\n\nAll in all, excellent game. 8/10.","July 14, 2014","true","27.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Anyone who liked Freelancer, Freespace 1/2, Elite, I-War or any of the X games (apart from reunion) will be right at home here.\n\nNow for full disclosure I grabbed S♥♥♥♥ couple of months ago while it was still in Alpha stage and initially I wasn't too impressed. While issues are to be expected when you are playing an Alpha version, on my low-mid system, frame rate and stability issues kept me from playing for more than a couple of hours and I left the game alone for a while until some of these things were worked out.\n\nBoy! What a difference a couple of months makes. I figured since it finally got it's nice new "Beta" tag that I'd fire it up again and I'm really glad that I did, over 12 hours in the last 3 days can attest to how much fun I've been having with it.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is your a star ship captain dropped into a dynamic living game world and your free to do pretty much whatever you want in a sandbox environment. (As of this writing the more linear campaign option has not been added yet, but is coming down the pipe shortly) :\n\nFeel like transporting VIPs or cargo from one sector to another, while enjoying the scenery? Check.\nWant to make your fortune by mining asteroids and junk yards? Check.\nIndescriminately want to blow up (Or at least try) any ship that comes near you? Check.\n\nPros:\nMind blowing number of ships to choose from (If you have the cash of course!)\nPlenty of factions to work with or against.\n3 unique classes with choices on which enhancements and perks to put into different skills when you level up.\nGalactic news and events that actually happen in the gameworld rather than being just Lore or Fluff.\nExcellent ship to ship tactical combat.\nPlayer driven goals, shall I save my money for a new ship or shall i upgrade my weapons and components?\n\n\nCons:\nUI needs to provide more feedback. (Not being able to see the target summary unless your looking right at it, is a bit of a pain)\nEasy for a new player to be a little lost when first starting out, text tutorials are not ideal, but they do the job.\nStill a few performance and stability issues at times, which is to be expected with the game still being in BETA stage.\nStill some balancing issues with certain weapon types that need to be fleshed out, Beams being the prime example.\n\nSuggestions:\nTrading - Someway of knowing where to buy low and sell high would be nice, right now it's a bit of a crapshoot.\nMission markers - How about different markers for each mission type? Would also be nice in the case of a point A to point B mission if the point B marker was a different color on the map screen.\nEvent markers - After reading galactic news it would be nice to be able to at least select a few of them and have location specific news appear on the galactic map. (Bob spotted in the smith sector, should be able to mark the smith sector on the map so you don't have to go hunting around)\n\nOverall SG2 is shaping up very nicely and I highly recommend it, with a great DEV team who constantly provide feedback to player comments, it's only going to get better and better.\n","May 4, 2014","true","21.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So I was keeping an eye out for a similar, if not even better after ten years, replacment for my space combat kicks. The vids on the Store page for Starpoint Gemini 2 look amazing, it seemed to tick all the boxes.\n\nRegardless of your Class you start with an awesome ship, it reminded me of B5s WhiteStar. It's a beast, easily crushing the initial waves of pirate scum who think they're hard enough. As you progress slightly you come up against larger foes and more drawn out battles that require a little more thought. You can upgrade your weapons or change them out, improve your crew to improve your boarding party and the idea of having a Merc fleet to command sounds great. There is a very solid foundation for an epic game here.\n\nCombat is on the whole more tactical than Freelancers wild dog-fights, although in fairness I'm not expecting a Cruiser or Frigate Class ship to turn on a dime like a Fighter. A bit more pace wouldn't hurt though. There is currently no story mode and I didn't think I would miss it so much untill it wasn't there. The good news is that it's yet to come, so that's really something to look forward to. For the the time being however, I'm done flying about on other faceless peoples errands as it really has no impact on the greater Galactic Goings-On. The Devs have done a superb job so far but they've a real task ahead to fill out Gemini and the players role in the galaxy.","May 2, 2014","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Plenty of missions to run, things to see, and fun to be had. Flying and controling your ship takes 10-15 min to get fully used to - but once you do the game really opens up and grabs you. If your wondering if you should buy the game I would tell you to go for it - if you like space games. I have not run into any bugs yet and am really happy with how the game plays right now. Early Access can be a bit of a minefield sometimes, thankfully SG2 is pretty damn solid as it currently stands.

Dont get me wrong, its an awesome game, but I always felt underpressure from my corperation and the fact it was a pay monthy subscription to play as much as I possibly/physically could. Due to this I eventually stopped playing and have ever since been on the lookout for something that comes even remotley close to EVE visually, mechanically and diversly. Starpoint Gemini 2 is the best I have found yet, and (as at the time of writing this) is still only in BETA!! Really looking forward to where they are going to take this, and no pay monthly fee so I can pick up and put down as I wish without feeling like I'm losing money. Ok so its not as complex as EVE but EVE was (imho) massivley complex and this game does just enough without frying your brain. Diversity is there, the amount of stuff you can do already without the campain is huge, visuals are breathtaking and the playable area is massive, not EVE massive but I ve been playing now for about 20 hours with 1 character and I've only explored about 1/8 of the map. Very well done on this guys and a big thumbs up on how much feedback you take from the forums. Its so nice to see deleopvers actually listening to us gamers and implementing changes directly off the back of feedback/critisims/ideas that come straight from the community. If you used to (or still do) play EVE, love space sims (or not) or are just looking for something to fill the gap between now and Star Citizen, look no further.\n\nAll in all I give Starpoint Gemini 2 9/10 and watch this space, its only gonna get better","August 30, 2014","true","59.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Compared to other early access games I wasn't as disappointed as normal, in fact at this point this game could pass as an alpha.\n\nAs far as the gameplay this is more of a you against the galaxy type of deal, you fly a spaceship, you may have multiple garaged spaceships that you own but (somewhat like ace combat in a way) but it is 100% open*galaxy*.  Normal gameplay consists of going on randomized missions such as assassinate, ferry cargo/passengers, capture ships, smuggle counterfiet goods etc, you level up/rank up and have a skill tree/rank tree.\n\nYou may earn money through missions, trading, mining (asteroids and other such objects), plundering derelict ships, and the best is to find rare high level bounty ships which earn you considerable profits.  You spend your money on new ships, ship systems (weapons) and system upgrades.\n\nSorry for the long review but I tried to explain what I would have wanted to see before I bought it (well worth the money by the way!)","September 16, 2014","true","19.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Looks great, sounds great, fun to play, everything about it is awesome.\n\nEXCEPT that it's Beta, like really Beta. While it's a fun as hell game to play it crashes pretty consistently every 30 minutes or so. It has done this to me so many times that while I have 11 hours on record with steam I have only actually progressed through the game for 6.5, so just over half. The main reason for this huge loss of time has to do with the save system. It's pretty stupid: you can only save while docked, and (right now at least) you loose those missions (not failed, you loose access to those missions as if they never existed) so every time the game crahes before I can save I loose whatever time I invested into the game.\n\nSo consider this game in an update or two.

They work & worked very hard on this SG2 which was even a joy to play incomplete in the earlier betas - constantly (like to the point of how do you get any work done?) reading, replying, and participating in forum discussions. They entertain ideas for how to approach planned features & possiblities of integrating new ones. This game is far from done in their eyes, and we are all excited to see how SG2 evolves over the long run.\n\nOh yeah, the game: The graphics are awesome. The difficulty is varied enough to appeal to everyone (I'm in the extreme club, and find it quite challenging at times). You feel the constant itch to explore as available ship components, slot enhancements, crew officers, mercenaries, and new ship models differ between areas - and buying a ship direct from the manufacturer is cheaper than buying 3rd party from a different faction.\n\nDon't want to or can't buy a ship (because that faction hates you)? Grind rep and switch sides, or just board and capture the ship for yourself. Want to mine asteroid fields? You can do that. Want to capture ships and sell them for millions? You can do that too. Want to hunt down obsure achievements? They're here.\n\nAnd this game is only going to get better.\n\nPositive\n+ Awesome community\n+ Gameplay rewarding proper piloting\n+ Mod support (check out sound, graphics, and UI mods)\n+ Craftable rare drops (blueprints) that feel as good in use as they are frustrating to get\n+ Power management\n+ Huge map\n+ Wormholes!\n+ Great music\n+ Interesting campaign storyline\n\nNeutral\n+/- Slow start - it's very hard to begin classing up in ships, especially for new players. There are guides, but there is a bit of a grind. I like the payoff feeling from earning your way. Others will just go get a mod that gives them 1 billion credits. I suggest learning.\n\nNegative\n- Voice acting (there is a mod that improves a bit).\n- Illegal goods priced roughly equivalent to expensive legal goods.\n- Trade market prices could be more varied for better profits.\n- Few factors past pool numbers for shields and hulls.\n- Unrealistic aggro (2 gunships will "think" they can take on your dreadnought and rip you out of cruise speed).","January 8, 2015","true","182.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Great controls, upgrades, options and visuals.\n\nBut eventually, it's not the repetition of missions that grows old, it's the feeling that nothing around you changes, you can't own anything, build anything, destroy anything, push enemies back. So eventually becomes very stagnant. I totally get the dynamic stuff would be hard to implement, but then perhaps an easier way to liven things up is to throw in some random stuff like starports getting blown up (then coming back online after repairs), or certain races getting push back into the fringes or something. You can basically just settle into trading and fighting between two starports and essentially, aside from the background visuals not being different than another area... that.. is all the game becomes.  It's too bad because it has great potential and I admitedltly spent hours upon hours playing this game (65 I think).

Unique gameplay, easy controls, especially when you're mostly committed to mouse and keyboard style gameplay, Haven't played in a while, though I haven't played much of anything lately; landscraping, as opposed to computer work which I've done for 20+ years, these days, am just tired when I get home from work, though if I didn't have a wonderful woman, cooking amazing food and keeping me enthralled with her ways, I'd probably game more, and before long I'll be back gaming and doing computer work. I love to work out-of-doors, but my skills are strong on the side of the technical realm. Back to the game, It is not too complex, don't get me wrong, I love complexity, but Starpoint Gemini does require quick thinking and reaction; observing it evolve through updates / patches since I bought it in the spring of 2014, the developers seem pretty intent on making this game something to speak of and they are certainly not ditching their creation, unlike other devs I've seen veer away from working on a game, not keeping to their promises.\nI recommend this game, for sure, especiallyl at this sale price, $10.49 as of September 28, 2015. For this price you absolutely cannot pass it up. To me, it is one of those games, I'll pick back up on, finish a few missions, upgrade my ship and be content, looking forward to playing again to utilize the new hardware and getting a feel for the upgrades and their impact on gameplay.\nCheers to the devs and all who enjoy the style of gameplay.","September 28, 2015","true","38.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

It is neither too expensive, nor bad looking or somehow broken or buggy.\nThis is a first impressions, not a 100% review, because the game is huge.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n- Fly around in space in your own "capital" ship. I put that in quotes, because your first ship is a small semi-freighter whatever, but packs quite a punch. Apparently you can go all the way up to cruisers, destroyers, carriers and stuff.\n\n- Simple, yet efficient trading system (X3 would have done good to use that). You can see all available goods for trade as well as best buy and sell prices on the star map and can automaticall plot a course to the desired station.\n\n- Space looks good. Graphics are really not all that bad.\n\n- Combat is interesting in a sense that it's a mix between flying and shooting yourself and also using several skills to enhance damage, survivability etc. I'd just have hoped to have more interesting skills to use. You can also use items and fire your heavy guns like missiles etc. The coolest part, however, is to just have your turrets fire automatically while you concentrate on evading. This is not advised 100% of the time, but it's neat. Turrets will also have fire arcs to take into account. You can easily see the status of your shields and hull and can high tail it out of a fight with max engine power. You can also distribute power between engines, shields and weapons, so that is all very solid if basic (whoever played Freespace 2 for example knows what I mean). I would have liked to redistribute power from my forward shields to my rearward shields for example or have some sort of pause mode where I could issue my gunners or fighters to target a certain area of a ship. Either I just have not found a way to pause the game (because I see comments that it was supposed to be a thing) or it isn't there. I also don't know if you can target different subsystems on a ship. So far I have found an option to target "ship systems", but not individual ones. It would have been great to target a ship's engines or weapons individually to disable it, but I guess that would be a task better suited to fighters than capital ships. There are apparently also boarding torpedoes so you can take over enemy ships. The weapon types encompass all you really need, from railguns, to beams, plasma weapons, rockets and torpedoes. I'd just look forward to getting a bigger ship, but the only bigger thing I see costs a million credits and money is hard to come by if you don't invest a lot of time into trade or something like that. The cruiser even costs 15 million! Long way to go.\n\n- The map is huge and full of different factions and pirates.\n\nThe not so good stuff:\n\n- You can apparently only have control over 1 ship (and some mercs) but not command your own fleet (maybe in an expansion or so I've heard), which is kind of disappointing, but ok.\n\n- Automated freighters. I don't see a possibility to have those either. You can own different ships, yes, but there seems to be no way to assign a freighter to go trading on his own in order to generate money while you do something more interesting, because seriously...trading is great and all but it IS extremely boring to have to fly the routes yourself every time...that is a ♥♥♥♥ing slow way of making money...but I think you can have stations or something like that at least...\n\n- The flight distance. Crossing from one point of the map to the other could potentially take a looooong time. There are fast travel routes, but those cost money...lots of money as far as I can see...that kinda sucks. There are also worm holes at least.\n\n- The campaign is...ugh...so utterly boring thus far? Go here, collect a core here, help this dude we totally don't even know or get to know...destroy a ship, bam 30 secs, go back...and all the while suffering through the TERRIBLE dialogue...I'm sorry, but this is definitely the weakest part of the game. Especially the main character just does not have an enticing voice to listen to in a game. Some spoken dialogue is even missing lol.\n\n- Scale. The fighting is a bit weird sometimes, because you don't even see a lot of the enemies you are shooting. At least not in the earlier stages of the game. Keeping track of multiple enemies in a fight is painful, because your automated gunners will not necessarily target your target, but whatever they damn well please. Also, the fighting is kind of weird some times. I've encountered an enemy that was apparently "impossible" for me to take on according to the game. I was level 1. I killed it. By staying on its tail and out of the reach of its main guns...really? ;) That was kind of anticlimactic...\n\n- Weapons and ships. I can currently buy some different ships and lots of different weapons systems and stuff, but it all seems worse than what I have, so either the game is not good at giving me information or there is no purpose in me buying new stuff. For example, I can buy a gunship for about 250k. That gunship has less hps than my starting ship, cannot carry missiles and has less power available, so why would I buy that? Also most weapons systems seem to deal less damage than what I have installed. That is weird.\n\n- Contraband. I once picked up illegal drugs from a destroyed ship. I was told I was entering an area where these drugs are illegal. I sold them. Nothing happened. Why can I sell this stuff at a station in a system where the drug is supposedly illegal? I don't get it.\n\nSo, take everything with a grain of salt, but I'd say the game is definitely worth the asking price. If I had to rate it I would give it a solid 80+ I'd say. It does what it says it would do. It controls nicely, looks good and thus far I have not encountered any real bugs. There is always room for improvements and I hope an expansion or dlc will come out.","October 3, 2014","true","26.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Looks great, sounds great, fun to play, everything about it is awesome.\n\nEXCEPT that it's Beta, like really Beta. While it's a fun as hell game to play it crashes pretty consistently every 30 minutes or so. It has done this to me so many times that while I have 11 hours on record with steam I have only actually progressed through the game for 6.5, so just over half. The main reason for this huge loss of time has to do with the save system. It's pretty stupid: you can only save while docked, and (right now at least) you loose those missions (not failed, you loose access to those missions as if they never existed) so every time the game crahes before I can save I loose whatever time I invested into the game.\n\nSo consider this game in an update or two. Or play at your own risk. Granted right now there is no story so you're really loosing free play, which is no real big deal.","April 27, 2014","true","14.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Many similar mechanics, with great ship customization. Maneuvering in space to get the best angles during a fight are fantastic, and managing your troops and ship's abilities and shields make every fight unique and fun.\n\nThe story mode has bad writing and worse voice acting as well as being quite linear, so I'm mostly using it just for the experience to get bigger and better ships.\n\nThe most frustrating bit of the game are the crashes. I've yet to have a single play session which didn't crash on me aty least 3 times. You'll be in the middle of a huge fight, and the game will suddenly die. The best thing the Devs did was implement auto save whenever you visit a space station or planet. But if you get in a middle of a big fight out in space and suddenly the game locks up, God help you.\n\n-- Edit: I wrote this mini-review/opinion piece a while ago, and the game is far, far, far more stable. Over the time since it was written, the Development team have been awesome in their implementation of not only new features, but bug fixes. The aforementioned random crashes are gone.

It was at that point I discovered I had already owned this game for quite some time,( which happens more often that I should admit).\n\nAnywho, I installed and was immediately overwhelmed with the tutorial making me memorize a million different commands and interactions that seemed to be mostly Jibberish.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealDietrich/recommended/236150/","TheRealDietrich","CDR Dietrich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealDietrich/","7 products in account","I wrote this review in January of 2015 on Metacritic.  I thought I posted it to Steam, but did not.  This game deserves a review.  Here's a copy/paste of my former review.  The game has only gotten better through expansions.\n\nI am a Star Citizen backer. Want to know a dirty little secret? I love and crave 3rd person space games. En route to searching for something to fill this desire, I came across this game. "A Steam sale?" I asked. "Twenty-four bucks?" I blinked. "I spend that on 2-3 drinks at a restaurant with the wife..." So, I plucked this one out of the Steam shelf, downloaded and started playing. Eight hours later I looked up and saw it was 4am. "Woah..." The next (read: later that) day I dove into the Starpoint Gemini 2 Community and learned I was late to a really cool party.\n\nDid you love Freelancer? Are you craving a 3rd person Space game? What are you waiting for...? Pick this gem up ASAP. There are few games that are so worth your money that you'll want to encourage others to purchase, but this is certainly one for me. In a day when space sims are seeing a great resurgence, it's refreshing to see a game that's not afraid to be 3rd person and give the player a bit of a relaxed take on space.\n\nI feel like a Malcom Reynolds, flying around in my ship, always with my eye on a new shiny, but lovingly holding onto, in my case, "Big Red," until the time is truly right. There's dangers around every planet, but I've got a crew, a purpose, seemingly endless space to explore (certainly more than my limited time allows), and a ship. There's even a fun plot-line to follow along as you make your way in the galaxy--or don't; whatever--it's all up to you.\n\nI can assure you that if you want a rewarding, relaxing, and immersive (but not taking itself too seriously) space game, this is it. I give it a 9 (I'd have done 9.5 if it let me) because of the somewhat outdated UI, and the graphics are not the most polished. That said, the graphics do not detract from the game too much and again, it's sort of a breath of fresh air of late with the Elite: Dangerous's and Star Citizen's of the world.\n\nThe development team has their ear to the forums and though I am new to the scene, they appear to be largely shaping the game around their community. It's mod friendly, and seemingly more so as time goes on, and there's already some great mods out there. It's much of anything you want in a fun game.\n\nCheers.","April 12","true","92.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Don't bother trying to be a trader; it won't work, and you can't automate the process like in X3.\n2. Along 1 above, the primary way you can make money in this game is capturing ships. Unless you want to end up outclassed, learn how to use your troopers and grappling beam.\n3. The progression through the classes of ships is well balanced; each feels like an improvement, without any of them feeling redundant.\n4. Each class of ship does feel unique, and the methodology of flying and fighting in a corvette is distinctly different than in a dreadnought.\n5. The different models of ships in each class are also rather distinct from one another, and will play well with different tactics. For instance, one ship may have great overlapping fire arcs between the side and front turrets, but have hardly any coverage on the top bottom and the back, while another will offer ballanced coverage over the whole ship, but can't offer the same forward punch.\n5. Ye gods, the voice acting is TERRIBLE, and the plot is a throw away at best. This wasn't a big issue for me, as the game is mostly free-roam.","May 6","true","29.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"starpoint gemini 2.exe stopped responding".\n\nI have tried everything, even resorting to deleting the game and installing to a different hard drive. no luck. the game is unplayable as docking is an essential part of the game!\n\nI'll update this review once another update comes along, but for now its money wasted.\n\n---UPDATE---\n\nThis review was posted shortly after posting on the starpoint gemini 2 forum.\n\nI have to say, the devs are absolutely awesome. I posted a post on their forum and within an hour I had a response by both email and on the forum by 2 different devs. I was asked to send them the log and dxdiag report, which i did.\n\nBy process of elimination they found that the autosave system had corrupted a save file causing the crash i was getting.\n\nThis is the first time I have had such a great fast response for a problem with a game.\n\n10/10 for the devs!\n\n--On to the game--\n\nIt's awesome! I have wanted to play space sims for ages since the first homeworld game, but there just wasn't anything on the market that hit exactly what I wanted. Having read a lot of reviews and watched some on youtube i decided to take the plunge on this... and boy am i glad i did, although i've only played an hour or 2 i can see myself being sucked into this world like i was with homeworld.\n\nGraphically it looks beautiful and although i have not played many space games since homeworld i can say its the best iv seen on steam so far.\n\nThe audio is great! not to intrusive like many games of this kind, but not lacking so much that it gets boring.\n\nAt present the only option is freeroam which is exactly what I was after. Do what you want, when you want! Although when the campaign is added it will be a great bonus!\n\nMods! its available on the steam workshop! endless possibilities await avid modders! there isnt much on there at  the moment but i can see it blowing up pretty fast!\n\nThe ONLY thing i have against this game is the tutorial... or lack of one. being completely new to this type of game it would have been a little helpful for it to have some sort of single mission tutorial or something like that. At present it only offers lots of reading.... and if your like me, reading isnt the way you take things in. DOING is the way i find easiest to learn.\n\nThis is only a minor gripe i have to what i have to say is a superb game. one of my favourites this year so far! :D","September 17, 2014","true","20.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","9"

There are several bugs that obviously need to be chased down and cleaned up, but if you are a fan of the space (trading) games of the past, then this will win your heart.\n\nThere isn't much of a story line yet, but the sandbox (freeform) mode is exceptional, not to mention HUGE!  Did I mention that the map is HUGE?\n\nFor a fact, there are more opponents, stations, friends, and asteroids to keep you busy for a VERY long time.  It's because the map is HUGE!\n\nThe game is more akin to Freelancer than to Mass Effect (at least until they get the story part released), and you have so many options to build and customize your ship(s) it's going to make GOTY for space sims.\n\nThe visuals are a little less important than the action and details, and you get to blow stuff up.  A LOT of stuff.  It's probably because the map is HUGE!\n\nSpend the money.  Buy the game.

The music is very good although perhaps some more variety would be nice especially for the battle music.\n\nThe story and voice acting is probably the weakest part of the game but the game offers plenty of freedom to explore space and play how you want to.

A real worthy successor for the likes of Freelancer and Privateer but it has so many flaws that it is very close to not being recommendable...\nI still recommend it though for those in urgent need of a space sim who don’t like Elite: Dangerous and can’t wait for Star Citizen since chances are good that you still will get lost in the vicious circle of just one more mission to be one step closer to the next upgrade/weapon/ship.\n\nLet’s start with the good things:\nI really like the music…\nok… that’s not all, there is so much to see and do in this game, too. The galaxy is huge and there are many (unique) space stations and planets to visit, missions to do, artifacts/blueprints to track down and especially ships to destroy, buy or capture. Yes, you can capture enemy ships – in theory – that is one part where the design just doesn’t work out so well, more on that later. You also gain experience and level up which will give you skill points and every 5 level a point for perks. Skills feel rather cheap and bad for me. There are 4 active skills (temporary boosts) you can invest your points in, each skill for one of the available weapon systems (railgun, plasma, beam and heavy (missiles)). So you basically decide which is your favorite weapon system and put your skill points into that skill. Perks are passive but also don’t feel that well thought out. Again you can increase the effectiveness of your favorite weapon system up to 3 times and then there are a lot of semi useful perks to invest in. Additionally you get permanent bonuses by getting (steam) achievements (never seen that before in a game...)\n\nThe actual space simulation needs to get used to, too. I was expecting a feeling like in the old games and even bought a joystick to get the good old times back, but that just doesn’t work out (for me). The shooting is turret based (you have chase cam and no cockpit view anyway), meaning you can see around your ship and you just move the camera freely and aim with your mouse (depending on the turret placement on the ship). Furthermore the hit feedback is so bad that I quickly decided to switch to beam weapons that are instant hit so I know where I aim is what I hit. Railgun and plasma are projectiles flying somewhere in the direction of the enemy and unless you are not fighting a huge freighter close combat you barely see if you hit or not and especially if not why not (ok, it might just need to get used to but beam seems the better solution). Also you can just tell the system to auto fire (that's why there are acurracy stats you can influence, but I want to play the game as space shooter and not strategy game like star wolves so I don't want to use autoaim...)\n\nWhat is really bad and I don’t understand how the design can fail so hard is that you can’t see your enemy information in the hud. Instead the hud is clustered with stupid, bad looking buttons I barely use (which I could easily access by keys). You only see the enemy information when the enemy is in sight and when he is close it is so fast moving that you can barely read it. So what is happening all the time is: There is a bunch of enemies closing in, you see them in the radar, you can target them (via hotkey) but you have either to start flying into their direction (which is a great idea when it turns out that they are deadly) or switch to turret and target mode and move your camera wildly to get them into focus and be able to identify their threat level. Both very inconvenient since you should be able to quickly cycle through all targets and identify them with one glance. Well perhaps I’m missing something, there even is an info hotkey but it won’t work for enemy ships, only for special objects.\n\nThe other really bad design issue is the character level system. You level up quite fast and the missions you can get (you don’t have to visit stations to get missions, you will get them while in space, which is good) show the suggested level you should have to take that mission. The problem is: the character level does tell ♥♥♥♥ about your actual strength. That only depends on your ship and weaponry. So this indicator is useless in the first place. Coincidentally it is also useless in the second place because there are types of missions that are just no brainers – regardless of which level they show. If you have maintenance or science missions you just fly to the target, repair or inspect it aaand… it’s done. On the other hand, good luck with rescue or capture missions, which are often impossible even on low level. So the balancing is very bad in general but luckily you can cheat your way out most of the time: Early game you just start your engine boosters and outrun every enemy, mid game they sometimes start blocking your boost mode but you can have a ship with cloaking device by then and just turn that on. Later this doesn't work and thats when you get in real trouble…\nTalking about capturing… first you can’t capture 90% of the enemies because they have a larger crew than you have (capturing works this way: grapple the enemy with a tractor beam, send troops via teleporter to his ship, if you have more than him you possibly take over the ship). You can focus on capturing by searching for a cheap ship which allows a large army of troopers on board and you can get perks or officers (you can hire 3 officers for your ship, by the way, you can also hire merc ships that follow you and certain ships allow to take fighters on board you can launch during combat so you end up having your own fleet) that give a bonus on the capturing chances.\nSecond most of the time there are other ships around. So even when you manage to find a capturable ship chances are high that it will get blown apart by some other ship nearby. So it is a great feature in theory that just is no real fun most of the time but satisfying when it finally works.\n\nOther weaknesses I like to mention:\nThe presentation is really bad. The main story has a ridiculous voice over most of the time, sometimes just dialog (not sure if it is a bug that voiceover is not playing because the music gets muted anyway) and sometimes just a text popup – atmosphere = 0.\nThe balancing of the main and some side missions is also a bad joke. You will be stuck for hours until you have enough money for a capable ship and after you finally progress you often get much easier missions afterwards.\n\nThe menus are confusing and tedious to use. E.g. you can either sell all cargo or one good at the merchant, but if you have more than 1 of a good you always have to go to the next screen to select how much of the good you want to sell (well everything!). And you will do that a lot because the screen shows if you are having good, mediocre or bad prices so you most likely don’t want to sell the goods with bad prices and rather fly to the next station. I think the ship loadout menu is simply bugged. edit: it is not bugged, turret handling is just another unintuive feature. Also when I unmount a rocket launcher I lose my missiles. The good thing is that I can store my ships with their loadout in my garage and can swap them easily depending on the situation (cargo space/troop count/gun power).\nBut the weapon/ship prices balancing could be much better. The next better systems are so expensive that it takes hours until you can afford something new that actually feels more powerful. The upgrade flow was much better/faster in Freelancer.\nLast but not least there are that most annoying situations where a cutscene triggers in the middle of a fight, you can’t do anything but the fight continues in the background usually resulting in your death or at least a great headstart for your enemies.\nSo there are many occasions in the game where I ask myself: Did the developers actually play what they created?\nAnd then I go back to the game desperately hunting for the next better ship…","July 15, 2015","true","45.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A bit more variety would be nice too, after a while of free-roaming, it might get a little stale, but that goes for most games, really.\n\nBad:  The dialog and cutscenes are terrible.  No, really REALLY terrible.  The dialog is cliche, and *hideously* over-acted.  And those accents?  AND NO SKIP??  And the game doesn't really pause during these tedious, cliche, dragging, unskippable cutscenes.  I've seen better cutscenes in pretty much any other game.\n\nGood:  Ships.  Mostly.  They're all quite recognizable, and have a lot of variety.  Once you know the ships, you can see a silhouette of most of them from most angles, and be able to ID the specific ship, or at least class.  Nexus ships a couple others in particular are EASY to spot.  Transports less so, but their class is obvious, so no matter.\n\nBad:  Firing arcs.  These are SPACE ships, they should have minimal blind spots.  They are not floating in an ocean, they need coverage above and below.\n\nBad:  There is a single "best" weapon, DPS-wise?  The stats show that, anyway.  Beams tickle, the only NPC weapons that seem to DO anything are rails and plasma.  This balance state made it out of early access?\n\nBad:  Map and space design.  Freelancer got this right, and they had space with "too much" stuff in it.  The SG2 single solar system is both incredibly too small and insanely crowded.  It would be fine for say, underwater on an ocean planet, but for "outer space" it's just crowded.  And the "movement" field for dust floating past makes it feel like a fish tank with a broken filter and a bunch of pooping fish.\n\nSpace Engineers and EVE and to a lesser extent Freelancer made the game FEEL spacious.  SG2 is a lot of LARGE factions crammed into a small fish tank with a bunch of stuff floating in the water.\n\nBad:  I finally managed to get a ST-drive, yay!  ...Only to find that it doesn't actually work?  *All* the things should be working before the EA tag comes off.  At least implemented in some state.","January 3, 2015","true","36.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The freeroam aspect is awesome and the ability to break away from whatever you are doing to pursue an enemy, deliver some goods, or just mess around compares to games like the X series. Every ship in the game is flyable and upgradable, and the gameplay is heavily impacted by an RPG skillset and perks that you earn by leveling up.

There are several bugs that obviously need to be chased down and cleaned up, but if you are a fan of the space (trading) games of the past, then this will win your heart.\n\nThere isn't much of a story line yet, but the sandbox (freeform) mode is exceptional, not to mention HUGE!  Did I mention that the map is HUGE?\n\nFor a fact, there are more opponents, stations, friends, and asteroids to keep you busy for a VERY long time.  It's because the map is HUGE!\n\nThe game is more akin to Freelancer than to Mass Effect (at least until they get the story part released), and you have so many options to build and customize your ship(s) it's going to make GOTY for space sims.\n\nThe visuals are a little less important than the action and details, and you get to blow stuff up.  A LOT of stuff.  It's probably because the map is HUGE!\n\nSpend the money.  Buy the game.

It really isn't a game that I can sit and dump 8 hours into daily like some of the other games I've played, but it is fun to come back to it every once in a while and get my "freelancer" fix for the week. I personally found this game to be pretty fun when in sandbox/exploration mode. Story mode on the other hand.. was poorly completed, I believe I spent about 20 minutes in, and dumped it due to the appalling voice acting and poorly scripted story.\nNow for sandbox I loved flying around blasting and capturing ships to sell at the local stations. I loved upgrading my ship from the inventories of captured  ships. I'm always looking for the shield or weapon improvment. I loved exploring the map and seeing all the cool spacial anomalies. UnfortunateIy, though I did find some general weaknesses in the way content is utilized in the game, there are only a handful of side mission types such as capture ship A, Destroy ship B, or Haul element C these side missions do get old pretty quickly and is a main reason why I cannot dump countless hours into the game in one sitting. Sometimes I also receive missions I have no way in hell of completing, the AI levels way faster than I do... I'll be level 4 with missions that are level 12 around the beginning area. It's ok as you can just drop the mission, but is kinda annoying all the same.\n\nOverall, I find the game to be pretty engaging when played casually, but any longer than a couple of hours and I'm ready for something else. I've been looking at Elite: Dangerous but it looks like a tremendous amount of tedious work to play, just from peoples reviews, that and it's much more expensive.\n\nTo the developer: I really hope you guys haven't given up on this game now that it's considered "Complete" there is still a tremendous amount of possibilities with it, and I would love to see more content(More engaging space stations, etc.) Thanks a ton for creating a game that allows me to get my space sim fix when I feel the urge.\n\nRatings\nGraphics: 8/10\nStory: 4/10\nGame Play: 9/10\nOverall: 7/10","October 20, 2015","true","46.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

It is a vast improvement over the previous title in the series and successfully creates a fun space sim experience with some rpg progression for your character.\n\nInitially after release the game was somewhat buggy, but the developers have ironed out the rough edges and even successfully adapted most of the user interface for gamepad control. Thus far I have spent most of my time in the sandbox mode, but I have recently begun the story playthrough. Both modes are fun to play with the story mode featuring a rather standard, but competently-executed space sim plot. Best of all is that steam workshop is available for the game and there have been many great mods that improve aspects of the gameplay as well as those that create custom content.\n\nThere is a good diversity of ships and weaponry in the game, with ship types ranging from small gunships and shuttle craft up to battleship size vessels available to be purchased. You can also hire officers who confer stat bonuses and other ships piloted by mercenaries to join you. There are numerous ways to make money including a robust trading economy, asteroids to mine, spatial phenomena to explore, odd jobs to be done, transport/taxi missions, and of course bounty hunter missions.\n\nCombat is satisfying, though you certainly feel like more of a ship commander than a pilot. This is probably due to the game's third person perspective which suits the game well because most of the ships you will use are more like capital ships than fighters.\n\nTo sum it up, this is one of the best single player space sim/rpg's to come out in a very long time.

I am an avid player of sci fi games, medieval, simulation battle and strategy. I play games so much I do not have any other form of life except work and games. I do stay in shape as I work out a lot. I can practically tell you exactly how to make a good game and it will be a #1 top seller, I have even made games myself constucting whole citys and governments with plots and story lines along with political agendas on governments and war. This Starpoint Gemini is very promising and is a good game. Couple of pointers to the developers, you should have ships hunt you down as if looking for you and then take off before being destoyed. Somone you can recognize that you have seen before but make some what elusive so he/she can come back again to hunt you from a jurisdiction you are not welcomed of course, but this should be once in great while not an everytime thing. Another thing is that when you get high level in the game all you see is big hard ships all the time, almost no small ones. In the begining you would see them a lot. I am level 80 and it does not seem to be going any highier(no complaints). But sometimes you exit from a station or a star gate and you are jumped by a horde of big ships just out of the blue(c'mon a little ridiculouse at times)it happens often and half the time you dont stand a chance unless you have big hired mercenarys that are expensive to maintain, which does take a big toll on the money you make. Sometimes you fall behind unless you really try to keep up the hustle and bustle of making money, then its more stress instead of pure enjoyment to try and keep good powerfull mercenarys at youre side. You should fan it out more to where at least 50% of the time there are still smaller groups of ships, or one or two important people(hunters) that show up to hunt you like I said previously, Instaed of being mobbed by a lot of big powerfull ships all the time. There still needs to be smaller ships around of all sizes. All I see now are big ships everywhere and almost no small ones traversing through space or hanging out at space stations. Its almost as if everybodys super rich now and got dreadnaughts and carriers becouse I am level 80 now. You need to tone that down to be more normal. If you did that the game would excell in greatness, otherwise that is a major downfall. But I do see it getting bigger more powerfull ships to attack you as you are highier in level that makes sense, but overall it needs to be re-worked to how i mentioned previously, thank you...... Several hours later on re-editing, I am now back to write what I said. There is more randomness, I guess i was just to fast to express at 80th level. I went back in different parts of the galaxy, it does get heavy at times and then again light on battles just depends. Also what i like is there are also missions you can take that can be much lower than youre level and also much highier. There still needs to  be ones that hunt you down and occasionally escape to come back another time but with a name to them you can recognize. May i also add i have not played the story line yet and am looking forward to it, its just in the free roam you can choose other characters instead of bieng stuck with the same story line one. Overall its all good and was very enjoyable playing. Would be nice to have another dozen songs in the game, the music is similar to eve music which I liked a lot when I played eve back in 2009.","April 30, 2015","true","327.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

The former will take hours before you can buy your next ship, the latter will take minutes.  Rinse and repeat and winthin one afternoon you have the biggest, baddest ship with all the best hardware.\n\nThere's no variation across the map: each sector feels identical.  I guess in real life the universe is very homogenous but you probably shouldn't use WMAP as your basis for a space RPG.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty dull.  You can tell the actors aren't at all enthused by the story and nor was I.\n\nPros:\nYou can adjust the power balance of your shelds, weapons and engines, giving you a more hands on approach to aggresion, defence and running away.\n\nEach weapon and shield module has its own power and can be drained if over taxed during a fight, forcing you to keep manouvering to keep your better charged side towards the enemy.  This makes the big lumbering ships more interesting to play.\n\nYou can take your unstoppable death machine, paint it shiny pink and name it "Winnie the Pooh".\n\nSummary:\nThe game world is too big and too bland.  If the devs had put the effort into writing a better story and varying the world rather than inflating it, this game could be great.  Otherwise it feels more like work than fun.","August 30, 2015","false","32.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","2"

I'm still new to ship's customization but there seems to be plenty of options, and I really can't wait to buy a better/bigger ship.

Can only imagine how good it could be if it supported a multiplayer PU and had an optional cockpit/bridge view.\nTo early to call yet, but this game shows so much potential I think I can rate it in my top 5 space sims.\nAnyhow having a blast so far and excited to see how the finished product plays!\n\nEdit 8th of October 2014 My first impressions of SPG2 was that it might make my favourite top 5 space sims… it has the potential but it lacks a few vital essentials like a functional overview such as Freelancer. I was probably more than 20 hours into my early access when I realized just how much I missed it.\nIt’s no game breaker but having played Freelancer for well over 1500hrs and EVE online for much more you quickly realize just how much it holds the game back from being so much better. I’ve put some 140 hrs into the game (including beta) and I’m far from finished with it.\n\nThe good news is that some serious HUD tweaks are coming... the DEV’s have worked  tirelessly to address a few bugs that appeared at launch and they’ve been responding to some imbalance issues relating to levelling, the game having only been released a few weeks ago is already feeling much better!\n\nVisually the game scores 9/10    Just beautiful!\n\nSoundtrack 9/10      Really great soundtrack.\n\nStoryline 6/10     Story was OK, I just didn’t get into it. Just dialogue, no character cut scenes at all.\n\nVoice acting 6/10  Some were hilarious they were so bad.\n\nGameplay 8/10  Some solid gameplay mechanics, easy to get into but hard to master.\n\nReplay ability 9/10  I got my money’s worth just playing the Beta early access!\n\nGeneral Content 9/10  Some real quality ships, gear, missions, bounties, capture ship gameplay etc…\n\nLGM Dev’s 10/10 Never come across such a great team working so hard with so little.\n\nI just finished the story mode… overall I enjoyed it, I’ve still got a few high bounties to go after and I haven’t explored all of the map. The game as far as the DEV’s are concerned isn’t finished they have a big wish list of features they still hope to implement and honestly I can’t wait.\n\nStarpoint Gemini 2 easily makes it into my top 10 space sim games and if you’e looking for something to fill the void while we wait for Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous etc Just get it already.\n\nSPG2 will keep on getting better as they go and I’m looking forward to it and new content.","September 22, 2014","true","145.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The developers are keeping the campaign under wraps until release, so I don't have enough information to say how well it all ties together. I will say that the game is playable, as is, without the campaign.

While Starpoint Gemini 2 comes close, it's not... quite... there yet. This game is still in development (just recently in beta), so bear that in mind.\n\nAll of the pieces are there - free roaming, trading, space battles - however, SG2 seems to fall flat a key area - ship movement. The starting vessel, a frigate, I believe, looks like a fish, moves like a fish, but steers like a cow. Most combat is spent circling around trying to get a bead on your enemy for about 1/2 a second before they move out of view once more. By that point, his buddy has been firing lasers up your butt. I'm a space combat noob with this game, but even Freelancer felt like it had more "zip" to ship movement. I had to crank the mouse sensitivity just to feel like there was some kind of response to the controls.\n\nGraphically, it's quite nice. Ships, planets, stations and space "stuff" is lovely to look at.\n\nThe game requires some optimization. When you are in a serious furball with many other ships, I find that the game really chugs and slows down - even if you are not involved in the combat, and it's just nearby.\n\nThe game is not multiplayer, and I am not clear on whether or not it is ever going to be multiplayer. That is also a major wall for a lot of people. Freelancer was great. Freelancer with friends was amazing.\n\nThis is not a Freelancer replacement, though it comes close. If you're not concerned about a multiplayer experience, you're not going to find a game that delivers what this one does at this price point. However, I would wait for later in the beta cycle or even for wide release. It's not quite ready for prime time.","March 25, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gfx, sfx and music is majestic and gameplay is easy to learn and fun.\n\nI started free roaming after the intros screens just to get a sense of the game. And i was blown away how easy the ship was to controll with the mouse. (you can choose gamepad if you want) Love the ui in the game. Anway i started free roaming and collected stuff from junk out in space and traded them at nearest planet. And i really feelt like being a pilot in space trading to earn my living, its hard to explain but this game just took me by storm instant.\n\nI know that alot of thing may change further ingame but i feelt i had to type somthing. I will continue this after 10-30hrs or more of gameplay.

Meanwhile spend that ill gotten cash to upgrade ship systems, buy fancier guns, and stock up on consumables to give your ship an edge in a fight, or i suppose help miners in their tedious rock popping. Hire troops for the wetwork, bridge officers for passive bonuses, and later on mercenary captains to back you up in a fight. Remember, it's OK to leave them to die.  Ultimately earn enough (or take over!) that fancy new ship you've been eying. There are also purchasable licenses for financial perks like earning extra credits when killing certain factions or cheaper goods from a certain corporation, even passive credits per month so you can sit around and do squat and still earn money just like the one percenter you are.\n\nExploration stays enjoyable by providing several modes of travel.  Pay to use an established warp gate (there's a way to make a one time license purchase to make them free though), or risk some damage and redshirt lives by using wormholes.  There's also these odd green bands of gravitational anomolies than can pull you in and whip you across several sectors very quickly, and finally the convenience of a consumable that will jump you a limited distance but can go from anywhere to any place you've already explored (and have enough drives to reach). It's also financially useful as the more stations you find, the better options you'll have to buy low and sell high with a decent variety of trade goods, some of them illicit in certain regions.\n\nI wish the different parts of space were more varied, but at least it's all uniformly pretty with nebulas, asteroid fields, ice asteroids, and clouds of floating junk (all mineable if you're into that sort of thing) to add some variety. There are scannable anomolies, though only a few types and they all just do some sort of passive thing to surrounding space like scramble sensors or block teleporters. Scanning them down will get rid of the field, and earn some xp and credits if its a mission, otherwise they are ignorable.  Some of the more unique stations are very beautiful, like the Spire, but most of the space stuff is pretty samey.\n\nCombat is  pretty simplistic you can even (and its recommended) set your turrets to autofire and concentrate on turning your best shields towards the light show. I wish the different guns and damage types were a little more varied. Heavy weapons have limted ammo but help speed things up, and there are some other consumables that can be deployed to help increase offense or survivability.  Spice things up by locking your grappling array on a wounded ship and teleporting over boarding parties of expendable no name grunts who throw their lives away so you can get a big payday.  If you're lucky and manage to successfully take over a ship you get to loot it far more effectively that picking through its wreckage, then tow it to the nearest dock to either add to your stable or sell off. Remember to keep the redshirts stocked every time you come back to port. Out in the stars are a bunch of named elites with bounty's on their heads and suprisingly deadly offensive capabilities to test your mettle.\n\nCurrently theres no real story, and a very limited number of missions that just help earn credits while doing the things you're already doing, but the foundation that is there is solid and fun, and surprisingly well polished for an early access title.","December 20, 2014","true","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please note that the sections on performance are not entirely relevant now, since the game runs much better.\n\nREVIEW AFTER RELEASE:\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThe game is a mix between Freelancer and X3. You can command fleets, hire wingmen, level up skills, buy massive battleships, trade, do missions. It's a lot like Darkstar One too, if we are comparing - but a lot better.\n\nThe focus here is on large ship battles - and with many ships, rather than smaller dogfigthing. Your starting ship is fairly large ( gunship), and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can climb the ranks and get battleships, dreadnoughts and the like, and command officers and mercs to help you out in battle, either on your own ship or as a wingman. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.\n\nIt looks lovely and has a massive open map to explore, complete with anomalies, slipstreams, wormholes, gates, planets, stations asteroid fields, nebula etc. - all you would come to expect from such a game and more.\n\nThe campaign is basic, but enjoyable. The voice-acting is absolutely atrocious though - the accents are all over the place and it is detrimental in an necessary way. You also have the option to free-roam, doing missions as they come along, trading or becoming a pirate. It has a complete reputation and trading system, allowing you to become anything you want.\n\nA lack of multiplayer hits hard, since this game would be infinitely better with it and a real shame it is not included. It also seems to have a fairly repetitive and grindy feel to it - hence the mark of 6/10. If it had multiplayer I think my score would jump to 8/10 instantly though.\n\nJimbo Rating: 6/10\n\nREVIEW WHILE IN EA:\n---------------------------------------------------------\nIt's a mix between Freelancer and X3. You can command fleets, hire wingmen, level up skills, buy massive battleships, trade, do missions. It's a lot like Darkstar One too, if we are comparing - but a lot better.\n\nThe focus here is on large ship battles - and with many ships, rather than smaller dogfigthing. Your starting ship is fairly large, and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.\n\nIt looks lovely, but does seem to suffer from some performance issues. Putting the lengthy loading screens aside, I frequently experienced 0FPS drops when entering new sectors (occurrs quite often), which is a royal pain in the ♥♥♥ - especially if it happens to be a wing of enemy fighters.\n\nIt's still beta, but if they can fix the performance issues (severe slow downs, long load times, crashing) then this game will be a winner.\n\nJimbo Rating: 6/10\n\nNote: why have I "not recommended" this game - even though it's good? Simple: it's nigh-on un-playable (or very frustrating) at the moment, what with the aforementioned performance issues.","April 28, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

So even if I am not an expert, I think I can write a fair review.\n\n+ Great Value.  You easily can beat the game 2 / 3 times without feeling bored. And the Dev team enhanced the First Starpoint to the new engine, it should give you around 50 hours more of gameplay.\n+ Cool graphic; not realistic like Elite Dangerous for example, but a very nice representation of space.\n+ Nice gameplay /  Mix of Rpg and tactic space game ; if you play in high difficulty it can be very challenging.\n+ A lot of things to do.\n+ A lot of ships and weapons to suit all tastes.\n+ A extremely nice and responsive Dev Team. Basically if you post anything ( interesting ) on the steam forum, there is good chances that a Dev will be the first to answer.\n+ A perfect example of how a Early Access should be done and handled.\n+ Mod support.\n\n- Scenario not great.\n- A little bit short. I know it is against my + on greate value, but the thing is  I think 35 hours to reach max level is a little bit to quick; of course if you want the best weapons you will have to spend a lot of times, but it lacks the motivation of leveling up.\n- At the end you are incredibly overpowered. Some may consider that a + , as a kind of reward but not for me.\n\nSo highly recommend this game made by a very nice and little team of passionate Dev.\n\nWill by their next project without hesitation.\n\n\n","August 28, 2015","true","34.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are still some missions that completely bug out for me and I am unable to complete them until I fail it and try again. The main story missions can be long and you can only save at the space stations so when it does fail half way through you have to start all over again and push through the voice acting once more.\nOther than mousing over the faction and reading it's description there is nothing that makes any of the factions feel personal in any way.\nThere is the basis for a great game here and some might enjoy this title. I however cannot recommend it.\n\nUpdate:\nFor a 9 man indie team then this is a very well done game. I must admit I did no research before reviewing. I'm very impressed that the developers care so deeply about their project to comment on my small post and describe their plans and ambitions for the future.

The gameplay is pretty addictive and you have to really grind pretty hard to earn enough money to build a decent ship - unless you use the cheats, which would probably instantly ruin the game completely.\n\nDefinitely worth the couple bucks I spent on it, I probably wouldn't pay retail for it.

The story and voice-overs are what you would expect from a space rpg, however that shouldn't really be the reason you play this game.\n\nIn my opinion, I have had loads of fun warping all over the galaxy doing manuevers around large carries and owning pirates and rebels with my plasma cannons and missiles. The amount of customizibility with you ship is off the chart for this game, however once you find your playing style and the best gear for that style you are kind of set.\n\nYou can also download other peoples mods and get fan made ships or docking hangers and other cool weapons not found in-game which is pretty sweet that the devs opened it up for modding.\n\nAll in all, this is a quality game that I went back and purchased the DLC's for because I thought the price justified the entertainment.

Unlike some space games, most things are strait forward, and I don’t feel the need for a spreadsheet full of stats just to progress in the game.  SPG2 does this rather well without feeling like its dumbing anything down.  It really feels like a modern take on Freelancer, which I thought was a fun game as well.\n\nThe progression through the different levels is strait forward, but at the same time your profession choice seems to be inconsequential.  I wish you were given the profession choice after your first level up, so you could see what play style you actually preferred before making the permeate commitment.\nThe camera movement is a bit wonky with no real free look option.  Instead you have a sluggish turret cam that you can manually aim your guns with. Ironically I rarely use to aim since my guns work much better on auto-fire, so I just use it to look around.\n\nThe fire arcs for the guns are a neat gameplay mechanic but their representation in 3d space and on the 2d stats are hard to visualize. Often I think I should be hitting an enemy when I turn my camera to find out they are actually below me and outside my firing range since I don’t have a gun down there.\nThere is a wide variety of ships and weapons in the game, but you are left up to your own exploring to find out what they are and where they are sold. This seems a bit odd to me since the market place has a great mechanic to show you what, and where the best prices for trade commodities are, but none for ships and weapons?\n\nThe universe is large and has a good feel to it without feeling like your traveling through light-years of nothingness.  Every once and a while during PTE (Power -To-Engines) an enemy ship will drop out and take a shot at you or you will see an anomaly to scan and many other random events.  This adds a lot of fun and excitement to traveling that many games turn in to pain wrenching boredom just for the sake of realism.\n\nYou have plenty of choice as to how you would like to play, pirate, enforcer, trader, miner or just the storyline.  The missions are varied and while there is the occasional grind it is rare and in no way feels necessary for progression.  Also with a large universe there is plenty of places to explore and room for several playthroughs without getting old.\n\nTo sum it up I think it’s a great game that has a lot of replay potential.   So if you like the space game genre and would like a fun, non-hardcore game to jump in to, Starpont Gemini 2 is awesome choice.","September 19, 2014","true","42.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you've ever played EVE, you will immediately see the attraction of an "offline mode" style game, that you can pause when the pizza guy comes or save before doing something stupid.\n\nThings I really like.\n* The universe is already pretty big, lots of places to explore but the game has features like wormholes, JumpGate networks and TeleportDrives to get you around faster than full speed ahead into one direction.\n* Ships look cool, there is a good variety of designs and varied configurations already, Its obvious there will be more to come.\n* Great maneuverability of the ship, it's the type of piloting I really wished EVE had, you can really out maneuver a lot damage if you get good at it allowing you to take out larger ships that claim to be "impossible".\n* Shielded sides, you don't fly around in a "bubble" shield like most games, each side of your ship has emitters and if one side is busted you're taking hull damage! That really fits my play style of focused attack. I hope that later one you can divert power to bolster one side or the other depending on where you are taking the most damage.\n* You can board other ships with what amounts to raiding parties and fight their crew, if you manage to take them down, you can grapple their ship and tow it (painfully slowly) back to a station and sell it or use it as your own. This will be a good source of income if it didn't take ages to get a ship back to station. I'd suggest adding a towtruck style ship that we can come back with or something and get it there much faster, just let us bookmark the spot and return would be fine.\n\nAreas in need of improvement\n* I guess its the pilot's radar, but its way too small to be useful and you can't zoom-in, you can tell if there are enemies in the area the same as if there are friendlies, but it's hard to gauge you're position or distance from them without "looking out your window" by turning your ship or the camera. I'd prefer more thought into that, it needs to be bigger and zoom able and a lot more detailed about what each tiny blimp is. For example, you can drop a ZETH which is basicly an automated sentry fixed in space, but if you fly too far from it you may never find it again and its not cheap. I frequently lose mine if there are NPC friendlys around because it's impossible to tell what anything is.\n* Stations need to be able to attack, I love the warnings that tell me any enemy station is nearby, so the first time I heard that I saved the game and flew right at one, but nothing happened, I think they should start firing some lasers if enemy craft turn up.\n*Needs more ship system customization and I think this is already on the way based on some of the anomaly scans I've done, cause you need jamming, ECM, shield boosters, etc. The ability to vary your ship should be based on more than just what skills you're pilot has, not to keep bringing up EVE but there's a lot to take for example there.","September 23, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is nothign cooler then sneaking up on your bounty target cloaked then firing a barage of missiles at its critical systems and then hacking the ship while your blasters tear it apart. The combat is engaging as well as the other aspects of the game. It is like a mix of Freelancer and the X series with a very user friendly interface.

It has decent graphics, good game controls, easy to learn and best of all, it's pretty addicting. There are three character classes, different type of ship classes, different kinds of ships within the classes, four different weapon types and tons of missions to do in sandbox mode.  I've been playing as the gunner,  especializing on weapons systems,with the ability to adds different bonuses to the weapon system of choice. My weapon of choice being rail-guns.\nIt's up to you how you want to play. You have the option of playing as a pirate, enforcer, bounty hunter, miner, trader or a freelancer (combination of all). How effective you are doing each type of job depends on the ship, the combination of skills you select as you increase in experience and buying a license. License determine how much money you will receive depending on what the license is for. For example, a mining license will get you more money when selling ore, a police license will reward you with moneyfor everykill, and so on so forth. The point of it all is to make money, so you can get better ships and better gear, you know, the same old formula that keeps us coming back for more.

Kind of like a space sim crossed with an RPG but in a good way. Only just beginning but I can tell this is going to be a great game for my tastes. If you like Freelancer at all, this game is a must buy. The graphics are beautiful and it's a genuinely fun game. The systems are a little intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll be lighting up space like some sort of...thing...that does that...that provides light. In space. Through 'splosions. It's not necessarily the fastest-paced game but it's certainly not slow-paced at all. Sometimes you do small mundane things like mining asteroids for ores or scanning anomalies in deep space to farm xp. I can see how that might seem tedious to some. I personally enjoy that kind of stuff to break up the intense space battles. I've only gone after low-level guys in my little ship so far, but I can see how you could command huge fleets or have some massive ♥♥♥-kicking frigate at your own command and go headfirst into the toil of battle. Let me give you a TL;DR:\n\nFun game, slower paced farming stuff to do, really fun and exciting space battles, beautiful scenery, decent music.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mephane/recommended/236150/","mephane","Mephane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mephane/","184 products in account","tl;dr: If you ever wanted a game that plays like Star Trek Online, but is actually good, buy this game.\n\n\nYou have all the basics of an open world space game - trading, piracy, bounty hunting, mining, scavening etc, but here you don't fly small fighters, but mostly capital ships. The smallest craft are gunships that already dwarf a fighter, and from there you have the entire scale up to massive freighters, dreadnoughts and carriers.\n\nYou can outfit your ship with a variety of light weapons (e.g. rail guns, plasma cannons, beam lasers) and heavy weapons (e.g. torpedoes, missiles, ion cannons), plus you can install upgrades to both the weapons and the various components of the ship.\n\nShips handle basically the same as in Star Trek Online, however you can choose between setting your turrets to fire-at-will or manual crosshair aiming. You have the four shield quadrants, weapons have distinct firing arcs, and thus some ships are better suited for frontal assault, others can deliver heavy broadside attacks. The game also features power distribution - at any time you can freely adjust your power between engines, shields and weapons, and I must say the UI for that is very slick, with a handy snap-on center point for a balanced distribution.\n\nSpeaking of ships, there is not just a variety in stats and turret placement, but a great variety in visual styles. From Battlestar Galactica-style bulky ships (my favourite is the Bishop class battleship) to organic-looking cruisers, there should be something for everyone's taste.\n\nSpace itself is not realistic. The game takes place within a star system with a binary star, and both the sizes of objects and all distances are massively scaled down. That's the one thing I am missing, that feeling of vast emptiness in space. Though the  Gemini System is large, seamless and sprawling, you come across a space station, mining platform, planet, asteroid field, nebula etc. every few steps. It's a busy place, maybe a bit too busy.\n\nThe skill system is rather simple, but does its job. There are 3 classes, each with 4 unique special abilities, and every level you get 1 skill point to upgrade one aspect of one ability. All abilities have multiple effects, and therefore can be developed into different directions. Every 5 levels you get a perk point which can be used on passive bonuses like increased turn speed, better trading prices, higher mining yield or more damage with a weapon category.\n\nThe graphics are very nice. The ships are gorgeously detailed, you can zoom in and see things like individual windows, weapon turrets are fully animated and you can even adjust your ship's color and metal glossiness (from dull to polished), you can even choose from a variety of decal and even give it name which is printed onto the hull.\nBut it's not just the ships. For example, SG2 features some of the most beautifully looking asteroid fields; the asteroids even cast shadows on the surrounding dust!\n\nThe sounds are well done, too, the UI sounds very Star-Trek-y and the engines, weapons very Star-Wars-y (i.e. the best of both worlds). But the highlight is the music. I've had the game during Early Access but only towards the actual release was most of the music added, and all I can say is that I was mightily surprised by how epic it is.\n\nFinally, a few positive words about the community. The atmosphere is generally helpful and friendly, and the devs are very active on the Steam forums and are really listening and interacting with the players. The game is also Steamworks modding enabled, and you can already find stuff like the obligatory Star Trek ship packs.","September 30, 2014","true","66.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Capturing ships is most fun, and also the quickest way to earn a lot of money. Though after 18 hours, and having bought the best carrier-class ship, I'm not so eager to get back in and play again. But it was definitely a great 18 hours.\n\nJust some thoughts, a story-line, more insanely expensive ships to want, ability to hire captains who go out and do work for you as well, would make add more hours into the game.\n\nAlso, a cockpit view with people would be nice to see the scale of different ships.

Perhaps a bit too much emphasis on the combat, but the combat is good, and there are plenty of weapons to choose from. Moreover, the visuals are great, even if a few features aren't working as of this being posted. Free Roam could use a bit of extra stuff to do, and the I only played a tiny bit of the campaign and got put off by the silly voice-acting.

If you are expecting the depth and simulation of something such as the X-Universe then you will probably want to avoid this game.   However if you want to just fly around in a beautiful world, and combat enemies with responsive and fuild controls then this game is for you.\n\nThe ship designs are very beautiful and unique. The enviornments are very good and beautiful to look at as you go through the game.\n\nThere are many different factions within the game that will end up fighting each other.  As well as many you can gain or lose rep with that will effect your standing with them.\n\nThe controls are easy to understand and reponsive.\n\nCombat can be fought in several ways, you can hire a crew to improve stats of your ship such as accuracy, dodge, shields, etc.  However you can also tell the gunner to shoot for you, so either you can fly and have the A.I. shoot for you or you can Shoot and fly yourself.  This provides a nice change of pace for when you are wanting the A.I. to focus on defense or attack while you just maneuver the ship.\n\n","March 29, 2014","true","26.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unlike some space games, most things are strait forward, and I don’t feel the need for a spreadsheet full of stats just to progress in the game.  SPG2 does this rather well without feeling like its dumbing anything down.  It really feels like a modern take on Freelancer, which I thought was a fun game as well.\n\nThe progression through the different levels is strait forward, but at the same time your profession choice seems to be inconsequential.  I wish you were given the profession choice after your first level up, so you could see what play style you actually preferred before making the permeate commitment.\nThe camera movement is a bit wonky with no real free look option.  Instead you have a sluggish turret cam that you can manually aim your guns with. Ironically I rarely use to aim since my guns work much better on auto-fire, so I just use it to look around.\n\nThe fire arcs for the guns are a neat gameplay mechanic but their representation in 3d space and on the 2d stats are hard to visualize. Often I think I should be hitting an enemy when I turn my camera to find out they are actually below me and outside my firing range since I don’t have a gun down there.\nThere is a wide variety of ships and weapons in the game, but you are left up to your own exploring to find out what they are and where they are sold. This seems a bit odd to me since the market place has a great mechanic to show you what, and where the best prices for trade commodities are, but none for ships and weapons?\n\nThe universe is large and has a good feel to it without feeling like your traveling through light-years of nothingness.  Every once and a while during PTE (Power -To-Engines) an enemy ship will drop out and take a shot at you or you will see an anomaly to scan and many other random events.  This adds a lot of fun and excitement to traveling that many games turn in to pain wrenching boredom just for the sake of realism.\n\nYou have plenty of choice as to how you would like to play, pirate, enforcer, trader, miner or just the storyline.  The missions are varied and while there is the occasional grind it is rare and in no way feels necessary for progression.  Also with a large universe there is plenty of places to explore and room for several playthroughs without getting old.\n\nTo sum it up I think it’s a great game that has a lot of replay potential.   So if you like the space game genre and would like a fun, non-hardcore game to jump in to, Starpont Gemini 2 is awesome choice.","September 19, 2014","true","42.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you've ever played EVE, you will immediately see the attraction of an "offline mode" style game, that you can pause when the pizza guy comes or save before doing something stupid.\n\nThings I really like.\n* The universe is already pretty big, lots of places to explore but the game has features like wormholes, JumpGate networks and TeleportDrives to get you around faster than full speed ahead into one direction.\n* Ships look cool, there is a good variety of designs and varied configurations already, Its obvious there will be more to come.\n* Great maneuverability of the ship, it's the type of piloting I really wished EVE had, you can really out maneuver a lot damage if you get good at it allowing you to take out larger ships that claim to be "impossible".\n* Shielded sides, you don't fly around in a "bubble" shield like most games, each side of your ship has emitters and if one side is busted you're taking hull damage! That really fits my play style of focused attack. I hope that later one you can divert power to bolster one side or the other depending on where you are taking the most damage.\n* You can board other ships with what amounts to raiding parties and fight their crew, if you manage to take them down, you can grapple their ship and tow it (painfully slowly) back to a station and sell it or use it as your own. This will be a good source of income if it didn't take ages to get a ship back to station. I'd suggest adding a towtruck style ship that we can come back with or something and get it there much faster, just let us bookmark the spot and return would be fine.\n\nAreas in need of improvement\n* I guess its the pilot's radar, but its way too small to be useful and you can't zoom-in, you can tell if there are enemies in the area the same as if there are friendlies, but it's hard to gauge you're position or distance from them without "looking out your window" by turning your ship or the camera. I'd prefer more thought into that, it needs to be bigger and zoom able and a lot more detailed about what each tiny blimp is. For example, you can drop a ZETH which is basicly an automated sentry fixed in space, but if you fly too far from it you may never find it again and its not cheap. I frequently lose mine if there are NPC friendlys around because it's impossible to tell what anything is.\n* Stations need to be able to attack, I love the warnings that tell me any enemy station is nearby, so the first time I heard that I saved the game and flew right at one, but nothing happened, I think they should start firing some lasers if enemy craft turn up.\n*Needs more ship system customization and I think this is already on the way based on some of the anomaly scans I've done, cause you need jamming, ECM, shield boosters, etc. The ability to vary your ship should be based on more than just what skills you're pilot has, not to keep bringing up EVE but there's a lot to take for example there.","September 23, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First of all, I am not going to comment on the technical issues currently existing in the game. It's very resource hungry, and there's an unpatched memory leak forcing you to close the game roughly every hour. The devs will have to address this before the final version is released.\n\nAlso: What this game IS NOT, is "Eve Offline". Anyone who says such things is severely overhyping the title. It is, at best, a Freelancer clone.\n\nNow for the meat of the review.\n=THE GOOD=\n1. Fluid interesting combat, but don't expect dogfights. It plays more like traditional naval battles with turrets and missiles.\n2. Responsive dev team. They take community input to heart and make changes as needed.\n3. Very large map. So large, that travelling from one corner to the other would take you probably 20-30 minutes.\n4. Seamless travel. There's still warpgates and jumpdrives available to the player, but no "zones" or loading screens.\n5. Many different factions enables you to work with and shoot whoever you want.\n6. Many different ships. Enough variety to keep it fresh and interesting.\n7. A bounty system that enables you to live out your inner Boba Fett. Be the space cop you always dreamed of being!\n\n=THE BAD=\n1. Ship designs are... different. Maybe I'm used to the look of EVE, or WingCommander, or Homeworld, but I expect space ships to have a certain bulkiness and weight to them. Most of the ships in this game either look like some derivative of a shark/fish, or an insect. It's very strange cruising along and seeing a flying praying mantis scoot by. The rest look dated. It's like the devs took the Freelancer inspiration a little too far, and saddening that the mod community is starting to produce models far better than the "official" ones shipping with release. You can have more than 5,000 polys on a model these days, guys...\n\n2. Combat. I know I said it was a "good" aspect, but I just want to make something clear here. 90% of battles I've been in, no matter what ship I'm using, no matter what my loadout is, I can win by pushing three buttons on my keyboard: Railgun skill -> Damage amp -> Fire at will. Done. And this is playing on Hard Mode. There is something inherently wrong with being able to destroy a dreadnought with a frigate.\n\n3. Combat (again). Missiles and other 'heavy weapons' are very pointless. It's odd you can only fire them once the little orange bar on your reticle fills up, nearly defeating the point of having them. On one ship, the Oppenheimer, I opted for no missiles or heavy weapons of any kind and noticed absolutely no difference in my ability to destroy anything and everything. They're effectively redundant, and with the current system in place I cannot see this ever changing.\n\n4. Ship customization is basically not a thing.\nPeople have been praising customization in their reviews, but I feel they are being dishonest. You can customize your ships in-so-far as being able to change their paint job or logo, or how shiny it is. That's it. As far as gear and parts are concerned, you're only tuning stuff already on your ship, and you do so by scrolling down a list and simply getting the most expensive thing on there. You're not really buying new engines, or an expanded cargo hold, or a different powerplant. You're not weighing the options and going "Hmm! If I get this, then I can't have that!" It's not at all a mod system like what's in EVE. If your ship doesn't have a cloak, you'll never have a cloak. If your ship has crappy shields, you'll always have crappy shields. Etc. I hope this changes before release, but I somehow doubt it.\n\n5. There's no reason to go beyond a cruiser. I can kill or capture anything with a Saratoga. I basically stopped playing when I towed a dreadnought into port and cashed it in. Apparently 90 guys can overpower a ship staffed by thousands.\n\n6. It's far too easy to hit 'end game'. The first few hours of playing was just me saving up to buy a frigate. From my frigate, I captured a destroyer. From my destroyer, I captured enough ships to get a cruiser. From my cruiser, I was unstoppable. I did this very rapidly, despite pouring tens of hours into simple exploration.\n\n7. Bugs. Yeah yeah, it's beta. I know. But it is rather silly flying up to a bounty, seeing they're "blue" (allied), and then just following them around until someone kills them, yet -I- get rewarded with the bounty. I wish that worked in real life where if I watch the cops bust someone, cash magically appears in my pocket.\n\n8. No main quest. It's supposed to have one eventually, but despite being beta none of it is playable. You're stuck doing random low-paying generated missions, or inventing your own fun. The the latter can be quite enjoyable, but you will run out of stuff to do in a hurry.\n\n=Final Thoughts=\nDespite its issues, Starpoint Gemini 2 is quite the fun little sandbox and probably the closest thing we're ever going to get to a successor to Freelancer. Freelancer was far more polished as an overall product, however, and until SG2 introduces a TRUE parts and customization system (which I consider to be a much greater problem than combat, or even optimization woes), it will not hold a candle to Eve Online.\n\nThis is a beta that plays like an alpha, but if you're hungry for a spaceship game with solid promise, then this is it.\n\n6/10.","August 6, 2014","true","22.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game itself looks quite attractive though it might at first sight be frightening with all the panels and buttons involved in the gameplay process.  But u need only 1 hour or a bit more to get used to it and comparing to good old X series the controls are VERY simple. The gameplay itself is quite fun but has some issues still. For example while doing "taxi" missions and stuff like that which is like 1000-10000 credit reward i managed to encounter a pirate that attacked me near the station. Thanks for the help of allied station system pilots i shot him down(though he was trying to run from me) and got rewarded with 8000000(!!!) credits. Which makes the other missions which i have to do in order to get exp absolutely silly regarding the reward they provide. And also there is still no main campaign task available (at least i couldn't find it in any menu). So the game is just a free roamer. But i hope it will get better. Music in game is decent. Overall i would rather recommend the game than not.","August 13, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Even though there is no storyline at the moment, purchasing the game in Early Access gives you the chance to get a feel for the game controls and also to try out some mods (Or even create some of your own mods). The one thing that I absolutley love about this game is the depth of the lore. You can sit down and read for some time on different factions and their background and know their allies and enemies. Since there isn't many Space Simulator games like this and I absolutley love Spaceship-type games, I felt as if I had to buy it. I was disappointed when a game called Black Prophecy was taken down and that game had a lot of potential, but looking through steam and spotting this game, I almost immideatly fell in love with it. As I've briefly said, the graphics are amazing to this game as you look around, from the giant nebulas to just looking at space. I strongly reccomend buying this game now if you haven't played it before and are looking to buy it when the storyline comes out because you do have to settle in to using the controls and finding out what you can actually do in this game.","August 1, 2014","true","22.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It plays like a mix of Freelancer, X3 and Eve. It's super intuitive to pick up and play and the menus are all neatly laid out and self explanatory without sacrificing your ability to do what you need to do. Combat varies depending on the ship but for the most part it's slower than the frantic arcade dogfights seen in Chris Roberts games; with more emphasis on positioning and presenting sides of your ship to enemy.\n\nTrading and economy functions as you'd expect, with goods costing more or less dependant on their origins and the political affiliations. There's a fair amount of contraband so it's best not to use the "Loot All" button if you're trying to live a virtuous life.\n\nIn terms of Early Access content; the game feels very polished already with much of the world content seemingly in place and all game systems working as you'd expect. The current starting scenario is possibly a little bit easy, starting you off as it does with a mid level ship and plenty of tools already at your disposal. The missions are all randomly generatied (apparently depending on your actions, though I've yet to make a big enough impact on my galaxy to see this) and most of them follow a fairly standard template. It'd be nice for some more intensive missions with multiple stages but the ones that are there give you enough to do, and when they involve going through hostile areas they can become quite harrowing. The full game will have a story mode, which isn't present in this E.A release, so who knows what that will entail.","August 3, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
