A lot. But then, that's why they launched in Early Access. I know they had last-minute issues, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. My thumbs-up comes with the expectation that the game's issues will gradually be ironed out over the coming weeks and months. I'll be keeping an eye out and updating this review over time.

This sounds like a very harsh thing to say, but unfortunately with steam early access, you never really know if the game will ever come out of it.\n\nEverything about the game is worse really. The physics on the robots are inconsistent, despite the newer engine. It makes fighting the robots feel a bit off. You might hit a guy with a spinning disc and have him not move, then he might drive into a wall and that'll be a much larger 'impact.' I didn't use a wedge, but I'm told the chassis of the robot actually makes no difference, ie, if you make a wedge you can't get under people. I can't confirm that.\nThe building has been 'simplified' to the point where it trades ease of use for clunkiness. For instance, if you try to add a 'peg board' to the edge of a disc, there's about 15 attach points on one side, and 3 on the other. You have to click change attach point about 15 times, as opposed to just clicking the attach point you want, then on the motor. It's just not streamlined at all, and I can put everything inside eachother.\nNext, huge lack of parts. The variety dropped pretty hard in general. There isn't enough weapon motors and the best one isn't strong enough. Moving on, lack of part clarity, none of the motors say how much electricity they draw, as far as I can tell. The armor doesn't necessarilly say how effective it is. Is fibreglass going to give me more or less health than carbon fibre? Something about fire resistance?\nOn a side note, the music is annoying, the sound effects are low quality and just sound weird, and some are ripped from the old game. The graphics, while not that important, are pretty awful. Somehow even though the textures are higher quality, they are just worse looking than the old game. It's hard to explain. They just look like typical stock unity textures, it looks odd and cartoony. I'm sure you'll get the same feeling when you look at the screenshots. I think it's to do with the lighting.\n\nFor me, a robot building/fighting game where the building isn't great and the fighting is plagued by weird physics isn't worth the buy. Wait until full release, then look at the reviews again.\n","May 26","false","0.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I was sure that, yes, the game needed some work, but i was also convinced that the game was really fun.\n\n...I was incredibly wrong.\n\nI know, I know, the game is still in early access, but there are a lot of basics problems that not only need to be solved, but changed.\n\nStarting to the bot lab. Ok, now you really have the complete possibility to create any, ANY shape for the robots, but the price to pay is too high. The way you modify the chassis is really too difficult. I had trouble even with simple robot desings, the multiple layers scheme is far from being clear. But there is more...\nMounting the parts can be really frustrating. The process is really slow, I don\'t get why the parts must to be mounted in a \"standard\" position UNDER the chassis, and then, repositioned where we want. But i like the idea of moving mounted parts, this really is an useful thing.\n\nI do not like the way you wire the motors/pistons in RA3. it works in the opposite way of RA2, I found it too messy. But maybe it\'s just me.\n\nOk, time to try our new, fresh built robot, right?\n\n....Right?\n\nNo.\n\nFor no reason, the physics of the game decided to punch herself with all of his might, resulting in a complete DISASTER.\nWithout touching any key, my robot started to bounce illogically all along the arena. Any attempt to stop it was useless.\nI\'ve tried to add weight, add more wheels, everything. But no, nothing changed. The only thing i could do was delete the bot and build a new one.\nIn the nex time i\'ve tried different things. I\'ve tried to save space putting motors and wheels outside the chassis (mounted properly with extenders), but for no reason the back of the bot started to bounce. Another scrap. I\'ve also found that you can overlap parts. I was able to put 5 batteries in the same place. You can\'t see a thing like that in a 2016 game.\nThen i\'ve tried to build a robot in the style of \"Chaos 2\": 2 big motors at the FRONT (ztech HP) to avoid wheelies, light and with a short wheelbase: a functional design in RA2 and in the real life. But what happened next got me mad.\n\nNot only there is an exaggerated, insane amount of centrifugal force generated by the motors (that also spin at ridiculous low speed, considering that\'s the most powerful motor of the game) but the centrifugal force does not change even when  the motors are spinning at max speed.\n\nThe result?\n\nTrying to go forward, my robot started to continuosly roll over backward. I was crying inside me.\n\nWithout hope, i built the last robot.  Big, heavy, slow, but functional.\nThen i\'ve tried to battle.\n\nSad. Really sad.\n\nA lot of sounds are missing, visual effects like fire and sparks are exaggerated and badly done. When you hit your opponent, you don\'t fell like you are hitting it, but you fell like you are pushing, or bouncing on it. You don\'t feel that you are damaging it, you don\'t see the deformations on the chassis, you don\'t see and feel nothing.\n\nThe only thing that remains is a slow, sad, frustrating game.\n\nI hope that this can help the developers. In those contitions, i can\'t play the game without getting mad.\n\nBUT.\n\nI see potential. I think this could be a really funny game in the future, but things need to be changed. I wish good work to the developers. Maybe in a few months i will be back, to see if something changed. Like me, a lot of people care about this game.","June 1","false","3.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Alright, I'll be honest, I'm in denial that this game is like biting into a big, meaty, tasty looking juicy burger only to find out it's made of wax.  I'm sorry devs, but... This was not ready to show the public yet.  I've waited literally half my life for this sequal, and I could have waited another 6 months.\n\nIn building my bot, it's almost impossible to line up parts.  I would rather the rotation snap 5 degrees per click (AND ONLY ON A CLICK... This "tap the mouse button as quickly as possible because a split second longer and it rotates 30 degrees" sucks).  Additionally, lining up parts without at LEAST some sort of a 3D grid is all but impossible.  In RA2 I could build the bot I just built in 10min.  It just took me 2 hours to get things lined up.\n\nThe interface is... well, not pretty, that's for sure.  I don't really mind that, as it's kinda like going back in time to my 13 year old self playing RA2 on my old Windows XP cheap rig.  But I can see where others would think "Was this game developed in VB6?"\n\nDevs... I WANT to trust you all will fix these issues.  I WANT to believe that this will fill my inner child with glee.  But... The fact that you let others see this game, or even pay for it, in this state...  Guys, pay your bills with my money and get on this, ok?  For me?  It honestly reminds me of my first projects in Unity but with a better UI and more overall polish... That's not a compliment... I'm no god of programming...\n\nMy advice?  Guys, wait a few months if you want a polished game.  If this is your dream as much as it was mine, buy it now, show the devs we want it to be better, but realize that if you expect it to live up to RA2 with modern graphics in this state, it will feel like getting a Fatboy Tire shoved up your ♥♥♥♥.","May 27","true","2.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

Odd noises too, like grinding when just driving along a horizontal floor for no obvious reason.\n\nTerrible cheesy music playing during matches.\n\nWhen you cause damage, the displayed hit points get in the way of the battle - the font is too big.\n\nWhen paused, the options option is there but cannot be clicked.\n\nNeed to disconnect my Oculus Rift, otherwise it plays the sound through it's speakers and the camera moves with the positional head tracking, which is really weird.\n\nSome menus do not respond to controller input.\n\nYou can start a match with just one robot, which is very easy to do as menus respond quick enough that a misplaced double click will make that happen, and then you just have to wait as the match starts and then you instantly win it. Why not just stop one robot battles from happening seeing as it never lets you take control of the robot anyway?\n\nHUD does not scale well with 4K (too small).\n\nIn robot creator if I move the camera up it just moves back down to the base of the table automatically for no obvious reason.\n\n\nI will wait and give the devs a chance before claiming a refund, but I have a terrible feeling this is basically a scam.

I even built a micro robot which won an entire tournament effortlessly. And my ripsaw robot from RA2(Which i needed mods to be able to build) i managed to build in this with nothing but the tools provided and still manages to defeat all opponents in less than 20 seconds.\n\nMy only problem with this game is that you do need to build robots to have nothing but wheel compoments in contact with the ground also the normal motors in the game are extremely slow in comparison to RA2, but thats fine because this games still in development.\n\nDevelopers want your feedback on what YOU want in this game you mightaswell give them the chance to give you the game you always dreamed of.

And as much as I love the idea of the reboot, it feels dated.  And sluggish.  I just wish there'd be faster motors, real life robots such as England's own Warhead or America's Bite Force, and a way to make your own drive train, so you can legitimately make either a push bot, or a faster spinner for your robot, or a drum weapon.  On top of that, the motors only seem to point forward when you first put them in, making it a real hassle to make the robot move forward properly.  A majority of the robots in the game as well just feel haphazardly put together as well, with blade spam all over them.\n\nPros:\n+ It's a nostalgic return to the Robot Arena series.\n+ Arcade like, and super quick loading times\n+ Axe like weapons feel like they can deliver a punch.\n\nCons: (Oh boy this is going to be long)\n- Customisation feels rather limited.\n- No faster motors or powerul motors.\n- Spinners feel like and look like a wet noodle.\n- No real life robots in the game right now.\n- Preset chassis are small and unvaried.\n- One graphic on a robot replaces all graphics on all robots.  Not sure if a glitch or really poor design.\n- Making low profile robots makes awful clanking noises.\n- Graphics on some styles of robot stretches and makes it look ugly as sin.\n\nWhat I would like to see in the future of this game:\n*FASTER MOTORS: I want to be able to create a hard hitting spinner bot or a robot that uses a drum weapon and still keep its ability to ram into opponents quickly.\n*REAL ROBOTS: I wish to see robots old and new in the game.  Whether or not this'll happen is something completely different.\n*ACTUAL STATS ON ROBOT PARTS: One thing I have noticed is there's a lack of info on parts.  If this gets updated I'd be fairly okay with it.\n*A DRIVE TRAIN SYSTEM: Having a steering column is nice and all but I would love to make a robot that can steer on a six pence without having to fiddle with motor positioning.  On top of that, I'd love to see a choice between either belt or chain drive, for those who wish to make a robot on a tank drive steering system.\n*DIFFERENT FORMS OF LOCOMOTION: Wheels are cool, but tank tracks, Walking legs, or even a Half track system would be excellent.\n*WEIGHT CATEGORIES: Right now, all the robot seem to be in the same kind of weight category, which is quite misleading.\n*MORE ARENAS!!!: Can't stress that enough right now.  Being in a real arena would be fantastic, such as the old Robot Wars arena or the new Battlebots Battle box.\n\nOverall, this feels really outdated and in need of some more work, if I'm brutally honest Octopus Tree.  It doesn't feel polished, and it feels a little rushed on top of that.  Unless this game gets a really big update and pretty much changes the game into a much more customisable game that actually feels like I'm making a robot, then I'd say avoid this for now.\n\nA really disappointing start for such a promising game!","May 26","false","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The devs have taken a step back to their credit and conceded they're not as close to a full game as they thought they were, have shown to be passionate at every step and are willing to accept feedback - the question becomes if you're willing to be an early alpha tester.\n\nIt's a lawless wasteland with no weight classes and where anything can be mounted anywhere - through other components, or even several feet away from the actual robot. Every chassis has box collision - if it's a wedge design or has a portion cut out to herd other robots (i.e a 'dustpan' design), it doesn't matter. The fact that chassis wedges do not work to any degree is an absurd oversight.\n\nI can still however draw fun from the game. The chassis builder is powerful (when you disregard the above issues) and they have the right ideas about modernising the build system. It’s just undercooked, with glaring faults and omissions. When you get the proper experience with the wonky physics it can be satisfying; big, heavy bots like EMERGENCY clones are king, able to run down everything in it's path.\n\nWhat I can get from the game personally doesn't mean this game is not poor in it's current state - but all of Gametechmods and the Robot Arena community are looking ahead to Robot Arena 3's eventual rise to glory.","May 27","false","24.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yes, this is an unfinished version with alot of problems, but they're still working on it and once the bugs are ironed out I can seen this being a worthy follow-up\nJust the fact that now I can move components, even when their linked, makes design so much easier.  Right now positioning the components are fiddly, I'm hoping they'll tightne this up a bit.  The new components are great, chainsaws were saddly missing form the original, and even though Chainsaws are useless in real robotic combat, getting the option to use one is great.  Also, the inclusion of barrel components is a good addition.  When RA2 was released barrel spinners were faily new but now that they're established in the sport throwing them in is great.\nAgain, this is pre-release, so threre are alot of problems.  Right now the program is pretty unstable, and I can see a hundred small fixes that would make this game alot better.  Hopefully the developers won't let these problems slide, because I'm excited for the future of this game.","May 26","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's more complicated, but it gives room for a bigger variety when it comes to robots. At least for the chassis. The size of the parts is... not a good balance. The motors I find too small and the batteries too big. There isn't enough of a variety of parts. Yet. The placement of the parts start below the bottom of the chassis instead of at the bottom of the chassis like RA2 does. The physics aren't the best, and it's pretty slow. The robots are particularly slow. There needs to be some motors that have something like a chain drive/belt drive with it instead of only direct drive. This is probably a common complaint, but the parts don't have to be inside the chassis or attached to the chassis at all for some reason. The game overall has a lot of potential. The Lab has some great ideas particularly, but this is a very unpolished and unfinished game. I'm hoping for it to improve soon.

It's EARLY ACCESS! All those negative reviews after half an hour of gameplay shouldn't exist. It's not the prettiest game, the soundtrack is rough, but there are good things too!\n\nWhat to expect.\n1. Building is fun, the chassis doesn't always appear as smooth as it should, seems to not be mirrored when you build a bot with sloping sides.\n2. Lots of components. You can pretty much build whatever you want. You'll see some CRAZY designs in the arenas. This is the reason we all play this game anyway.\n3. The AI aren't horrible. It's early access so I played one game where the bots just flipped themselves on the weird map and timed out but in a simple map they seem to fight decently. In a tournament you'll face such variety that one type of bot won't win everything with ease.\n4. Painting the bots needs a lot of work. Textures are all messed up.\n\nOverall I recommend this game. You'll have fun if you can get past it being a little buggy. The worst thing I've experienced was getting thrown accross the arena when an opponent's weapon moved back to it's starting position and I was in the way.","May 26","true","4.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","2"

I bought it within five minutes after release. So much of this game feels unfinished it isn't funny. Wonky controls, very unintuitive UI, and no way of knowing the stats on any components or armor you put on until you put them on and try it are just the start of a long list of things wrong.\n\nOn a brighter note, I am happy with the chassis designer. It isn't perfect, but it has more features than the older one and when given some time to understand it, it seems like it will do a good job. I like the arenas and component selection as well. The RA2 weapons and motors are a good nostalgic touch.\n\nI would have gladly waited more time for this game to be better put together.

That is not nearly enough time to put together a solid game of any kind. This game reflects that lack of time and budget they were given.\n\nThe improvements to the bot lab are awesome. There is so much more freedom in how a robot can be built now. But that is hampered by the lack of any snap points for component placement or rotation. It's impossible to get any component pointed exactly the same way as any other component, or at the same height. Just adding some snap points would make the bot lab nearly perfect.\n\nUnfortunately from there, things get bad. Combat is much more like Robot Arena 1 than anything: slow boxes covered in components driving straight at each other. Even though you can flip other robots over, no matter how you build your chassis shape you cannot simply drive under other robots. You mearly bump into them until some physics instability allows you to accidentally end up underneith. Collisions are super simple. Most of the time chassis and components wont be anywhere near each other when their hit boxes collide. No matter how a match is lost, it classifies every losing robot as "immobilized". Sometimes already counted out robots will get counted out a second time. I can barely hear the "announcer" despite volumes being turned up all the way.\n\nThe menus for some reason are designed as if I'm using an Xbox controller when I only have keyboard and mouse hooked up. It was quite confusing when it said "Press (A) to continue". Some of the menus apparently scroll, although there are no indications of this except for some images being slightly cut off. Click and drag is the way to scroll these menus for some reason.\n\nTextures look ok, and polygon counts are high, so no real complaints on the graphics side of things. There are more parts available than in stock Robot Arena 2, so that is an improvement. Background music is uninspiring stock instrumental stuff.\n\nIf I had to play this on a tablet or something, it would be a mediocre 5/10, but being released through Steam for PC users, this game is currently a 3/10. It should be way better, but for some reason the studio decided to rush it out in only 5-8 months to test the market. Hopefully they both decide to make a Robot Arena 4, and go all out in making it the most realistic simulation of robot combat ever made like we want instead of the arcadey little toy they gave us.","May 26","true","1.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Firstly it does have the odd bug but then again thats why its advertised as an earlly access game. The bot creation can be a bit of a pain as the components start under the chassis and you have to adjust them and the rotation isnt as smooth as ra2. I encountered a glitch while testing the robot where it tends to fly or topple over but found adding weights to the robot stabilised it. Also if i could change something else it would be the ai controlled robots. In a career match they spend their time attacking already beat robots to rack up scores making it very hard to beat them.\n\nAnyway i gave this game a thumbs up because despite all the bad reviews and bugs its still easy to have fun. The creations have more possibilities and its easier to connect things for example the wheels. The graphics still dont seem as what promised but to be honest why are graphics so important?

There were clearly going to be bugs this early.\nI have 12 or so hours clocked and i have witnessed bugs on single multiplayer and the menus but the game is certainly playable.\n\nThe new layers system for the body of the robot is a really good idea and a massive leap from RA2. There are problems here- as in most places, however. The first is very annoying when you try and re-edit a robot after a match. It seems that the camera coding breaks as it moves itself to the top with nothing you can do about it:( Also sometimes the position of the dot for the body is nowhere near where the mouse cursor is, which can make finding the correct square harder. The paint job thing at the moment is fairly poor because unless it is a flat side, the paint will look wrong - had to stick to plain colours...\nAnother thing is that none of the motors seem to be powerful enough to make a fast robot or spinner (which btw the game is still sadly aimed at- you firestorm/chaos 2 lovers will be saddened by the same scoring system and the fact that chassis don't seem to be able to get underneath anything.) you have to use 2 of the bestest fastest motors - the z-tek HP - if you want to move quickly and cheating with parts inside of each other is always necessary. You guys need to add the mass classes back in and have a non-competitive over-weight class just for the lols.\nIn the way of multiplayer, as far as i have heard you can only do 2 player atm? if so then obvs thats something to fix but i have only tried 2 player. It seems you can only use arenas such as soccer pitch and specific robots as well? it is a bit dodgy but i got a few games in while i could.\nA problem as with this and the previous robot arena is the fact that if you jnust cover yourself in spikes and ram the oponent you will never lose as you get constant points and they die very quickly. Personally i love flippers and theres very little ways of winning, except immobilising - which is IMPOSSIBLE on the spinner bot ai because it spins back, making that bot easily the best?\nThe bot cam is a good idea and on my robots have worked a charm and look good if you position well! So actually well done on that!XD However, you guys need to add and orbit view that follows your bot so that you can choose exacly where youre looking as i feel none of them look in the right place atm.\nI completed the career tournaments losing 10 and winning 11 (when i found lots of spikes work) and there is now no way of me playing career again? it does not reset or keep score and when you win or lose a tournament it doesn't tell you.\nI could be wrong on this but i'm pretty sure theres something slightly off with the armour, im not sure what it is but im sure it's there where steel is just so weak.\nOn many of the maps there is a pit/somewhere to fall off - but it does not count as losing in many places in you fall in, which clearly is an issue, you can also lose as a bot that got pitted is driving around in there with more points than you.\nThe damage also looks very strange, it seems to just lower the top layer down a bit and nothing else...\nI love the idea of being able to add your bot to the steam workshop, although im not sure whether my internet isn't loading it very well or what and im not sure if my bot got uploaded as well..XD\nI tried using a controller to play as it looked like it was set up for it, but apparently not... also in the menus you quite often get a bug where it keeps scrolling down, it doesn't select anything, it is just annoying.\n\nAt the moment you have a good starting point, and i wouldn't say it was 90% ready tbh. The original selection of parts is never enormous - i hope modders share my enthusiasm and make parts and things when the game reaching full release. There is actually so much potential in the game and it is very close to reaching it. Despite everything i have said, i like the game and will play it over RA2 in the hope that bugs are flipped out the arena Chaos 2 style and glitches are destroyed Razor style... Keep the update coming and we'll have a great game eventually. I'm going to vote recommend in the hope that things i mentioned are eventually polished off.","June 3","true","17.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The game has the potential to become better than it's predecessor. Here's the pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n\n*Graphics are better, more realistic.\n*New Bot Lab adds more customization.\n*Fighting is a lot smoother than in RA2\n*More Parts to work with.\n\nCons:\n\n*No max weight\n*No weight classes\n*When damaged in a tournament match if you win, you automaticly move onto the next round without having to repair your components.\n*Paintshop doesn't work right now.\n*UI is unpolished\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nI highly recommend Robot Arena 3 regardless of the glitches but I don't recommend it while it's in early access.

I enjoy this game a lot and do reccomend you buy it. its not perfect but what game launches and is just the best thing ever? It will continue to be updated and get better with each update. Buy the game, Be patient, Im sure within a week the big annoyances will be dealt with, and things are gonna change.\n\ntl;dr: Ignore everyone else, Its a fantastic game.","May 26","true","2.6"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","7","21","3","0"

Although that can be easily fixed by modding when mod\nsupport comes around.\n- Being able to fire your weapons in the bot lab.\n- Burst motors moving as you change their start and end points is going to be a good idea, and\nwould help when trying to build flippers.\n- Snap Rotation, and component raising.\n- Rotation speed up\n- Motor speeds need to be tweaked, as they are too slow.\n\nAs is I cannot decide weather or not to reccomend this title unless you are willing to take a risk. Yes it is broken but It's thumbs up because it is still fun.\n\nGrade: No grade for Early Access titles","May 26","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
