There are a few things that need to be done before this app is really ready for prime time.\n\nThis is delivered as a folder.  In the folder, there are two separate Unity executables for each of six environments.  And then there's an additional batch file to support DirectX 11.  It requires installation of a specific CODEC pack from GitHub in order to operate, and overall is at a quality similar to the Multiplayer Theater demo that is available for free.\n\nAt the very least, take half an hour, write a launcher.  Put a button to download the required CODEC pack, have Steam launch that by default.\n\nUse Environment.GetSpecialFolder and ask for videos -- look for the movies there.  If you're not going to do that, then at least use a single movies folder for all the environments.  But using the folder under Steam versus the user's Video folder (or any user specified folder) is something that is going to annoy users.\n\nThink about if you really need 12 separate executables here -- that cannot be pleasant to maintain in Unity.  Those scenes can all be in a single executable, and you can use LoadLevel to load the level you want.  So instead of separate executables, make one executable.\n\nAt that point you need a menu -- there are a lot of good Oculus-enabled menus in the Unity asset store, and the default Unity UI is workable as well.  Basically, if you're going to ask for money you need to be a cut above the tech demos in the forums, for free, at the Oculus forums.\n\nKeep in mind, Oculus is currently a developer only club -- developers are going to hold you to a higher standard than traditional users may, usually, and are going to have seen the various demos on the Oculus site most likely.  I know it's the first thing that I did after I unboxed my Oculus -- install the SDK, look at what people are uploading, see "hey, I should do that."\n\nThis is not currently ready for prime time, and needs some work before it will be.  As a demo on GitHub, I'd recommend it.  As a commercial paid product, it needs some basic professionalism brought to the table.","April 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 209 of 235 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","209","235","2","6"

However, I finally decided to give it a shot.... And MAN am I glad I did!\n\nThe screen clearity is fantastic, plays smoothly and works wonderfully. At first I thought they enviroments would get in the way of the movie experience, but when I'm watching movies, game videos i've downloaded, and other stuff: I hardly notice the backgrounds.\n\nYou can also zoom way in when using a specific enviroment to make the movie cover your entire view. With this setting it's very emerssive. I'd say this is a great buy! If you're having issues playing a movie, right-click the game in your library and select the manual, it has some great tips. Don't worry, it's nothing complicated, it's simply changing a check box from one thing to another.","May 15","true","17.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Does not work without internet(regardless of steam being in offline mode), which makes no sense to me as one of its selling points is the ability to play local content. Bit of a serious oversight IMO. Would have been nice to know this upfront before purchasing, as it really hindered my ability to give a demo.\n\n2. Controls are a bit sensitive, when inside VR. Trying to navigate around through various local directories, can be a bit frustrating. Would be nice if it supported the wireless hand controller with the oculus rift.\n\nUpdate(from Cineveo)Regarding your point #2. The "VR File Browser" can also be navigated using the keyboard arrow keys (up, down, left, right). Give it a try. You will see it's much easier and faster.\n\n3. Be aware that there are limitations in regards to file name length, when trying to find your local files. (looked like 32 characters, but did not count it)\n\nTo play most local content, be sure to install the additional codecs, as shown from the documents on the authors site.

Since I started watching my movies through this on my Oculus DK2 I really have trouble even thinking about just going back to watching movies on a standard flat screen.\nIts hard to explain it if you have never used an Oculus , but when you watch movies using Cineveo it really is like being at the movies watching your favorite films on a big screen. And just like the movies , if you pick a seat right up front you will have to look left and right to catch all the action lol.\n\nThe different enviroments are great too , although myself I tend to stick to the classic big screen cinema room but I did have a laugh watching Gravity 3D while using the space station setting.\nI do tend to get quite drawn in when using my oculus to the point I forget I am wearing it sometimes. I keep a drink behind me on a shelf while watching films and I often catch myself turning around expecting to see it sitting there lol.\nThe handsfree interface is a great feature too , being able to navigate without having to remove the rift is a bonus.\n\nFew things to mention to offset a couple of the negative reviews.\n\n1) You dont need to use shortcuts to start the different enviroments , this can be done by right clicking cineveo in steam and picking which one you want to launch.\n\n2) Yes you need a codec pack but all are free and chances are if you watch movies from the internet then you already have a codec pack installed.\n\nOverall its a great movie watching program for Oculus users so thumbs up from me !!! :D","April 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","11","23","3","0"

The launching is improved already, but that you have to actively have to read through an entire manual to see how to install the necessary codecs is also not a good first experience (I can understand they can't include those codecs, but come on give a 5 line text-file with just the actions you need to do).\n\nThe actual movie selection is really hard too, that is actually what I would like to see improved most. In movie the shortcuts are very good though (as in you can easily control the movie viewing experience once you know the keys).\n\nWhen I bought it in August 2014 I looked at several players and back then this was the only one that worked. I don't know how the app-landscape has changed since then, because I did not need to look, because CineVeo works for me (also because I don't use it that often admittedly).\n","April 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

My favourite theme when watching movies would be the “60s Drive In Movie Theater” this was content recently added in the update.  The animation and immersive environment outside of the movie screen from your vehicle is very well thought out.  Other themes are also well designed.  So in short, if you want to watch movies with a quality, stable and well-priced VR product then nail this.","April 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
