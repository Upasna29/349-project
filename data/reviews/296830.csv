I get what it’s trying to accomplish, and it should succeed. But there are enough bugs and glitches that it falls flat. Basically, you want to kill innocent people in creative ways. Good! Great! But 9/10 I fall back on poisoning doughnuts with "pills" and just tossing them at dudes. Basically, no NPC ever does what you want them to do, or goes were you want them to go, leaving amazingly fun traps completely useless. I had this one, I had put a sharpened stick in a pressurized valve so if I threw the switch, the pressure would push the stick out at fatal velocity. To lure an unsuspecting janitor near said trap, I threw a few cans of baked beans into two laundry machines, confident the noise would attract him. It did! And he clipped into the door and was just stuck.\nReloaded and tried again.\nClipped into the door again.\nFrustrated, I threw poisoned doughnuts at him. Get used to that. Between flammable liquid, cigarettes, exploding whatits, water jugs, endless electrical wires, sharpened sticks, collapsing ceiling fans and just good old thwacking someone in the head with a wooden beam, my most used death dealing trap as the literal son of Satan...was poisoning Crispy Crèmes and leaving them out like Elmer ♥♥♥♥ing Fud hunting a fat man.\nAlso for a Hospital with tons of nurses, doctors and security guards, they really do move randomly! I kept trying to figure out their movement patterns, plan my murders. Nothing to it. As far as I can tell, any NPC(not locked in a room) has free range to move anywhere on the map, at any time. Making sneaking and murdering, the two core concepts of the game, rather random and difficult.\nI spend most of my time looking for pills to poison people, and its getting old fast.\nDevs, I’d recommend tightening up the AI and maybe streamlining some of the ways to kill people. Too many tight corners you can’t throw things past, and too many small rooms where its impossible to throw cans at ceiling fans without being noticed and the unsuspecting victim standing up and the fan missing.\n\nEDIT: Okay, I'm offically calling this game done. Found a beach ball randomly in a hosptial. When I highlighted it, this is what I got:\n\n"Bengt the ball is the name given by Pewdiepie to the red and white ball found in Game Lucius 1"\n\n\nSo, buy at your own risk...","February 13, 2015","false","3.7"," 594 of 736 people (81%) found this review helpful 224 people found this review funny","81","594","736","224","28"

It's as if someone took Postal, took all the weapons out, mixed it with Goat simulator, baked a rather crudely made cake out of it and then merely added Lucius as the glazing!\n\nBut in all seriousness, this is quite terrible. Yes, the first game was quite limited, but it was a solid game with a fairly dense athmosphere and kills that had some weight and meaning to them.\nIn Lucius 2, meanwhile, you're pointlessly killing braindead NPCs who just happen to be around. Mostly with poisoned doughnuts, because the game mechanics are far too wonky and buggy to actually try and plot some kind of ingenious way of dispatching somebody.\n\nPoisoned doughnuts, you ask? Why yes, haven't i mentioned the braindead AI? Why WOULDN'T you eat an entire box of doughnuts that you randomly found on the floor? And while we're at it, why WOULD you react to that little boy over there, bursting into demonic flames as he levels up? Clearly, this game is supposed to take place in some bizarro-dimension.\n\nOh, it also doesn't help that when you do achieve such an unsatisfying, anticlimactic kill, the game demonstrates just how crudely it's made with a display of wonky, silly ragdoll physics. Whoo.\n\nHave i mentioned that on top of all of that bad design, the game is also one of the buggiest messes i've seen? Yeah, NPCs phasing through doors, objects becoming non-interactable at random, the whole shabang. There's quite a few early access games out there that are more finished than this one. At least at the time of writing, which is 2 days after release.\n\nBut hey, now that i've mentioned all the bad things, here's a list of all the good things i have to say about it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll notice that the list above appears to be rather devoid of text.

So while you have more freedom about using your powers to kill in many different ways, all feel very empty and meaningless.\n\nLike in many horror movie sequels, it's easy to just increase the body count, but the atmosphere of the original was lost in the process.\n","February 14, 2015","false","8.9"," 163 of 229 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","163","229","7","2"

I knew it had a terrible story, major performance issues, and lousy controls, but murder never looked so gosh darn fun.  Now I really dislike it.  It had so much potential until I actually tried to play it.  It's not hard to just play the game through, but I want to play WITH the game.  I wondered why streamers always killed people the same mundane ways.  Now I know it's because it's near impossible to do anything that the game didn't lay out for you to do step by step.  I don't want to poison donuts and kill people off one at a time, I want to set whole hospital floors on fire.  I tried.  Everyone just stopped their reduntant patrol circles and waited for the flames to die out.  No panic or anything.  Set up a neck level trip wire, and suddenly putting water on the floor doesn't make anyone slip.  wtf.  I knew this game seemed stupid with its cheesy cut scenes, scenarios, and references, now I know it actually is stupid because you're in a semi-open world environment with the goal to kill as many people as possible and the real challenge is trying to have fun while doing so.","December 22, 2015","false","1.8"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","45","51","3","5"

And I'm having a blast! The sequel is built far more open than in the first game. Gives you the freedom to roam around and encourages you to be creative and plan deaths for absolutely everyone, in the most brutal ways ever! That's defintely a huge improvement. The story and gameplay start slow and lame in the begining, find keys, unlock door, find more keys, unlock more doors. But as I progressed more, it started to make sense.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/296830/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Lucius II is a GREAT game. The plot makes sense, there's a decent amount of content and replayability, it's a beautifully atmospheric game and it stands alone in its style. All in all, I'd give this game an 8/10. What Lucius II tries to achieve, it achieves fairly effectively. There's a few bugs and problems, but considering the enormity of the game, it's to be expected, and none of the bugs are particularly ground-breaking.\n\nPersonally I'd price it at around $15, so grab it at a discount if you can. However, the developers seem really committed to updating and patching Lucius II, and the game definitely has a unique style to it (that I for one love). If you'd like to see a Lucius III, I definitely would say that you won't be too disappointed paying full price for the game, and you'll help contribute to a sequel :)\n\nI've broken down my review into positives, slight negatives and big negatives as follows. I'd weigh up each of the following before deciding if you'd like to buy the game or not:\n\nPOSITIVES:\n\n- Much more content to explore than the original game! The hospital ward plus the town of Ludlow total roughly three times the size of the mansion in the original!\n\n- A controllable and customisable level-up system - choose how to progress your skills!\n\n- SO much customisation and interactability with the environment. You can combine some items with other items to create complex traps for potential victims, as well as use some items with objects in the environment for the victims to interact with.\n\n- A plethora of ways to kill victims. The original game was incredibly limited, but in Lucius II you'll never be short of potential ways to hunt your victims down!\n\n- Due to the number of ways to kill victims, replayability is definitely an option!\n\n- Full and working controller support! No more mapping keys to buttons!\n\n- Achievements that were much more thought out than in the original: certain hours of gameplay and travelling specific distances are a thing of the past!\n\n- Collectibles that you can hunt down!\n\nSLIGHT NEGATIVES:\n\n- A nitpick, but there are both spelling and grammar errors in both the subtitles and the in-game descriptions (while playing in English). The audio sometimes is slightly different to the subtitles.\n\n- I encountered a few objects or items that simply said '[TEXT DESCRIPTION]', so I'm guessing the developers forgot to code in some of the text. This doesn't affect functionality in any way.\n\n- For whatever reason, when I started up, the default subtitle size was set to 0.0 instead of 1.0, so I couldn't even read the subtitles at first. I don't know if this is hard-coded into the game, or specific to me, but for a professional game this shouldn't be a problem.\n\n- The first level is next to impossible to kill everyone in for the 'Problem Child' achievement due to an extremely limited number of potential ways to kill the mental patients.\n\n- There's a few glitches. Occasionally you'll come across a door that doesn't open, but you simply pass through. Occasionally electricity or a cord will take on a mind and physics of its own, though this doesn't affect gameplay at all, just the visuals.\n\nBIG NEGATIVES:\n\n- KEYS. I love the concept of gathering keys to unlock areas, but there's a serious problem with them. Occasionally, they'll disappear once you reload a save without collecting them. If you save over your original save, there's no way to get them back, and you are sometimes left unable to complete a level. Considering this game relies a lot of save-and-load, you're bound to run into this at least once.\n\n- While the total area you can explore is indeed more than in Lucius, the areas are *entirely* level-specific. In the original, it was always the same mansion, perhaps with slightly more areas available each level. In Lucius II, each level is independent.\n\n- Serious kill-mechanic oversights. There's so many brilliant ways to kill victims, but I found myself not even hunting them out, as every level after the first is far too EASY. This is mostly due to Mind Control regenerating power on a successful kill, and an over-powered item. I've summarised these in spoilers for you, in case you don't want to read about the 'easy kills':\n\nOnce you unlock mind control, you can basically get every single person in the first chapter to simply walk down an elevator shaft. The developers limited the number of times you can do this (which was a great idea), but they forgot about fire. Kill someone with fire, then mind-control another victim and have them walk over the first victim's burning corpse. The second victim will die, and also catch on fire. This fire lasts around a minute, and resets the timer if you kill another victim. I managed to pile up over 30 victims from the result of one initial flame!\n\nThe nailgun is over-powered. One shot is an instant kill, and it comes with 5 shots per pack of nails. There's even a second pack of nails right by the gun when you first find it, giving you 10 shots. If that's not enough, at the start of chapter 2 there's another 15 nails for you to collect, giving a total of 25 possible kills from the nailgun alone.","July 1, 2015","true","14.4"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","38","45","0","0"

The linearity of the first episode? Gone! You have freedom to use your environment, and to compose with your habilities to create the kills you want. The lack of indication and sometimes really hard to figure puzzles? Gone too! Everything is written, sometimes three times (you know, just in case you were wondering if that door was a door...well it is!), you have plenty of informations and a map that moves in real time to help you out. The colision and AI bugs? Ghhu...oh wait. That's where it starts to stink.\n\nBecause let's face it, Lucius II is a really poorly executed concept, a buggy mess, and a non-polished game that would deserve the "early access" tag at best.\n\nFirst of all, there is absolutly no AI. The characters react without any logical sense. You just killed someone with a gas explosion in a room? Don't worry about being detected, the person in the next room won't even hear what the hell just happened. You want to lure someone with the noise of an object? Good luck with that. The NPCs won't hear a thing half the time, and the rest of the time, will just stand there in awe, with a question mark on there head. They will continue there activities with a deceased body in the same room, covered with acid, or even with electrical wires coming down from the roof. Simply put, they don't give ****.\n\nAnd it's not like if it was the only "oversight". Nope, the controls are aweful. It not in the way Lucius moves, but in every aspect of the interaction with the game. Lucius can't grab anything with his hands: he has to use telekynetic powers to grab anything. It doesn't drain your energy, BUT if you go anywhere near a christian cross, the object falls on the ground and the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can't pick it up, because he can't use telekynetic power in range of a cross. Oh sure, you can grab another object and throw it to the cross to flip it, but that's anoying. Now the biggest problem with that stupid idea of not being able to just grab something is this: if you have any object out of your magical pocket (you know, the one that contains 250 lbs worth of objects), you are suspicious: meaning you can't walk around with anything in your hand and you constantly have to holster in and out anything you want to use. Worst! Let's say you want to push a trolley with gas tank on it, to set it on fire and blow someone up, well since Lucius is allergic to everything, you can't push the thing if someone is around, because...you're pushing it with your mind and that's pretty suspicious. Bottom line, you can't touch anything, and that's pretty stupid.\n\nAnd at this point, you maybe thinking "well if the AI sucks, how is that a problem?" Well it's problem because IT BREAKS THE IMMERSION THE CHALLENGE THE MECHANICS THE GAMEPLAY THE ENTIRE FREAKING POINT OF THE GAME. Why would you play a game that consist in killing people in plain sight, without being seen, that has no AI what so ever, and that stops you from using the fun part of the levels? It's tedious, stupid, broken as hell (in the last two chapters, most NPCs died without me even being in the same room) and un-polished like an alpha from a Bethesda game. Sometimes object go through walls, preventing you from grabbing them; when it's a key, well you can load the level entirely. The ragdoll is out of controll, like Dark Souls on crack; when someone dies, anything can happen with the body. The worst thing about it is, that's the least of your problems when you play the game.\n\nAs much as I liked the first one (with its flaws), and as much as I wanted a sequel, to get the Hitman X Omen that the first one made me wish for, I just feel like I've been abused by the developers. If you read me: I know you don't have that much money. I know you meant well, but that's not how you treat the players. If you don't have money for a good looking 3D game (yeah I didn't even mentioned the fact that it looks dated and that the background are atrocious) of that scale and that ambitious, you don't do it. You have to be cleverer and make better choices in term of technology and game-design. Why chose a hospital, a really crowded place, when you know, you absolutly know, that the AI is incapable of even reacting to the sound of an explosion? Why do you chose a wide open town, with corn fields that can't hide anything, if you are not capable of doing a good matte-painting? And seriously, what the hell is with all this indications everywhere?\n\nThe concept is really cool, and GOD I wish there was someone to actually pull this off (like IO Interactive...the one from Blood Money, not Absolution) and make it a good game, while keeping the corniness of the plot, characters, and background that, in my opinion, add to the charm of the game...but yeah, that's not it. At all. And no patch can fix most of the problems.\n\nDon't buy.\n\nPS: the soundtrack is really nice though...but the audio mix sucks :'(","April 20, 2015","false","8.6"," 46 of 59 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","46","59","7","0"

You are given a mediocre "town" called Ludlow which consists of one block of literally 8 storefronts you can sneak around in. They are so close together you almost wonder how killing anyone is "stealth" because they discover the bodies quite easily if you don't burn them simply because of how small the area is. I also don't understand how there's an entire corn field burning as well as a giant cross on fire RIGHT next to the area all of the townsfolk are in. The fire is huge and big enough to lace the town in smoke, WHY is nobody reacting to that? The people seem eerily calm and accepting of their doom. Shouldn't they have SOME AI that works in the game's favor? Or are they just mindless drone NPC's poorly following a pre set path?

The detective saves you from the burning house, you end up in a hospital, here you attack a nun, get thrown into isolation and kill your doctors. here starts the actual gameplay, where you have to escape the hospital.\n\nPros:\n+Lots of ways to kill people, you are no longer restrained to kill a person the same way. this might seem like only 1 + point, but this has great impact on your game experience and will make you wanna play more than 1 playthrough as you can take a different path now.\n+more maps, and bigger. there are like 10 maps, and each has lots of people in it (especially the maps in the hospital and in the town)\n+ More abilities, tree perk. you no longer only have 1 or 2 abilities you can use like in lucius. we were only able to create fire in the last few moments of the game, so you could max kill 3 people with the most awesome abilty.. however, in lucius 2 because of the tree perks you can decide what abilities you want first, (there are 3 tree perks, each has a few more powers in it as you level it up, you can have 2 full tree's when you complete the game)\n+Graphics are slightly better, but this doesnt matter that much for most people.\n\nnow lets talk cons.\n-Lucius 2 has a bad story, this is something everyone can agree on. the beginning makes sense and is alright. but as you move forward, and complete the town map, you get the feeling they just send you to random blunt maps which seem the same and kinda boring looking\n\n-its hard to understand at first. before the game begins you get this little tutorial which gives you lots of information in a few minutes, which you quickly forget as some powers you wont immediately use. in lucius 1 the powers were evenly spread and when you got a new power / ability it was clearly explained how to use it and when, this however was not the case in lucius 2. (i had to look up a guide for the first map, so i understood how i could do everything and where to look for hints etc.)\n\n-the people in this game are absolutely ridiculous. you can kill someone in front of a nurse and she wont even come of her chair. you can break/modify items and people staring at you wont stop you. the only way to make them move is to actually walk in a restricted area, and even then is their line of sight really bad so you dont ever have the feeling of being truly ♥♥♥♥ed. also when you do get busted you can just use a lifeline and go on again, youll lose a bit of health but its easily gained by visiting a toilet (which are everywhere in this game)\n\nOkay, lets get real here for a second: Lucius 2 does not exceed the expectations after playing Lucius 1 for alot of people, the story is worse, AI is terrible, the people react bad, but that doesnt mean that this is such a bad game.\n\nLucius 2 is a fun game to cycle around with your tricycle as you kill people with anything that you can touch. (or mind control) it might not be the most realistic or serious game but thats okay. Cause its fun.\n\nId rate this game a 7/10 for enjoyment. as its really original with its playstyle. you wont often play something thats like this. i do recommend buying this on sale though. since the worth of the game really depends on what you find important in a game.","April 18","true","14.1"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","24","30","3","0"

You can kill your victims in many ways, using both the environment and items that you collect instead of one and only possible way. Game is split into levels, each with its own map, objectives and hidden stuff. Gameplay is quite buggy, but I didn't encounter any game-breaking glitches, only hilarious ones usually related to physics (which is quite impressive by the way, especially for a Unity powered game) so it's easily forgiven. The optimization is nice, despite high system requirements mentioned on the store page - with i7 4790K and GTX 970 I was able to achieve smooth 110-120 fps gameplay in full HD and with everything on max (+ additional SMAA and SweetFX effects). Played around six hours (mostly offline though) and had a lot of fun, so I recommend it to anyone who can live with the bugs and some cheesy moments.","February 13, 2015","true","0.4"," 177 of 299 people (59%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","59","177","299","30","0"

I didn't have to play long to see the many problems it has.\n\nI enjoyed the first game and while it had limitations, at least npcs felt more real to me than those in this game. The NPCs at first were jumping/glitching all over the place when I first started playing and for a second I thought I was lagging or something. Turns out it was the game itself to my surprise.\n\nSome of the stuff, while a little creative, has me questioning why people would pick up donuts off the floor and eat them? Unknowningly to them, the donuts were poisoned and  it was followed by a horrible choking animation and slight ragdoll flail to the floor. Needless to say, what happened?\n\nNot only that, sometimes I try to over think it and try to make a smart trap and turns out it doesn't work, or at least I thought. I then gave up on it and went half across the map to do something else, but then suddenly my screen goes into slow-mo and I got XP. Turns out, without me seeing or knowing, the guy for whatever reason decided to stop going on its 'fixed' path and went into my trap randomly.\n\nShould I be concerned? Not so sure now.\n\nBesides the NPCs, their glitches, faults, and outrageous rag-doll mechanics (inlcuding Lucius's as well when you're 'busted), the controls are something I want to touch on as well.\n\nThe using function is such a pain... Often times I mess up what I am doing and nearly get caught because I may have the wrong item equiped since if you pick up something, it switches to that.\n\nThe inventory is pretty spacious and all, but just trying to click on an item is a pain because often I click it and it makes me take it out almost immediately. I like the whole floating the item thing, but since it is not normal every NPC freaks out because I accidently have too many items and the inventory doesn't pause the game, so it's a rush to drop an item and quickly put away the one you are having float above your head, as if that is normal. Now I have to hide and switch items that I have equipped for the other so that if I were to be standing there like an idiot, no one will see something floating randomly next to me.\n\nWhat happened to just holding stuff? Too cool for me!\n\nAlso... Is there a toggle for the sneak? It hurts my pinky to use the Left Crtl, holding it down while trying to figure out what I need, the inventory, power or item usage, and watch the patrols... Blargh.\n\nWas this game rushed? Has no one even tested/try this game? Who the heck gave this signaI to release? I am very disappointed, but at least it gave me quite a few laughs when bodies randomly ragdoll everywhere... The first game at least was a lot better than this.\n\nNot worth it though for full price. Maybe get it when it is worth $5 and you might get a small laugh out of it.","February 21, 2015","false","4.8"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","24","37","2","0"

The game starts with a horrible and poorly made tutorial, then instead of some neat video sequences like the first game had, I had to suffer through some drawings with sound effects (the lazy mans video sequence, I suppose) and a not well thought-out plot being explained to me.\n\nWhen I try to kill my first victim I have already realized that I have made a bad purchase as the game bugs itself and the victim start getting movement spasms instead of walking to its intended locations (what's up with the AI?!). I struggle in this area for a while, getting quite angry with the ONE looping sound effect from a madman in the background. He has one sound effect, and it literally plays about every twelth second!!!!\nI can't use poison on the victim as the pills I had disappeared into the wall after I tried throwing them at an interactable ceiling hatch. Thankfully there are other, less buggy (but still buggy) ways to kill this victim, but at this point I just wish I could get my money back and never see this game again. I'm very sad to give this game a bad review as I really loved playing Lucius 1. I don't know what went wrong with this one, but I feel tricked. Obviously I should have watched a playthrough or a review on YouTube before wasting my money...\n\nLucius 1 was an incredible game, but I think they had a lower budget on its sequel, because the gameplay, sound effects and pretty much everything is a whole lot worse than it ever was. Or is this still in beta and I just didn't read the fine print?\n\nEDIT:\nI have to add to my review, because I was naive enough to give the game a second chance. Unfortunately that only served to remind me of how horrible this game actually is. I honestly believe the developers spent about one month to make some beta (or worse) version of the game, then just gave up, but released it anyway. It's riddled with bugs and glitches, and even though I loved Lucius 1, playing this sequel makes me suspect that maybe a completely different person made it. Or maybe a monkey did the programming. That would explain a lot... Honestly: NEVER buy this game. If you read this, go on YouTube and see just how terrible the gameplay is. Everything from the camera angle to the AWFUL gravity engine (or lack of one) and the buggy characters and completely depressing AI, annoyingly looping sounds without variation and a completely different gameplay from the original should be enough reasons to avoid this game like the plague.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I really did... But nope. This is the worst game I've played in years and it makes me angry to see it on my desktop.\n\nDevelopers: Shame on you. You could have done so much better!","October 31, 2015","false","0.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

There are some pretty elaborate traps to set up but good luck getting any NPC to fall for them or lining up objects so they actually hit what you're aiming at. I think the biggest problem for me was the skill tree and how limited the items are in each level. I rarely used my powers because I could usually get by with using items and more often than not, I was out of mana anyway. Mana is extremely finite and a lot of the items need to be carried over into the next level in order to use certain traps. Over all it's an ok game. It's fun for the most part but really frustrating after a while. Can't really recommend it unfortunately.","February 15, 2015","false","7.9"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","21","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VampArtemis/recommended/296830/","VampArtemis","RedVelvet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VampArtemis/","110 products in account","The main reason why I'm recommending the game is not because I adored the first, but because it has quite a lot of promise despite it's flaws. The plot of the story is just as basic as the first, but tries to over complicate itself with themes and character development that is lackluster and could have been slowed down for a more meaningful experience. Some moments, like when you first physically meet with Lucifer and when you meet up with your demon brother Isaac, leaves much to be desired. The story is rushed and feels as if, despite the gameplay and world being much more thought out, the story was put on the backburner and not given as much attention as it deserved. The story had very redeeming qualities that if it was given more time and effort, it would have been a lot more exciting. I really loved the idea of Lucifers sons fighting to be the favourite and doing so through a biblical demonic event. It moves past the personal struggles with his biological family and makes his demonic one more dynamic and almost human. For the gameplay, I felt that the fast paced and almost rushed qualities of the story rubbed off on it. The skills you obtain and the different ways that you can execute your targets were plentiful. You didn't have individual targets like the first game though, but whole floors full of people with you having a choice whether to only kill those you need to kill, or to kill them all to get more power. This is great, but the first games targets felt a lot more personal and gave you a chance to have an attachment to the character if you so wished to. If there would be a better balance between each aspect of the game and slowed it down, I think it would be much more successful of a game. Also, in regards to the endings hint towards a Lucius 3, it was a good ending at best and would have benefited with a little more flare. Perhaps using that tutorial map more so Lucifer could have more of a spotlight like he had in the first game would have done the trick. In my opinion I'd give the game a solid 6/10.","November 19, 2015","true","13.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I tried every possible way i found in the web to fix that issue. I know 2 Games which are this bugged the first one was "Among the Sleep" and the second one was "SAW". Both were really good games but with no effort to fix their bugs. One of this games "SAW" got even taken off the steam store. We have the same problematic by Lucius 2.\nOften those games have a problem with the OS or the GPU.\nI think Lucius 2 has a problem with the OS. It says a minimum OS of XP and recommends Windows 7. If you use 8/10 it might not work. A lot of people with those Versions of Windows have that issues.I tried Windows 8 and Windows 10 and it didnt work (i know theyr not good for gaming but its my laptop) Will have to try in the Future if it works on my Desktop with Windows 7.\nMy guess is that it will work with Windows 7. But if you only have 1 Comp with a Windows 8 or 10 on it u should stay away from this game because it most likely happens that it wont work. If i get it to work i change my review to positive if i like the game but still warning people to buy it.\n\n\nUpdate: So i installed it on another comp with windows 7 and it just works without any problems or bugs for now. It really catches me to play it. Gameplay,story,sound,graphic is all really good and i like it even more than the first lucius.i dont know if the non start bug has to do with the version of windows or rather with the gpu i wasnt able to fix it on myother conp.only thing i can say is: if the game starts for you then its a really good one and i dont regret my purchase at all. The game devs are working on fixing that bugs.

Sure the voice acting isn't as good, sure there are bugs, but the good stuff is just so good.\n\nWhile the cutscenes in the first game are satisfying, getting to plan your own murders is a ton of fun. It also gives the game more replay value than its predecessor, since in that one it kind of loses its touch once you know how to beat every stage. I also adore the new skill tree system and the abilities to choose from. Especially since it doesn't force you to specialize yourself; as long as you kill enough people in every stage, you can probably max out the skill tree. And still, it sure is fun to play through the game with different play styles. Wanna start off as a mind controlling puppetmaster? Do that! Wanna become a master of telekinesis and toss people around? Do that! Wanna watch stuff burn? Do that!\n\nEven though the game still steers your actions through the objectives, it still allows great freedom. Personally I'd love to see some kind of sandbox mode where you can choose between different locations to wreak havoc upon. The graphics have improved as well, so now I can finally look at Lucius's face without wanting to return to staring at the back of his head. The climax was also more impressive this time. It didn't just make you feel like an epic badass, it made you feel like an epic badass fighting a stronger epic badass. And that was fun.\n\nWhich leads me to one of my few complaints (spoiler alert): I'm not a fan of Isaac. Mostly because of his voice. A character like him who appears to be obsessed with the prophecy and talks the way he does should have a psychotic kid voice to go with that. But instead he was given a really ordinary low-pitched evil voice. Same with the devil. What was wrong with his old voice? I really liked that one.\n\nBut overall it's a really fun game, expecially if you like to get creative and watch people die. Don't expect to get "Lucius, but even more" because you won't. This game is very different from the previous one, and to me in a good way.\n\nI really, really hope they make a third game. And if that isn't enough to finish the storyline, a fourth. And a fifth. And a sixth. And as many as the developers deem neccessary. If they keep this up, I promise I will continue playing them.","April 25, 2015","true","9.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Which affirms my belief that violent video games can actually reduce aggression when used properly.\n\nPsychological concepts aside, the second game is rather different from the first. I like that the second game gives us the freedom to decide how each character dies. It gives a sense of control and freedom.\n\nBut it appears that every death is just... NPCs dying. In the first game, it actually felt like we really killed someone because there's consequences and suspicions and the need to hide evidence. Whereas in the second game... Oh, we can have a hospital filled with dead doctors and nurses and no one wonders if the hospital is haunted.\n\nIt'd be good to have a mixture of the good points from both games.","March 31","true","9.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I really don't know how to explain it. It's like they rushed to develop it or something. It's filled with bugs, weird mechanics, and just a bad design.\n\nThey tried to go for a more sandbox like gameplay where you can choose how to kill your victim, but it's just not done right. The kill scenes are bad, and not like they were in the first one. The only decent thing about this game is the story, which isn't even really grade A, but it's passable.\n\nI'd wait for this to go on sale ($5 or less). It's just not a finished or well developed game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanereynolds/recommended/296830/","kanereynolds","Kane Reynolds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanereynolds/","188 products in account","After being in the Psych Ward for six months, the doctors decide shock treatment is the best for young Lucius and that’s where things go wrong. Sadly, you don’t get to see what happens next but judging by the blood on the walls and the dead body sitting next to you with the deliberator in his chest one can only imagine…\n\nUnlike the first game where each person has a specific way they need to be sent to Hell, the sequel gives you the chance to explore the possibilities with a wide variety of deaths ranging from poisons, explosions, mind control murders, and flying oxygen tanks that are almost impossible to aim. My favorite kills so far have to be combining water on the floor with the deliberator, and using the nail gain which is pretty much a one-shot kill for each nail you have at your disposal. The hardest kill method is the oxygen tanks I’ve mentioned, because there’s no easy way to aim the sucks on the cart they use and the item keeps moving after you’ve stopped moving the cart. I could kill with a Dixie cup and some string easier than the tanks.\n\nSo far I’ve found an exploit; each of the deliberators can only be used once but saving and loading back to such saved file will reload the deliberator for use again, as well as tone down some of the way people look at you when it comes to suspicion – by the way you might be missing an item or two or need to do an objective again but that’s a small price to pay if it means you can essentially use a kill method near-indefinitely.\n\nThere’s a lot of things I like about this game but many of them are also things I liked about the first as well – such as the exploration, the music, and the immersion. Playing as the son of Satan is great and since he has no lines of any kind he doesn’t bore anyone with quotes cheesy one-liners. There’s a quote from Highlander in this one – imagine how much I laughed.\n\nBut there’s still some things that I didn’t like that returned as well. The music does seem to lag out from time to time and the voice narration is super quiet. Although the objectives are really clear, the kill methods seem to have some preferred victims, making it hard to kill that person with the keys if you’ve already used up your poisoned doughnuts.\n\nThe only two characters returning from the first game are the detective – the narrator but replaced with a different voice actor from the first – and Lucius’ human father but his role in the sequel can be summed up and being a vegetable on a hospital bed next to a life support machine than can be shut off at any time. That’s about it.\n\nIn short, I like Lucius 2 and will stand by the game in all its glory and faults just like I did its predecessor. I’m a little ways into chapter two and it doesn’t seem to have a very long game by the looks of it. According to Steam, there’s only about four more missions before the game is complete, but replay value is pretty high – there’s boggle heads to collect, kills to try out, skills to obtain, and cars to get hit by, so I can see myself playing this one for a while.\n\n\nNow if you’ll excuse me I just reduced the population of Ludlow to zero and must explore to see if I missed something. To those playing this game, happy hunting!\n\n(Fun fact: The town of Ludlow seems to have gotten in adult gizmos that are available at the General Store.)","February 13, 2015","true","26.0"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","15","29","5","0"

But will you want to play this game or go back to the first one ? In Lucius 2 we play as Lucius. This game takes place after the events of the first game. After the destruction that Lucius caused he got sent to a Mental Hospital to be tested but after a mistake some of the workers make Lucius is able to escape and wreak havoc. Lucius finds out that he has a brother and he needs to beat him to win over his father. So how is this game ? The game is a really good game but theres a ton of stuff wrong with this game. First of all this game is entirely diffrent then the first game. Unlike the first game where you didnt have control on who to kill or how to kill them you are now given free control on who to kill and any way you want to. You have all the objectives availble at the start of the level and you can get them in any order you like. The game's story is very interesting and in my oppinion is way better than the first game and its way more fun than the first game cause the killing system works way better in 2 than in 1 but this is where the problems start to pour down. The game is riddled with bugs and sometimes it can be game breaking. People clip through walls, Items phase through walls, the map sometimes doenst show doors and it can be complicated and without spoilers. The final level is complete BS and to figure out what you need to do could be really annoying. Overall Lucius 2 is a good game and without a doubt i would reccomend getting at some point or just wait for a patch because this game is way better than the first. I bought the game yesterday and had trouble finishing a level because of the bugs. When i closed the game i found that there was a patch that fixed the problem. If you were a fan of the first game defiently thing about getting this game. I give Lucius 2 a 7/10","February 28, 2015","true","7.3"," 34 of 67 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","34","67","3","0"

Barely used the special skills (i.e. pyromancy) because they were so tedious and poorly explained\n-LAG. Omg, the lag. Certain parts were worse than others\n-The graphics in the first game were not the best. That said, I feel like the graphics in this one were a step down\n-No level selection. If you miss something the first time, you're screwed if you saved past it\n-All or nothing controls. There would be times where I would be setting up a trap and slight movement on my control-stick would yield no movement. I'd ever so slightly increase the motion of the control-stick only to be greeted by overly dramatic over-shooting\n\nUnfortunately I would not reccommend this game as a stand-alone game.

You get to explore a lot more, and you actually don't have to kill EVERYONE (but, come on...).\n\nThe soundtrack is good, although I'd dare to say the previous one was better'ish'.\n\nI don't usually rate games numerically, but you've to start somewhere.\n\nGameplay:  8/10 (as soon as that ragdoll gets patched up, it will go up to 10/10)\nSoundtrack:  8/10\nGraphics:  9/10\nEnjoyment:  666/666 (10/10)\nOverall: 8/10  (fix the ragdoll and that goes to a 9/10 for new players to the series, and 10/10 to Satan worshippers)\n\n** old review **\n\nOk, I'll keep this short for now, as I'm busy playing (killing people), and I want to go back to playing (you know, kill more people).\n\nIf you've played the first, you'll love this one, because you, well, kill people.\nIt's a lot more freestyle, when compared to the first one, as you can kill whoever the hell you well please (meaning kill them all).\nThe cinematics are quite nice (and if you check my screenshots, there's one very interesting, where you can see McGuffin "kneeling" down before Satan.\n\nSo far, I'll say that my only "real complaint" is the ragdoll mechanic, after you kill someone they're literally just a ragdoll, and at the slightest touch, move everywhere.

While you can kill people in a lot of different ways, it does get tedious, repetitive and very boring very quickly.\n\nThe controls are clunky, especially during crouching it is awkward to move where you want to go. While the map is open you can walk but can't turn which seems like an oversight and the devs either didn't intend for you to be able to walk while the map is open and it's a bug or they did and it doesn't work and it's a bug.\n\nHaving said all that, I personally like the voice acting and the cut-scenes and enjoyed the story-line so far and will try to play this one through as time goes on just to see the story through as the gameplay is not that amazing by itself.\n\nI also enjoy the skill tree and setting people on fire or mind controlling people is just to funny, making them walk into traps and kill themselves.\n\nIf you are looking for an intense action adventure game then this is not it, trying to complete the story killing the relevant people just to move on with the story is frustratingly boring at times.\n\nAll in all not bad and still recommendable as you can just have fun, ignoring story progress, taking your time to come up with convoluted traps that kill people in humorous ways.\n\nThe way you can kill people is where the game really shines.\n\nThough, as a casual player of this title/series, for the price I paid I definitely feel I got the shorter end of the stick and you might want to wait for a bundle or sale discount.","February 14, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Which normally is fine, just reopen them. However, if somebody dies in a doorway and the game loads, the door is now shut on the dead body which causes the body to completely stop the door from opening ever again.

It makes me laugh every time i make someone walk into a hazzard or down an elevator shaft.\n-From what ive come across it can be a bit like a puzzle game where you have to get certain pieces in the right place and it can make you think.\n\nCons:\n-Sometimes things can..break. Which means you have to reload your last save in order to get an item that you need to progress. This is just a minor annoyance and has only happened to me once.\n-Im not terribly invested in the story. Its more fun just killing the AI then knowing why you are doing what you are.\n-There isnt really any benifit to being sneaky.\n\nneutral:\n-The physics can get a bit weird with ragdoll when you are caught or kill someone, but once again i think this just makes me laugh more than it makes me upset that its not realism.\n-Toilets give mana or power. Dont exactly understand that one, but its semi humorous.\n-Sometimes you dont have the obvious tools to get a kill you need on someone to get a set of keys, which can lead to a bit of searching untill you find it in some obscure place after 10 min.\n\nOverall I would reccomend this game. The price point is a bit high for it currently at $20, but if you can get it on sale I would say get it because It can give you some good laughs and who doesnt want to be the son of satan for a little while?\n\n7.8/10\n\n","February 25, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Don't let it ruin the story for you.\n\nThe gameplay is completely different, and although it could have been a nice change, it seems like it's only in alpha stage and is pretty horrible to play. All of the characters have no logic to them. Don't worry if you get caught killing someone or if someone finds a dead body, there are virtually no consequences as they will carry on acting as if nothing happened. You can't even use your hands anymore, everything is done via levitating objects. If there is a cross in the room, you can'st just go and turn it over. No, you have to stand far away from it and throw an object at it with your telekynesis.\n\nRemember all those awesome elements that made you love the first game? Your'e not really going to find those here (no more challenging puzzles). The storyline isn't implemented into the game very well too (mostly due to the crappy gameplay).\n\nOverall, this game looks like it's in alpha stage, not even beta.

I am not sure about that. Lucius 2 definatly has some major bugs. I first thought of it as more promissing. Most killing methods just repeat themselves. And you find yourself with using Control and Fire(manareg) as one of the top skills. Later telekenesis is helpfull (pressing a button from a distance a single time)\nThe Ragdoll system sucks. You pull your dead victim in a room, and then you kick it out again, which quite sucks. Sandbox experience? Not really. Under sandbox I understand quite more. And once you don't have enough pills or electrical cords and your experience is to low to make your victim jump itself down the elevator shaft you find yourself soon stuck.\nThe ending is quite lame. Could have been done better and leaves you with the impression that the game was literally too short to play.\nIt sure rather reminds as an early access then a finished game. Part 1 - Linear but still fun. Part 2 - free to kill in each level is quite fun, but the ragdoll and the quite dry storyline ruins everything.

It crashed 49/50 times and there seemed to be no fix in sight. Nothing I tried worked and I found myself becoming increasingly impatient and ever-so-close to wanting to demand for some sort of compensation. However, that mindset quickly changed with the patience and amazing communication of the devs that helped me finally fix this issue. So I'm definitely giving Devs 5/5\n\nGame play, it's pretty simple; simple physics with the way objects are thrown and the force of the throw can determine whether something potentially lethal (chemicals) will break and kill your unsuspecting victim or just chill on the floor (or whatever place it lands on). The story is simple. Maybe a bit too simple since the main objective of this game seems to be killing everyone in as many ways as you can think of possible. I'm giving that a 3/5 for game play since it /does/ get a bit repetitive after awhile. Also, my first time playing through this game, even though I use the lifeline, somehow, I still end up getting a game over instead of memorywiping the person that busts Lucius.\n\nThe objectives are pretty repetitive; collect keys, unlock doors and break things to complete your objective (and kill specific people). The story of the game can pretty much be summarized in a few words: Escape the hospital, kill your competition for Father/Satan's affection and the right to kinda be like Satan's favorite son that gets to sit by him while the world burns. Story: 2/5\n\nSo I guess I give this game a 3/5\n\n1. This game was pretty freaken broken when it first came out. BUT the devs are all working very hard to fix the issues one by one.\n\n2. The Devs are all super nice people. They kept me updated with possible fixes until the issue of game crashing was fixed.\n\n3. I love the fact that I get to be the antichrist and murder people. (Basically, I love the Omen and the concept of the two Lucius games) I know the first game was definitely parallel to the Omen in story but Lucius II had an original storyline in continuation of the first game.\n\n\nAnd regardless of the flaws of this game, I'm looking forward to a Lucius III.","March 12, 2015","true","23.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Determined to make his critical appointment, Chris makes a hard U-turn and heads back up the West Virginia highway. Running low on fuel, he finds a shortcut, it's clearly a road less traveled, but to Chris it seems to be a quick fix to avoid the traffic jam. Not far away, Jessie and her friends, Carly, Scott, Evan and Francine, stand quietly--stunned as they survey what's left of their road trip after the tires blow out on their SUV. They've been left stranded, deep in the middle of the woods. Chris heads down the dusty road, accidentally hitting the SUV along the way, scattering the foursome around it. Luckily no one is seriously hurt in the collision, but egos are bruised and tempers flare. Chris is apologetic, and Jessie is the calming force when she discovers that the reason they're in their predicament is that barbed wire had been stretched across the road. Therefore, their blown out tires were seemingly the result of a prank. The group quickly bands together, determined to find a phone. Evan and Francis stay with the cars, as the other four make their way down the road. As they venture deeper and deeper into the woods, the assumed idea that the trap was set by a prankster grows dim upon their discovery of a mountain cabin filled with grisly hunting weapons and horrific souvenirs of the hunt. They are now certain that whomever--or whatever--lives in the cabin is responsible for the barbed-wire trap that derailed their trip. What the foursome doesn't know, however, is that Evan and Francine are now dead, mercilessly mutilated by three gruesome mountain men. Facing an uncertain and possibly horrific fate at the hands of these men, the four friends are sure of one thing: they will never go camping again.","February 20, 2015","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had one issue regarding the save cache giving me a black screen, but I deleted my custom saves and restarted the level and there wasn't an issue. Checkpoints are frequent after each objective, so it's not that frustrating.\nI would say the engine needs a tweak as it can be quite demanding on a low end computer,\nI think purely due to optimisation issues.\nSaying all that, whether or not its a self aware game or written with the creativity of a shoebox,\nIt is hilarious to play through and can be very entertaining.\n\nI picked it up for 15 quid and I would say the pricing is about right.

They marketed it as a sandbox, there was never any doubt of what it was going to be. That's how it was always marketted, I didn't even really expect there to be a story to it, from what people were saying before it was released.\n\nAside from that, there is actually a decent story, if you're paying attention. Having played this game more times than what would probably be considered healthy since it's release, I've had time to really pay attention to the story. Instead of the long cut scenes from the first movie, you have people talking about incidents that happened. You have newspaper clippings. You have things that are actually subtle, that you have to pick up on. It's not an overly cinematic game.\n\nNow, the game itself is buggy, more so than Lucius was, yes, but there's no game breaking bugs, really. Something might come up every now and again where you'll have to go back to the beginning of a level and play it over again, but other than that, I, personally, have not encountered any game breakers. I've never crashed playing this game or anything like that.\n\nAnd yes, the way the AI acts when you kill something is goofy. It's amusing to me. I enjoy it. But that's me.\n\nIn short, yes, it's a buggy indie game. I didn't go into the game thinking there wasn't going to be bugs, because honestly, the first Lucius also had bugs, and there were some actual game breaking bugs in the first one.\n\nAnd there are a lot of references in the game that had me amused. Ludlow, for one. The younglings for another. Just small things they slipped into the game.","February 23, 2015","true","49.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your objective is to go around and kill people, for the glory of Satan of course. You're meant to use your environment as a tool to kill nurses, patients and other people. When you kill someone, you need to hide the bodies. Otherwise people will find them and grow suspicious and panicky.\n\nNow, as a game, the concept is very creative and fun. Who does not want to go around and use the supernatural to kill your foes? However the game seems to fall a bit on the matter of actual functionality. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches. For example, people in the game can sometimes glitch into the walls if you drag their bodies, the game can crash when you finish a level, and different sounds can go off without any particular reason. I had the music sound, which plays when you kill someone, play on a loop randomly, even if I was just standing still. Occasionally the narration would replay without a reason.\n\nNow, would I recommend the game? Yes. Even with the bugs, the game is actually rather fun and enjoyable. The puzzles are rather creative and when you figure them out, you actually feel pretty good about yourself.\nHowever, if you really cannot stand bugs and glitches in games, you may want to wait until the devs release a bugfixing patch. Lucius 2 really could use one.","February 27, 2015","true","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That may change based on whether or not the developers actually fix the infinite amount of bugs the game has.\n\n\nIt's basically a buggy, magical Hitman: Blood Money. You're put into a sandbox area and given tasks, but are allowed to do as you please for the most part. Some people you HAVE to kill, but others are just a bonus.\n\nThis game is buggy beyond reason. If you combine your items together, save, and then reload, those items will be glitched and unusable most of the time. If you kill someone, save, then reload, there's a chance that they will spawn in alive and then magically die after a few seconds. I had a glitch where a guy who was suppose to be in a coma walked around for a few seconds before resuming his normal function. The AI sometimes gets stuck on silly objects, or will survive an acid attack despite being half-way corroded. Sometimes you'll get in trouble for being in an un-restricted area. AIs sometimes forget their patterns and refuse to behave normally. I've had issues where music would loop over other music, even during cutscenes, forcing you to quit the game.\nThere are probably a lot more glitches and bugs that I haven't mentioned. I'm guessing the huge ammount of bugs was due to the devs wanting to release it on Friday the 13th, and thus had to rush.\n\nDespite these awful and frustrating issues, the game is still pretty fun. If you've played Hitman: Blood Money enough times that you could probably kill someone in real life, you'll like this game. I've played around 10 hours and am close to beating the game. I will say that atleast 3 or 4 of those hours was backtracking because a series of bugs ruined a mission, but still.\n\nHopefully the devlopers will patch out a good majority of the bugs. If and when that happens, I fully reccomend this game at $20 for the amount of content you're getting, but as of now, I wouldn't pay more than $10-15.","February 27, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do you have this desire to find creative ways to kill all that stand in your way from achieving your goals of showing the devil how much you love him? Well if you said yes this is the game for you.\n\nLucius II: The Prophecy, developed by Shiver Games, takes a page right out of the movie The Omen, and puts you in the shoes of Lucius an unassuming boy who has a very dark past and intent. You will find yourself navigating through a hospital, as well as a local town. Somehow you have lost your devilish powers, and you are going to be hell bent on getting them back. There's only one issue, you are going to have to first escape the hospital. Once you do that there's a little twist and perhaps some competition waiting for you.\n\nGraphically this game looks great, it uses the Unity engine, and you can definitely tell that it uses it well. I was a bit concerned about the random male nudity that was sprinkled through the game, especially a specific locked bathroom door scene, but other than that the game looked great.\n\nI just wish I could say the same about the game mechanics. There's definitely the option to customize your evil powers so that you can play to your strengths, but there are definitely some skills that once I got them I never used them, or I could never figure out how to use them. Basically the first fire skill till the end of the game I couldn't figure out how to use.\n\nThere's also the fact that when you pick up items you automatically levitate them in your hand, my problem is I really wish that items/weapons that you use that could use an actual touch were held. It just looked strange to use the nail gun, or the water container as it is suspended in air.\n\nSpeaking of suspending in air the whole throw mechanic was just strange, would it have been too much to ask to just have a straight shot with gravity taking effect after some distance instead of the constant rainbow throw that the game gave you. It was just a little awkward to aim for something straight in front of you or right above you, if you were standing close.\n\nThe music in the game definitely gave you that anti-christ game feeling. I'm not saying screaming demons, or anything, but it definitely fit with The Omen type of feel. I did find it interesting that the voice overs in game tended to fade in and out which made me thankful there was subtitles so that I could actually pick up on what was being said.\n\nThis game definitely showed that there are many many ways to kill, and I have to say that the MOST difficult part of the entire game was the beginning, I spend hours trying to figure out how to kill people in the hospital because I accidentally screwed up a chance to kill someone. Hell I ended up possessing people's minds and had them continuously walk into the open elevator shaft because I couldn't get anything else to work.\n\nI do wish I was able to play the first one so that I could get the whole story, but then again this is probably a game with three parts as this game will give you a cliffhanger at the end. I can say that you can jump right into the game from this chapter, thanks to the openning credits.\n\nIn the end this game is frustrating, feels clunky, and there are certain things that aren't 100% clear on what you are supposed to do that will leave you scratching your head and maybe ultimately reaching out to the gaming community to figure out a solution. So with that being said this game gets a 7.1 out of 10.","March 5, 2015","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That tells you something. Some of these things cannot be changed with patches. If I was the developers, I would scrap this junk and start over.\n\nThe basics.\n\nCLUNKY GAMEPLAY. Terrible movement and no thriller element what so ever. You're in a mental hospital to kill people, and it feels like I am an old lady at the market, looking for an exit. The AI see you behind walls, or doors before they're opened, but they do not spot you glaring at them through a glass window. The controls are terrible. Cannot quickly run past something, grab it and keep going; need to focus on the item and pick it up and put it in your inventory ...sigh. All AI run in the same motion, all the time. The mental patient running down the hall, back and forth, the mental patient standing near the magazine counter, the two men chatting at the table, the janitor... they all do the same motion, every time, no element of surprise, no puzzle, just boring kill them and wait for them to repeat their same actions.\n\nTERRIBLE STORY. This story literally made me laugh in a pathetic way. When I watch the beginning cutscene, I thought to myself then and there, "this is going to be a refund." The writer obviously has a very vague understanding of religious culture and absolutely no knowledge of Satan. A child with a crayon and a booger, could create better material. Weak story, uneventful, no draw-in what so ever, no thrill, just cheesy boring dialog.\n\nThe developer clearly got made fun of in Sunday school; Jesus hurt his feelings. So he cried, and made a promise to one day release a terrible game that no one would play, even at a 75% discount, because he is in himself, a failure.\n\nIf you paid full price. You got hosed. If you paid $4.99, you got hosed. I wouldn't even buy this, just go download it someplace, it will be in your recycling bin wthin an hour.","February 27","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I ADORED the first Lucius, so I was so excited for this, but it seems so rushed. Sure, the main aspect of this game is killing people in imaginitive ways - and yes, I have to say that sometimes that is fun. Only sometimes. As you progress you end up just doing the simplest thing. Poisoning, throwing acid...it all gets a little tedious. Not to mention the freakin GLITCHINESS of this game! My "E"  button "Lifeline" KILLS ME if I use it (not much of a second chance, more of a suicide). Lucius ragdolls whenever caught, and in all honest it's laughable. The atmosphere is ruined when you suddenly get picked up by your arm and you ragdoll around and glitch through the wall and floor. Sometimes the deaths don't even register - on  more than one occasion I poisoned some coffee, the person drank it then simply continued to wander around as normal. The music cuts out sometimes, and the throwing system and aim is far to quick to even react to, meaning you stand there wiggling your mouse to get it to aim in the right way. Also, Lucius seems to hate holding things, meaning if you pick up even  an innocent item such as a sandwich you get caught and boom, game over (yes, I should be able to use my Lifeline, but oh, that kills me!). Yes, I liked the sneaking and the killing and even the art style, modeling and the music, but the rest is so buggy that it takes away the greatness from this game.

It's a low budget indie horror game.  You know it's going to be goofy, jenky and buggy.   It's one thing to get all obnoxious with gamer activism for unfinished AAA titles, but man, chill out on the small teams making goofy games.   The quality was EXACTLY what I would expect from a game of this caliber.\n\nThings to note for the angry gamer:\nYou will find plenty of bugs, but not many that really break the game.  I only had one instance where a person who had the keys I needed, got knocked down and never got back up or died.\nAnimations, Models, Ragdoll Physics... Just general graphics are meh.\nYou can get away with damn near anything.  People really just kind of look right past you or you can just run away real fast.\nThe last boss was absolutely impossible to figure out.\nI had no idea the credits were rolling and I had beat the game.\nMy play through saw 2 whole video game wieners.\nThat said, this game is what you make of it.  I just don't get why people will buy a low budget horror game and yell about development. If you are a fan of B-Horror movies, this is a pretty fun game to play but you might want to pop it on your wish list and snag it during a big sale.\n\nHere is one of the 2 wieners I encountered in my playthrough:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392706772","February 15, 2015","true","13.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Personally I enjoyed every minute of it and will continue playing long after I have finished. There are only a few games in my entire Steam library that I have actually sat down and played from beginning to end; and fewer still that I actually go back to. With most games I usually get bored after awhile and start playing something else, but Lucius II kept me thorougly entertained during my entire playthrough. Yes it is a short game, but each level is a sandbox that provides unlimited diversion. Yes, there are bugs, but I have not encountered any that were gamebreaking. I only crashed once in the many hours I've played, and the other bugs I encountered were mostly minor, such as a missing icon or broken camera angle when climbing up to a rooftop.\n\nI have only a few gripes, and nothing too serious to keep anyone from enjoying this game. The first is a lack of kill animations. Whenever you sucessfully kill an NPC they will usually turn into a ragdoll and fall on the floor. The kills are still interesting and unique and should delight most players, but the lack of detailed death animations kinda makes that elaborate setup you worked so hard on seem disappointing. Another problem is the AI in general. It still needs a lot of work. Sometimes an NPC will get stuck in a position or have trouble reacting to the bait you left on the floor, or sometimes they will just sit in mid air. They also do not react when an explosion just rocked the next room. This brings me to my final complaint which is the overall unpolished feel to the game. As players have suggested, it feels rushed. You'll notice a decline in quality as soon as you watch the cutscenes, which are nothing more than paper dolls with a character narrating. I don't know if they were going for an aesthetic appeal with this or just cutting costs. When compared to the cinematic cutscenes of the first game it really feels like they opted for the less expensive route.\n\nPersonally I'm not bothered by the cheap changes or the small bugs and beta AI, but now I cannot decide which game I prefer. I love the first game, and that one actually feels like a finished product, but the lack of variety really turns me off. After you finish that game there's really no reason to go back to it unless you are achievement hunting. Lucius II, however, lets you plan your murders, set up traps, and kill in any order. On the other hand, in Lucius I the kill scenes were so gruesomely gratifying. It's really hard to decide which game is better, but I think that once the devs finally iron out all the problems in Lucius II I'm sure most fans will be happy with it. There's an amazing sequel to Lucius here, you just have to dig through all the mess to find it.\n\n(Oh yeah, and the final boss is a direct replica of Malachai from Children of the Corn. Too awesome!)","February 22, 2015","true","14.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

However, there are so many game-breaking bugs, poorly designed interfaces, performance issues, and control scheme nightmares that I cannot recommend this game to anyone.\n\nFor example, there is a sequence where Lucius must use a shotgun. Simple, right? No. The process goes like this:\n1. Collect the shotgun and shells by aiming the reticule at them, pressing E, and then pressing G (yes, really).\n2. Go to the inventory screen and drag the shells onto the shotgun. The game does not pause while you're in this window, despite the fact that you can't see any of the action, so it's very likely you'll get mercilessly ravaged while you attempt to do this.\n3. Double-click the shotgun to equip it. Urghh, it didn't work. Double-click again. Double-cli- Oh, there it goes.\n4. Fire twice before having to repeat the clumsy process all over again.\n\nAdditionally, it's possible to get into states where a level becomes uncompletable -- for example, on many of the hospital floors, there are keys you need to pick up in order to progress. These keys can disappear or become lodged somewhere out of sight, and the level has to be restarted.\n\nThere's a fair amount of slowdown in this game, which is odd considering the fact that the graphics aren't anything to write home about. The final battle is particularly bad about this -- particle effects grind the game to a halt. Expect freezes, too.\n\nThere's a great number of smaller issues that the developers surely must have noticed -- for example, the inventory screen often claims containers are 100% full when they're actually empty, volume levels fluctuate at random from scene to scene, and when Lucius drops objects, they hover in midair instead of falling to the ground.\n\nAdd to that the fact that no one proofread any of the text, and you can clearly see that this is another half-baked Unity game released on Steam far too early. I hope that Lucius II becomes playable someday, but for now, it's impossible to justify spending $20 for the dubious pleasure of playing this frustrating game. Overall, it's a great concept, but it feels like it's still in alpha.","February 16, 2015","false","8.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Not something I found enjoyment in playing.\n\nI purchased this game soley because  Cr1TiKaL voiced one of the characters  in the game. But after playing with the intent of personally interacting with the character, I just gave up; the game was just that unenjoyable.\n\nAt first, I thought the game concept was kind of interesting and creative. As I was playing the game it, at first, seemed to have a nice atmosphere and setting. But everything went downhill after the cutscene with the demon and the investigator. All seriousness was sucked out of my experience when that demon's mouth moved in such a cartoonic fashion. And things did not get better once the actual gameplay started.\n\nThe tutorial was a bit lazy. Takes you to hell so you can learn how to play. Why couldn't it take place in the actual world? And learn as you complete the first mission? That's something that's pretty much standard these days. Anyway, after getting out of hell and starting the real game, things become pretty tedious feeling. It's already been mentioned in other reviews but there doesn't seem much of a point to some of the creative ways to kill people except for fun. So why do that when you can just poison all the doughnuts?\n\nThe one positive thing I found in the game was a reference to Kitty Forman from That 70's Show.\n\nAs for the story, I feel it's a bit poorly written. It feels like the story was an after thought or the story came after the they already had the idea for where they want Lucius to go, like it was just tagged on.\n\nLastly, I could not get past the terribly handled "easter egg"/tribute to PewDiePie. I'm not a fan of the guy, and I don't have a problem with him, but the way the whole beachball thing was handled is just painful, like being beaten over the head with a sack of frozen oranges. Expect with oranges you aren't out $20 and you can still uses them for something. I'm sure maybe it made some PewDiePie fans giggle a little, but for the rest of us it made an already disappointing experience even worse. The only thing I can imagine that would have made it any worse would be if the ball talked and was voiced by PewDiePie himself. Or by Fred.\n\nIn conclusion, this game was just a let down and I advise those who are curious about this game take a moment and reconsider purchasing this game.","March 20, 2015","false","2.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If you're looking for a game that teases your mind, you will be disappointed.\n\nUnfortunately the game is full of bugs and glitches. Doors never cooperate, and trying to hide a body in a closet is like trying to shove a water noodle into the closet using nothing but your forehead.\n\nDespite the glitches though, I do enjoy the game. It's derpy and over the top, very different from the snore-fest that the original was.\n\nThis video I've made gives a good idea of what the game is like.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA85cqVfaMo","February 17, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Yes, it was limited, but the kills were all unique, and you actually *GASP* had to do some detective work (read: stalking) to find the nessecary tools to kill your next victim.\n\nLucius 2 tries to be much more sandboxy and only partially makes it. The AI is pretty brain-dead, the levels a wee bit cramped and out of place. You can sneak by pressing control, but you wont need it once, as even if you do get caught you have at least 2 mind erases available. Combine all that with health from toilets, random gay sex in the bathrooms, and a saints row 'esque purple ♥♥♥♥♥ killer and you can easily form the opinion these guys arent taking the game seriously, and neither should you. But, that ruins immersion in a game like this. IF I want LOL RANDUMB things in games, then I'll go play a game that is tongue and cheek.\n\nThere is a nice variety of "special" kills but there could have been so many more. After a few levels another new way pops up, and then its back to Poison sandwich, defib, elevator, fireaxe blah blah etc.  Finally the uprade system is pretty bad. You have 3 skill trees to choose from; mind control, telekenesis, and pyro. Each individual "talent" takes 3 points to.. well I'm not sure but I think it makes them last.. longer? The game isnt nearly long enough to get every single talent unlocked, but that doesn't matter, as more than half of them are pretty useless. I'm a BIG fan of fire in games, and when even I don't care enough to even put a single point in the entire pyro skill tree... that says a lot.\n\nWhile I never had a problem with setting up traps and killing innocents, I see many others do. I would say this is a case of people not being patient enough or too slow (mentally) to not play a game where M1 = Kill. Yes there are a ton of bugs but none gamebreaking. I had ZERO save game problems, either loading or with corruption. I think many on here that do are full of it, and just want to join the bandwagon because they can't possibly form their own opinions on things, or being a troll in reviews is cool to.. them? Oh there are alwasy the people trying to run even a game like this on ancient hardware then trey to blame the developers because their 15 year old rigs crash every 10 seconds!\n\nIt's not the greatest game ever, but it's fun and is priced well for the content and length. Just like it's predecessor. I look forward eagerly to Lucius 3: The Sandwich Fandango\n\n","February 20, 2015","true","21.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

The storyline is riveting from the beginning all the way to the final conflict.  You feel mesmerised by Lucius as he conducts his reign of death, There were so many ingenius tools and means by which Lucius conducted his business.You absolutely never got bored for even a second. The game is two chapters and they are both lengthy.You move from Hospitals to Research Facilities to exploring the dark town of Ludlow with many other distinct and original areas in between. The graphics were superb. It is extremely rare in this day and age to find a game that pushes the limits as this one does. At times outlandish and sometimes hilarious this game goes to the brink of well mannered society and bumps it up a notch. I like that. I like it a lot. People need to be challenged at times and this game certainly does that. Just the sheer number of different buildings and areas to explore was extraordinary! The creativity created for the death scenes was obviously well thought out. There were literally hundreds of different items that could be utilised to achieve the task at hand. I'm not sure anyone could really say enough about the storyline. It was absolutely a masterpiece from beginning to end. It blended together magnificently. I felt the character. I felt his mission. I understood the root core of his being. In conclusion,I would like to say to the developers; I certainly hope there will be a Lucius III. Also,leave Lucius as the young boy he was in your next addition. This one unique aspect seems to trademark this young fellow. We don't want to see him grow up. Also,consider giving him a voice to speak. I believe this would add tremendously to the next addition.","February 24, 2015","true","52.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

Jerky camera (no matter how low you set mouse speed).  "Helpful" text everywhere like you're some robot analyzing everything that useful and how you can use it.  Interacting with dragable objects and teh rag doll physics of dead bodies is AWFUL.  Ther eis no fine manipulation, you have no precise control.\n\nI killed a guy cuz I needed his keys.  Fried him when he went to use a sink.  The keys fell out of reach behing the door.  The body was blocking the door so I couldn't close it to get the keys.  Tried dragging the body out of the way but it was stuck under the door.  Hence no way at all I could get the keys because of this stupid "physics" system...more like a physics anomaly.\n\nThis game could be fun, different ways to kill people unlike the first game, more people to kill, open sandbox type areas, interesting powers.  But poor controls, poor interface, and horrible "physics" make this more of a chore than a game.\n\nAlso, no manual saves.

My computer was brand new and saw Lucius II was available and purchased it, when I was going through the tutorial I noticed that I was having serious framerate drops. Thinking that "it's probably because this map has a lot of detail textures for the fire and the rocks." But issues still presisted even after the turorial level.\n2. The A.I.would glitch out on more than one ocasion. I could kill a doctor in a room across the map, within no one's line of sight, and still get caught by a doctor, nurse, or patient from across the map.\n3. I'm not to sure about this one in particular, but in the level where you have to suffocate Lucius' dad, you have to acquire the file before you can get to him, which happens to be in a room occupied by tree doctors and one that walks in every so often; one option to kill them is with the sprinkler system and applying acid to the water line. Once I had applied the acid, it would then say to activate the sprinkler system...is there a switch somewhere or do you need a lighter? It's too vague really, and if you happen  to need a lighter, none spawn on the map, but you can get one from the previous levels...at the penalty of sacraficing your save.\n4. When opening a save file, some of the NPC's would glitch and react to me as if I had killed someone within their line of sight.\nA word to the wise, if you're thinking about buying this game DO NOT DO IT. You are wasting your money, your time, and your patience with this haphazard of a game.

Don't listen to all of the negative reviews by idiots who gave the game a down-vote because their computer's graphics card and/or processer power is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ via; "The framerate was bad" and "I wish I could run it" is no reason to give the game a bad review. Get a better computer, play the game, THEN rate it or just deal with what you have like I did. I played the game on medium quality (low quality during the last level to run more smoothly because the fire/electricity/rain graphics going on were 2good4me) and it was still outstanding. My computer isn't a gaming computer so the framerate wasn't the greatest but it's not the game's fault. It was a stunning game beyond belief nonetheless.\n\nAside from my opinion on people down-voting the game because their computer was subpar/didn't meet the requirements.... now for the ACTUAL REVIEW.\n\nJust like the last game, the game had its bugs. It was definitely an improvement though! The first game had lots of bugs but was still a good game and this one had MUCH less and was even better!\n\nThe gore was SO MUCH BETTER in this game. The organs and arteries spilled in the beginning was an ASTOUNDING touch and I absolutely loved the start of the game where you walk around the ward in a straight jacket covered in blood. It made the whole setting all the more exciting and interesting! It was a sad day when you had to go find and put your suit back on. :( Back in black, baby!\n\nThe story was even more interesting than the first game's. Instead of following a storyline of murdering people in the house in specific ways and in certain orders, you were able to freely roam because it's a sandbox game, and you do whatever as you please, when you please, how you please.\n\nAlthough some tasks of murdering people in certain ways were tedious, near the end of the game I would just mind control people (who were either in the way of what I needed to do or had something on them that I needed) and simply make them walk into a fire I started or was already there lol. I know, how uncreative of me. What I'm getting at here is that some ways of murdering were tougher than others, but I'd rather spend an extra 3-5 minutes figuring out how to kill someone in a creative way rather than just poisoning their coffee or donuts or something. Now THAT's boring. (Plus there isn't enough medication to go around in each level lol.)\n\nI'm not going to spoil anything, which is why this is going to be a short paragraph; this game's ending was so much more satisfying than the first one's. Just sayin'.\n\nOver all, both games were FANTASTIC. I like this one more than the first, but that doesn't mean the first one was bad. Basically, if you like a somewhat easy game - following a specific storyline with specific methods (which was fun playing out, don't get me wrong!) you will probably find the first game more appealing.  If you enjoy challenges and levels that you'll have to actually try on once or twice to achieve so the game isn't just a breeze, I'd definitely say Lucius 2 is your best choice. Both games were absolutely two games that I will favor for a very long time. Can't wait for Lucius 3! <3\n\nBtw thanks to my buddy Josh for gifting me this sick ♥♥♥ game. :^)","June 19, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This seems to be trying to take the whole thing into a more sandboxey way which might have been really fun if the game actually worked as it should. The UI is terrible and the performance is awful but that is the least of this games problems.\n\nThere are bugs everywhere. Characters going through walls, getting stuck in doorways and etc etc. I lost all interest in the game when the guy who had the key i needed got stuck inside a toilet and somehow managed to block the door. It feels unfinished and i can't recommend it.\n\nThe actual content in the game could have been fun. The story is chessy but it could have been enjoyable. I am not convinced of the new sandbox style gameplay. The AI behaves oddly and there have not been many interesting ways to manipulate the environment so far. Perhaps there will be more interesting ones later on but so far it has mostly been poisoned food, water/electricity and some fire stuff.","October 18, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We're all people and we all have the right to live our lives how we want to. I have much love for ALL people!\n\nThis game was partially broken on release but thankfully they've fixed it now :)\nSo here's my NEW review!\n\nPROS:\n- Play as the ♥♥♥♥ing anti-christ!! EPIC!\n- Kill people in creative and horrific ways! AWESOME!\n- See 2 gay guys having sex in a hospital bathroom....Why isn't this a con?.. Because I threw a jug of slippery fluid on them (:O) and watched as one man fell down and the other one just kept humping the air until I threw a vial of acid into the room killing them both. GOOD TIMES!\n\nEDIT: This was NOT an enjoyable moment simply because I have any problem with homosexuality. It would have been just as fun if it'd been a man and a woman banging in the bathroom. But I must say that walking in on two guys was an epic curveball that made it that much funnier. Especially when the one guy just kept humping air. OMFG funny moment! And on top of that I applaud the developers for being open minded.\n\n- Rather than following a cookie cutter script like in Lucius 1, this game allows you to kill basically any person in the game in basically any way you can think of. So you can completely clear a level and kill everyone or you can just kill those who are targets. COOL!\n- People have actual ♥♥♥♥♥ and balls! Complete with physics! :O\n- Umm did I mention the killing??...\n\nCONS:\n- Meh graphics.\n- Meh Levels. (not as good as the first game IMO)\n- The story ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS! At least in the first game they made a bit of an effort to make it feel like you really were playing the villain in a horror movie. And the cop investigating you was pretty decent too! Except I think he must've had a learning disability of sorts... But in Lucius II that cop sucks satan's ♥♥♥♥ (literally) in like the first 2 minutes of the poorly made cutscene and just joins Lucius' side on a ♥♥♥♥ing whim thus leaving you with no real opposition. Stupid idea on the dev's part in my opinion. PLUS the entire game feels like a ♥♥♥♥ing satire of itself! It's like the developers didn't even take it seriously so they figured ♥♥♥♥ it we'll just make it into a comedy. The first game was somewhat satirical as well but it also had some great horror elements. In a way this game just feels like a poorly executed joke with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of blood and gore.\n- Buggy and awkward as hell at times!\n- Sometimes it's way too hard to kill people creatively so you'll fall back on the ol tried and true methods such as; Un-necessary defibrilation and poisoned donuts.\n- The first game felt a bit more solid and well made, this one feels like they subbed the contract out to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nameless korean sweatshop game-making company.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThere is a lot about this game that sucks but honestly it's just not enough to make me not want to play it or reccommend it. Lucius 1 & 2 are truly unique and thus have a bit of a monopoly on the "antichrist simulator" market at the moment seeing as there really arent any other games like it. I'd really like to see the devs make a Lucius 3, but maybe actually take it a bit more seriously this time guys? It's not like it'd really be so morally reprehensible to make a game like this that doesn't play out like a ♥♥♥♥ing comedy. Sometimes It feels like developers are scared to make games like this that are serious and brutal because they'll be classified as monsters or some ♥♥♥♥... But in a world where people let their 10 year old children play GTA and Valve allows games like "Hatred" to sell on the steam store I'm pretty sure people can handle a ♥♥♥♥ing serious horror villain-protagonist type of game... All in all I'd reccomend Lucius 2 if you're a sick ♥♥♥♥ and it's on sale for at least 50% off.","February 17, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

This seems to be trying to take the whole thing into a more sandboxey way which might have been really fun if the game actually worked as it should. The UI is terrible and the performance is awful but that is the least of this games problems.\n\nThere are bugs everywhere. Characters going through walls, getting stuck in doorways and etc etc. I lost all interest in the game when the guy who had the key i needed got stuck inside a toilet and somehow managed to block the door. It feels unfinished and i can't recommend it.\n\nThe actual content in the game could have been fun. The story is chessy but it could have been enjoyable. I am not convinced of the new sandbox style gameplay. The AI behaves oddly and there have not been many interesting ways to manipulate the environment so far. Perhaps there will be more interesting ones later on but so far it has mostly been poisoned food, water/electricity and some fire stuff.","October 18, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Apart from being less linear and providing more variety and tools for dispatching victims, Lucius II is everything a sequel shouldn't be. Filled to the brim with bugs and glitches that constantly drag down gameplay, the AI is beyond a joke and incredibly easy to exploit, the only challenge comes from the infuriating, broken mechanics. The arid story takes you through a range of mundane and characterless locations, it also features the most nonthreatening devil in video game history.\n\nSlaughtering the developers with a nail gun was quite cathartic, and very telling, this feels like a product of self-loathing.\n\n3/10","March 18","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked Lucius 1, but it was hamstrung by total lack of freedom in executing kills.  Everything had to be done in one specific way in a specific order.  Changing that to more freedom and open world was the right idea.  But the engine can't handle it.  The physics is broken.  The AI is broken.  It just doesn't work in Lucius 2.","June 5","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
