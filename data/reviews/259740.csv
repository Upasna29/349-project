The first game in the Nightmares from the Deep series does not disappoint and proves to be another fine release from Artifex Mundi. However, the game does show its "age" a little bit: it was actually already released early in 2012, and this shows – it's not as meticuously polished as Artifex Mundi's more recent releases.\n\nDon't take me wrong: I enjoyed playing this game, but I didn't felt "drawn in" as much as by other games from Artifex Mundi. This was mainly due to the voice-acting of the different characters, which proved something of a disappointment. This is a pity, since the story itself is more than interesting and offers  a nice twist on the well-known "Pirates of the Caribbean" theme, although the ending could hardly be more cliché.\n\nSomehow the different elements of the game – point-and-click, hidden object scenes, puzzles and cutscenes – didn't add up for me to something really engrossing. Most of the separate elements are perfectly fine, with the hidden object scenes standing out as beautifully drawn as ever. The puzzles range from very easy to moderately difficult, and add some variety to the gameplay. I was especially pleased to find the option to choose for a game of Mohjang instead of the different hidden object scenes., with the Mohjang games gradually increasing in "difficulty". The music in this kind of games often strikes me as bland, but that's just a matter of personal taste I guess.\n\nAs is well-known among collectors of achievements, games by Artifex Mundi offer excellent possibilities to achieve perfect games without too much difficulty. As usual, two playthroughs are needed for this, but both need to be on the same profile in order to let all the achievements unlock. Something to keep in mind, as I made the mistake of starting the second one on a new profile, and playing through it for a third time would be stretching it way too far ;-).\n\nOverall conclusion: recommended, mainly to fans of the Hidden Object Genre","August 15, 2015","true","9.6"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","35","37","0","2"

It went beyond the usual throw-in story of most hidden object adventures.\nThe plot was decent and you were reminded pretty constantly of what was going on by contextual clues.\nThe location of the next hidden-object puzzle is usually hidden in the most-current location (a picture, etc) otherwise you can just spam the hint button and it will get  you to the right area.\nHigh resolution puzzles made it easy to pick out the items that were required and lots of hidden object puzzles were present in the game (with only a couple of exceptions)\n\nLows:\nThe doubling back to the "guardian" to unlock the chest that takes like 20 doubloons to open was kind of annoying.  It isn't required throughout the game, but that's not made apparent while you're playing.\nA couple of the puzzles had sections that were a bit hazy and fuzzy on large monitors.\n\nAll in all, this was a good game.  I enjoyed the story.  Not so much the fact that you were a talking character (and female at that) which disconnected me from the main character a bit.  But, still it's a game and it was a good one even if some of the sequences were pretty obvious.","May 25, 2015","true","4.1"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","45","57","3","1"

I've been meaning to play this game for ages now. Finally being able to find the time, I'm rushing here to give you my full review. Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart is one of Artifex Mundi's earlier games, thus it is quite possible to encounter amateur mistakes or some clumsy animations now and then. Yet, the charm attached to the developer’s name doesn't fail to entertain us anyway.\n\nHere we have Sarah Black, the curator of the Caribbean Museum and the mother of one cheery teenage girl, preparing the exhibition of a life time. The mummified corpse of Henry Remington, most notorious pirate of the Caribbean Sea back in 1800s is finally discovered and retrieved from his resting place: "Davy Jones' Locker" a.k.a the bottom of the sea. The corpse is delivered to the museum for the exhibition, and Sarah prepares him to be displayed. Just as we were thinking that he seems kinda handsome for a corpse that's been lying at the bottom of the sea for some centuries, he comes back to life, kidnaps our daughter, summons his ghost ship and sets sail to Skull Island... Oh, where did I see that before?\n\nOkay, okay, I'll say it. I have no idea about the rest of the series yet, but this first game is basically a retelling of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest without Captain Jack Sparrow to lighten up the mood. But as the first instalment of the Nightmares from the Deep series - and possibly the most clumsily done - The Cursed Heart still finds means to keep you interested, with a detailed story of its own, weaved out of countless nautical folktales. Hey, I'm glad that we have a name for the protagonist at least, contrary to "Madame Detective" of Left in the Dark.\n\nArtwork is most brilliant with its eerie depictions, nautical themes and an expected amount of undead roaming around. At this point, no one expects Artifex Mundi to present bad artwork, even with its older titles. What I do wonder though, is that how they've managed to make cinematics in lower quality than actual game artwork. Cinematics are blurry and less presentable compared to actual in-game artworks. Same goes for the voice acting: voice acting itself is beyond par, but the lip synch is non-existent: people do move their mouths rhythmically, that's all. I think this is forgivable considering that this is an older title though.\n\nHere comes the gameplay: we have quite enjoyable and clear HOG scenes, some FROG scenes, a good amount of enjoyable puzzles and alternative Mahjong games if you are bored of object hunting. It takes at least 2 playthroughs to complete all achievements - one for HOGs, one for Mahjong games. The map is not interactive, but you get used to the environment quickly, and there is little backtracking aside going back to the ship to place a Dubloon on a chest and listen to an undead dwarf tell a story now and then. What's that about? You gotta play the game to learn!\n\nNightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart is probably not Artifex Mundi's best game, but it is a promising title and the start of a possibly enjoyable journey on a series. If you'd manage to grab it on sale, you'd enjoy it thoroughly when you'd be in the mood for a pleasant little HOG.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 22, 2015","true","8.6"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","31","37","2","4"

This will start a hidden object scene search, upon completion you will be awarded an item, although some items are found without hidden object searches as well (general environment finds).\n\nSome of these items are used in puzzles, some of them are keys, and the rest are your traditional use on environment items that adventure fans are familiar with.  None of the puzzles are challenging, and all are logical.  The only exception to this rule is the "Urns" puzzle - the final one in the game.  Thankfully you can hit a button and skip any puzzle if you want, but this version of the game also has a strategy guide which you can access from the menu (probably not during a game though, but I never tested this).\n\nThis version of the game does come with some digital "extras", most notably 8 beautiful (up to 1080p) wallpapers which are taken from the memorable scenes in the game.  In fact you can see three of these in the screenshots on the Steam Store page.  Naturally you get to play back any video you have already seen, and there is also some concept art (but not much, six images to be precise).\n\nOh, there's also a mahjong game if you want to play that instead of finding hidden objects, but I never tried that feature.\n\nFor the price I feel like the game is too short, versus something like Monkey Island II - another zombie themed pirate adventure, and probably the best adventure game of all time.  However, it's worth playing if you like pirates and the sounds of thunder and lightning and want to have the beautiful wallpaper art on your desktop (I do).","February 8, 2014","true","3.4"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Having played three, I now consider myself an expert on them. Definitely. Anyway, this is a good one. Just don't judge it on the quality of its story and voice acting, both of which are subpar at best. It seems to be a genre convention actually, so I can go with the flow. No, these games depend more on the quality of their artwork, the level of interactivity in scenes, the quality of the puzzles (if any), and how well things sparkle and zing when you click on them. No really, when you find that hairbrush hidden carefully in the background of a scene, you want some fireworks when you click on it. It's satisfying, I admit it. I get the impression, reading around, that this developer is considered a good one when it comes to HOGs. I wouldn't know, but on the strength of this it's well-deserved. The game's quite long; it took me a little over 6 hours to complete the game (including the two bonus chapters as this is the CE) which is about twice as long as some HOG games. Like most of these games, the difficulty level was towards the easier end of the spectrum, but frankly that works just fine inbetween bouts of Spelunky and Jets 'n' Guns. It's relaxing, and strangely compelling. Interestingly, each hidden object scene also offers a mahjong game. You can either do one or the other, and the more of the HOG you complete, the easier the mahjong game becomes (and vice versa). It's a good way of trying a different approach if you're stuck trying to find a particular object. That didn't happen very often with me, but I appreciated the option. There's no time limit on completing each scene, but if you do them quickly you can gather a few Steam achievements. The achievements were a little bugged though, not all of them registered, if that kind of thing is important to you. Puzzles? Yes, plenty of those, most of them very easy, but they're a nice change of pace. The game surrounding the hidden object scenes plays out like a point and click adventure, with an inventory and objects that must be found and used in the appropriate places, so there's plenty of variety to keep you going. There's even a map!\n\nSo overall then, the best HOG-like I've ever played (out of the three I've played over the last month). GOTY in the HOG category so far, in fact! But seriously, if you like this kind of thing you can't really go wrong. The artwork is excellent, the music and presentation are great, the storyline and acting are like fingernails on a blackboard, you'll love it.","February 11, 2014","true","7.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

There are storytelling sections including vivid 3d visuals combined with some of the best voice acting for pirates in a pirate game even better than Assassins Creed Black Flag.  This story has it all from Mystery, to Action, to even Romance!  It does all these things, and does them all really well.\n\nDifficulty for players would be a bit above normal.    No worries if stuck, there i a fully illustrated strategy guide, a puzzle skip option, and a hint button for puzzles so anyone will be able to finish the game.  The map is structured well with clues leading to more clues not just random running around to check every part of the game.  The ability to play the game and have it progress as you move makes it one of the few Hidden Object games that can be used for speed runs.\n\nCompletionist Advice:\nThe game has many achievement bugs, best way to avoid these seems to play the first game through on expert doing all of the hidden Object Puzzles using no hints and skipping no puzzles.  Collect all the coins, do not put them in one by one, and when you have 12 coins put them all in.  Second playthrough on normal do Mahjong instead of HIdden Object puzzles to clean up the rest.

Though I wouldn't say I expect much from games of the genre, The Cursed Heart was an unexpected low for a developer that I know to be better than what they showcased here. It's shallow, abysmally voiced, and weighs down an otherwise mostly enjoyable game. It's hovers right between ignorable and so-bad-it's-good, but winds up more obnoxiously persistent than anything else.\n\nA slightly awkward world to navigate combined with the often unclear objectives were also a bit annoying, in the sense that I had to continually check my map for where to go as opposed to a more natural form of progression. Despite these issues I would still consider The Cursed Heart worth checking out if you've exhausted the rest of the developer's catalog. Its high production values and addicting game design (the reason for which I'm still trying to figure out) are as exceptional as ever, it's mainly the developer's pedigree which brings the experience down, having demonstrated a better knack than most for the genre and in doing so set a higher standard which they as are also going to be judged against.","November 5, 2014","true","5.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Unwittingly Sarah triggers 'ancient' magic and revives the cursed Captain.  Captain Remington upon his revival steals Sarah's daughter, Cory.  Of course, Sarah follows and stows away on Captain Remington's summoned "ghost" ship as it sets sail for Captain Remington's island.  As Captain Remington's story unfolds the player discovers his personal history, his cursed 'life' and why he stole Sarah's daughter.  Sarah with the help of a surprising ally convinces Captain Remington that what he wants to do will only cause more tradegy.\n\nGameplay is basically set up to occur in three distinct arenas, the museum, Remington's ship, and Remington's island.  The tragic tale of Captain Remington is revealed through the various characters (mostly his undead crew, who were cursed when he was, assuming the player talks to them).  Rather reminscent of the 'Pirates of Caribbean' first movie and the tale of 'The Flying Dutchman'.   Captain Remington's entire tale is told by the Guardian of Remington's chest, which contains the collateral of Remington's Davy Jone's bargain, whenever coins are found and given to the Guardian.  Very keeping with the Davy Jones motif and legends.\n\nThe puzzles are classic, nothing hard or head scratching.  The game even includes a 'treasure hunt'.  (When I saw the 'treasure' map, it reminded me of 'Treasure Island'.)  There are enough hidden object scenes to keep this a Hidden Object game.  The puzzles and hidden objects scenes are intergrated well enough into the storyline that they do not stand out, which in my opinion is a very good thing.  However, since the gameplay arenas are limited to three areas there is a lot of back and forth movement within the area until everything is completed.  Some may find this annoying but the amount of things needed to be done and accomplished within the area keeps the gameplay moving.\n\nBeing the first Artifex Mundi game I have ever played I found I enjoyed the well written storyline as well as the overall gameplay.  This game would and did bring me back to buy more, not only of this series, but other games by them, as well.","August 28, 2015","true","12.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

The story wasn't that interesting but it was a decent backdrop to the fun puzzles. It was also a bit odd how they told basically the whole story in the first quarter of the game but then every time you collected a dubloon you'd get pieces of the story. I kept waiting for the dubloon cut scenes to tell me something I didn't already know but they didn't. Not saying it was a bad way to tell it, just kind of unnecessary? Oh well.\n\nThe puzzles were fun. I liked how interactive they were. A lot of the times you didn't just assemble the items and click them on to the screen but you actually had to follow instructions and pick up a tool to manipulate different things, etc. I really thought that made the game so much better than other ones I've played. I didn't get stuck or get frustrated with any of the puzzles. They were mostly pretty easy (in fact, the only time I used the hint the whole game was when I kept over looking a small item lying on the ground which I needed to pick up to progress >.<).\n\nThe hidden object puzzles were pretty good. Sometimes they were a bit weird on how they labeled things (like one where there's something that looks like a ribbon rolled up but they called it a "spring"). They also have items that need extra actions to find or complete which makes the HOPs more fun. These actions usually made sense to do so I never encountered any frustration with them like I have with other games.\n\nVoice acting was okay. Nothing great but nothing horrendous either. Cut scenes were cool but low resolution.\nOverall, I enjoyed it very much. The bonus adventure available through the "Extras" on the main menu is worth playing after too.","May 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The game features an inventory where you can store items to combine with the environment to go deeper in the story.\n\nThe game have two difficulties and have a guest feature : all the family can play the game and resume it where they left.\n\nThere is also a map which is useful to not get lost despite you can't fast travel with it but can show some hints if you play in the easy mode. Also you can use the Hint/Skip hourglass whenever you want and wait until its refill to use it again. But be warned that you may not skip or use a hint in any puzzle or hidden objects scene if you wish to have some achievements.\n\nThere is a some choice of puzzles and there are two kind of Hidden objects scenes. The first Hidden objects scene features the name of the objects to find some are found easily (normal one) and some others need you to interact with the enviroment or to combine two items to found them. The second Hidden objects scene let you find the pictue of the items to find.\n\n(#):\nFrom the beginning to the end I've a very bad issue : all the cutscenes were full of pixels and I've seen one or more discussion on steam despite I didn't read them all. I tried to switch to the lowest resolution, I did made some few changes even if the cutscenes are still worse.\n\n(*) :\nThe game has some achievements that can be missed  mostly challenging achievements including finishing the game on hardmode or using no hints in the puzzles or hidden objects scenes. There is currently a good guide for that (Chapter 0 - Achievement / Arquivamentos):\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=548288815\n\nThe challenging achievements require you to finish a puzzle or an hidden objects scene or a domino game under a minute. And two achievements require you to find 3 objects in 3 seconds or find all objects with a few misclicks in the hidden object scenes.\n\n(@):\nAs I said in the key features, you need two playthrough to finish the game. One to finish the game with all the puzzles and hidden objects scenes perfected and another one playing the mahjong game instead of the hidden objects scenes. The good thing is you can skip all the cutscenes and puzzles in your second playthrough if you succeeded your first one. The mahjong game consist in taking all of the mahjong tiles, to do so you need to make couples. BUT there is one main trap to not fall in... you need to play a new game in the same user !

After receiving the corpse of the famous Henry Remington, don't ask how but you awakened him. Taking your daughter as hostage, you sneak into his ghost ship and find yourself in a race against the clock to save your child.\n\nThe story is beautiful as you're also diving into the pirate's past and love story. Besides, Remington is cursed because of a pact with Davy Jones, only you can undo it. And Davy Jones is important for the trilogy anyway.\n\nThe gameplay mixes point-&-click, puzzles and hidden objects scenes. It's well balanced: all the puzzles aren't too hard but are not too easy (though one or two of them could be seen as harder to understand). I didn't find anything wrong or buggy.\n\nThe graphics are correct but beautiful too as between the boat and the island, you have also that surnatural aura surronding you.

The game nods continuously towards "Pirates of the Caribbean" and similar "Cursed pirate stories", which could be a plus or a minus depending on your personal preferences. It does boast rather nice background art and multiple "exotic" objects to manipulate from "all around the world". There is also a variety of ages where objects come from - modern, XVII-XVIII century and end of XIX century (if you care to go for a "bonus" adventure available under "Extras"). Some of the foreground objects look a bit cheap, though, and cutscene video quality is really way too low. While being very accessible overall (as a casual game should be) "Nightmares" does not explain everything (like "Skip by playing Mahjong" option or how to start hidden object minigames) very well in the beginning. However, there are no giant mechanical flaws in it, and the ones existing do not detract too much from the experience. Although the voice acting and overall sound assets are so-so, they do help to complete the "pirate mystery" atmoshpere. The storyline is super-simple and although it tries to add a couple of twists, overall there is nothing grasping about it. There is a little humor to be had and there are even a couple of jokes that might make you smile, but overall the game tends to overplay "serious mystery" part a little bit too much for my taste. A couple of cheap jumpscares are also available.  Having completed all of the available adventures I can say that the game does provide some casual fun for those, who appreciate the appropriate setting and do not mind to solve some simple puzzles (with ample hints available). Overall it is a good title to buy in a bundle and casually enjoy when you don't want to strain yourself or spend much time with a game. Perhaps, it could also be worth a try for HOG fans when on >75% discounts.","February 20, 2014","true","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is short and the story isn't much of one if anything, but the puzzles can be fun for the 30 seconds they last and getting around is quick and easy\n\nAs most other reviews say, the sound quality is bad and i found it annoying that the lips didn't sync with the voice audio. On another note, trying to play this at 1080p in fullscreen caused the image to noticeably resize itself each scene. Not sure whether that was my own fault or not, but there are only a handful of options in the game and resolution done automatically through the game. I ended up just playing in window mode to avoid this especially since i knew the game was short. The only other thing i can think to say is that my mouse had lag issues during the game which required me to adjust my DPI on the mouse software itself as there is no mouse sensitivty setting in game.\n\nI cant judge the game too harshly because i haven't played any other of the genre. i would say that if it weren't pirate themed i wouldn't have an interest in it. If you are interested wait for a sale. I wouldn't purchase this game or any of the sequels at full price.","March 23, 2015","false","7.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The narration and the voice acting are clunky, and the daughter character has the annoying damsel in distress syndrome, but the plot and some of the dialogues really make up for these shortcomings.\n\nThe puzzles, including the hidden object scenes, are somewhat on the easy side, but they offer a nice variety to keep the game constantly interesting and fun to play.

Most notably, often they present you a messy Scene of Hidden Objects, in which you have to find a list of many items, after which you are awarded with one single object. If you don't like the Hidden Objects minigame, you can replace it for a match of Mahjong without any side effect. Other than the Hidden Objects minigames, the objects are never really "hidden", which is great.\n\nContrary to some other games of the genre (*cough cough* BoUT *cough cough*) the puzzles here make a lot of sense. You will never find yourself thinking "I'd never expect to use bettles for this!". Still in this comparison, NotD will not present you with jokes and puns befitting a primary school kid (which is definitely a plus if you're not one). The developers from NotD do not seem to despise any specific other genre of games either, or if they do, they do not sign their game with that. Respect is definitely a plus, unconditionally.\n\nAbout the bad, the graphics suck at some points specially the talking animations, and the voice acting is dull, which is weird since some of the CG scenes are pretty decent. The game is not FullHD, fullscreen just stretches it. The story is very cliché too. The game is quite short as well.\n\nIf you like puzzles get this game. You're going to have some fun, though not much of a challenge. If you want graphics and fireworks, you'll potentially get disappointed.","August 22, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

With that said, I found a few exceptionally good things, and found a few things to be less enthused about. Firstly, the good: the game is beautifully illustrated, it has fantastic subject matter and setting, and it is satisfactorily full in length of gameplay. The voice acting and writing / dialogue are decent. The weaknesses are mostly that it eventually becomes slightly tedious, as clues later in the game require less intuition and more room-bypass-clicking legwork; in this regard there is a sense of the length of gameplay being somewhat inflated by unnecessary backtracking and uninspired search-errands. The puzzles are not particularly inspired either, however, some of the hidden object scenes are fairly challenging, and there were word usages and terms I was unfamiliar with (e.g. cockade) that upped the challenge bar. It is a very well-polished game, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I cannot help get the feeling that it somehow underachieves.

I've always liked Hidden Object games as a relaxing kind of guilty pleasure: mind on stun, if you will, and just play with the pretty pictures.  This one is a successful meld of adventure and puzzling.  The story is clear and present, driving the action to the puzzles in a satisfying way.  I enjoyed the voicing and the art, although - as is always the case - a couple of the objects were real "wha" moments, as in "wha zat?" (so it's a good thing the "sonar" shows outlines).  The tasks were generally clear, the solutions were fun and not ludicrous or mood-breaking, and overall this was a fun way to spend a few hours.  I even went back to get all of the missing achievements.","August 27, 2014","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The videos are a bit fuzzy at times and the voice acting sometimes spotty which is a shame cause otherwise this is a good game.\n\nThe puzzles are not difficult to figure out and the hidden object/mahjong sequences are rather good. You will most likely never get stuck on a puzzle for a long period of time. The game even has 2 playing modes: Adventure and Expert. On Adventure mode the game will show you on the map the next location you need to go to and will sparkle around objects you need to interact with whereas on Expert these helpers will not be activated,\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hidden object games/mahjong with a bit of adventure and good story thrown in the mix.","February 23, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With that said, I found a few exceptionally good things, and found a few things to be less enthused about. Firstly, the good: the game is beautifully illustrated, it has fantastic subject matter and setting, and it is satisfactorily full in length of gameplay. The voice acting and writing / dialogue are decent. The weaknesses are mostly that it eventually becomes slightly tedious, as clues later in the game require less intuition and more room-bypass-clicking legwork; in this regard there is a sense of the length of gameplay being somewhat inflated by unnecessary backtracking and uninspired search-errands. The puzzles are not particularly inspired either, however, some of the hidden object scenes are fairly challenging, and there were word usages and terms I was unfamiliar with (e.g. cockade) that upped the challenge bar. It is a very well-polished game, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I cannot help get the feeling that it somehow underachieves.

And a good one at that. It's not the deepest game you'll ever play (no pun intended), but it entertained me enough to play it through to its satisfying conclusion.\n\nGameplay consists of traversing (pretty much) static screens of a museum, a pirate ship and a mysterious island, gathering items and solving decently fun puzzles. Items are generally gained by playing a mini-game, which is either the traditional hidden object one OR a game of Mahjong. The critical detail here is that you can choose which one to play whenever you want!\nI went through the game only solving the Mahjong puzzles and had a great time.\n\nThe game is a great introduction to the genre and a solid example of how to do a casual adventure game right.\nSteer clear of it if you're looking for a particularly serious or challenging experience though.","July 9, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You receive the dead body of  Captain Remington, who was - back then in his days - a feared and cruel pirate. In fact, you are the one who brings him back to life and Remington flees with your daughter to Skull Island. Obviously, it is your task to rescue your duaghter and break the curse that keeps the old Captain alive. One should not expect a deep and emotionally moving story behind such a game and so didn't I, to be honest. That's simply because such games are ment to be played casually: easy to learn, even easier to master! In comparison to other games of this genre this game made a quite good attempt and at least tries to build up tension and most of the time keeps you a little curious, indeed. Of course, this isn't comparable to extraordinary RPGs, for example, but within its own genre this game knows how to sell its plot well (therefore my STORY-rating is pushed from a 2 to a 3).\nThe difficulty was mainly rated with the highest difficulty-level in mind. There are two modes you can choose from: "regular mode" that shows on your maps all places where actions are available and gives you a shorter charge time for hints, and "expert mode" that doesn't give you hints at all and lets your hint-bar fill up more slowly. If you play this game for the first time, expert mode can be really hard, indeed, because you have to spent more attention on clickable items and have to backtrack a lot to find spawning hidden-object-scenes, but there is one big downside: the game offers a complete "strategy guide" ... I would rather call it a "click-through", to be honest. It's an entire list of all objectives, you have to fulfill, including all clickable items with a beautiful photo gallery. This is ... *clearing throat* ... ment to be nice, really, but this game is simple enough and offering a complete walk-through is destroying the last bit of a challenge completely ^^" Without this "feature" my rating would probably have been a 3 of 5 due to the expert mode, but in this case I decided to reduce it to a 1 out of 5 because even the "clever puzzles" (as stated in the game description) weren't clever enough in my opinion but rather easy-peasy.\nThe gameplay is solid and the voice acting is ok. This game is actually just a simplified Point&Click-Adventure (because the game chooses the appropiate interaction-method with objects automatically, e.g. "talking" while hovering about persons, magnifying things that can be inspected, and collected objects from your inventory aren't combinable, at all) with hidden-object-/mahjong-elements and - let's be honest - it's hard to screw something up that's as simple as clicking ; ) Autosaving works perfectly fine and I didn't bump into bugs or crashes of any kind. However, there doesn't seem to be a way of starting a new game as long as your current campaign isn't finished, despite of creating a whole new player-profile; not the end of the world, but mildly annoying. Due to some restrictions I had to play this game three times to earn all achievements. Mini-games can be played in two different modes: One is the common hidden-object scene and the other one let's you solve the object finding by playing mahjong. To earn the achievements "Self-guided Tour" and "Mahjong Master And Commander" you have to solve all 28 mini-games in a playthrough either only as hidden-object-puzzles or only mahjong-challenges, and during my first run I tried out both mechanics and wasn't able to complete these puzzles a second time in the other mode. I'm not sure if this was intended. If it was, then I've got to criticize that this design-decision artificially lengthens the game time for those who want to get a Perfect Game.\nThe graphics are generally good and offer a decent resolution, the only thing that disappointed me, was that the game description claims to have "AAA-quality cinematics" that it clearly doesn't have! The cinematics didn't scale with the resolution and because I play with a FullHD-monitor, probably as most players these days, I had to watch horribly pixelated cutscenes. Either the devs didn't test the quality on a common monitor or they simply lied ... no matter what applies, it's awefully negative, in my opinion.\nI decided to decrease the rating for the game's replayability, although I personally played it three times. The reason simply is, that on one hand I only would have needed two playthroughs - maximum -, if I had paid a little bit more attention. And on the other hand I want to evaluate games as objectively as I can, which means, that I have to be aware of people that don't care for achievements like  I do. These people would probably not consider to replay this game, because it doesn't offer new challenges, alternative endings or anything else that makes this game worth playing again.\n\n~Conclusion~\n"Nightmares From The Deep" is a decent game. Those of you who like hidden-object-games will probably have some nice hours to spend with this. I personally don't think that it offers any original ideas or breakthroughs in this genre and didn't create tension or fun above the ordinary, but on the other hand I don't see any severe reason to prevent you from buying this game, if that is the kinda game you like and enjoy, because despite the misinformation about the "AAA-cinematics" it offers a solid quality and I consider it as one of the better hidden-object-games on the market.","April 28, 2014","true","10.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Artifex Mundi makes pretty solid games overall, nothing special but not bad either.\n\nThe most notable thing I enjoyed about this one was the sonar that aids you minorly in hidden object scenes, I found it helpful without ruining the puzzles or anything. I also prefer Mahjong over dominoes as the alternate game. The game map could serve to be a bit better though, about 70% of the screens are one long line with a few rooms/paths branching off, and it can be a pain to navigate, especially near endgame.\n\nThe story takes elements from Pirates of the Carribean, rather heavily, up to having a heart in a chest keeping an otherwise immortal pirate king alive. I get the impression that Artifex Mundi just takes ideas from other places and uses them as their story, but whatever the story is not very important here anyways.\n\nOverall, a solid game, maybe not worth the full price but certainly worth checking out on sale.","November 12, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was my first Hidden Object Game, didn't even knew this sort of games existed. :)\nYou play a female museum curator whose daughter is kidnapped by an undead pirate. Quickly you find yourself in hot pursuit to set her free. The game is the first part of a trilogy.\nWhile I didn't have high hopes for this game, I quickly found myself hooked on progressing through the game. The main game is a point & click adventure, but combined with 3 types of sub-games. First there are puzzles, which are usually not too difficult to solve. Second there are the hidden object games, where you need to find a list of objects in a single scene. And third, mahjong. Mahjong? Rather strange, as Caribbean piracy was already stopped by the time this Chinese tile game was created...\nI found the game addictive as you quickly pass puzzle by puzzle and the story line opens up. Not a must-play game, but quite entertaining.\n\nScore: 7/10\n\nPro:\n+ nice graphics\n+ steady game progress\n+ decent story\n+ additional bonus story\n\nContra:\n- maybe a bit too short?","October 3, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Artifex Mundi makes pretty solid games overall, nothing special but not bad either.\n\nThe most notable thing I enjoyed about this one was the sonar that aids you minorly in hidden object scenes, I found it helpful without ruining the puzzles or anything. I also prefer Mahjong over dominoes as the alternate game. The game map could serve to be a bit better though, about 70% of the screens are one long line with a few rooms/paths branching off, and it can be a pain to navigate, especially near endgame.\n\nThe story takes elements from Pirates of the Carribean, rather heavily, up to having a heart in a chest keeping an otherwise immortal pirate king alive. I get the impression that Artifex Mundi just takes ideas from other places and uses them as their story, but whatever the story is not very important here anyways.\n\nOverall, a solid game, maybe not worth the full price but certainly worth checking out on sale.","November 12, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Entertaining story, decent animation, and interesting environments. The game mixes point-and-click adventure with hidden object as well as a few mini-games sprinkled in. The puzzles are clever but not overly challenging. I never needed to use the "Hint" button.\n\nAdding to the list of positive things are steam achievements, trading cards, a nice music score and zombie pirates.\n\nIf I have any negative marks against the game, it is a little on the short side. There is a bonus adventure that allows you to continue where the main game ended, but it too is short. I also wish the protagonist's daughter had a name. I don't feel as invested when I think of "HOLD ON! I'LL SAVE YOU.....WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS!". Maybe I'm supposed to be a crappy parent who can't remember my kids name.\n\nOverall, it's enjoyable and if you feel the price is too high, wait for a Steam sale.","July 25, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/recommended/259740/","dunetiger","Dune Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/","2220 products in account","This game is strangely compelling for a casual adventure game that focuses heavily on hidden object puzzles.  The difficulty\nisn't really there - you'll breeze past this game, even on expert mode (and really, you need to play this on expert mode for this to be even remotely challenging).\n\nThat being said, despite most of my time being put into roguelikes or twitchfests these days, I found this to be a great way to spend an afternoon as I downed tremendous amounts of coffee (typically how I like to spend Sundays).  Like I said, the difficulty is hardly anything to shake a stick at, but the game is pretty good at providing feedback loop to the player to always make it feel like you're making progress.  The story is somewhat of a joke, but I can safely say that the 12-year-old me would have probably loved this game to death.  The guy over twice his age... you know what? I liked it for what it was.\n\nOne caveat, however, is if you're going to 100% the game (which I did, so that's saying something, right?) you might not enjoy a second trip around as you'll need to play the game twice to get every cheevo.  Normally I don't do this, but it was too easy to pass up.  So why is playing it twice so bad?\n\nThe game offers an alternative most of its hidden object puzzles (there are secondary HOGs to play that make absolutely no effort to hide anything; they are thematic bits to vary up the found-something-in-the-pile method of providing the player items) in the form of "Mahjong".  First off, I hate that anyone calls the matching game of mahjong tiles "Mahjong".  It's Shanghai, and Shanghai sucks!  If the game had real mahjong, I'd probably enjoy it a lot more (and no way that's going to happen).  However, if HOGs aren't your thing, but you would prefer to match tiles to pass puzzles, you're welcome to do that.  And you can't possibly fail, either as getting to a stalemate simply reshuffles the stack... which will affect your achievement hunt.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\n- Great time waster with some interesting if not terribly difficult puzzles\n- "Mahjong" tile matching will shrivel your sack and must be suffered if you want to 100% the game\n- Recommended, but you might want to hunt for it in a bundle. It is not worth the price of admission, even with the extra scenario packed in for "collectors"\n- Alternatively, get it elsewhere (cheevos are also in-game and just as useful off of Steam as they are on it) for much less.","April 28, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this "makeup" is, like all powder, rouge and gloss, only a superficial incentive to buy the game.\n\nThe background-story is a rescue-adventure, with some drama and romantics, so if you took the hint of powder and rouge and gloss, yeah it's a game aimed more for a female audience. But it doesn't break your crown to play it if you don't fit into this type of audience... The artwork is fine, gameplay is very organic and it has a easy playability. Experts may race through this game in a couple of hours - if you want to get all achievements you might to have take your time.\n\nThose type of games are games without consequences (at least quite often if you do it all right), there will be only one Ending ... a happy end. Sighs I am a grimm type of person, so I often like to mess up all the glamour, the beauty and the pretenses... so, yeah, no luck for me today. Games that have a hundred or more ways to mess up things, or to send the protagonists of a story into impeeding doom... yeah, that is where I do excell. And probably you also will miss the shocking effects of the protagonist falling into the deep abyss, chained to a cannon. Well, never mind. The game is still fun to play, and very much so. It is type of eye candy that makes your eyes get stuck onto the screen, till you have squeezed even the last drop of dour enjoyment out of this game.\n\n7,99 Euros is a little bit too high as price for this game though, but still - if you like these genre, buy a copy of it and enjoy it in a dark, unlit room...

Three, if I recall. So, due to that fact, I can't really rely on past experience in order to review a game of this genre. But still, I can identify one that is of higher quality, and that title is Nightmares of the Deep: The Cursed Heart. I've also come to know that Artifex Mundi's games (most of them) are actually pretty good, overall. And that's exactly what I can say for the first entry in Nightmares of the Deep (NotD). It is a pretty good HOG.\n\nOriginality reigns in this title. And I love it. You'll find numerous puzzles, and all of them are different in such a way that it amuses me. Just like in all HOG's, you complete these puzzles in order to receive an item, unlock an object, etc etc. Completing this certain task will lead you to another, and another, and another, until you reach a critical point in the game and achieve some objective you were trying to accomplish. Same with HOG scenes. There is, however, a twist in this part of NotD. You can skip the entire section that consists in finding, or assembling hidden objects, and replace it with a mahjong game. I've found this feature entertaining and distinguishes this HOG from others out there.\n\nGraphics wise, the scenarios are pleasant to look at. A negative aspect might be considered as the cutscenes, which are of lower resolution. Same with character animations, and the horrible lip sync, that are clunky and not really believable, which is obviously not the point of an HOG, to look realistic, but I'm sure they could have done a better job in this department.\n\nLooking at the story, it's actually a strong point in NotD. I won't spoil it, of course, but I can say it's pretty interesting. I also enjoyed the fact that some storytelling is told through ghosts scattered around the different scenes. And I must indeed admit, pirates plus HOG equals and awesome combination. The soundtrack is catchy and it looks like we're searching for Jack Sparrow or something related. Achievements add replayability and a "bonus chapter" that could have been totally implemented into the main game is always compelling, I guess.\n\nOverall, I recommend this HOG title, 100%, for the average, hardcore, or beginner HOG gamer, and for the ones who just want to take the genre for a spin.","November 13, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a solid story, solid game play and the voice acting is actually decent. I guess my only issue is that the extra storyline was short, but it was still nice and answered a question that was lingering after the end of the game.\n\nIf you're into this genre of games then you'll probably like this one. It has a fair amount of hidden object scenes mixed with other types of puzzles. There is also a helpful map which clues you in on which area to go to next so you can keep progressing. Though some hidden object scenes get revisted and they're not as challenging the second time around.\n\nStory is rather straight forward and doesn't have that many twists and turns, you can figure it out pretty quickly. But it's still told well and who doesn't like pirates?!\n\nLong story short, buy the game.","October 13, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game has an impressive amount of quality, and a few new twists on gameplay that I was very pleased to see! The story is enjoyable, and any romantic will be very pleased with the plot twists and turns we go through to reach the very satisfying ending.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent and will not disappoint - well-constructed, enjoyable and steadily more complex Hidden Object scenes teamed with enjoyable puzzles and a robust hint system. As with many games in this genre, they make good (if not enough) use of a map to help navigate and figure out where you need to go next. The only bit of gameplay I think they could have improved on was the map itself, as there is no quick travel option.  Which makes sense in-game context, but still means quite a bit of traveling back and forth. Honestly my only quibble with the gameplay.\n\nVisually, it's stunning - the little bit of CG they use is well-done and matched to the artwork rather than trying to be realistic. A choice I applaud and definitely praise them for. The one bit of 'regular' CG is used for a deliberately creepy and eerie set of characters and was still a careful mix of realistic detail blended into the style of the art. The Hidden Object scenes were done in the art style of the game, not quickly patched from photos - the creators going that extra length always wins points with me. Very solid, consistent, and delightful visuals.\n\nWhich just leaves audio, and this is a spot where the game falters just a wee bit - not in the music, but in the (mostly great) voice acting. Towards the end of the game, some lines are just not delivered well, or with odd inflection. Thankfully not by any of the major characters in the ending. The sound effects are minimal but spot on, but the music . . in full honesty it's mostly forgettably pleasant and appropriate for where you're hearing it. Nothing outstanding, but at least nothing that throws you out of the mood set by the game.","January 3, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this piece manage to do that. But let's start from the beginning.\n\nI had mixed feelings about this. I finished Mystery of Montlake Mansion few months earlier, and this game is almost like a clone to the latter. But hell, it's Steam Sale, so whatever.\n\nAt the beginning everything is just like the forementioned title. The graphics is kind of corky, and sometimes you just see, as if the entire game was done in Photoshop, but it's not really annoying. I must say, that I really like this kind of art style. It gives me good vibe, just like in the old pointers (Dracula and so on). It's not the best, but it's manageable. Cutscenes, on the other hand, are ugly and badly rendered. In standard games cutscenes are way better than the actual graphics of the game, right? Here's the opposite.\n\nThe music and sound is mediocre sadly. There's a sound for picking ♥♥♥♥ up, for solving ♥♥♥♥ up and for scaring (yea, right) ♥♥♥♥ outta the players. Music is really forgetable, TBH I don't remember any loop from the game itself. And I'm not sure if this is because it's so bad or there is just none.  Oh well, at least voice acting is good, right? No, it's not. It's really bad. Almost all characters in the game sound unnatural and overacting is really common. Except for maybe two undead pirates. That's kind of sad.\n\nGameplay is just like forementioned Mystery of Montlake. We walk around, collect crap, sometimes solve really easy puzzles or search for stuff in the cluster♥♥♥♥s. Modern pointer people! The olny change from the Mystery is the "ability" to change search scenes into the mahjong, which kind of speeds the game a little bit. Nevertheless, it's not something groundbreaking. On the other hand, the game is from the dead genre. And TBH even thou I kind of knew, what's coming, I couldn't stop playing it. And that's a good thing, because I can be really picky about games.\n\nOverally, the game is mediocre, but with the lean on the good side. It's corky and stupid, but fun to play. And it can be perfected (all achievements) in two playthou's: one with doing all search scenes normally, and the second time doing mahjong. For perfection hoarders or people new to games, I would recommend it. If you have a mother, father or little sibling, who like playing video games, and ultra violent and hard whatever is not their kind of thing, Nightmares is the perfect choice. For skilled player it's for two nights tops, and one should consider if s/he really wants to buy this piece especially when one is not a completionist. For me, I recommend it. Just for the sake of old good point&clicks. Maybe someday something good will pop up on the market.\n\nZawisza out.","July 5, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It turned out to be more of an interactive story intervened with puzzles - something in the vein of Myst. It was a bit awkward at first, but once I got used to it, I must say I quite enjoyed the game. The story might not be very original, but it's coherent and captivating. The puzzles mostly consist of "find hidden object" scenes, but there are also some more demanding ones. Though I wouldn't mind if there were more of those. Overall it's a good game and I can easily recommend it.\n\nThe only major flaw is that you cannot get all achievements in on run, because you can either solve "find hidden object" scenes OR mahjong puzzles, not both at the same time - and there are separate achievements for each of those. So while the game has little if any replay value, you'll be forced to play it twice if you're a completionist.","April 11, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself having to use the sonar feature fairly often because I couldn't distinguish one object from another, although it was never so bad that I had to use a hint.  I honestly preferred playing the mahjong.  The background locations were pretty, though.\n\nThe point-and-click puzzles were mostly logical, although there was a lot of backtracking for what felt like very little payoff.  Also, I really hope you like collecting ingredients for recipes.\n\nThe voice acting and music were decent, and there was even a bit of humor with the pirates on the ship.\n\nI was slightly disappointed with the bonus mission.  While the puzzles were pretty good, the spelling, grammar, and word choices were terrible: "tukan" instead of "toucan," "perl" instead of "pearl," "wires" instead of "yarn with knitting needles"... it just got worse and worse.  I can overlook small mistakes, especially in bonus content, but some of the errors made finishing the hidden object games nearly impossible without resorting to sonar or hints.\n\nOverall, it is a decent little game.  It has its shortcomings, but it was relaxing enough and interesting enough to occupy an afternoon.  It took about 8 hours to beat it twice through on expert mode (once for each set of achievements) including the additional mission, so I feel like I got my sale-price money's worth.\n\nI would give it a 6/10.","August 17, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To sum it up, this is way I liked or disliked about the game.\n\nPros:\n- Great art style, fits the gloomy setting of the game\n- Well made soundtrack, setting an adequate mood.\n- While the synch is not exactly perfect, the voice acting is good.\n\nCons:\n- Hidden Object scenes are entirely random. You search for 20 objects, one of which you are actually looking for, the rest dissapears forever.\n- Item Usage often doesn't make sense. At one point you need a stone to smash a window even though you have an iron wrench in your inventory.\n- The quality of cutscenes is horrible. This may just be an issue I had, so I don't know if it's the same for everyone.\n- Most items that you use are immediatly discarded forever even though you would need them later. Instead you have to search for a similar item all over again.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, I miss the logic aproach that most point and click games should use. If you need a certain item for a situation, you should usually be able to figure out which one on your own. Also, If I have to find a total of 3 scalpels to use in 3 different situations, I'm beginning to question if my character instantly annihalites every item that has served it's purpose once as a personal one-use policy. However, the game can still hold it's own with it's art style and soundtrack, which is easily good enough to create the atmosphere required for the game.","November 25, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.\n\nThat's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.\n\nThey do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.\n\nMy recommendation, because of the "if you've played one you've played them all" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games.","August 12, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is still a beautiful game with a good story which we have gone to expect from them if you've played their games before. The things I didn't like with this game is:\n1. The voice acting. It is of course rarely good in hidden object games, but this was on the borderline to embarrassing at times, and took away a little piece of the mood and feel to the game.\n2. The length. It took me 3,5h to complete this, all puzzles and hidden object scenes, no hints and I even did the bonus chapter. The puzzles weren't very challenging except for the last one in the game, which for me took a little more effort to see the pattern and complete.\nThe only reason I'm might sound negative toward this game is because Artifex Mundi really have delivered before (I started in the middle of their games based on release, which might have been a mistake) But in the end; It's a gorgeous game, with good sound (except voice) and okay puzzles. A little short, but still a stable hidden object game with a good story. 6.5/10","March 20","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nothing particular to this "Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart" game.  It's more of a recurring motif problem.  To wit, their Achievements combined with the inability to either save a game or just plain quit a game and start over.  In this case, I'd made my first run through on Casual and doing the HOGs.  So, I started up another run on Expert and was working on the Mahjong games in place of the HOGs.  About a quarter of the game in, I realized I'd just done a HOG instead of a Majong (i.e., I'd messed up the Achievement).  Without a way to restore a save or just quit and start over, I'd have to finish the entire game knowing I couldn't get the Achievement and restart another run.  No.  Not gonna happen.  So, I'm upset, frustrated, and uninstalling the game.\n\nNow, as to the game itself, it's a little below par for Artifex Mundi.  For some reason, it's a bit hard to see the objects in the HOGs.  Also, there are a lot of cases where you get stuck, only to realized that a HOG has popped up somewhere on the map that you'd otherwise have no reason to re-visit.  If a HOG re-activates like that, there should be a quest type of task that would take you back to the area to see the now-active HOG.  And, finally, the voice work (heck, even the role) of the protagonist's daughter is really annoying.\n\nOther than that, it's pretty much a standard Artifiex Mundi HOG (decent graphics, mostly tolerable voice acting, and reasonable puzzles).  I got about 3.6 hours out of my first run.  If I'd gone on to continue the last run, I'd probably have gotten about 5-1/2 to 6 hours of "enjoyment" out of it.  So, if you decide to buy it, I'd suggest getting it on sale.","June 21, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had so much fun in this game that I actually played through it 3 times (mostly to get the achievements, but yes I enjoyed it too).  So - gameplay was good, I had no issues at all.  Puzzles were challenging without being ridiculous.  There is a hint system but I didn't use it.  The game follows a story so all of the puzzles are story driven and themed.  There is a great mix of puzzle types in addition to the hidden object puzzles.  I got all of the achievements in 3 play throughs - the last being a speed play for myself.  For this type of game I feel that this is a very, very good game so I give it a 10/10 and my enthusiastic thumbs up.","July 3, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To sum it up, this is way I liked or disliked about the game.\n\nPros:\n- Great art style, fits the gloomy setting of the game\n- Well made soundtrack, setting an adequate mood.\n- While the synch is not exactly perfect, the voice acting is good.\n\nCons:\n- Hidden Object scenes are entirely random. You search for 20 objects, one of which you are actually looking for, the rest dissapears forever.\n- Item Usage often doesn't make sense. At one point you need a stone to smash a window even though you have an iron wrench in your inventory.\n- The quality of cutscenes is horrible. This may just be an issue I had, so I don't know if it's the same for everyone.\n- Most items that you use are immediatly discarded forever even though you would need them later. Instead you have to search for a similar item all over again.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, I miss the logic aproach that most point and click games should use. If you need a certain item for a situation, you should usually be able to figure out which one on your own. Also, If I have to find a total of 3 scalpels to use in 3 different situations, I'm beginning to question if my character instantly annihalites every item that has served it's purpose once as a personal one-use policy. However, the game can still hold it's own with it's art style and soundtrack, which is easily good enough to create the atmosphere required for the game.","November 25, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have solved it better in the 2nd game, which has the same kind of mechanism.\n* Sometimes when you ask for a hint in certain types of the puzzles, instead of hinting, the game solves the whole puzzle for you.\n* There is only casual and expert mode, no in between.\n\nComment: I played it on casual difficulty.

There is a option to play mahjong which involves choosing the same two items like two bottles or two swords and quite easy to do when stuck combining a object..\n\nIt has dead pirates who are real helpful as long as you give them something and if you give one pirate coins he tells you the history and what happened and can be spooky at times the hint system is helpful.  Captain Remington sounds similar to Blackbeard who looked like he devil in battle and was know to cause fear in his enimies.\n\nIt is worth your time and buy it on special, I did and enjoyed my time playing the game, a bonus adventure is available,  after doing the main game and can take a hour or longer to do. You are nominated the new captain of the ship and need to find the message from a ship wrecked.

Nonetheless A.M. has followed the method of if it isn't broke don't fix it, meaning they reuse their puzzles with cosmetic variations from one game to another. This has the unfortunate result that if you've played one of their games you've played them all.\n\nThat's O.K. if you think of the games as more visual novels with bonus puzzle content. Granted the writing isn't amazing; but it isn't bad either. I know I've yet to play an A.M. game I could make myself stop playing before the end. That's, on average, over 3 hours in one sitting. And, most of their games include a bonus chapter that extends gameplay another hour.\n\nThey do manage to do this without unnecessarily padding game length that overstays its welcome. I know that doesn't sound like much in an industry with triple AAA titles that boast hundred of hours of gameplay. But, for cheap casual games this is an achievement.\n\nMy recommendation, because of the "if you've played one you've played them all" problem, is pare your selections down to their better games. That would be Enigmatis 2 (but not the mediocre Enigmatis: the Ghosts of Maple Creek) as a top pick, Grim Legends 1 & 2 if you liked that, and the Nightmares from the Deep trilogy if you just can't get enough of these games.","August 12, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is still a beautiful game with a good story which we have gone to expect from them if you've played their games before. The things I didn't like with this game is:\n1. The voice acting. It is of course rarely good in hidden object games, but this was on the borderline to embarrassing at times, and took away a little piece of the mood and feel to the game.\n2. The length. It took me 3,5h to complete this, all puzzles and hidden object scenes, no hints and I even did the bonus chapter. The puzzles weren't very challenging except for the last one in the game, which for me took a little more effort to see the pattern and complete.\nThe only reason I'm might sound negative toward this game is because Artifex Mundi really have delivered before (I started in the middle of their games based on release, which might have been a mistake) But in the end; It's a gorgeous game, with good sound (except voice) and okay puzzles.

You don't like puzzles?\n\nNeither do i, and yet... it took all of about 2 minutes for this game to reel me in. It's a casual point-and-click adventure where the protagonist is on a quest to rescue her daughter from a risen-from-the-dead (or was he ever truly dead?) pirate (which may sound horribly campy, but it actually fits the story very well). It offers a "hint" button to help the... ah... less puzzle-oriented of us out when we're stuck, and offers an alternate mechanism for finding hidden items in some contexts (namely, a Mahjong mini-game, where matching tiles substitutes for finding items). As others as mentioned, the quality of the cinematic cutscenes is rather poor (specifically, each pixel is about 15mm across, but the motion _is_ fluid), but the cinematics are nonetheless used to great effect, providing cohesive transitions between non-cinematic scenes, which ties them to each other in a way i've not personally seen in games of this type (admittedly, my experience with them is limited, as it's not really my genre - perhaps that's a common thing to see in other games of this type). The non-cinematic parts are of course graphically impressive and the controls are trivial (well, the singular control - the mouse). The voice-overs are a definite "meh" but they aren't bad. (Some of the pronounciation irks me, but there's no accounting for taste (tomato, tomahto, and all that).)\n\nAt 8 Euros for parts 1-3 (on sale), i kinda feel like i've cheated the publisher, as opposed to feeling cheated myself.\n\nSo... back to playing... where were we... right, we've just left the museum and... aaaarrrrggghhh! A pirate! Click it! CLIIIICK IT!!!\n\nPS: plays flawlessly on my Mint Linux.\n\nPPS: After having finished it, some closing thoughts:\n\n- None of the puzzles felt "arbitrary" to me, in contrast to some puzzle games i've played (i'm looking at you, Lego series!).\n\n- A couple of the words for hidden items were a bit confusing (or completely new to me), but the "sonar" feature made that a non-issue.\n\n- It felt a bit short - roughly 6 hours (without using the Hint feature), including the  Extra Adventure which gets unlocked after the main story. Nonetheless, the pacing felt good - it never went long without something to do and i was never left scratching my head for more than a few minutes at a time. Likewise, backtracking was not problematic because navigation is swift.\n\n- Unlocking all achievements requires 2 play-throughs (once using the Mahjong search feature and once without it), and i'm very unlikely to play any game of this type twice.\n\n- i feel that 8+ Euros is a tick too high for today's market for this type of game, but not overly so. i won't impulse-buy an 8 Euro game, but will certainly bookmark it so that Steam notifies me if it's on sale.\n\n- i will likely impulse-buy future titles by this publisher if they're priced at 4 Euros or less.","March 24","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I still tried this HOG because I got this in a sale and still had fun playing this HOG. In this HOG u will be trying to save ur daughter and also solve another mystery of what happened to the countess and the pirate who's name I forgot LOL\n\nThe music was alright. The BG is very nice. The VA was ok not the best and the cutscenes suffer low resolution quality. This game was made in 2012 which explains the low resolution quality.\n\nMake sure u get the HOG Nightmares From The Deep two. This HOG has three games which is cool:)","May 29","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
