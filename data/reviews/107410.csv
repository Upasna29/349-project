I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.\n\nI run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.\n\nAnybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?\n\nThe marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.\nHe screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood.\n"SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!"\nhe died after that.\nI cried\nand he respawned.\n\n11/10, would recommend getting.","October 31, 2014","true","844.4"," 4,812 of 5,069 people (95%) found this review helpful 2,324 people found this review funny","95","812","5","324","71"

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.\n\nOne that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.\n\nAs we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.\n\nThere I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.\n\nAs I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.\n\nFalling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.\n\nThat is what this game is about.","May 17, 2014","true","161.0"," 3,556 of 3,752 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","556","3","0","89"

It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.\n\nAt its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ♥♥♥ depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.\n\nOut of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)\n\nHowever the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.\n\nOh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.\n\nIn wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.\n\nPurchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.\n\n(IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)","September 30, 2014","true","211.0"," 1,590 of 1,661 people (96%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","96","590","1","40","51"

I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D","November 3, 2015","true","177.6"," 1,702 of 1,800 people (95%) found this review helpful 423 people found this review funny","95","702","1","423","42"

Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.\n\nArma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.\n\nYou will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.\n\nYou can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.\n\nThe graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.\n\nI recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.","October 6, 2014","true","516.3"," 517 of 567 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","517","567","9","8"

For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.\n\nArma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.\nComing from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.\n\nAt the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.\nFortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.\n\nSpeaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.\n\nFor all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride.","November 25, 2013","true","280.1"," 758 of 880 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","758","880","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stefan-/recommended/107410/","stefan-","stef-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stefan-/","97 products in account","Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: "$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.\n\nBasically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator  and  a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it).\n\nThe engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface.\n\nPro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.\n\nThe game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.\n\nI'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched "tappy" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.\n\nLastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.\n\nSo yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D","March 25, 2014","true","305.7"," 380 of 426 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","380","426","0","13"

What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I’ve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.\n\nWhat you don’t get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you’re in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you’re sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing.\n\nThe strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.\n\nWant to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.\n\nWant to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn’t the game you’re looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign – those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don’t expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before – the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.\n\nPersonally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players.\n\nSo, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I’d certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.\n\nI hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I’m not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some.","December 20, 2013","true","130.3"," 407 of 474 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","407","474","0","4"

You gonna waste time to get to destination point and after hour of travelling there you will be shot by some weirdo in the woods.

The main campaign is split into 3 chapters/episodes: "Survive", "Adapt" and "Win".\n\nIn the first chapter you need to survive in a multi-force conflict on Stratis. It's a quite instructive Episode, showing you the Arma 3 101s, such as moving, diving, driving, shooting etc. There's no pop-up message showing you what to do, but usually you can open a "Help" tab by pressing H. The missions on Survive are quite controlled, but if you keep hiding behind a rock your Squad Members will have a hard time or even die. So if you don't want to be left alone, you should do what you're supposed to.\n\nThe second Episode plays on Altis, where you join a local Guerilla force. In this chapter you learn how to control your own squad and how the communication system works. You still have your orders, but you can leave the base and explore the map whenever you want, playing optional missions or looking for better weapons.\n\nFinally, in "Win" you join the NATO reinforcment. In this chapter you need to show what you've learned so far, fighting a lot of enemies ;-)\n\n\nScenarios - Workshop / SP / COOP\nThe Steam Workshop offers a lot of user created content, which you should definitely check out. Many of them can be played in coop with friends or even on servers. There are some stock Arma 3 coop missions you can play as well.\n\n\nScenarios - Multiplayer\nThere are a lot of Servers online, which offer a lot of different scenarios and modifications. I'll cover just a few (popular) of them:\n\nDomination:\nBasically "King of the Hill" where you need to capture cities. Usually you can use whatever gear you want and choose your function (Engineer, Medic, Commander, ...). Every function has its own abilities, which you can benefit from. Most servers also support side missions, where you can get new vehicles, choppers or jets. Domination's my personal favourite.\n\nWasteland:\nIt's a team deathmatch mode where you can join multiple groups or play on your own. You usually start with a pistol and need to find/buy weapons and supplies (water, food, ..) to survive. If you earned enough money you can build your personal fort. There are vehicles and choppers on the map, but most of them are broken and you need to repair/refuel them. But you can also get special vehicles for your team by doing side missions which appear every few minutes. Certainly, the other teams try to do the same thing.\n\nAltis Life:\nOne of the most popular game modes. It's basically a "cops and robbers"/"roleplay" simulation. There are police forces which are other players controlling the cities. As long as you don't do anything illegal, such as killing someone or carry weed with you, they won't do anything to you. It's a fun mode if you want to play Arma without shooting someone all the time. Microphone is recommended!\n\n\nScenarios - Do it yourself!\nYou certainly can host your own server. There are a lot of scenarios which you can download and modify. Arma 3 also offers you an Editor which you can use to build your own scenario from scratch. It's quite hard if you don't know anything about scripting or never used the Arma editor before, but there are a lot of tutorials on youtube and on forums which you can check out.\n\n\nKart DLC\nThere's not much I can tell about the DLC, but you can drive Karts, Yay!\n\n\nKnown issues\nA lot of people are not able to play Arma 3 on a stable framerate, despite their superior machine. If you have any performance issues, check out the online tutorials on how to fix it. There are a lot of possible ways to increase your performance.\n\n\nBut worth the money?\nImho, definitely! It's been over a year and the devs still add content. Check out videos on youtube or try the game on free weekends if you're interested but don't know if it's something for you. It takes some time to learn the basics, don't be frustrated if you die every minute on your first try ;-)\n\n","October 26, 2014","true","307.4"," 181 of 210 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","181","210","13","0"

The gameplay is unique and realistic. You can actually feel the realism when you play, especially mixed with the awesome community.\nControls = 10/10 - There's alot of different combinations of controls. Advanced stances for peeking is a great feature that I hope more games will have in the future. Mod-creators can also have their own controls added very easily. I have yet not seen a game with these many control functions.\nAI = 4/10 - Sometimes the Ai is completely ♥♥♥♥ed up and this is something the devs need to work on! Especially when you are inside forests and such, where they shoot you through bushes etc.\nGraphics = 8/10 - Good graphics, though watch out for FPS drops!\nDetails = 6/10 - No furniture in buildings and other stuff, which makes the game feel empty. But the outdoors (which you mostly play in) has alot of rocks and bushes that can actually save your life in some really hard situations. Though mission makers can add stuff in the Scenario Editor.\nReplayability = 9/10 -  There's alot of things to do, from diving onto land and then sneaking around a guerilla camp to using advanced high-tech mortars togheter with armored vehicles assaulting a largely fortified base. If you combine these things (Combined Arms) you can create some really epic missions.\nMusic = 9/10 - Also I love the soundtrack, it's just pure epicness.\nSound = 8/10 - Since the Marksmen platform update got released the sound got a huge upgrade. The gunfire does different echoes/sounds depending on environment and distance and the guns also sound more realistic.\nGlitchfree = 5/10 - The game has alot of glitches and stuff like that, but sometimes it's just hilarious and doesn't affect gameplay that much. Luckily it's not as bad as DayZ.\nCommunity = 10/10 - AMAZING COMMUNITY, even the russians stick to their own servers. Though there are some veerry rare occasions of hackers. Also a huge amount of community-mods to use!\nDevelopers = 8/10 - At the start of Arma 3 alot of people were saying it was unfinished and they only added expensive DLC (But it looks like they forgo the free platform update!!). Back in Arma 2 the DLC was very worth it and rich of new stuff to play with.  Recently, the developers announced their secret project which is a whole new terrain located at an Island in South America! There's alot of new features such as Jetskis and Airplanes which I'm very looking forward to! :D They've updated the Anti-Hacker protection A.K.A Battleye for increased protection, and since then I haven't encountered any.\nStory = 6/10 - I don't really know about this. It's not really explained that much and you have to make up the theories yourself, kinda like how Five Nights at Freddy's is.\nLength = Long - I think the campaign is about 25 hours long...\nOptimization = 9/10 - There is alot of optimization, you can even switch colors of the teams.\nPerformance = 6/10 - The frame drops, the thing everyone is talking about. The problem is that it mostly depends on the server which FPS you get, not what type of PC you have. Singleplayer works fine, and so does private servers. As long as you have a good server there shouldn't be too much of a trouble.\nDLC = Medium - There are 3 DLCs at the moment, some people think it's way to expensive (13.99 £ for 2 Helicopters!?), but they always put ALOT of detail and work into them, and a platform update also gets released.\nUPDATE: The release of Tanoa in 2016 looks like a very good DLC. Looking forward to it.\n\n---------- FINAL RESULT = 96/100\nFair Price = Yes","March 13, 2015","true","076.7"," 152 of 173 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","152","173","15","5"

Before I go on I must say that Arma 3 is hands down my favourite game and hopefully will be yours to as it provides endless hours of fun!\n\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros\n\n- Endless Hours Due To Mission Making Or Zues\n- Tactical Military Experince You Won't Find In Other Games\n- If The Vanilla Game Is Not Enough You Can Mod Arma 3 To Get A New Or Even A More Challenging Experience\n- A More Or Less Friendly Community\n- If The Hardcore Military Experience Gets Too Much There Is Multiple Gamemodes That Are A Lot More Casual\n- This Game Gets Frequent Updates And Has 5 DLC's For The Game\n\n\nCons\n\n- FPS Shutters & Drops May Occur Depending On Your PC Specs (Especially With Mods)\n- Not A Lot But A Few Major Bugs (Leads To Some Pretty Hilarious Moments Sometimes)\n\n\nThe First Steps Of Arma 3\n\nOkay this part of the review is aimed at people who have just obtained the game and how they should take thier first steps towards this wonderful game!

I was born. I rolled out the spawn point. Before I even got out spawn the was a hive of activity from people running around shouting profanities in ever language you can think of. From the kid running down the road after his car that been robbed by three guys who are now flipping the kid the middle finger as the kids is chasing them down the road shouting in his high pitched voice “ GIVE ME MY CAR BACK YOU F&%$%”. Then the is that guy all geared up looking like he just came from a game off battlefield 4 who is selling his expert military killing skills to you for a one time low price “ protection to hits all under ones roof, you a fresh you should hire me I would give ya some tips” he shouts in a menacing voice at you.\nDon’t forget the fresh spawns running around trolling people, lying in front of their cars stopping them from driving off, to the five guys surrounding the only cop in the place shouting at the top of their voice’s “ we are protesting against the police force you are corrupt”\nI could hardly take it all in when a Dutch guy walks up to me and says “hi dude how are you?”\nI replied “im cool just looking to get $hit rolling, you know?” the Dutch guy say to me in a very mellow voice, very very mellow voice “ yar come with me brudda I got two friends we going to make some money you wan in?”\nWithout a thought I now found myself in a car with three guys who are all not talking even when I ask them where we going. we head down the road at speed, before long we are in a field with the guys now out the car pointing guns at me all shouting at the top of the voices “get out the F$£%% car now!” intermediated and curious at the same time I get out the car. To find one of them smashing me over the head with his pistol in a rocky balboa of a swing witch sends me crashing to the floor. Now the three bandits have me on the floor and are now proceeding to hit me over and over again to keep me there, they ask me for one million dollars. I laugh at them and tell them im fresh to this hold thing I have no money. They chat around to around for a minute then they tell me that I have wasted there time and im going to have to pay…\nThey then opened fire on me and I was killed.\nSpawn back in where the guy with the menacing voice runs up to me and says “don’t get in cars with strangers, that one is on the house” as he walks off in to the long dusty road of Role Play.\nI ended up making a ♥♥♥♥ load of friends on the sever, it was great Altis life. Joined a clan steam rolled through the clan and became warlords in our own rights. Zeus the clan ran the sever we had our fat fingers in all the pies. Not a lot ♥♥♥♥ed with us but if they did we would pull such a force together with ours members and our allies, no one could escape. Robbing banks, robbing players homes, robbing players, taking hostages for ransom if no pay out shot the ♥♥♥♥er and make a carpet out of him, drug dealing, drug farming, drug taking knocking off drug dealers and farmers the lot. It was like my very own Scarface.\nMilitary Simulator Game\nARAM<3 Is an awesome game, brilliant combat simulation with breathtaking graphics and terrain. The standard maps are based on two real islands in the Mediterranean sea in Greece. The maps are identical to the real islands. The game developers went to that much length to map the terrain that they got arrested by the Greek authorities for spying, that’s commitment. The Incredible scale of Altis the main island is over 270 kilometers, it has 730klm of road linking 50 towns, villages, and cities. Accurate star map for navigation.\nThe islands have five unique factions, NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA and the civilians each have their own motives and vehicles. Over 15 stances, now remember your keys you don’t want to get stuck in one of them. The moding is great on this the are tones of mods out there for you where its game type to gun grips and that AK47 you always wanted. The multiplayer and the moding community work well together. But I find the game modes and vanilla content good as well. Breaking point and arma life, wasteland chernus (cherno map for arma2 dayz mod) are but a couple of mods you should check out. The list goes on.\nThe is so much i could say more about this game but that list goes on too. I give this the best marks i can.","July 29, 2015","true","249.1"," 149 of 176 people (85%) found this review helpful 89 people found this review funny","85","149","176","89","0"

It caters to all types of players. Casual players can usually find themselves playing custom missions such as Wasteland and King of the Hill. Roleplaying players have Stratis and Altis life, and tactical players can find servers with Coop and Team vs Team missions as well as tactical groups that play the game in a very realistic manner. Besides the vanilla content there is a variety of realism and fun mods both in the workshop and from outside resources. Feel free to do your own research, check out the Zeus game mode, as well as some tactical gameplay videos that can usually be found https://www.youtube.com/user/Dslyecxi.\ntl;dr Game is awesome, very moddable, hours of gameplay.\n\nEdit: Just to update the review, now with a lot more hours and proper tactical gaming experience behind me, I can say I rediscovered arma completely. In my first mission I didn't even fire the gun and it was more fun than most of the stuff I have played before.

I am this game. This game is me.\n\nAfter 1564.2 hours invested in this game... I  have come to the conclusion that Arma 3 isn't a video game but a government research project into alternate reality simulations. This isn't a game... it is their first draft of the Matrix.\n\nI... I have done things in this alternate reality that I never thought I'd do... I learned how to fly helicopters at terrifying speeds just inches from the ground and I've dropped scores and scores of fine young soldiers into battle. I have used a supply crate as  a helicopter-borne wrecking ball. I have learned how to operate rocket launchers with extreme prejudice and impunity.\n\nIn one instance, I became a heroin running gang-leader that got into an epic shoot out with the police that ended up with me flying away in a stolen helicopter high on adrenaline (and a little cocaine)... then shortly after that  I was in a high-speed police chase that ended the lives of several good police officers in fiery explosive deaths as their cars tumbled and rolled around corners as I zipped away at 300km+ in the worlds fastest Prius. I have sung Kumbaya over a barrel fire at a meth lab with my mortal enemies.\n\nI once crashed a jet straight into a single enemy soldier because God Bless America, god dangit!\n\nMost importantly  - I've learned from this game. This game has taught me a lot of stuff... like that stairs can straight up kill you. I moved to a single story house because of this and I am happy to report that no stairs have tried to kill me since! I have also stopped climbing on and around rocks because they can swallow you and you'll never get out of the rock... I have put up posters all around my neighborhood advising parents to keep their children away from stairs and rocks, lest they end up dead or swallowed whole!\n\nIf I had to look back on it, I'd say my feelings are like Lois Griffin in this clip - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlHTPDDguF4 - WHAT DID I DO??!?! WHAT DID I DOOOO!?!?!? *Wretches* - I mean that in the best way possible... what a delightful waste of time... way too much time!","August 3, 2015","true","120.8"," 71 of 78 people (91%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","91","71","78","63","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProtatoesAndCheese/recommended/107410/","ProtatoesAndCheese","E.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProtatoesAndCheese/","213 products in account","While the animations, graphics, lighting, and vehicle handling are better in this installment into the ARMA series, I miss the ARMA 2's setting, units, and mods.  ARMA 3's "future-istic" setting doesn't make sense, and some of the gear used just looks flat out odd.  While I appreciate the new vehicles such as the MRAP "Hunter" or the newly updated "Ghosthawk" (Blackhawk), or any of that sort of updated feel.  I'm not saying change is a bad thing, I'm just saying sometimes too much change isn't.\n\nA great addition to the ARMA series, was the much requested "stances" available to you during the game.  Whether it's leaning from standing, crouching, or even laying on your side in the prone position, it offers a wide variety of heights and angles to tackle those pesky rocks, windows, and walls that you're either too short or too tall for.  There are 3 standing stances, 3 crouching stances, a sitting position, and a prone position.  Every stance except for sitting, allows you to step out to the side, or lean around cover.  From the prone, you can peak a corner, or lay on your side.  This vastly improves over ARMA 2's restricted movement.  It would be nice to see the ability to vault over short walls, or help your buddy boost over a larger one as well, but that's just wishful thinking.\n\nAnother thing I noticed, is the sound of the weapons.  A lot of the weapons have similar sounds, which makes it hard to distinguish which side of the battle you're getting into.  While some of the sounds such as explosions, vehicles, and other small ambient additions are nice, I feel like I'm often confused and lost with the sounds.  Hopefully, a good soundmod will fix this later down the road.\n\nAI. . . AI. . .AI. . .   One thing the ARMA series hasn't been able to nail down, is the AI's movement, pathing, communication, and skills.  I realize that it's really difficult in such a complex and vast game such as this, where the player has free will on which direction to get to an objective, or how, but often you'll either find your allies falling behind, running out of formation for a second, or asking "Where are you" after you run over a hill even though other soldiers under your command are still coming of the hill themselves.  It would be nice to see AI being able to figure out things based on other AI, and not almost strictly from you.  Combat awareness.  Something I noticed in ARMA, is that no matter what situation, the AI in combat are lacking, whether an enemy soldier, or a friendly, you'll notice them not finding cover, running into the middle of a street, or from behind cover out into the open.  On one of my first "showcase" missions, I was instructed by my AI squad leader to move behind a wrecked tank as cover.  "Neat" I thought.  He then gave me an area to suppress, as I was an automatic rifleman.  I began laying fire down from my position, my own squad leader walked next to me, and as he gave an order, ran right in front of me, bushing me back, and causing a bullet to hit him in the head, resulting in a mission failed and having to restart the whole thing.  Note, the time it took for him to stand next to me and rush in front of me was almost 1 second, leaving me no time to react.  Their aim isn't that great either.  You could be standing across a room and they won't be able to hit you, or they'll be firing from a fortified position catching you and your allies of-guard yet, not hiting any of you as you sprint to cover or dash towards it.  Now, this goes both ways.  To combat them being "too easy", you could set the dificulty to Expert of Veteran.  The problem with this, is that the change is too extreme.  Setting your game to the highest difficulty, results in enemy soldiers being able to spot you easily.  You could be concealed at night in a bush, and taking you out.  That, or you'll witness getting shot in the head from across the valley.  My advice?   Find some friends or a group to join, disable AI teammates for the mission, and only play with a team made up of human players, 9 times out of 10, you'll be able to accurately cover teammates, move together in a more realistic and effective way, and it will increase your expierence 10-fold.  Here's an example of the Helo AI in this game.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203646487\n\nAnother weird problem you may notice, is the problem with framerates while playing any form of multiplayer.  You may or many not have issues, and to top it off, it's really sporatic and without a known cause.  In singleplayer however, this is not the case, and the game runs a lot smoother.  and it is quite confusing, and frustrating when trying to set your settings.  Here's an example.  You go to singleplayer, and you set your game to just the right settings after a while of tinkering.  The game looks great, and you're real happy with it.  Now your friend hops on, or you want to go play on a server.  You select one with the best player/ping ratio, and join it.  You notice right away your frames are a lot worse, and you sit the tinkering with your settings again, mostly lowering everything so that you can run the game.  Not only does this make the game look worse in one of the most important features of the game, but when you join back to singleplayer, the game looks worse, and you either have to deal with the settings again, or get stuck with lower graphics.  Now, changing the settings in multiplayer may not always fix the problem either, so you could be messing with them for awhile before giving up in frustration.\n\nOverall: If you're a fan of the ARMA series, or any realistic shooter, I'd go for ARMA 3.  While I still play ARMA 2 more, ARMA 3 offers enough change when I get tired of the former.  Improved graphics and lighting, vehicle handling, weapon handling, and the use of different combat "stances", really improves over ARMA 2's static and prohibited movement.  While you won't be in the deserts of Takistan, or going through the dense city of Zargabad, the Islands of Stratis and Altis, are sure to give you the variety and fun you'd want.  While the AI isn't improved much, some of the futuristic units, and factions don't fit well, and the sounds can tend to be confusing, ARMA 3 is definitely a step in the right direction, and a giant leap towards success.","January 5, 2014","true","067.5"," 107 of 131 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","107","131","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeyStreak/recommended/107410/","KeyStreak","keystreak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeyStreak/","31 products in account","It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.\n\nOver the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home.\n\nArguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.\n\nWhile Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions.\n\nThe first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the "follower" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.\n\nIt's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.\n\nWhile it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to "find cover" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.\n\nTactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.\n\nAdapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface.\n\nAlongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on "Patrol" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.\n\nAfter the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take.\n\nArma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.","April 18, 2015","true","525.5"," 62 of 75 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","62","75","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnirock/recommended/107410/","omnirock","Omnirock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnirock/","804 products in account","Arma 3 is an ambitious title with a style of gameplay that will polarize players. The many complexities and amount of controls to master can be a daunting task for any newcomer to the series, while seasoned vets will feel right at home (for better or worse).\n\nThere is a great deal to learn about playing Arma in a way that is enjoyable. The default campaign mode is passable, with all the tropes you'd expect to find in a military shooter, with a few surprises here and there. Missions vary in length and scope, ranging from short range patrols to full on combined operations assaults.\n\nHowever, where the real meat is in the multiplayer experience and the many mods available. Hopping on to a co-op server with 60+ players who actually want to work together as a unit is nothing short of amazing in a world of "le epic trelling". Being able to request evac, mortar, medical assistance, etc is wonderous on it's own, but having those assets being controlled by actual players gives you a sense of connection and being part of a team. Even if realistic military games aren't your particular style, there are plenty of other game modes available that you can download right from the server browser and enjoy. These include standouts like Altis Life (kind of like a more advanced Cops and Robbers), Wasteland (a survival mod focused on factions), and Breaking Point ( A Day-Z style mod).\n\nMods will breath all sorts of new life into your game, adding new vehicles, uniforms, maps and much much more, giving you almost limitless scenarios and tools to use in creating custom missions.\n\nyou can check out the large database of mods at : http://www.armaholic.com\n\n\nThat said, Arma is not without it's fair number of faults and missteps, the game is not optimized well for multiplayer, and you'll encounter many bugs along the way (most of which are hilarious as opposed to annoying). The learning curve can be fairly steep, and you'll have to be patient to get the most fun out of this title...  that said, it's well worth it, especially if you have some friends willing to do the same.","April 8, 2014","true","806.8"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","51","58","0","1"

Emulates infantry combat and tactics.\nExtensive community support means the game doesn't get old through the release of community based mods, scripts, addons and missions.\nGreat mods available (Altis Life, Epoch, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Exile and more).\nRealistic and accurate firearms ballistics and ranging (as far as a game can attempt to emulate).\nBeautiful and well designed maps.\nDestructible buildings and map features.\nHuge variety of weapons and load outs especially with the addition of the Marksman DLC (highly recommended).\nLarge number of vehicles to drive.\nMore mature community player base. It's a game where you need to use planning, teamwork and tactics to succeed so it attracts a higher age demographic. ARMA 3 is not Call of Duty, Battlefield, CS:GO.\nCons:Prone to bugs and glitching. Death by staircases, insta-exploding helicopters and being sucked into walls is sadly not that uncommon. Deducted a full point for this as it sadly detracts from the quality of the otherwise brilliant game.\nIt is worth noting there is a steep learning curve to the game but this can be offset by utilising the in game virtual arsenal, virtual training and practice scenarios.\nWill eat your CPU and GPU for breakfast. You need a solid rig to run this with ultra settings. Not a problem for me personally but players do experience FPS issues.\nInventory system could do with improvements.\nDLC content. People however do need to be aware some content requires DLC. Personally I don't have an issue with DLC as it supports the development of the games I like but I do understand DLC annoys some people.\nSummary:\nHighly recommended if you would like to experience simulated infantry combat.\nNot recommended if you want to kill, die and respawn constantly like in a typical FPS shooter.\n\nIt's a difficult game to master but if anything learn to shoot first. Finding a group to play with that can show you the ropes helps. Learn to communicate meaningful information to your team mates (eg. CONTACT! 2 infantry, bearing 40, 200 metres, left of the house with the orange roof). Effective communication and teamwork is key to succeeding.

Well, no worries my friend, you will NEVER finish all of the user created missions available to download. The online Arma creators community is alive and rich with well executed and engaging content. And that brings me to the editor. Can't find what you want online? Make it yourself. Do you want a game where you and several friend have to deliver cakes while being attacked by demon monkies? Well go and ♥♥♥♥ing make it! You can sink hour after hour into the Arma Editor. Sound crazy? Well it is. There are many games that have been developed off the Arma Engine and the Editor gives you alot of control (not complete but you can figure lower level stuff out) to create literally whatever the hell your crazy mind can come up with. So buy it because when you buy Arma you also buy endless gaming opportunities!\n\n**EDIT**\nWith the release of the Eden update it just keeps getting better! Everything I mentioned earlier about mission creation just got a whole lot esaier and more intuitive. Bohemia is probably the last great developer that actually appears to care about it's users. It's amzing that years after its release the team is still pushing massive updates, FOR FREE!!!!! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I love you brilliant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!","September 16, 2015","true","717.1"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","31","33","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrimeMovies/recommended/107410/","CrimeMovies","crime movies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrimeMovies/","72 products in account","ARMA 3 is one of my favorite video games to date. It's a massive military sandbox with tons of factions, weapons, and vehicles. What's not to like?\nMilitary simulation at it's finest.\n\nARMA gameplay is so different and less homogenized than the other shooter games out there such as CS;GO, Battlefield, and other modern-day gunfighting games. It's a game for thinkers and tacticians. It's a game for people who are patient and who enjoy executing a well thought-out plan.\n\nGameplay\n\nLet's get right down to the basics; ARMA at it's core is all about combined arms gameplay, meaning that compositions of infantrymen, motorized and mechanized vehicles, helicopters, support units, and CAS are all conducted in unison to perform a common goal depending on the scenario. You can charge a factory inhabited with militants with a large column of unstoppable tanks in an organized attack, or you can complete similar objectives with a small team of 4 during a night mission.\n\nThe shooting is not like your classic FPS with head-tracking and ray tracing. With the massive scale of ARMA comes realism, and bullet drop, stamina, and ammunition type all change the dynamics of your weapon. Different calibers have different 'feels' to them, and equipping the proper gear for an operation is like choosing the right cameras, lights and crew for a movie set. You need proper scopes that are for your chambered caliber, you need to learn how to zero in your sights, and how to ultimately master long-range marksmanship. The shooting reintroduces the aspect of skill-based combat.\n\nVehicles don't feel very optimal, but they do the job and they function as they are supposed to. Vehicles for each faction feel different, and they all serve a purpose, whether it's transporting ammunition and gasoline to the front lines, or conducting artillery fire missions on far away targets. The helicopter flight modules are very realistic and fun to use especially as an experienced flyer, and doing gun runs with a stealth A-10 feels even better.\n\nThe AI in the game is terrible especially when in a combined arms group. Commanding feels clunky and annoying, and your AI teammates make remarkably bad decisions and don't stick to formation under certain circumstances. That's why you need to play this game with friends. Having more players in a mission with you is quite literally a fun multiplier. Picking roles and cooperation are the best parts of the game.\n\nGraphics\n\nAltis and Stratis look fantastic and the architecture and design make you feel like you are in a genuinely mediterranean location. The water is fresh and blue, and the trees shimmer in the sunlight as they are supposed to. The ground is home to a lot of detail, with rocks you can use as cover, seastacks obscuring different locations, and ruins with plenty to discover. The modelling is fantastic and the weapons are crisp and sound spectacular. The only issue is that this game runs surprisingly bad, utilizing only two cores of your processor (or something like that), meaning that you would have to play on medium to low settings if you have a lower-end system.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nIt's ♥♥♥♥ unless you're playing with friends. Zeus is a fantastic addon with on-the-fly mission creation, but I wouldn't think about playing it in public even once. Battle Royale is overhyped, island life is boring and requires too many mods. MILSIM is fantastic but as always there are good groups and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ groups out there.\n\nOverall it's a fun game and you get a lot for your money.","April 25","true","468.2"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","41","50","2","10"

God knows how many hours I've spent on Arma 2. Anyways, this is one of the best games I've ever played. While I might describe this as a game, I consider this as more of an engine. Why?\n\nBecause games often restrict you to a lore, a path, tools, programed in a way without giving you the chance to explore other possibilities; they want you to experience what they want you to experience. For this game, it's different - you can choose to be a common soldier in the Vietnam war. You can choose to be a helicopter pilot in the war in Iraq. Whatever theatre, faction, weapon, uniform you fancy, there are often mods for it.\n\nSo forget about how badly optimized this game is, because the fact is with how vast the possibilities this game opens you to, you really are pushing the boundaries of this engine. People often complain about how badly optimized this game is, and at the same time complain about the lack of free will in other games. This game has the latter, so appreciate it for what it is.\n\nThe community is one of the best out there. But because of the influx of new players, also be wary of who you might run into.","March 17","true","863.9"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","27","29","5","5"

Please note that I'm only giving it a negative review because of my history with the Arma franchise (starting with Armed assault, moving through arma 2 and all its expansions and playing using ACE mod on each) and the fact that I had certain expectations when I inevitably pre-ordered this game.\n\nNow please note, I have no issue with the setting, near future is fine provided it is done correctly, and in that regard I believe Arma 3 really shines. I have yet to play a game set in the near future that is as 'believable' as Arma 3, because the majority of the weapons and vehicles already exist... and a lot of them are outdated.\n\nMy issue with arma 3 is the fact that there is a shocking lack of content with the base game, there is a massive step downwards in terms of realistic fidelity, and the performance of the game is abysmal, even with someone with a computer that is massively overpowered for the game. Now, the argument could be made that no where else could I turn for a game that seamlessly integrates combined land, sea and air warfare on a massive scale, and I would believe that argument if Arma II and it's expansions didn't exist. That's the problem, this has all been done before, and to a much better standard.\nWhy do soldiers only flinch when shot, and continue to fight back as if nothing happened? In Arma 2, if I shot the leg/arm of an AI, his movement would be impaired or his aim would be impaired, in Arma 3, nothing is simulated whatsoever. Instead, enemies take multiple hits to be downed, even with extended armour turned off!\n\nI don't understand why Bohemia decided to create 3 factions that are more or less mirror images of one another (the reused assets between mounted MG's, grenade launchers, missile launchers alike is puzzling and frankly, lazy.), I don't understand why they removed core features such as dragging/carrying wounded allies to be healed properly by a dedicated medic, as opposed to the magical 'heal all' FAKs we have in game, and I don't understand why they're still using the same tired engine as they used 20 years ago for a game that is on a much greater scale in both terrain, amount of buildings and graphical fidelity.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Arma III is a stroke of technical genius, managing to take the virtual reality engine and make it look THIS good is mind blowing, but what's the point in looking good, if the game runs like ♥♥♥♥? Even when installed on an SSD, there is still the stutter loading when playing online, and I've found that in cities etc. the framerates are completely unplayable when playing with a reasonable player count of 30+.\n\nSo here are what I consider to be the pros, and the cons:\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful looking game\n- Interesting concepts behind a near future setting\n- Movement is easily better than the previous games\n- Stance system (whilst part of movement, is good enough to be mentioned on it's own)\n- Bipods (when they work) are really damn cool\n- AI is much smarter than previous installments, reacting better to cover and suppression\n- Sound design is much better, although guns still sound a bit 'off', something I rectify quite quickly with sound mods\n- Inventory system is really nice and intuitive\n- Steam workshop support makes mods easier to use, however due to the file size limit only really supports basic mods which I couldn't care less for.\n- Campaign is a bit more cohesive this time around, previous campaigns felt a bit aimless\n- Pre recorded voice lines\n\nCons (there are a lot of them):\n- The game caters to more casual players (will explain with the following points)\n1. Ammo pool showing how many shots are left in your gun, regardless of difficulty setting is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid\n2. AI can tank several rounds, and fire back with perfect accuracy with nothing more than a flinch, gone are the days of crippling someone's arm to reduce their accuracy or taking out their legs to stop them from moving\n3. Vehicle crosshairs almost never line up with their HUD counterparts, and cannot be turned off\n4. Weapons have poor penetration value, I've seen the argument being made that in the future armoured vests will allow you to survive longer, which I can appreciate, but that does not stop the fact that the kinetic force of a bullet would still wound you to the point where you are ineffective. I don't mind the soldiers surviving, but at least incapacitate them for ♥♥♥♥s sake.\n5. Magical FAKs that heal you to the point where a dedicated medic is a luxury, not a requirement.\n6. (More of a server issue than the game itself) Everyone is running casual epoch, altis life etc servers. These far outnumber the traditional game servers, which I think speaks for itself really. It's a game targetting people who aren't here for an authentic military shooter. It's here for people that want to use third person, sprint everywhere and not take things seriously.\n- Each faction is practically identical, there is no assymetrical balance like the previous games, everyone has one assault rifle, one type of grenade, one type of MBT, one type of transport helicopter, one type of attack helicopter, ONE JET EACH (wtf?), and the exact same grenade launchers, missile launchers, UAV's, UGV's and submarines. The recycled content is ♥♥♥♥ing lazy.\n- The DLC's thus far have offered very little content for their price. For example BAF in arma 2 added an entire new faction to play, with vehicles and weapons respectively. Whilst I can't comment on the expansion pack, Operation arrowhead was practically a new game, and from the PR that bohemia have released, TANOA seems about the most compelling part of Apex, which will probably run like ♥♥♥♥ because the amount of trees etc.\n- I don't like Altis. Personal preference.\n- Game runs like absolute ♥♥♥♥ on several rigs I've tried, including a 5960x, 24gb of ram, 2x Titan X's in SLI all running from an ssd to remove any loading stutter. It's just not possible to get this game running nicely.\n- Hardly any weapons/vehicles per faction. I touched on this briefly, but it was months until CSAT and NATO got jets, and they're both ground attackers only? Why? Why is there only one large transport vehicle shared between each faction? Why does each faction have the exact same UAV's, the same UGV's, submarines, grenades, chemlights, smoke grenades, ghillie suits, armour etc etc etc. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥.\n- Why does it take multiple bullets to drop a guy at 1m? Unless I'm using 7.62, 12.7 or intermediate cartidges, armour seems to sponge bullets for absolutely no reason.\n- Why can I not drag wounded allies? Or carry them?\n\nThis game drives me insane because I wanted to like it so desperately. Each iteration in a series should build upon it's predecessor, and in many regards Arma III improved in many ways, but took so many steps back that I can't recommend this game to anyone.\n\nNow ACE 3 definitely makes this game a lot easier to stomach, but the base game is still unfortunately there. It's unfortunately the only way I could say you should play this game if you're used to Arma II. I'm sure I'll get a lot of arguments from people saying that mods will fix X, Y and Z, but the fact is; Arma II didn't need fixing, so why should Arma III?","May 13","false","275.5"," 375 of 615 people (61%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","61","375","615","49","29"

This is by far my favorite military game of all time! Sure it takes a while to learn about the dangers of not going prone when an enemy comes by or getting major fatigue in the middle of a firefight but it is a SIMULATOR and by far the best one for military standards. I DO NOT recommend this game for the Call of Duty & Battlefield lovers because there is just no simple "respawn" or "run and gun it" situation this is not built for Deathmatches! It is built to be a simulator that simulates real time combat for the hardcore people! There are no killstreaks/CoD type loadouts or MLG scoreboard.

With increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more!  The control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2).  Another of the top complaints of this game is the NETCODE.  It is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2.\n\nThis game is mostly open source, Meaning that players are able to change almost every aspect of the game from the amount of fog to adding dinosuars into the game.  The things you can do are endless and that is it's selling point.  Bohemia Interactive leaves the imagining to you and the community to come up with your own story or missions.  This game is heavily supported by the modding community and for good reason.  The scripting language for ARMA 3 is .sqf, Based off the C++ coding language, but it seems like a little of everything works. (there is alot of things you can do to make somehting work)  I have based 4 years of my life modding and playing arma 2 and arma 3, making this my most played game, by a long shot.\n\nThe best way to play this game is modded and with friends.  By it's self, arma is fun, but somewhat bland, but that seems like that was part of the plan...

Lemme start by telling you this game is definitely more of a template than it is a full game solely based on its modding capability alone.\n\nSo I have a Vietnam Mod for this game, adds new maps, units, weapons, etc. Our platoon lands in the jungles at LZ Fiona, a clearing in the jungle in the hills. We spread out and head into the jungles. A shot rings out and the LT. takes one in the chest. V.C. Ambush. I hit the ground and ready my M16A1 I have no clue where the rounds are coming from but they're coming.  As I'm lying in the brush three figures run by, but they don't look friendly. Startled I swerve quickly back into their direction and let loose a full auto barrage from my 20 round magazine, I see blood flying out of the figures and then they drop. I got three of them. I look back ahead of me and start letting out one-round bursts trying to suppress the enemies on the opposite hillside. Ammo's getting low and the bullets keep coming. I climb through the muck and grunge of the jungle floor to a nearby friendly, he's hit but no time to mourn now. I pilfer through his gear and find what I needed, sweet sweet ammo, ~30 bullets left. I reload, and the hell begins anew.","May 18, 2015","true","380.6"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","22","24","6","6"

It's got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over.\nEverytime you play will be a different experience, may it be your role, the difficulty, or the ai. It's all different every time.\nYou can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but it's not really game-breaking, it's just a moment you can laugh about.\nPlus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable, There's so much different changes you can do to the game, from changing your character's voice or face, up to making a whole addon and even more.\nIm not gonna say the game's completely perfect though.\nThe main problem may be the community, but from time to time you'll not meet with that problem;\nsome people will be nice to you and help you if you're a newbie to the game, and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare, as people dont appreciate them on the servers.\nThe gameplay;\nNow that is one hard question to answer.\nThe gameplay mostly matters about you, and the gamemode, how you want to play, will still be valid, but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or you'll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while he's only using a simple rifle with no scope.\nAs you would guess, another problem is the AI, sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes it's just the best AI you can find in a game.\nnow, im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as it's better to find out yourselves, but i'll just say that King Of The Hill, Wasteland(mostly fun with friends), and Zeus(you'll be most likely to spend days on this one) are the ones i recommend.\nThe community:\nThe community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game and/or experience. I'm not gonna say much about it except this but there's alot you can say about the community.\nThe Engine:\nthis game requires a beefy pc(currently at its state) but the engine is brilliant, It can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard CPU usage. The engine is mostly dependant rather more on the RAM than the CPU, i recommend atleast 6-12 RAM for this game if you're gonna play it alot.\n\nOverall:\nThe game's worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it, altough you will find mostly funny moments and non-serious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable. Certain people refer to this as a "Walking Simulator" but the point is that ArmA III is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms, you WILL find yourself walking and running alot to objectives, but that's how it is in real life too. The game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming. You can find alot to do in this like commanding AI and/or players, which is always hard at the start, and participating in large assaults on towns such as Kavala.\nIn my opinion, ArmA III is worth a shot.\n\n-Lankercool, Commander and Soldier, also regular Zeus player in the ArmA III Community.","July 18, 2014","true","435.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","3"

However, of all the iterations, Arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most. These aren't big changes, but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth.\n\nGraphically, it's convincing. It isn't always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel ALIVE. You can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on (Yup, it is a real place).\n\nIf you don't know anything about this game, the best word to sum it up with would be 'realistic'. You are a single soldier in a large, real-time conflict. You can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go. Expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead. Don't expect to behave like Rambo and to survive.\n\nI wouldn't consider this game 'complete' just yet- for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing, the main campaign is only 1/3 released. That being said, it's the community that really supports this game. Mods like Dayz show how flexible and open-ended the game can be. Really, Arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support, letting the community come up with the best content.\n\nPersonally, I haven't spent much time in the large-scale multiplayer side of things. I prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable. Expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own. I've also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island. Yup, on my own, with no NPCs or other players. I love the sights and sounds. I love exploring over the next mountain, or lounging about on a beach, soaking up the digital rays. I don't expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game- the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and I chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment I could extract from it.\n\nThe community is what makes this product what it is. They're serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come. You'll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and team-worthy fashion and thanks to the Steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer.\n\nBuying this game is an investment. The developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a must-have title, though it could take several years to reach that stage. Don't expect gameplay that's easy to jump in to, nor should you expect a fun standalone experience. But this game is no COD. By default it's not a mainstream game, but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless.","December 13, 2013","true","61.9"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trenchninja/recommended/107410/","trenchninja","TrenchNinja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trenchninja/","94 products in account","THE GOOD\n--------------------\nThis game is actually the 4th installment of the Arma series and I've been playing since the start.  The developers of this game have taken a rare approach to updating their game.  They keep the mechanics and feel of the game pretty much the same while making the graphics shine by just updating their custom Real Virtuality engine rather than replacing it, as well as adding new campaigns, missions, vehicles, weapons, and game modes.\n\nThe part where this game REALLY shines, however, is the community driven mods.  The game was built for modding and the developers have done everything in their power to make it easy for the community to make ANYTHING they want out of this game.  It may look like a hardcore military simulator from the store page, but I've seen games in this series turned into a civil war sims, "grand theft auto" like games (Arma Life), hardcore zombie games (DayZ), a StarGate tribute which had working, animated stargates and all your favorite characters from the show, ww2 sims (Invasion 1944), Jurassic Park tributes, and so much more.\n\nThese mods take a lot of work to create, sure, but there are also things you can do very easily without any knowledge of 3d editing or texturing.  Simply open the mission editor on the map that you like best and place a few soldiers down.  Now add some waypoints for them to attack a town.  Add some soldiers inside the town.  That's it!  If you make yourself a civilian character in the town you can watch a fantastic battle ensue between the two groups of soldiers, using proper flanking maneuvers and yelling back and forth to one another when they see an enemy.  This all would take at most about 2 minutes in the editor to have a full battle going on.  Want to do more?  Read the plethora of information out there on advanced editing and scripting in the game and before you know it you'll have the ability to make suicide bombers, "battle busses" (essentially a civilian bus with artillery and machine guns on top of it), nuclear bombs, and really ANYTHING you can imagine.  If you have any issues, someone will be willing to help you out either on reddit.com/r/armadev or on the official Bohemia Interactive forums.\n\nI hope you'll choose to join me on my favorite game and play some cool missions together that you or I just freshly made in the editor!  Even if you don't like making your own content, there are fun mods already out there such as the popular Battle Royale mod where you're forced to parachute out of a crashing plane with 28 or so of your fellow players and fight to the death while scavenging for the best gear.  Just look around and you'll find endless entertainment in this game!\n\n\nTHE BAD\n---------------\nI mentioned that the engine is updated with each iteration instead of replaced.  This does sometimes mean that glitches that were in the first couple games reappear in later games, but with the increased popularity of the series lately the devs have been doing their best to squash all those nasty bugs.  Another warning I would give would-be buyers is that the game is very demanding for your PC.  People who have rigs that they THINK are powerful because they can play Battlefield 4 at full settings without much frame drop are in for a nasty surprise: Arma 3 truly stresses your hardware and the devs are still working on optimizations to take full advantage of your hardware.  At the moment it seems like most people are having a smooth experience but some peoples' hardware, even when pretty impressive, just doesn't get along with the game that well at the moment.","June 23, 2014","true","554.9"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verySimple/recommended/107410/","verySimple","Apoll0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verySimple/","135 products in account","Very Addictive\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an in-depth military sandbox shooter. This game does a great job overall of satisfying the thirst for using tactics in combat. Before I get any farther into this review, I would like to point out that this game is nothing like COD or Battlefield. That doesn't necessarily mean it can't be fast paced, but the learning curve for this game can be kind of deep for some. I'm going to focus primarily on general gameplay, rather than go in-depth with mods.\n\nOverall Gameplay 9/10\nThis game is often called a walking simulator, however this game is so much more than that. Once you play long enough, you just look at walking as another method of travel. You start weighing your options as you come into contact with objectives/other players.  Do you want to risk driving to a location, only to get blown up by AT (anti-tank) or would you rather take the longer, but mostly safer method of walking. Once you get yourself in this mindset you really stop caring about how much you have to walk. That being said you can see how decisions can ultimately lead to success or failure. This is perhaps one of favorite things about this game. Want to stealthily insert from the sea SEAL style? Would you rather set up on a hill 1.5km away and pick off the enemy? Or would you rather roll with a battalion of tanks and annihilate everything in your path. The decision is ultimately yours.  You may find that a lot of this isn't in the vanilla game, but thankfully the modding community has done an amazing job shaping this game into so much more.\n\nCombat 8/10:\nCombat is great, but it has its problems (some very frustrating problems at that). PvP combat is always amazing and most of the time it comes down to who has the better tactics. However... The AI is ridiculous. It has gotten better overtime, but the AI is completely unpredictable. Sometimes you can drive up to them and kill all of them without them even getting a shot off, or you can be 1km off sitting on a hill with your sniper and start picking them off, only to be obliterated by them with ridiculous aim. Don't let that ruin your experience though. Some of my favorite moments in this game have to do with the AI doing something completely hilarious (EX: taking you on a tour of a town in a small hatchback for no apparent reason).\n\nMechanics 9/10:\nfalls 2 feet to the ground, dies... To be fair combat mechanics in Arma 3 are much better IMO than that of previous Arma titles. Bullet penetration is verrryyyy well done. It can easily give you an advantage especially if you have a weapon like the .50 cal Lynx that can kill enemies in armored vehicles. Bullet spread/drop seems realistic enough. If your one of those people like me who wanted sniper mechanics to be real you'll be mostly dissappointed, but ranging and bullet drop can be compensate a little. There are lots of options for movement and stances (they can actually benefit you greatly in combat). I HIGHLY recommend staying away from rocks. I have no idea why, but rocks can instakill/trap you if your not careful. Not all rocks are like this, mostly just large ones... stay away...\n\nVisuals 9/10:\nWhen first playing this game on ultra it can be breath taking. For the full experience I would highly suggest wearing some nice headphones and turn up the volume. The immersion is very enjoyable. If you can't run the game on ultra dont feel left out. It still looks great, and can often times give you an unfair advantage over players online (being able to see through foilage/fog).\n\nThere's probably a lot I could add to this review, but a lot of the enjoyment comes from mods. There are too many good ones to list.\n\nI may sound a little biased because I love this game so much, but if the above that I described sounds remotely like something your interested in then I highly recommend it.","June 26, 2014","true","743.8"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

With over 900 hours of ArmA and no belief in myself, I just drove those soldiers who trusted me into hell, unarmed, unexpected and unaware. Surprisingly, I was sucessful. All I did was just, care about them as people and not just military assets; I told them to respect and be friendly to each other, to cooperate. Over and over. I watched over them as if they were my sons, making sure they had all they needed, making them check to be better safe than sorry, over and over. And I did this with everyone I came across. I went from leading just 4 men to even leading up to 20 people. All I told them to do was just to be respectful, to work as a team, not to only think individually but as a group, collective; think of what you may need and what your friends or teammates may also need. Everyone told me I couldn't lead, and that I could even lead less as a medic and I wanted to prove them all wrong, and so I did. Carried all my supplies, plus ammo and AT munitions for our units. Sometimes I'd fail, and I'd never know whether it was our mission, our team, or my leading - but I kept going on. Today I just lead a very small team of just 8 men into what I never thought I would've ran into.\nIt was like any other day I logged in; got a squad formed up as I always do, my sweet "Echo 1-1" led by myself, Corsacfox. I told them what I told everyone and we set sail. Our Mohawk pilot had to de-route as the LZ wasn't the best and I had to re-build my entire plan out of scratch. I debriefed everyone, made a perimeter on disembark and we just took down the enemy communications (radio tower). After that, a second target went on but we suddenly got ambushed from all directions; our team was struggling to survive and I got up to the point I asked command for help. Command sent Foxtrot to help us; but Foxtrot didn't do as told and nearly betrayed us, going on their own. I fought aside my men who all had trust and belief in me; they simply didn't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about Foxtrot.\nWe fought and fought, moved and moved as we all worked together - it wasn't just me being the leader, it was everyone working together and me making the final order to follow, and even that could be readjusted to better ideas proposed by my units. Foxtrot even nearly killed us with artillery as they wanted to take the risk, their leader died and ditched them; and so they fell one by one. My squad stood together, those who carried ammo for the ATs saved the day as we took down many enemy armored vehicles; and command/base was a disaster. I just kept going and going, and we ran out of missiles. A friendly CAS that I requested gave us support; and after a VERY LONG fight; we finally succeeded; we took down the artillery, recovered the HQ and took back the territory. We were all happy, celebrating; our Exfiltration point was designated as a mass evac. Our first half of the squad got in a Mohawk and flew away back to base with Delta, that hadn't helped us either and were mostly dead.\nThe second helicopter came, a blachawk; and as we were returning to base a CAS took us down; we had to parachute in an emergency and we were dropped off in the middle of the desert, about 5km away from Base. I made a risk run through complete wasteland to get to the helicopter and retrieve all the supplies and my backpack back; and I helped the few that were left of my team back up. We ran until there were 2km away from base, and a helicopter found us - it finally took us to base, safely. The enemy really wanted to take down Echo. We had a really nice story, some funny jokes you'd find in the military, and one of the best experiences I've ever had in any game. We were all complete strangers to each other, and yet everyone worked so well together, regardless of their differences and roles. I returned to base with an experience that brought me so much happiness and so much of a different perspective of life, taking the initiative and being confident feeling that I can not even explain. It's the best when people work together, and even if it is through a game, it can help you out a lot. I am very glad of what I did, and I learned many things from previous Squad Leaders when I was one of their soldiers, and so did I with my personal experiences as one. It taught me many things for the game, and many things for my life outside of the ArmA universe.\nI very much thanks everyone who has ever been or will be part of my squad in future experiences, and I salute everyone who formed part of "Echo 1-1".\n\n19/10/2015 - EDIT N°1\nArmA III, after having played for almost 2 years now; I must admit that my view on it hasn't changed. Bohemia Interactive may not have the best past ever - but I believe this game is simply a masterpiece. It's development still continues as of the day of today; and it really does deliver all that it promises. It's given me many hours of entertainment, and going. Endless matches and experiences that made me entertained, scared, emotioned, and that made me laugh a lot. There's lots of modding, there's lots of gamemodes and missions - maybe the game was meant for military simulation, but it really has no boundaries. All you need is being able to run it, and maybe some friend(s), it won't dissapoint.\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal review\nArmA III\nArmA III is like chess. Out of all the table games, ArmA is the most sofisticated and "Fancy" war game there is. I've had over 2,000 hours of Battlefield, and of Call of Duty. Few hours in Insurgency and many other games. But ArmA, I've never heard of ArmA III until one of my friends told me about it, in ArmA, the systems are extremely advanced, the system is so realistic that it gets up to a point in which it turns plain annoying. You break your leg, you can't breath, you fall, you trip, you die, you drown, everything happens in this game. Theres everything that a war game needs to have. This is not even a war game, it's a war simulator which makes it even better. The campaign is hours of fun and entertainment, and if you dare, you can even learn how to code in ArmA and make your own missions, making missions to be rated, for your own fun, to screw around. You can do anything you could imagine in few hours, and those few hours will grant you limitless fun, hours and hours of gameplay. Hours and hours of designing and meeting new people. Hours and hours of COOP, PVP, TDM, AVA, and everything that a war simulator needs. Cars, tanks, planes, boats, submarines, civilian cars, trucks, convoys, war helicopter, transport, ambulances. Huge maps, huge buildings, huge cities, beautiful physics and beautiful enviroments. The map is huge and it would probably take you hours to go across it, both Stratis and Altis. I haven't played this game for a "really" long time, but, with the very few hours I played, I can pretty much say that it's way better than anything else I've ever tried. Bohemia Interactive might not be the best company out there, but still, they made this one beautiful game that no other company have, or ever will, do better. You'll need a team, you'll need to cooperate, and think about what cards to play while being in the front of the battle, you'll need to set up your equipment and gear, and know, know how to use it, and how to react to all possible situations. This game has no boundaries, and I have great expectations for it, I am waiting for it to grow even more, and for it, to be even, more enjoyable. This game, this game is unique.\n\nThis is the best game I've ever played.","July 27, 2014","true","374.4"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

The Possibilities are endless for this game because of the unlimited modding capabilities Bohemia has provided us with, creating missions for your friends and you to enjoy is awesome, although the mission editor is a bit hard to use at first... This game is for people of all gaming backgrounds as it provides intense infantry game play, explosive vehicle game play and the tactical commands (that know one knows how to use). The use of the third and first person views offer an increased FOV and different play style. To add also the HUD and the menus are very easy to navigate and are user friendly.\n\nNegative\nThe game by design is full of glitches that can be annoying and frustrating, the vehicles don't handle as well as you would think with your mouse and keyboard (depends what you think) Also if you have a less than good Computer then you may have a hard time running this game above 20 fps.\n\nOver All\nI Strongly recommend getting this game to anyone that has a good PC and enjoys the likes of battlefield and maybe Call of Duty and anyone that has previously owned a AmrA Game\n\nHope this review has been useful and meaningful","November 18, 2014","true","504.2"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"

Other mods can be downloaded from Armaholic.com)\n+Ability to make your own scenarios/mods\n+No running and gunning- tactics and planning are the only way to win\n+Huge learning curve keeps kids away (this is a very good thing)\n+Looks great, even if the framerate is on the low side. I get 30 FPS playing KOTH on an i5-2500k with 12GB RAM and a GTX 560. Not a beast of a computer, but it has no problem running this game.\n+Ability to play in third-person or first-person views.\n\nCons:\n-Can't drag a fallen team member to safety before reviving (this is a big difference from Arma 2)\n-Updates can mess with mods\n-The vanilla game doesn't have a huge selection of uniforms/guns (this can be easily fixed though with mods, so it's no big deal; however, some servers don't support mods which makes the selection useless)\n-Still expensive. You need the DLC, as many servers require it.\n\nIn summary, buy this game if you want a mature shooter that values tactics and punishes a lack of teamwork. This isn't a twitch shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield; it is a game that tries to be as realistic as possible and entirely succeeds, in my opinion (note: I have nothing against COD or BF).\n\nIt is worth the money.\n\n100/100","May 15","true","218.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordercoyote/recommended/107410/","bordercoyote","Eli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordercoyote/","106 products in account","Game requires several gigabytes of modding to be playable. Gun sway is obnoxious, optical glare is like looking through an instagram beer glass and although in real life soldiers can carry up to 40kg in a firefight, the characters lose stamina and said gun sway worsens to musket-levels of pinpoint accuracy. Not to mention there is actually no stamina bar or notification, you simply hear him moan incessently.\n\nThe game is expensive and some of the vehicles and equipment in the game is classed as separate DLC's which you need to buy to pilot or use. Despite the hefty price of Arma 3, you can expect the ratio price of the DLC's to be roughly 20 percent of Arma 3's original cost. The helicopter DLC, for instance, contains only two helicopters and a "realism" mode which worsens your ability to fly for your viewing pleasure. They, the creators of a military simulator, also randomly brought in a DLC that lets you race around in a go-kart. No, I don't know why either.\n\nYou can indeed exchange attachments on weapons except bipods and front-grips - no one really knows why they discriminated. Not to mention said bipods serve absolutely no purpose and without a mod you cannot deploy your weapon on any environment be it bipod, edge of a window or bonnet of a car.\n\nThe body armour does indeed seem to affect your lethality but again there is no indication anywhere what is more armoured and what is less armoured., what weighs more, what weighs less.\n\nMany of the "futuristic" weapons on Arma 3 are actually cancelled weapons systems deemed inferior in real life (AH-99 Blackfoot) or don't actually exist (such as T-100 Varsuk) making the game incredibly peculiar.\n\nIt's also extremely difficult to host a server for your friends to play and will require third-party software such as a server host plus hamachi or equivelant software. The experience is stunningly frustrating and can easily consume three hours of your time learning the game's scripting language simply to run the game or create a respawn point. Queue irritating slurring youtube tutorials by semi-conscious d1ckh3ads who can't get to the fuc king point.\n\nBuildings are only superficially destructible, they won't crumble but they will undergo scripted morphing turning magically into ruins.Tanks can also be defeated by a farmer's three foot stonewall. Yes. And collisions cause the game physics to dart you away hundreds of metres even in a tank sometimes.\n\nOverrall I would rate this game as being lower than the temperature of outer space. Arma 2 including its DLC'S have major flaws but the replayability is immense and covers actual modern weapons. And whilst Arma 3 experienced the longest most buggy alpha-staging in Earth's entire gaming history, Bohemia's employees were arrested for espionage because they thought it would be smart to send two work employees on tourist visas for a little bromance "coincidently" where they were basing Altis on and started taking pictures of actual military bases there. What the fu ck were they thinking?\n\nRidiculous, ludicrous. Don't buy this game. The Iranian soldiers also look like bugmen or bumble-bees.","November 22, 2014","false","348.8"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","38","57","5","1"

Of course, a huge delegation of Party leaders and reporters is present, just like during any other event of this sort. So, as he walks to his plane, he becomes surrounded by reporters and they ask him, "What have you liked the most about Soviet Union?".\n— You have great children, they're so playful, happy and optimistic about their future.\n— Awesome! - reporters reply - and have you liked anything else?\n— You have great children.\n— Yeah, we love our children too, but what about our cars and TVs and fridges and roads and other things?\n— You have great children - the representative replies - but everything you make with your hands is terribly bad.\nSo, Arma series has a really great community.

Well firstly, this isn't a game...\n\nAbout me:  Marine Corps veteran.  Have been playing video games since 1989.  Love military simulation ‘games’.\n\nPROS:\nBeautiful graphics.  Check out my screenshots.\nSandbox.\nValue.\nModing community.  The only real reason I am still playing, and they are doing it for free, and do a better job than the company I paid for this game.\n\nCONS:\nBUGS/GLITCHES/CRASHES NIGHTLY!!!\nIn the editor, never merge sp missions.  They will never work.\nGraphics don't mean much.  Look at Minecraft, ROBLOX....\nSandbox don't mean much when the tools you are given to enjoy it don't work, i.e. the 'mission' editor.\nHaving to spend 50 hours of scripting and mission making in order to enjoy an hour of carnage.\nSound.  Horribly done.\nBallistics unreal.  Yes I have actually been shot at and shot back and yes this game is NOT realistic!!!\nUnit command and control blows hard!!!  The absolute worst.\nAI is the worst I have ever seen.  They put zero effort into it.\nMultiplayer is a disaster.\nHaving to learn a computer language to do what Bohemian should be doing.\nCampaign can't compare to BF, or MoH etc.  Why even try to compete with those????\nCompletely unrealistic and immature approach to war... I honestly think these guys are pacifists…\n\n\nSo why have I been playing it for over 20 hours a week???\n\nFirstly, there is nothing else out there.  BI actually may wake up one day and give us the tools to make this game epic.  Or at least create a tool for us guys who HATE scripting!!!!  Make it 100% GUI.  Look at the F-18 mod.  Amazing!!!!!!! Easy to use, smooth and fast.  Nothing like the ‘mission’ editor we are forced to use.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is not a video game.  It is a watered down military "TRAINING SIMULATOR"\n\n\nAt that training simulator is Virtual Battlefield 2!\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBS2\n\nYes.  We have been falsely advertised to for years.  Aside from the graphics, there is has been zero upgrade to the basic mechanics of Operation Flashpoint, AKA Arma, Arma 2, and Arma 3.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, I can only guess that BI makes most of its money from VB2, not the ‘games’.  There focus is on the guy who buys the software the military uses and the guy who builds the training blocks, scripting each training evolution for the unique team experience.  The guys who use VB2 have not need to script, just the one guy lucky enough to play with VB2 all day.\n\nSo when you look at why this game is terrible it makes sense.  The AI sucks because VB2 isn’t designed to be against an AI opponent.  The unit training plays against a game master or Zeus if you will.  Which leaves guys like me who want to play a GAME left in the dust.\n\nSolo missions and campaign suck because VB2 is only used for short training periods not a full mission or campaign.\n\nI have been playing military simulator for far longer than I care to think.  And this isn’t one.  It has no brain to even compare to the legendary Sims of the past.  M1 Tank Platoon 2, GUNSHIP, Falcon 3.0.\n\nThe mission editor is not user friendly because there is a guy in some cubicle somewhere in some military unit learning code to script the training missions.  Hench why make it easy, when you can charge some government huge amounts of cash to train an administrator.  Sounds like Microsoft!!!\n\nSo, this is why ARMA in all of its buggy existence is not a game.  It was never meant to be a game.  It was meant to sell to a group of Guiney pigs and use them to help make VB2 better.\n\nSo enjoy making all of those mods and scripting code, while BI makes a killing off all of your hard free work!!!","October 6, 2014","false","314.6"," 174 of 303 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","174","303","4","13"

The gameplay is not your typical shooter as it incorporates strategic elements and doesn't play like a traditional FPS. Console gamers will have no issues with this game's controls even as their first shooter on a PC.\n\nArma has a slight learning curve, it may be a little confusing at first until you learn how things work and learn to take cover. Arma has a lot of little details to gameplay that you can improve upon to give yourself and edge such as the stance adjustment controls. But they aren't vital for successful gameplay. Arma is only as complex as you want it to be. Even though it is a simulation game, it feels much more natural to play than other simulations.\n\nSingleplayer - The story is actually pretty good, some of the scenarios definitely have a challenging OP:Flashpoint feel to it which I'm a fan of. It's divided into 3 episodes with their own chapters, each episode giving a new perspective to the conflict and upping the scales of battle. There's also a Bootcamp mini-campaign which will help new players a lot.\n\nMultiplayer and Community - Arma is a great game to play alone, it's even better together. There's lots of public servers with a variety of gamemodes that you can just jump into. Lots of awesome custom scenarios too such as the Co-Op scenario Invade and Annex, as well as the PvP scenarios such as KoTH and Wasteland. But the best experience is playing with an organized group. There are casual co-op groups, PvP clans as well as hardcore roleplaying "milsim units". You can feel around for what's right for you.\n\nEditor - Arma has always had a very powerful Mission Editor tool and has open support for custom scripts. This alone is all we needed to make missions. Then BI gave us Zeus - an in-game editor, look up some videos - this alone will entertain you for hours by yourself. Now BI has also promised a 3D Mission Editor to cover even finer details.\n\nMods - The game is advertised as a military simulator and it does a great job of that just as-is. But really it's whatever you want it to be and you can deepen the simulation aspects with user content. The community is actively pumping out amazing mods for this game and BI has always been highly supportive of community content (even to the point of cash giveaways from the Make Arma Not War competition). If you can think of something cool to add to Arma, it's probably already got a download link.\n\nCriticism - Although the game engine gets some flak for being "unoptimized" (BI has been improving on the game's performance significantly) when you think about it, how many game engines have this kind of attention to detail in such a wide scope of gameplay? You can be infantry (even fight underwater with certain assault rifles), skydive/HALO jump, pilot a transport chopper, fly a jet, drive a tank, use artillery, anything. Not to mention the detail of the environment even to the starmap. What other game can you think of tracks the temperature the ground depending on time of day and when last it rained therefore affecting your thermal optics? Yea, thought so.\n\nDLC - Arma 3's DLC is optional, and you can just get modded content which are not affected. Even if you don't buy the DLCs you'll get the improvements to the game and still be able to play with anyone who has/doesn't have DLC. Just wanted to clear up the myths of Arma 3's DLC.\n\nI've been playing since the Alpha/Beta with 1,000+ online hrs and I'm still not bored. Arma 3 and Arma overall as a series has come a long way and has improved tremendously and BI listens and improves from community feedback. Arma games have a long lifespan and there are a lot of people just buying it now. It's been almost 2 years since the Alpha was released, and expect Arma 3 to be active for at least another 3-5 years, probably more. Think about it, why buy a bunch of other games when Arma can be all of them for one price? Definitely the most well-spent money I've ever spent on a game for the enjoyment I've gotten so far and will continue to have. No doubt about it. I'm glad I could support such an awesome studio, keep up the great work BI.","February 5, 2015","true","480.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","6"

They have started to roll out the campaign, finally after a few months after realese. What helped Arma II was the modding scene and even just the mission files for multiplayer which will further improve the life of this game, as this seems to be the direction that Arma III is going and that for one thing is excellent. This could spur some very interesting gameplay and I am hoping it would catch on with groups such as ShacTac or LSG just like in Arma II. Graphicly the game has improved alot from its predecessor, implimenting modern lighting and just looking far superior which may not matter for most people but it is a nice addition for the game.\n\nNow for the downfall. Not everyone has this but many people do. The game has severe problems with performance and not knowing how to utilise CPU and GPU properly. (http://i.imgur.com/pkwvj34h.jpg http://i.imgur.com/RQog0QF.jpg) These two screenshots show the utilisation of the game and it is quite clearly awful. Playing the game at 10-25 FPS is not possible. You are at hinderance when playing with this sort of preformance. The BiS developers seem like they are trying to avoid this problem, moving threads to less noticable places is one of the ways basically just outright trying to get rid of the people complaining. This feels like bad practice for the company acting this way towards their paying customers.\n\nWhen it comes to problems such as this they seem to respond very badly. A similar problem a while ago caused them to reply and they said it is "too hard and we are not willing" (SOURCE:http://steamcommunity.com/app/107410/discussions/0/864961722019263834/ ). Really I do not think they should be developing games if things are going to be to hard for them. They are letting down customers and it is a real big shame because this game is really promising.\n\nFinally\nPROS:\nExcellent Multi-Roll Military Sim\nBeautiful Graphics IMO\nWay Smoother than Arma II ex. shooting,aiming\nAltis and Stratis being very versitile and can make for interesting gameplay\nImproved physics with bullets and vehicles\nThe ragdolls!\n\nCONS:\nSevere performance issues and utilisation\nThe sound assets could be better (That is nothing mods cannot sort)\nGame feels incomplete having only a select few vehicles/weapons\nThe campaign only just being rolled out again feeling incomplete\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n**Edit\nSo, I upgraded my PC and have been playing a feck ton of Arma recently. The sad thing is though my FPS never stays above 60fps and I still sometimes even drop below 30fps with such a good PC. It is really, really depressing that this game is so awfully optimised. When I jumping in the editor and Get 60+fps I see what the game could be. They have also now finished the campaign and on the plus side JSRS studios are developing a new version of JSRS. That is going to be a must have mod in Arma III for me.\n\nI am still going to leave this unrecommended on the fact that it does not even seem to have changed despite spending alot of money on a new PC and even buying a watercooler for the CPU so I could overclock it, just to find out that I still get bad FPS. I am playing the game yes. I am also enjoying the game but underlying all of that is still disappointment. I guess if you like Arma II and you think your PC would be up to it, go for it. Otherwise don't bother.\n\nAgain, thanks for reading!","November 27, 2013","false","492.0"," 380 of 679 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","380","679","0","70"

(Obsolete)\nIn 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 20 FPS, but the players will teleport all the time, shoot before you see ! Also in 2035, every soldier is the fattest America, Greece, or Iran has to offer and can run for 2 meters provided you are not carrying anything heavy, like a weapon.\nIn 2035, players will be so stupid that you will want to kill them all, even your teammates, because they will join the strongest teams.\nIn 2035, AA radars are the most useless stuff ever created, only usefull for single targets, and on the ground, what happened to the Operation Flashpoint scanner ?\nIn 2035 you will finally be able to go underwater, too bad there is nothing to do there.\nand finally: in 2035, you can forget about usefull vehicles, here MRAPS do not have AT launchers, and AA tanks have a ridiculously short range, bad accuracy, useless radar, and only 4 rockets which MAY allow you to shoot down one helicopter hovering and not using countermeasures.\n\nIn short: the future SUCKS.\n\nfor the record I had 976 hours of play time on arma 3 at the time I wrote this (now 1200-ish). This number is still bound to increment, but I can not recommend the game for anyone until they fix their engine, and the future.\n\nEdit: I will be nice for once: The ballistic system is a nice addition to Arma. sorry I ran out of nice things to say.\nYet another edit: If modding the game was not such a pain in the ♥♥♥, and if Bohemia did not RELY on modders to make their game for them, I would probably recommend it. Of course that means modding it is a pain in the ♥♥♥ (unless you are creating everything from scratch, which means you can make everything and as such should not bother with this engine)  and that I do not recommend it.\n\nA word for JPS2004308 who commented this rant:\nHow does that apply to what I said ?\nAlso I would very much like to point out to everyone here that you copied / pasted your comment to all negative reviews of arma 3.","May 11, 2015","false","324.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","1"

I kiss COD, Halo, and Battlefield goodbye. this is Arma. having no same exact mapped mission. with no same exact scenario, with two Gigantic islands, and alot to explore, from controls, to different ways to approach things, everything is so much more realistic to any other first person shooter, for ground gameplay to taking to the skies in an A-10 or Huey attack helo. has so much more to offer. adding underwater combat, volumetric simulation, and Authentic FLIR imaging. gives a experience worth living for, takes the player right into battle at the comfort and warmth of you'r home.\n\nthe community is gigantic giving huge amounts of content the community creates for a quick subscribe and free download. giving multiplayer a boost to a stunning 100 player scenarios. goodbye 64 player servers.\nand yes. the Arma 3 community has quite a bit to offer.\n\nOPS on ground are stunning. having that adreniline rush of bullets whizzing past you or the curiosity to find where you're getting shot at from. Arma 3 supports a simulated person. not a gun with a hitbox, having 15 different ways to get out of sight. and to return the fire. the ways to call support and the ways to provide it are incredible. there are also many species of wildlife you can run into such as, goats, snakes, bunnies, dragonflies, and butterflies, Arma 3 completely excels on ground ops.\n\nOPS in air arent DCS world realistic, but are still realistic to its point. thanks to volumetric clouds, volumetric fog, and randomized weather chages gives Air OPS a huge advantage and disadvantage in different situations, different vehicles to take flight in means different ways to support squad and teammates in the battlefield. the wildlife here is birds. but flying is fun, yet can be very dangerous, wear you're seatbelts!\n\nOPS in water such as in boats or even diving are both very fun, might as well veetoh COD:GHOSTS fish A.I. a huge veriety of killable wildlife such as eels, fish, seaturtles, and sharks. also with the many different passenger and assult boats. having that ability to choose what kind of vehicle you want can give you the upper hand.\n\nOPS in armor such as tanks, imidiately makes you feel like a badass, rolling through with an M1-Abrahms platformed tank, makes you feel the most powerful thing on the battlefeild, then you have things like a pickup truck with a 50. BMG HMG that seemed good but you got blown up. alot of things have the upper and lower hand, as said many times depending on the situation, but before i let you go, try not to hit the bunnies, what did they do to you...?\n\nArma 3 has definately alot to look forward to in the up coming years, i hope this review was helpful, and at the same time confirms you to join the Arma 3 community. im not saying too much of everything, so you the reader has to play the game to find out more\n\nbut remember.\n\nMAKE ARMA NOT WAR!!!","September 2, 2015","true","685.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","6"

Now that its on general release I'm totally wrapped by it. I've already played around 250 hours and just can't get enough of it. There's 114 pages of custom made missions available for free via Steam and the Armaholic web site,( singleplayer, coop and multiplayer missions):\n\n\nhttp://www.armaholic.com/\n\n\nMost that I've played have been excellent. The in game editor enables you to create missions fairly easily with little experience.\n\nThe whole package is well worth full price. There's more big updates coming soon adding to the campaign mode..\n\nThe only downside I've found is the lack of an armoury. All previous ArmA games have included an armoury, where you are able to try out all weapons and vehicles, plus play as any character in game (including animals)\n\nThe game has amazing graphics, an open world stretching for many kilometers in all directions and smooth gameplay; all of which make ArmA a pleasure to play.\n\nIMO far better than any other shooter around (incluing Battlefield 4,Call of Duty & Op Flashpoint) . (Love Battlefied and the Op Flashpoint games as well)\n\n\n\nedit -  April 13th 2015:\n\nThe game has come a long way since I wrote  my review, though  due to a massive back log of unplayed games that I own, I've not had much opportunity to play the game recently.  That said, the developers have added a lot more  to the  game since  last   played it, such as the single player campaign, plus of course there are many more  missions  and modifications  added since I mentioned it previously; in fact far more than i'll ever be able to get through.","November 18, 2013","true","459.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kebabremover/recommended/107410/","kebabremover","Cap'n Awoo!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kebabremover/","126 products in account","This game had a whole lot of potential based on the early screenshots, but then Bohemia squandered it when they completely changed everything about it. You can find screenshots jam packed with weapons, attachments, camos, characters, and factions that just do not exist in the game solely because Bohemia wanted to go another course halfway through development.\n\nThat might have been an accpetable option, except Bohemia didn't fully commit. Because of this, a lot of the game is just copy-pasted nonsesne. Almost all vehicles use the same HMGs, GMGs, and auto-cannons with the only difference being the hull of the vehicle. All static weapons such as the mortar, GPMG, and anti-tank/anti-air missile launcher are the same in different camos for the different factions. There's maybe a total of 15 unique weapons in the game, all of which are divided into classes and inside these classes there is no variety. An example of this is the MX and Katiba. These each have their respective variants in the CQB, regular, grenadier, and DMR roles, but each one of them is the exact same. They have the same ballistics, same damage, same recoil, same magazine capacity (even though the MX has a much longer, thicker mag than the Katiba,) and hell, even the same round!\n\nTake a look back at ArmA II, you'll notice that each faction has their own ups and downs as far as weapons and vehicles go, but in ArmA III everything feels the exact same and in MANY cases it IS the exact same. They couldn't add a different auto-cannon for each faction, but they sure could add six different fedoras and civilian outfits for you to wear!\n\nAnother moronic decision on the part of the devs was to place the game in the future WITHOUT actually adding any futuristic content. Any and all futuristic content was scrapped early on in the development process and then they started adding things that "look futuristic." The Merkava replaces the M1A2 Abrams tank in the least sensible move since Jimmy Carter running for a second term, the Bradley is replaced by the Namer, another Israeli tank, and come to think of it, this entire game is a showcase for Israel. This doesn't make any sense at all in the current iteration of the game where it's spread out amongst all factions, but it made a lot of sense in the original story when Israel was annexed by CSAT and CSAT started using Israeli made weapons and vehicles to supplement their Soviet-made equipment from yester-year. This is a great example why they should've committed to the original story rather than stray away from the original path and create this jumbled mess of a game.\n\nWhen you get down to the core of it all, all that matters is the gameplay. Unfortunately, that is horrendous, too. The game feels like they watched Rambo on repeat for six weeks straight because instead of combat being fast paced and short lived like it was in in ArmA II, combat is now based on who is a bigger bullet sponge. Players can routinely take six or seven shots before dying, even two shots to the head sometimes does not kill! Full auto is now glorified and not using it is almost a sin because if you don't you're going to be the one in a body-bag. Seriously, they took a simulator game and turned it into Call of Duty.\n\nThe encumberance system is another horrible mess. Seriously, your character is not fit for military shape because he can't sprint for more than 20 seconds in full combat load without needing a five minute break, and good luck hitting anything once the enemy has fired a shot in the opposite direction, because your guy is apparently in his first firefight and is already reaching for his entrenching tool to dig all the way to China and is shaking harder than Michael J. Fox with a cold.\n\nAnother noticable feature of this game is how poorly optimized it is. Seriously, even with a good gaming rig your online experience will be riddled with framerate drops and, at times, outright freeze-framing.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the ArmA series, because what you will find is far and away from the usual experience.","January 19, 2015","false","452.8"," 53 of 89 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","53","89","9","10"

It wasn't in prevous part, and it's great experience, you finally have full control over your character. But it's not game for everyone, it's a simulator, so it's hard to get controls at the first time playing. + You can do briefing in many many hours, and fight overall will be like 5 minutes or shorter.

I hesitate to call it a game, but it really depends on your playstyle. You can go on Roleplay servers, or you can PVP. The usual hardcore users of this product however usually use it as a base for massive coop operations, including vehicle platoons, artillery support (manned and operated in a realistic manner by players) and infantry squads. You want to realistically call in a fire mission for the artillery? This is your game. You want to call in close air support for a strike on a sniper/tank/building? This is your game. You want to indulge yourself in close quarter combat with your squad? This is your game. You want to hunt down IEDs and the insurgents who placed them? This is your game.\n\nOk now, these massive coop operations are made possible and realistic by the modding community. This is a fact, the base game is (to the best of my knowledge) not ever used when it comes to any serious servers or communities.\nThe modding community supplies the realistic radio communications, the real word weapons, the medical simulation, better sounds, better graphics in some cases, better AI (!!!) and all kinds of maps, so YOUR platoon can deploy anywhere from Alaska to Zimbabwe. AND it brought you bipods (seriously Bohemia, how did it take you so long to implement freakin bipods in the game...)....\nThis modding community made the game more realistic and created the fanbase it has today. Arguably the most attention Arma got in years came from the Zombie mod (not a fan btw, but still).  And now Bohemia comes along and wants to charge you for DLC. Alright you might say, what is the DLC?\n\nThe DLC includes things as long range capable rifles and tools to be more accurate.\nIt also includes things like new helicopters and slingloading vehicles/objects.\n\nThese are argueably some of the main features for the marksmen and helicopter DLC respectivly.\nNow, these features where added by the modding community YEARS ago. In arma 2 already. For absolutely free. They still exist in Arma 3 too. I do not see the need for the publisher to charge this amount of money for features the community pretty much figured out on its own. I would rather donate that money to a beatiful website called ARMAHOLICS and to certain mod developers on there. And arma 3 is a triple A game with a triple A price. As others pointed out already: People who preordered, played in the alpha etc. paid MORE money than people who waited for the steamsales to kick in. I can get the whole game cheaper and including DLCs than the chaps who where loyal to bohemia and this franchise in the first place.... what the ♥♥♥♥ .... seriosuly. That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, even from a marketing perspective.\n\nHere is my advice: If you are looking for the real arma experience (large-scale coop, usually vs. AI with differing amounts of military realism) buy the base game. Then find a appropriate server or group to play with. They will teach you how to mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game and you will never need the lame DLCs.","June 18, 2015","false","617.4"," 46 of 77 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","46","77","0","2"

The game works for that. But, for people with expectations for this game, (for example, arma 2 fans) it is completely unacceptable. The game completely dwarfs all previous arma games in many aspects. The graphics and engine are much better. It has a great core, with great potential. But that, sadly, is all it has.\n\nThe game itself has to have been rushed. On the official release day, it was in the state of an alpha game, and still feels like a beta for most people. The game had an actual alpha and beta on steam, but from the player's point of view, not much changed between alpha and release day except for a few new assets and the main map being released. It never should have left the alpha, and the problem is that bohemia doesn't seem to have admitted to even themselves that their game came out unfinished. From release day, they have been treating it like a final product, with only a few small polishes and fixes needed. This is beyond the exact opposite of how it actually is. On release day, it was laughably broken. It had the most bugs I have ever seen in a game, and felt like a joke. Now, after 1.5 years, many obvious bugs have been ironed out. I can say that the very surface game experience is acceptable. The problem today is that while they fixed some of the basic gameplay issues, about 40% of the features feel unfinished, but that is coming from someone with 1000 hours of experience. As I said, the surface experience is acceptable, but if you REALLY start playing, you will notice inexcusable holes in the experience. Along with all of this, the game is set in 2035, so none of the objects in the game are real, and at best partially resemble real things. The NATO and AAF factions are okay, but the CSAT faction, the only opfor faction available, looks terrible. The CSAT people literally look like aliens, and I get depressed every time I see one of them. What was bohemia thinking? Why would you put space aliens in a military simulator, especially ARMA? Atleast put terrorists, or north koreans, or normal russians, but space aliens? This is very controversial, especially for a military simulator, in particular arma.\n\nCurrently, the helicopters DLC costs 15$. The game shipped with only a few helicopters, so it was good to hear that they were addressing this. It was sad to hear they were charging 15$ for something that should have been included with the game, but I could live with that. What really set me off is that for 15$ you get only TWO helicopters. Yes, 2 helicopters that you should already have for 15 dollars. With the arma 2 OA expansion, we literally got more assets than arma 3 will probably ever have for 20 dollars. Now we pay 15 dollars for 2 helicopters. Currently, from what I can see, Arma 3 is doomed. They are going to continue charging money for each baby step towards a finished game, and with that, only make a few baby steps, and then run off with the money. The only DLC remaining will be a DLC called marksmen which adds 7 weapons, all of which I've played with, and most of which look like laser guns, almost as bad as the CSAT faction. Bohemia also has a interesting DLC model which makes the DLC more like updates with certain assets you can't play with unless you buy the DLC. This will mean marksmen comes with an upgraded weapon system and 3 vests all of which everyone gets, but ingame the core DLC items are unusable without paying. There may also be an expansion way after the marksmen dlc comes out, but nothing has been confirmed about it.\n\nTLDR: Arma 3 is a dissapointment for real arma fans because holes in the general experience, not enough stuff and weird art style not appropriate for military simulators.","March 20, 2015","false","268.9"," 151 of 271 people (56%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","56","151","271","15","3"

But that playtime has been plagued by bugs, glitches, low FPS, and a constant feeling of "Why didn't they...?" in the back of my mind. I never got into ArmA 2 because of its FPS problems, netcode, clunky and unintuitive controls, and just bad game design. ArmA 3 has fixed NONE of these problems.\n\n- First off, the performance. The Real Virtuality engine is an engine from the ♥♥♥♥ing 18th century being held together with duct tape and ♥♥♥♥♥. Server performance still affects client performance. This is a joke. If the server gets overloaded, you are going to be looking at a framerate in the low 20s. This is why performance is so inconsistent.\n\n- The player controller is the same one from ArmA 2. This ♥♥♥♥ controller cannot play more than two animations at once, on the legs and the torso. Full body animations like switching weapons require the player to stop moving because of this. Again, this is a joke. Animations are also very stiff and crappy looking.\n\n- Same old bugs and glitches from ArmA 2 that were never fixed. You can lean into walls and see through them, much worse if you're using 3rd person. Grass pops in right in front of your eyes. Objects like rocks are incredibly glitchy and can randomly kill you. Vehicle physics are almost non-existent and you will explode from the smallest crash. VOIP is incredibly laggy and sounds like it's coming out of a 90s phone.\n\n- Game is supposed to use DX11 when in reality it still uses mostly DX9, one example is shadows. ArmA 3 still uses ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stencil shadows instead of soft shadows, even on max settings. Aside from that, visually the game is nothing special. It has nice sunsets and a decent draw distance but up close it's quite ugly. Low res textures are a problem.\n\n- The game is billed as a "military sandbox" by Bohemia and a "military simulation" by PC Gamer but ♥♥♥♥ing NOBODY plays it as one. 99% of servers are gamemodes like Wasteland, Epoch, and Altis Life; gamemodes more suited to Grand Theft Auto than a game with as much potential as ArmA 3. Worse still Bohemia has done nothing to prevent this aside from adding that useless End Game gamemode that nobody plays. I was lucky enough to find a server that plays the game as the combined arms game it's supposed to be, and I played a lot on that server, but the FPS was so bad (~25) that I eventually stopped playing.\n\n- Stemming from the issue above, tactical PvP just isn't a thing. There is some tactical PvE which I have enjoyed playing, but if you ever wanted to shoot at another player instead of those Terminator bots that can snipe you between the eyes from 2km away with a .45, you're out of luck.\n\n- 3rd person. Everyone uses it, or rather abuses it. It's impossible to get the drop on someone in CQC because he's looking at you from around the corner using 3rd person. "Don't play it", you might say. That's impossible, because I have never seen a public server with it disabled. "Don't use it", you might say. Again impossible, because that guy looking over the wall at me will shoot me when I come around the corner unless I use 3rd person to look over the wall too.\n\n- Updates are a farce. Game's been out for 2 years and only NOW we're getting bipods, really? The DLC is another joke, 30 euro for two helicopters and a couple of guns, wow Bohemia what a ♥♥♥♥ing deal.\n\n- "Never half-♥♥♥ two things. Whole-♥♥♥ one thing." - Ron Swanson. Driving physics are completely broken if you go anywhere that isn't a flat surface. Plane mechanics are pick-up-and-play. Guns sound like crap and basic stuff like keeping a round chambered doesn't happen. The only saving grace is the combined arms aspect, but alone they're terrible to play.\n\nI'm going to stop here because I could go on all day about how ♥♥♥♥ this game is and what it could have been if the devs cared at all. I never write long reviews, but how much I love the concept of this game and how awful the execution is made me. This game is NOT worth 50 euro, maybe 20 at best. The only good things here are the insanely huge maps and moddability of the game.\n\nThe only reason this game is popular is because there is no other game like it.","May 2, 2015","false","230.3"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","30","48","0","4"

I cut my teeth on the early Tom Clancy games, Rainbow 6 and Ghost Recon, so I was no stranger to the concept of a hard infantry sim.  I've followed Arma since its inception as Operation Flashpoint, and I have grown to love the series like no other.  There are portions of Arma 3 that are more boring than watching grass grow, as you sit in vehicles or tromp around on foot for endless minutes.  The real meat of the game though, lies in what can turn into thirty seconds to five minutes of pure chaos.  Firefights don't have the corridor of meat puppets that games like CoD or other mainstream shooters have to offer.  There are no meticulously rendered setpieces.  Instead, everything outside of radio chatter might as well be freeform.  You draw attention from a chopper while infiltrating a base, they radio out to a mechanized squad that sends an infantry fighting vehicle armed with a 40mm machinegun.  The ground churns around you and your own team as fire and shrapnel turn a stealth mission into a desperate fight for survival.  These are things that happen in this utterly unforgiving, but satisfying game.\n\nThis isn't a series for the squeamish, and this surely isn't a series where you expect instant health regeneration while you duck down out of the way from canned enemy fire.

If you're going to Arma looking to play the next Counterstrike or whatever, you're going to walk away disappointed.\n\nArma is more of a simulator than a casual shooter, and yes, there is Wasteland which is basically a worldwide deathmatch sandbox, and Arma 2 had DayZ (Which let's face it, is also a boring deathmatch sandbox with the inclusion of zombies), but to get the most out of an Arma game, you need to approach it for its strengths - the simulation aspect. You can play solo as a member of a squad (Depending on the mission - finding good missions can be a little tricky), or command AI using some non-traditional, but with some practice, easy to understand commands and play it like more of a strategy game.\n\nIn multiplayer, COOP is king in my opinion, but you can have large scale team-vs-team PVP which is a lot of fun as well. I admin a server that runs a large-scale coop mission 24/7 and it never fails to impress and challenge because the AI is smart enough in Arma games to allow for emergent gameplay - they'll flank, they'll fall back, they'll improvise, and it's different every time and you have to think. The engine takes some getting used to compared to the average shooter, but Arma 3 specifically is far less buggy than other Bohemia games have been. Being different isn't a reason in and of itself to dismiss it though.\n\nIf you're used to other games or approach it like a shooter, you might be annoyed with it, but if you give it time and learn it (and I can't stress enough how important it is to play a good mission in a coop setting to get the most out of it), it's hard to put down. Some of the best gaming experiences I've had have been a product of this game engine in coop with dozens of other people, and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.\n\nTreat it like a strategy game or simulation that has shooting involved, not like a CounterStrike-Of-Dutyfield alike.\n\nAlso steam sale so why the hell not?","June 23, 2014","true","288.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","4"

I joined a Invade and anex server and got killed over and over by the super op aim hack AI. I was just about to rage quit, when one of the server group members asked me if i wanted to join their squad to play with them. They told me what to do and after an hour i got the sweet taste of Arma team play. I joined the group after a while and started playing user made missions with mods and holy ♥♥♥♥. It has been the best year of gaming i have ever had. If you like millitary tactics and teamplay, Arma is right up your alley. It is not like any of the big fps's out there, you don't feel like a action movie super soldier. You feel just as vulnerable as the other guy on the receiving end of your barrel. If you are ever going to play this for the milsim part of the game, get yourself a group to play with.

I purchased it in Alpha and I was completely unaware of the amount of gameplay possibilites! You can go all out and re-create a real life scenario with the simplified editor layout, you could role-play on one of many open world servers, or you could just jump on a CO-OP server and use teamwork to destroy your enemy.. I had never played an Arma game until now and I have no regrets whatsoever for purchasing Arma 3 in Alpha and watching the game progress as it has. You would be a fool to not buy this game during any type of sale!!!  The reason I really love this game is because it incorporates three of my favorite games from "years ago". Those games being "Choplifter", Arma 3 has an AMAZING 3D Version with so many more options and settings and you can carry actual players and fuel/damage/ammo...ah, so good. The first game I played, some guy was screaming at me to get in the chopper, and as we arrived to the LZ I heard the pilot say, "Good Luck guys", and I was completely blown away!! I thought that it was an AI pilot! The second, "Black Hawk Down" for pc from like 99', the PVP is so much similar but way better. Last but not least, "Battlezone2", that was my favorite game of all time as a kid with custom base building and defending your base. I recommend finding a community as soon as you get into Arma 3, you will instantly become immersed into the game with a full community of people from all around the world.     Arma 3 is a great action packed shooter with lot of simulation aspects, a ton of different gamplay styles and gametypes, and a great place to make friends that will take you to a new level in the Steam community. More friends more fun..... WIN WIN!               And the Mods! End of Story..... See you in the battle soldiers! Be sure to get it before 2015 rolls around, "Make Arma Not War" is going to add so much and I have high hopes for the future of Arma 3.","June 28, 2014","true","272.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Multiplayer FPS and stability problems. Why nothing less? Read below.\n\nARMA 3 is one of my all-time favourite games. Yes, I don't have thousands of hours in it... but after getting back into King of the Hill (currently level 54 on it with 300+ hours in that mission/mod alone), I plan to change that. First game of mine to break 1000 hours... here I come!\n\nSingleplayer runs beautifully though note that, even on regular difficulty, the AI can, and will, shred you unless you play to the absolute best of your ability... but even then...\n\nMultiplayer, while not being the best in terms of stability and/or framerate (whether that be the fault of the servers or game's code), excels in other ways that games like Battlefield don't. Easily my favourite gamemode/mod/mission is King of the Hill -- 3 teams all fight it out in a ~500m radius circle. What makes it better than just 'run in and kill' like the Battlefield series? Vulnerable progression. You start out with a TRG 5.56mm; it's okay but you're going to lose most gunfights without the element of surprise. You want that next gun, scope, launcher or vehicle? Work for it. You earn money from vehicle destroys, kills, revives, healing teammates and sitting in the AO (the circle).\n\nThere are other great modes such as Wasteland which is similar to King of the Hill but, instead, everyone's spread far out across (typically) Stratis. You can group up with people or go lone wolf. Kill people, loot them, get money, buy things, kill more people. The thing that I dislike about Wasteland in comparison... is the lack of progression. It's just a sandbox pick-up and play gamemode/mission.\n\nWhat I'd like to see happen with ARMA 3:\n- improved multiplayer performance and stability\n- free, non-DLC weapons and vehicles ported from ARMA 2 (and Chernarus too)\n- more than just 2 sniper rifles in Marksman DLC -- so many people are disappointed with the lack of content coming from these DLCs\n- something valuable and proper in the expansion of Late 2015","January 20, 2015","true","752.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","5"

The game is divded into several categories if you will: Infantry, Airborne, Waterborne, Artillery, Armoured, Mechanized and HQ - it covers all of the basics (plus advanced) on the battlefield allowing for a varied approach to the game itself. Personally, I prefer being behind a console managing UAVs/UGVs! The successor of ArmA II has certainly taken on the role of "NEXTGEN" and demolished competition such as America's Army and DCS World.\n\nThe RV4 Engine[arma3.com] is used for DayZ Standalone and ArmA 3 thus far. Though DayZ developers have recently announced the change of their [heavily] modified engine, it really brings the ambience and full graphical effect of ArmA III to life. The detail of graphical texturing is one thing that appealed to me the most. In the majority of games I have experienced during my past, graphical texturing has always been a problem in games such as Call of Duty, (some) Battlefield games and even ArmA II. The level of immersion when experiencing the fidelity of ArmA III is insanely good.\n\nPros:\n» Detailed, well researched factions which integrate with some fictional factors: CSAT, NATO, FIA, Guerillas and even civilians.\n» Realistic sound effects for particular weapons, majority of them being rifles and pistols.\n» Ability to perform one of many roles: armour, infantry, etcetera.\n» Well established storyline for the campaign: even split into acts for more development time.\n» Realistic factors such as the attention to detail on the IFV-6c Panther - when moving over rough terrain, there are flaps on the side of the tracks that raise as it would interact with the physics in the world. Excellent detail!\n» Generally great game to play.\n» ...Many, many more.\n\nCons:\n» Ladders are extremely buggy. Climbing thin air is a thing once at the top of the ladder.\n» Artificial Intelligence needs a rework. Their reactions are not quick enough and are heavily delayed when reacting. Earlier today I told my men to hold fire yet they continued, even when disengaged.\n» No built-in immersive radios. External mods required: Task Force Arrowhead Radio, ACRE, etcetera.\n» Although one of the factions are based on NATO, it is all American equipment and characters - voice acting is American for example.\n» Editing a custom mission is impossible unless you have external modifications.\n» Animations in general could do with a bit of a rework.\n\nOverall, I would rate the game about 8/10 simply based on my hours within ArmA III. I played the alpha and the beta and it has come a long way since. It was great to be a part of that development process and I am glad I bought the game early. Really excellent game!","June 27, 2014","true","630.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Haha, just kidding. Arma 3 is made by Bohemia Interactors, the same developers that made Operation Flashpoint 1, 2 and Operation Flashpoint 3: Dragon Rising and all its notorious DLC packs. alkjdfljgaoirjgfsgh Arma 3 has had a rocky development cycle since development began in 1999 (Yeah, take that, Duke Nukem!). The biggest bump on this titles rocky road to going gold was when 3 of the members of the development team were caught by Greek military personel on the island of Lemnos, where they claimed that they were "just documenting the environment for a video game". It turned out these guys weren't the saints they tried to make themselves out to be after Greek secret police found explosives and make-shift pipe bombs in their hotel room that they had been staying in for 6 weeks. Tensions rose between Greece and the Czech Republic, and weeks after the mysterious release of the terrorists the Czech Republic was in favor of every single EU stimulus package to Greece, a nowadays declared failed state and international bombing range.\nAfter causing international ruckus, Bohemia developers seemed to enjoy the time in the spotlight, so keeping a low profile was out of the window. Their next direction for their game environment was blatantly framing the Greek inspired island as the most idiotic place on earth. For legal reasons they had to change the name of the island, which they did, from Lemnos to Altis (which just happens to be old greek for "Goat ♥♥♥♥ers"). The alleged mistreatment of the Bohemian Rhapsody developers also caused them to remove all furniture on the island, and they placed signs in most towns saying that cilivians threw their belongings into the ocean to build a giant sea-base nation because of the Greek politicians incompetence. Destroyed Greek military vehicles are spread all over the island, together with mass graves, and I sometimes wonder if Altis would have had its current post apocalyptic atmosphere if the developer incident had never happened.\nArma 3 had a well received launch, and was declared "Best Arma game of 2013" by GameSpot. Bohemimi Contractors made an absolute killing on the title, and is now ranked the 13th most valuable company on the planet. It's inclusion of a mod makers tool kit as well as a film editor has provided the community with the tools to create endless amounts of content themselves, and, unfortunately, porn. The Arma film maker is notorious for being abused by people importing of female game characters and posing them in lewd and untasteful situations.\nLooking forward Bohemo Mamani is looking for more Greece inspired environments for their next title. The developers just acquired a fully funcitonal T-90 tank, which they continously pose in front of on twitter with Bohemian flags, automatic rifles and wishes to visit Greece.\n\nThis game has multiplayer support up to 32 people, which is twice as many as the Xbox One version. Get the PC version.\n","May 30","true","058.8"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","17","26","11","5"

Many mainstream 'FPS gamers' complain about ArmA's style, because it's unique? That's exactly why I love this game. You really have to find patience and a learning curve to this game. But once you have control over the game, you'll find tons of enjoyable content. You'll find yourself playing around with the editor, campaign with great storyline, 2 beautiful islands to explore, customizable gear, multiplayer fun as well as serious gameplay. What else do you want? Yeah it might have some bugs and lag. But, if you look back at ArmA 2, not many complained about it though ArmA 3 is highly improved from the previous title. ArmA is a huge game that you will be playing for years to come. You'll always find ways to emerge into ArmA's gameplay. It's ultimately up to you to be creative. Because of Bohemia Interactive's hard work on unique warfare gameplay, and immersive experience, I'd give it 9/10 :)","February 13, 2014","true","768.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Not only do the modders create the community and the missions, but even simple crap like bipods! Even COD has bipods guys. What kind of a joke is a Karts DLC anyways? In a "war simulator"?

If played "properly", there's no crosshair, no third person view and no simplified control scheme. There are no scripted cutscenes, and no epic soundtrack is blaring during battles. The minimalist HUD doesn't tell you how much "health" you have, nor who's friend or foe. Worse yet, the entire game seems to have a steep learning curve for pretty much every single gameplay aspect it contains and if you die during a mission it's pretty much "Game Over" for you.\n\nSounds difficult? It is.\nAnd that is precisely why you should give it a try!\n\nArma 3 is one of the very last bastions of challenging and complex PC gaming. It is much more a simulator than a simple "sandbox shooter".\nYou are forced to think before you act, both on a strategic level as well as tactically. Arguably best played in multiplayer, the true potential of the game quickly becomes apparent. Agree on a plan with your team and see that plan shatter right after first contact. Improvise. Compromise. Try to keep your wits together despite the bullets whizzing past. Know the strengths of your friends and fight back - good communications is key!\n\nNo other game I know of emphasizes team play just as strongly as Arma does. Not only does it require the whole group to work together, you also cannot afford any "Rambo actions". Cowering in a ditch, your screen shaking from a passing enemy tank only a few meters next to you, you forget all about "K:D ratios" and focus on keeping you and your buddies alive. We are talking "Nintendo hard" here, people; to the point where the odds are near zero your team is going to make it through in one piece. However, if you do, your dopamine receptors will thank you:\nWinning is not just a true achievement here; the way to success (or failure!) is its very own reward. This, indeed, is the essence of Arma: Uncompromisingly realistic gameplay.\n\nIf you, as a gamer, haven't forgotten that facing a true challenge can turn out to be a lot more fun than having victory handed to you at the push of a button, this game is definitely for you.\n\n\nEdit (Sep. 2015): Arma 3 has a highly involved and well-organized mod community that is actively supported by the developer. Many fans worked very hard to boost Arma's gameplay further, with general gameplay overhauls, high quality content, sound mods and even in-game radio simulation.","September 6, 2013","true","114.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simus36/recommended/107410/","simus36","Moose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simus36/","5 products in account","The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot. Arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting, a volumetric cloud system, genuine vehicle physics, 3D weapon optics, ragdoll, noticeably improved weapon audio, and other grainy, eye-level details await scrutiny inside Arma 3's macro elegance. The best improvement is the merciful cutting of Arma 2's rigid, Tin-Man-without-oil combat animations, which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands. With voice-connected friends and a good user-created mission, Arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator. On Operation Fault Line with a gang of Steam pals, I had to drive a clumsy, eight-wheeled transport called a HEMTT across the map. To protect this elephantine truck we had a IFV-6c Panther, an APC with a mounted grenade launcher and 12.7mm MG. Minutes after leaving base, our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine, ruining its left track. As we get out to survey the damage, rockets streak across the valley. Everyone's okay, but the Panther is immobilized.","March 25","true","102.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This is where you hit the dirt, and find that bullets aren't all warning shots, and that the blood on your face can't be waited out, but that bullets will kill you, and that you'll have to wipe that blood off yourself.\n\nWhile it still isn't the most stable engine a game has run on, it's the most advanced one I know of, with all the trimmings of environment that effect the battle and without all the crashes of Battlefield 4.  Bohemia has brought the Arma series to it's highest point ever, and it's playability has been increased 200%.\n\nI can't reccomend this game to everyone, but there's one great lesson learned in my time with Arma;\n\nI've ended missions in other games seemingly covered in blood, wearing a bandana and sporting no shirt but instead a big sculpted chest and a BFG in each hand...\n\nAnd yet, I'd rather I could just make it home with a mission well done and all of my team safe and sound...\n\nThis is what Arma is...\n\nIt's fighting a real fight, where you have to pace yourself and hold your breath, where a bullet in the face can kill a man regardless of whether he's controlled by a player or an AI.\n\nIt's using your map, intel and wits to determine the best angle of attack on an enemy position, and sighing in relief when you find out later that you picked a good entry point.\n\nIt's being truly tense, when you lie hiding in the bushes, hoping the MRAP with a GMG turret didn't spot you when it's lights passed over you, and hoping that you can get everyone home safe at the end of the day.\n\nHundreds of hours into this game, I have yet to be bored even on the most patiently conducted sniper missions.  There's a satisfying reward in every mission in this game, and maybe that's because you really have to work to make it out alive.  Seriously, put on your boots because as far as a game goes, this is as close as it gets.\n\nThis is Arma, and there is nothing else like it.\n\n~Valtros","August 29, 2014","true","960.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Why? No matter what kind of game you want to play, you find it in ArmA3. If you want an authentic tactical expierence, download some mods like ACE/ACRE and join a realism unit. More intrested in survival? Then hop on a wasteland or dayz server. Team Deathmatch? Then battleroyale is for you. Even if you like roleplay (altis life) or sector control (king of the hill) you will find what you are looking for.\n\nGraphics: 17/20, the game looks great overral, with beautiful landscapes, lightning and weather.\nSound: 7/10, nothing too fancy here, but nothing bad either. If you want great sounds, then just download a mod.\nStoryline: 10/15, way better campaign than ArmA2, but let's be honest, there are better campaigns around. Don't play this game if you intend to only play it singleplayer, then you will be dissapointed.\nGameplay: 28/30, absolutly great. The diversity of guns and vehicles in the main game is already great, and there are tons of mods around to get more weapons and vehicles. The scenario editor allows you to create simple and fun scenarios in a matter of seconds, and more advanced scenarios if you have the scripting expierence.\nOptimization: 12/15, lot's of people complain about this, which is something I don't understand. You don't need the best PC in the world to run this game on high settings, and you can adjust every setting in the game, allowing you to get the best perfomerance possible. For me, it runs fine on very high-ultra settings on a i3-3240 3.4GhZ duo core and a GTX 750ti with 40fps in multiplayer.\nControls: 6/10, there is a great amount of controls to learn, which means there is quite a big learning curve for them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbt3mlg5you/recommended/107410/","sbt3mlg5you","Slows of Avernus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbt3mlg5you/","34 products in account","I tried to enjoy this game, but I could not. I have several aspects I'd like to point out to make clear why I don't recommend buying this game:\n\n1 - A totally unoptimized engine\n\nThe graphics in this game are great, no doubt about that. But the engine and the FPS I am getting definetely are not. My PC has up-to-date-components which do meet the recommend requirements, except for my graphics card. It is a GTX 760, recommended one is a GTX 680 though. I accept that I cant get the best amount of FPS with this card in a a game like Arma 3 - but only 27 FPS Max in a multiplayer match with ~ 10 people online and the graphics settings at low, view distance set to 1000 and with shadows deactivated? This is not a fault of my 760, it is because the engine of this game is totally unoptimized.\n\n\n2 - An AI which is dumb as f***\n\nI expect, that the AI in a game that is based so heavily on teamwork is atleast ACCEPTABLE. But this is not the case in Arma 3, no! The AI of the comrades you will lead during several singleplayer missions is so bad, that I would need to look for a word to describe it. They resist to follow your orders instantly, for example when you tell them to enter a car. They will walk around like a headless chicken before finally remembering that there is a car they should enter. And if you're unlucky, they won't enter the car at all. This is just one exmaple, but there are many cases where the AI would have to be improved. Maybe in Arma 4, which I certainly won't buy if they keep their attitude towards the game and the players like in Arma 3.\n\n\n3 - Terrible mission design\n\nThere are several missions which do just have terrible design. For example a mission where you have to make your way through a destroyed town with tons of enemies, vehicles (which I couldn't use for some reason) and barely any supplies. But this is not the only case. There are several other missions with a bad design, where you maybe have to walk for several minutes, or run to keep up with your mate and then encounter an enemy squad but you can't hit any of them because your level of fatigue is too high so that your hands shake and can't aim as you would need too. Sure, it might be realistic, but here it is just GAMEBREAKING. Luckily there is a way to skip a mission: Hold down Shift and - on your numpad and then type "endmission" (you can release Shift and - while typing). And I am thankful for this option because I was stuck forever with this one particular mission, but let's move on.\n\n\n4 - (Small) Things that could have been better\n\nThere are some small things aside from the big ones that coould have been better if the developers would have taken more time to improve the game. For example the body armor in the singleplayer. Depending on what pieces of armor you're wearing, you get an armor rating (which you can't see anywhere), and the amount of shots you can tolerate before dying depends on that rating. Sometimes I would just die from one shot (and no, it wasn't the .408 CT or the 99x108mm (.50) that hit me) and wonder why I died although I was wearing armor (note that I am talking of the singleplayer) and the enemy did take like 4 shots to kill! Seems like my armor rating was not high enough. But how should I know? See, the problem is that you can't know, because nowhere is written how good that armor is. It would've been nice if they would have given every piece of armor a value, like "0" for no protection, "40"-"70" for decent protection and "100" for high protection.\nThey should have also provided checkpoints for campaign levels. Well, you can save manually, bu if you forgot to and die, well you will be kinda annoyed when you have to do the whole mission again and let me tell you that the missions are not short ones.\n\n\n\nBut  there are also  good things about the game. The graphics are beautiful and if you have a high amount of FPS I'm sure that the multiplayer provides alot of fun. Thee are also so many vehicles from tanks to submarines, artillery,  jets, choppers, attack boats...  There is also an option to make time passing by faster. Press the key to the left of "Backspace" to increase time's speed, and the button left to this one to decrease time's speed. Especially useful when you have to  walk forever again.And another aspect I like are the realistic ballistics of the guns depending on their ammunition type. "But CaVe_DoVah, you wrote that u don't like it when u die from one shot. Seems like u have no idea and are not trustworthy!" No, wait. I wrote that I did not like the system with the armor rating. But the ballistics should stay like they are, because what would a military simulator be without realistic ballistics?\n\n\nI think that everyone should decide on their own whether they buy this game or not. I just tried to help you (and hope I succeeded) with this choice by writing about the negative aspects, since there are enough reviews already which cover the good ones enough. I personally regret to have bought this game, mostly because of the FPS I am getting although I am close to the recomended requirements, but hey, that's just my opinion.","March 30, 2015","false","82.9"," 29 of 50 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","29","50","2","0"

As with all the previous Arma series it has its problems (most of which I believe, should have been fixed before being sold to the public), but even with its faults it is still the closest thing to a real infantry simulator that a non-military person can purchase.\nWith mods the game gets even better and more playable, and less 'sci-fi' like.  Also, I've never played any of the single player stuff that comes with the game, I only do multiplayer with my group and I really enjoy it.\nThings to watch out for;  you need a fast processor for this game - DO NOT buy it if your CPU isn't over 3.5 M.  All of the Arma games are CPU intensive and this one is the worst for it.\nDon't expect it to be easy - this isn't Call of Duty or some other 'fps' that has the AI standing around waiting for you.  They'll hide, shoot at distance and even chase you around.  Use real-world tactics, if you're with friends, and see how well they work (they do), think 'stay alert' and you'll survive longer.\nThere's loads of stuff I could say about this game, but really I play it for about 20 hours or so a week and really enjoy it.","November 28, 2014","true","702.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

You can download endless missions made from the community workshop and play with strategy with your friends or run around half naked and dance around. Or you could roleplay and buy an ATM from all the drug money you earned in Altis Life. Or have races with friends in Karts. This game is an Army Simulator, but it's great for modding which let's you do more things.\n\nNow, this game isn't something like COD or Battlefield, it takes strategy and tactics and patience. If you come from these games it will be harder to get into fast. Although if you play through the campaign it will help you get used to the game. Please don't think the warfare in this game is just pew pew pew, die, respawn, repeat. It takes skill.\n\nAltis is a very big map, you can drive around for what seems like forever in this beautiful map. There is forestry, a lot of ocean, desert, grassland, etc. There is also Stratis, a smaller, more wastelandish and deserty than Altis.\n\nYou need a good PC to run this game. I usually get around 45 fps on online servers, around 60 on single player or games with small amounts of people in it.\n\nOverall, this game has a ton of things to do and you can't get bored of it.

The graphics are a little dated, but hold up overall. The big problem I see, is with the constant fadeout to FMV. This seems to occur so frequently throughout the Prologue, I began wondering what the point of the game actually was. I get it, that this was a tutorial phase; However, I could do with less fadeaway's and more actual gameplay. With the Con's out of the way, I like the realistic feel to the game, from the weaponry and equipment, to the military jargon, it has an air of authenticity, which makes these types of games appealing to many. Arma 3, may have it's flaws, but overall it isn't a bad game. If I were in charge, I would have modernized the graphics a bit, and put a greater emphasis on the smaller details such as battlefield damage to structures and the environment, the movement of the weeds, grass and tree's in the wind, and other little things to enhance the immersion experience. Still a recommendable game for those interested in Army Warfare Sims.","May 8, 2015","true","7.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","2"

Arrowhead, most importantly the infantry handling and animations that now offer much more flexibility and greater control over your character.\nVehicles none the less have been upgraded, the new PhysX 4 engine gives vehicles a much more realistic feeling.\nLights and scenario rendering have been not only upgraded, but made even LIGHTER for your pc to run, as opposed to the incredibly heavy Arma 2 engine that would put an incredible amount of stress even to the most high-end gaming rigs.\nThe downside however is that as of now the game doesn't offer much sandbox content as in vehicles and weapons but the developers have already announced future free DLCs that would address this and add some other cool features.\n\nIn conclusion i think this game offers infinite possibilities to those who can take advantage of them but it still needs some time to grow and reach its full potential, what we'll have then will be a game that is going to put to shame all the other commercial FPSs.","October 21, 2013","true","101.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

One of the greatest benefits is the modability and vast amount of user created content, that can be implemented in this very open sandbox. The first part of the campaign "Survive" showed that Bohemia Interactive made their game also interesting for singleplayer, but the true strength of ARMA 3 is for sure the multiplayer.\n\nDon't get me wrong - this game needs a certain level of dedication to get the maximum out of it, casual players probably won't get happy. If you want a unique mod- and mission-setting you cannot just create a game and simply "hop in". Hosting a MP-server with mods, creating MP-missions that work flawless with mods - all of this stuff can be quite complex and hard to be learned by one person alone. But if you decide to join a group or community that suites your style of play (action-, hardcore-simulation-, roleplay-orientated or somewhere in between) then you might get a most interesting and challenging game experience.","December 27, 2013","true","373.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm not even exagerating. Unless you only use vehicles 24/7 this update will have ruined the game for you, making you aim like a drunkard after jogging about all of 10m and forcing you to walk at a snails pace after a whole 20m. That's some ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful realism, isn't it guys.\n\n-----------------------------------\nIf I had to compare Arma 3 to another game, I'd say its the grandchild of Battlefield and Skyrim. With massive-scale combat, maps that dwarf any other shooter without question, and a variety of user-made game modes along with the vanilla series of Zeus game modes there is no shortage of content. In the recently added Zeus modes you can even turn this first-person shooter into an RTS game.\n\nThe game mechanics are mostly solid however some minor things such as falling damage, parachute mechanics, and cars/trucks turning to useless wrecks after a realtively minor bump into anything leave plenty of room for improvement. Bugs are also still a signifigant issue, even to the point of causing some destroyed buildings to randomly shoot someone into the air and have them fall to their death. And in general, the engine feels stiff.\n\nMuch like Skyrim—issues asside, if you find the right game mode for you, almost anyone should be able to find some enjoyment out of Arma 3. Whether you're some hardcore-roleplaying type, want to fight for survival all over an island, or simply want to vie for control over a city; there is plenty to do.","May 4, 2014","true","307.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

As a great fan of Arma 2, I love Arma 3 and the improvements BI have managed to implement into the game. As well as showing off near-future battlefield tech in the game to help accurately represent the game's time period, BI have also managed to develop great maps, interesting gamemodes (Wasteland) for online play, and still manage to maintain and improve upon the fun level of realism that made Arma 2 so popular with MilSim players. The modding scene is also very active, with mods such as ACE and ACRE out there for added realism and more 'serious' MilSim players which allows the game to be expanded upon a lot. Be warned however, the game isn't shy on performance and requires a decent rig to run properly even on mid-range settings. My only major whine about the game itself is the developer's choice to release the campaign in a series of 'episodes', drip-feeding us content and missions. But as each episode is released, this negative becomes less and less of a factor. I'm giving Arma 3 a 9/10, and deffinitely recommend this game.","January 11, 2014","true","106.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

Playing Arma II was not such a pleasant experience, and I was very happy that I haven't wasted my money on this when the Day Z mod came out, So I bought Arma III expecting something as bad as the previous Arma. But I was surprised. The graphics, movement, squad management, driving and many other features were massively improved. I`m not even talking about shooting. Recoil and gun damage is so realistic. But the inventory system probably is the most improved thing since Arma II. Now you can easily see whats on the ground, or in the vehicle, or simply add attachments for your gun ( which  are awesome! ). There`s no more arrow clicking and usual inventory lag. The only things that needs fixing are glitches and AI. Glitches should be fixed in future patches, but the AI need some work done. The AI could be both very easy to take down and extremely punishing at the same time. Sometimes AI just stands there for couple of seconds and then starts shooting, or instantly spots you and shoots you down in a few shots. I think Bohemia Interactive should really focus on this problem, because its not so serious as it is irritating, All in all, if you want some new experience of shooting game that requests some planing, patience and cooperation instead of "being your own little Rambo", you definitely should check out Arma III.","November 20, 2014","true","112.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

This is not simply, running around 360 no scoping people. Squad Managment and effective communication is necessary. There is also something that you can't experience in the said titles above, which is long-range combat.\n(An example of this is preforming an assault on a base/camp with armor, artillery and other assests from varying distances from your own base.\n\nHowever, this is still a game and should be taken lightly from time to time. I suggest learning how to do tricks in the littlebird (MH9-Hummingbird) and exploiting the terrible physics.\n\nThis game has multiple different gamemodes and tasks that could be simulated. So you'll never have the same experience twice.\n\n\nPros:\n-Very Realistic.\n-Great Graphics (If you can run them).\n-Interactive Environment.\n-Realisitc Vehicals (Most of the time).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n-Physics (You will hear "Arma Physics" referred to multiple times).\n-Muliplayer Optimization.\n-Very steep learning curve but you will appreciate it over time.

He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Führer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.\n\nHitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.\n\nHitler's Nazi Party became the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support.\n\nHitler actively sought Lebensraum ("living space") for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.","December 4, 2014","true","002.5"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","24","42","3","6"

Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.\n\nTo add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.\n\nThis game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.\nBean Bag Buccaneers.\n\n10/10 goty","November 5, 2013","true","217.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Don't remind me I am the latter please.\n-An interface so clunky (and barely explained in the prologue) you will find yourself googling how tos again and again. You really will feel like a lazy ♥♥♥ gamer who ended up in a military situation, well done.\n-Gunfire sounds seem to come from the spot where the bullets landed, NOT where they were fired from.\n-Passing enemy helicopters never seem to see you/call in a squad to engage you.\n-AI squadmates run off without you to engage the enemy despite having no ammo, while you are trying to loot bodies for anything useful.\n-AI squadmates often get tired if you haven't killed an enemy and grenade his ♥♥♥ from quite a distance. Which is nice, but after it happens a few times you realize you aren't learning anything.\n-The impromptu basecamp in the campaign mentioned it had an armory. Nice! Except command for some reason placed the armory outside of camp, on a table, like some peddler, and not inside the base where such assets would be actually safe.\n\nI guess that was my problem, I expected realism.\n\nTo boot, the game has been around since June 25, 2013, and yet the campaign they developed goes from boring to running simulator to incredibly difficult, and is over very quickly.\n\nIt stands to reason I suppose, since from release they game has felt more like a massive modding toolset than a game released for playing. At least the old operation flashpoint shooters (though buggy, largely unmoddable and hard as hell) had a semblance of a campaign, and the ability to issue orders to your squadmates.

Another timeless source of entertainment from Bohemia Interactive. Although it improves upon its predecessor - ArmA II / Operation Arrowehad - in many ways, there is definately room for improvement. While the game is more intensive on your hardware, especially CPU and GPU, for obvious reasons, the game does appear to be lacking a bit of optimisation. Saying that, it's not bad at all, and is perfectly playable. Players on a lower end PC may experience serious lag issues when playing large missions, especially during multiplayer.\n\nArmA 3 is a tactical shooter. Call of Duty or Battlefield fanboys go home. It is one of the most authentic combat simulators available to the public. It is not perfect, however. For what ArmA 3 lacks in realism and authenticity, it makes up for with a better physics engine, improved  bullet ballistics, better graphics, ragdoll physics and an even bigger map. ArmA 3, like most of its Bohemia Interactive siblings, and many other games on the market, is a dish best served multiplayer. It's a very squad-based, team-work orientated warfare experience. You CAN go lone wolf rambo; there is nothing stopping you. However, you should be prepared to die very quickly and you may negatively impact both you and your teammates with your actions. In multiplayer, make sure you have all sectors covered and that you've got your teammates backs. Every squadmember is a vital asset, and if you screw up your whole team will pay the price. It's not about the points, it's about the mission. You cease to be a player; from the moment you join a server your mentality should be that you are a cog in the war machine. Be the best you can be; weigh your options, play tactically and, if you're lucky, you might 'Survive', 'Adapt' and 'Win'.\n\nThe AI is somewhat disappointing, can be extremely inconsistent. Sometimes you can run right past them and they will not notice you. Other times, they will detect and headshot you from 500m away, first shot, in the middle of the night and fog all around. This seems to have improved since the Alpha release of the game, however. The AI is often fairly consistent in its behaviour. They are not to be treated as the weak AI you might storm through in other games. While they often are incapable of matching the abilities of a skillful player, the AI an often deadly foe. Respect the AI, and try to put yourself in their shoes. While you may cry 'bull****!' when an AI kills you, were you the AI shooting at the player that is yourself, I am sure it not seem so ridiculous and their shots so impossibly accurate anymore. Stick to cover, stay calm and don't do anything stupid. Use your teammates to help you (or try... public servers can get messy). If you want to enjoy ArmA 3 to the fullest, I would definately suggest seeking out and joining a 'Realism Unit'. Realism units are player groups which emulate the battlefields of today (and even some which are chronologically seperate from today). There, you will hopefully find organised, structured, tactical and authentic gameplay. If, like most people, that is what brought you to the ArmA series, a Realism Unit is where you belong.\n\nOne thing ArmA has always had is a vast modding community, and fans are constantly producing and releasing more content. A modification I am particularly looking forward to is the Advanced Combat Environment (more commonly known as ACE2, the sequal to ACE for the original ArmA: Armed Assault game) mod for ArmA 3. In ArmA 2, which utilised a more realistic feeling, simulator-ish, yet more restrictive engine, I had a lot of fun with ACE. It adds lots of functionality and added realism, and helps to expand the world of Arma. The 'Authentic Gameplay Modification' (AGM) and Comabt Space Enhancement (CSE) were two realism mods which expanded the gameplay significantly, which have since been discontinued. Their teams have merged, along with some of the developers from ACE2, to develop the recently announced ACE3. As of your reading this, ACE3 is probably already released and one of the most widely used mods in the ArmA III modding scene.\n\nPerhaps one of the most appealing aspects of the ArmA series, and one that gives it such longevity and popularity, would be the powerful mission editor tools. On the Steam Workshop, and several other online websites, you can find both Singleplayer and Multiplayer community-made missions with varying difficulties and talent. The ALiVE mod for ArmA 3 allows mission makers to easily build large-scale, dynamic, evolving missions utilising procedural generation, helping to flesh out the ArmA experience.\n\nI am excited to see what ArmA IV will bring to the table, if Bohemia Interactive decide to create a fourth installment in the series.

The different multiplayer gamemodes you can play and all the mods thats in this game is insane, especially the RP communities that starting to become a massive thing in the gaming industry.\n\nEven though ArmA 3 is the most realistic and full of gaming potential, it can be quite hard to find a community that you click with, typically you need to find some friends from outside and get them into this too, Then theres the time consume-\nwhich basicly means, if you got a girlfriend that you have to spent time with, you either have to play ArmA 3 together or drop either ArmA or the GF(This is the best choice aha), then theres also the hardware issues. When I started playing ArmA 3 my Geforce Experience program automatically chose Ultra for all the settings, which my PC didn't really enjoy, so I crashed and lagged a lot, so I chose to look into the configs, and saw that it all was on Ultra, so I turned it to medium.(This was with a single GTX-660TI GPU), and now later I have bought 2(SLI) 970. So what have we learned yet?\n\nBad things\n1st. Community play(Singleplayer is boring and etc.)\n2nd. Time consuming.\n3rd. Hardware issues.\n\nGood things\n1st. Awesome experiences with both RP and other kind of gamemodes.\n2nd. Meeting people from all over the world, and forming an virtual community.\n3rd. A really good solution if you want some competitive realistic war scenarios.\n4th. A lot of online users, so you shouldn't worry about not finding a server for your favourite gamemode.\n\nAll in all, I find ArmA 3 one of my favourite games, which is why I have chosen to say that I think you should buy this game if you want something realistic and "fun" but really time consuming.","July 10, 2015","true","245.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It is one of the few games I play that I continue to come back to over and over again.\n\nI won't go into much of the stuff you can read about online through professional reviews; stuff like the mechanics, graphics, etc. What I will go over though is why exactly this game is a gym despite any short comings and why it has such a loyal community.\n\nArma is a game that scales with your imagination. While not necessarily easy, users can create whatever mod they want for this game. Just recently I saw a video for a T-Rex mod.\nT-Rex aside, many of the modders for this game take it upon themselve to implement items and equipment into the game that the developers could not (most likely for legal purposes/trademarks). Missions are made constantly so there is never a worry of running out of something to do in Arma 3.\n\nWith one of the largest maps, realistic ballistics, and a sometimes brutally hard AI, the game provides a sandbox for players to play whatever military simulation they could every desire.\nGames can be designed to have a small 4 man team infiltrating small enemy camps or they can be designed to have huge operations with several platoons, armored vehicles, and airsupport.\n\nMy only warning would be to take your time learning the game and the modding community. When I first purchased Arma 2, I didn't play it for a year after my initial play through because I didn't quite 'get' the game. My brother also was not a fan of Arma 3 at first.\nThis is a game you need to Google and learn about.

You´re bored as to why nothing happens and everything seems so slow, but once you get fired upon, or get targeted by enemy artillery fire and see several squadmates around you bite the dust as you barely survived an artillery shell that injured your legs to a point where you can´t run anymore - the game becomes extremely intense.\n\nYour squad has been hit by artillery and you are among one of the few who kind of survived that attack, but your legs are injured and the next medic is 1 kilometer away from the AO. So you try to stay alive and slowly walk or crawl back to the military outpost in hopes of getting back to the EVAC zone in time (before the transport chopper flys off or the enemy decides to run a couple of bullets through the rest of your body).\n\nSo you hump back towards the military outpost that you and your team used to advance from, because you know you´re going to survive once you get there as there are many teammates and the EVAC zone is also back there. As you slowly make your way through the open field trying to stay as low as you can, crawling behind bushes - you suddenly hear shots from the distance and know that the enemies are advancing towards the EVAC zone and therefore towards you...\n\nYou try to make your way as fast as possible, when you read your teamchat talking about the EVAC chopper that is already on it´s way and almost there and you´re still 650 meters away. And as if that wasn´t enough of an issue, the enemies have spotted and are now starting to fire at you as well.\n\nAnd as you keep crawling towards the EVAC zone and notice more and more shots hitting the ground very close to you, you know that you´re probably not going to make it. And suddenly you hear a sniper firing from the EVAC zone down towards your position. He shoots one enemy rifleman after another and suddenly the teamchat indicates that the EVAC area is clear and that the pilot is going to wait for you... you stand up and try to not make your teammates wait too long for you while feeling happy about having survived such a counterattack without having to click on Respawn.\n\nThis actually happened to me once.\n10/10 would buy again","June 8, 2014","true","59.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

While there is less content than ARMA 2 right now, BIS is continually adding more. This game is definitely not for your typical CoD kiddy as it takes patience and strategy which all adds into the experience.\n\nThe biggest thing for me is that this is a community game. BIS has simply provided a platform where the community makes limitless mods and missions for the user to enjoy. Speaking of mods, THEY ARE AWESOME! Anything from radio mods, to sound mods, to vehicle and weapon additions, and even entire new maps and game mods (there's even a mech warrior mod).\n\nThe immersion in this game is great and I would highly reccomend taking the time to join a community. Doing this, you'll gain access to the real ARMA experience and not Atlis Life/Wastelands. Community events are great and there's basically one out there that would suit any player.\n\nLastly, this game supports multiple control inputs which is a HUGE plus for me. For example I have essentially 5 control inputs: keyboard, mouse, Track IR, joystick/hotas, and steering wheel/pedals. They all work seemlessly together and allow for some really awesome configurations. For example, the pedals are tri-purpose. I use them for the obvious brake and gas while driving but I additionally use them for analogue leaning as infantry and rudder pedals while flying.","June 24, 2014","true","307.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I payed 60.00 for it and have not regretted it since! I love this game to death but I play the mods like Battle Royal and Altis. I recommend this game because it brings you to a new state of gaming. Not only are you able to enjoy 1v1 combat or 2v2 combat u can have wars with eachother if you get the right set of people. I have enjoyed this game more than any other just because I caan basically do whatever I want to do and either evade police to get away with it or be kind and help whoever comes along!\nIf you're loooking for a solid multiplayer game this is the one that will capture your attention more than any other.

Well today i tried out a co op server. About 8 hours later i realized I was extremely hungry and it was nearly 3 in the morning. After 1 session of playing i had plenty of super fun moments from my very first mission where our helicopter got shot down almost instantly upon entering the AO leaving me as the lone survivor all the way up to my last mission where we had an insane firefight with overwhleming odds. What really wraps the game together though is the sound...One second you're moving towards an objective and suddenly bullets cracking overhead becomes the only thing you hear. What makes this even more tense is you might not know where you're being shot from and even once you do find the bad guys, you have to fight through the recoil of your weapon and your fatigue in hopes you can land a nice shot on them. You are not Superman in this game, you can't mow down bad guys like Call of Duty and youcan die faster than you can blink if you're not careful. Really fun game if you want to get as close to combat as you can without actually being there.","September 19, 2015","true","21.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Addons such as the TFR, JSRS or the Nato-Speznas weapons make it to a real nice Warfare simulation. It requires a good CPU and GPU, but all in all its a nice game to play and i am happy i purchased it ;)","September 10, 2014","true","603.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Trying to do a half-kneel with an RPG or binocular to minimize detection, forget about it. Great uniforms (like in ARMA 2), combat gear (not much to choose between), and guns (worst sounds of the year award goes to...)

The best combat simulator on the market, nothing comes close to delivering what Arma does. TL;DR PROS/CONS at the bottom!\n\nLiterally, no other game is as much of a sandbox as Arma 3. With oodles of content already baked into the game, there's thousands of hours literally to explore just of the vanilla content! Then, pile on the massive and hugely supportive mod community.. And you have the recipe for a game that keeps on giving.\n\nOnce you find an appropriate multiplayer circle that suits you and you feel at home, and are experiencing content YOU want to see in your gaming experience, you will get lost in the hours spent. The community of Arma is one of the most diverse and enduring in all of gaming, and is a special spot in PC gaming as a whole.\n\nThere's loads of singleplayer content in there too, the campaign is fully voice acted and is a great showcase of what the engine can do.\n\nAll the awesome to be spoken of, it does have it's few shortcomings, like most titles. The first one would be the tremendous real world PC requirements, yes you will need a higher end machine to have a truly enjoyable time in this title, to get any decent FPS. This game is a CPU hog, expect your CPU to turn into your room heater during long sessions. It is prone to many very annoying (and sometimes gamebreaking) bugs, that will break your experience if you let it get to you. Finding your community niche can be hard if you don't know what to search for.\n\nAll the cons being said though... They all have ways you can get around them as a personal player.\n\nThe problems relating to your computer, have an intel i5 or equivelent and a 2GB GPU, and you're in a pretty good start zone for getting acceptable FPS for an okay experience.\nThink exponentially for a better experience in the CPU, Arma 3 MAY benefit from more VRAM in the future, but for now is limited to 2GB VRAM, hard-coded into the engine. The game is still 32-bit, so does not use more then 3GB of RAM anywho, though faster RAM will always result in better load times.\n\nAs for the bugs and glitches you (can) encounter with this game... Very rarely does it crash, only under the most intense conditions should you ever see this come close to happening, the worst case scenario I have personally experienced was just extremely poor FPS under insane conditions, that equated to my game essentially locking up. But... That's not really the issues you'll be concerned about. There are several nuances to several systems within the game that like to just bug. The network is very easy to desync, and this causes all kinds of zany bugs. As an experienced player, I learn to troubleshoot these issues quickly as a part of the experience, and to be sure to always laugh at it. Remember, it's a game. Again, these issues are not specifically game breaking, but can be experience breaking.\n\nI really do love this game. I look forward to the DirectX12 update coming with the new Tanoa terrain map. Hopefully we get a smoother ride with DirectX12, but for now this is an endearing experience if you are willing to engage yourself as a player. The gaming experiences you have in this sandbox are unrivaled, no other gaming experience will compare. If you have a love for true gaming, this game belongs in your library in my opinion. This is Game Of The Century for me, despite it's shortcomings, the experience is unlike any other.\n\n\nTL;DR PROS/CONS LIST:\nBasically.. It's like a girlfriend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Macarthurian/recommended/107410/","Macarthurian","Mac=VX9=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Macarthurian/","203 products in account","Spending enough time in this game to fully appreciate the good and the bad, I have decided to put some words down.  I love this game more than any other game that comes to mind.\n\nWhere do I start?  I'll start with the hard stuff.\n\nYou will stuggle with this game.  You will have moments where you hate the way it's coded.  You will die to stupid things, like stairs or rocks.  You will hate the fatigue system and the weapon sway. You will get annoyed at the reskins for outfits.\n\nEventually, you will mod it.\n\nThis is not a simple run and gun game.  You will not find yourself 'no scoping' after sprinting for 2 kliks.  Arma 3 is a simulator first and a game second.  The groundwork is solid for the most part.  The modding community is devoted.  The game modes are varied.  There is something that almost everyone will find appealing inside this package.\n\nHalo jumping dressed like the UK Special Forces? Check.  Thank a modder.\nDriving a hatchback that's colored like the American flag? Check. Thank a modder.\nWant to build a mission around the Tet Offensive? Check. Thank a modder.\n\nAm I biased? Yes. Do I have a huge amount of respect for modders? Yes.\n\nArma 3 is a cpu intensive game.  You will have to tweek the hell out of it to make it just right.  You aren't going to get 60 fps on poorly coded MP servers. Please don't think it's your hardware, it's not.  Well, probably not.\nBut this game really shines in the graphic department once she's setup just right.  I'm constantly trying to squeeze as much performance as possible, but I'm not going to go over everything I've done, it would take too long.  If you google it, you will find it.\n\nPlaying the game by yourself is hindering your fun to an extent I can't even explain.  Ok, since you asked so nicely, I'll try.\n\nPlaying to campaign alone left me yearning for more.  I really disliked the interface when assigning targets, or handing out orders to the AI squadmates I had been shackled with.  It doesn't feel very fluid, nor does it give me the feeling of teamwork.  The AI, at times, can go 'full ♥♥♥♥♥♥' and just stand there while being mowed down by the enemy forces.  You may order them to get into the truck you're sitting in, only to find one of them has the great idea to run right into the AO and alert everyone to your presence.  Ok, I guess stealth is off the table.  At least I have superior numbers?  Ha, they won't get out of the truck and that rpg is headed this way.  I'll just reload my save then.\n\nNow, replay that with real people that communicate and know how to play.  Completely different outcome.  I'm not typing that hypothetical situation out again, just trust me.\n\nNow, onto the really fun part.  That part that makes my genitals tingle.\n\nThe Mods.\n\nOMG Becky, look at those mods.  They're so big!\nNo, they aren't all large downloads.  Even some of the smallest mods can change the game to a large extent.\n\nTake AGM for example.  It has different frag throwing options. A medical system that includes epi's, blood bags, adrenaline and the ability to drag people to safety.  No longer can you see how many rounds are left in your mag, you can only 'see' the weight.  It has weapon resting, fast roping, cook offs, vehicle repair options and a bunch of other things I can't think off.\n\nWhat about vehicles?  I really like the hummvees from Arma 2.  There are a few different options for mods for that.\nDo you hate that you stop moving when you switch weapons?  There's a mod for that.\nTactical glasses have no use in the game? There's a mod that gives you a hud when wearing the glasses in first person.\nI hate the stock sounds. JSRS3 baby!\nWant a Canadian mohawk?  Reskin mod.\nTired of playing Altis or Stratis?  Bornholm, Tilos, Chernobyl, Chernarus, Utes, Panthera. Just to name a few of the many user made maps available with a few clicks.\n\nBe warned.\nMods don't always work 'right out of the box™'.  If you don't have patience, you're just going to have a bad time.  Sometimes mods don't work well with each other, or give you graphical errors, or aren't compatible with user made missons.  In short, when they work, oh baby do they. When they don't, you deal with it or stop using them.\n\nLook, I'm biased.  I really am.  I love the milsim aspect of this game.  I love the squad play.

This game is an all around mess and an all around success in all aspects. Many call it a finished product and a BLAST to play and some call it an unplayable mess which involves complete "hyper realistic fails". So who is right? Well, this game appeals to both an arcade style audience willing to get action and combat at extreme levels and also to the hardened clan fighting veteran focused on mods which improve gameplay and add features to the game to improve and keep game experiences fresh. In this game however, having played it for solid hours on end, these moments which I had did not come naturally. For a game to acheive its scale and realism to levels as in ARMA 3 is by no means accepted to all in this generation. Not trying to put my old man cap on here but to play games like DayZ and ARMA you can't expect double kills and planes and cars to appear at the spawn. The PMC's of advanced warfare didn't appear in the army for just being strong and chosen. To play ARMA, it is the same as DayZ (although not as boring) and all "running simulators". And I don't mean to scare you by saying to have to run to Pygros from Kavala with broken legs. What I mean is the same principle that you DON'T start as a badass, and if that is your playstyle just don't play it or convince yourself that you can take the heat. Stories have to be made with extreme disiplinary acts in this game. And how do you get those? Well here are the steps. 1. THIS GAME TAKES SOME ♥♥♥♥ING BALLS TO GET WHERE YOU NEED TO GO. This can always be avoided (LOL not really) some way or another through the vast expanse of gamemodes like wasteland, and joining a realsim unit is all acceptable for even the hardest MLG sniper to learn what this game is about. But  this part cannot be let go. In parts where the game is about serious progression, you CAN'T be the one crying for someone to give you a chance because you are being a little ♥♥♥♥♥ cat. To be the general, you gotta go through West Point first. 2. THIS GAME WILL BRING YOU DOWN TO YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING KNEES AND WILL ALWAYS ♥♥♥♥ WITH YOU. So, how do not let this happen? Well you really ♥♥♥♥ING can't. It all happens in a matter where if you are in the right place at the right time which perfectly demonstrates how this game IS SUPPOSED TO BE. This is why you need to be with a team of people who know what they are doing and know exactly WHAT THE HELL is going on, or be daring and be alone, being a target, and dying. Just like in an animal world. So treat it like that. Hunt or be hunted, kill or be killed, the strong only survive. Because this is no FPS that you have ever seen and before buying this, you have to know what is coming for your soul.\nOh, but I have decided to roast your ♥♥♥ again by saying that this game is amazing fun. "Oh, but you said it took a long time and was boring." 3. SHUT THE HELL UP AND LISTEN TO ME. Because if you don't you will die. This game, has changed my perspective on what it is. Well, what is this game? What does it offer? What are you in for? To be honest, this game is really a test of mentality. This game is really to see what you do in dire situations of disaster, catastrophe,  military occupation, and survival. This can tie in to thinking of this game as an animal world like I said before. To live, you have to be familiar with your surroundings, familiar with the weapons, and all around just knowing WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ YOU ARE DOING. Because this game is never merciful and is always working against you as said in my other steps above. So how can you alter this? You can't. You can't change the future. You can't CHANGE your actions in this game.\n\nBecause it defeats the whole purpose.","February 22, 2015","true","548.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","8","12","4","2"

Honestly, I wish there was more to the game. I know it's alpha and more will be added -- but it's the stuff I've already seen which are bothersome. Physics engine still totally broken, still using that god-awful proprietary SQF scripting language which makes me want to kill myself (I know there's supposed to be some Java integration in the future, but that's not exactly a step up, and it most likely won't replace the SQF but will rather become an addition to it). There is some really cool stuff though. The helicopters are really fun to operate and you have a ton of (new) stances you can use to your advantage to find a sweet spot while taking fire. It's worth buying for the price for sure, but I'm a little sad they haven't improved the core more, nor does it look like they will in the beta or final release.","March 8, 2013","false","212.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

But i just can't deal with it anymore. 80+ hours I've spent in the game and it just feels like wasted time. Yes, the graphics are vastly improved, but that comes with a lot of sacrifices.\n\nFirstly, you have to have about fourteen gtx titans to run this game properly. I have a pretty decent pc (most games at high/max settings) yet Arma just does not want to play smoothly. I get about 30fps in arma 3 and although that's perfectly playable, the framerate drops and it is a pain to play. "I'll just ignore the framerate drops", i said to myself. "So what if it drops, it's a great game" but the game consistenly crashes. It just happened to me in wasteland, right behind someone with top gear and bam. Arma3.exe has stopped working. It's not like this is an occasional thing either, it happens at least once every time I play. And don't even get me started on the driving, its like trying to wade a kite through custard, seriously.\n\nAlso, the fact theres about 3 (ok maybe more) guns really annoys me. There's about 3/4 assault rifles and they all perform pretty much the same, there's no quirks with each, they're all just.. bland. That goes the same for pretty much every weapon class.  That's without me mentioning the fact none of them are liscensed or have official names. I know its a "futuristic" world, but I much prefered the ak47's, Pkms, m4's etc of arma 2.\n\nHave i mentioned the fact only one campaign episode has been released? It's not like arma fans have been waiting for this for years or anything and bohemia take MONTHS to release not the campaign, but a campaign episode. Seriously?\n\nIn my opinion arma 2 is a mechanically better, smoother and more fun game. My advice, play arma 2 for another year or so and wait for Bohemia to sort their BS out. Arma 3? Me no gusta.\n","December 24, 2013","false","158.5"," 68 of 128 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","68","128","0","2"

You have one big city with surrounding area and a designated landing zone. Three teams fly and drive their troops close to the LZ and try and take 4-5 tower areas within the LZ. Makes for a lot of fun building to building fighting but likewise can choose to sit and wait or snipe outside of the LZ. It's one of a few game modes (King of the Hill).\n\n#2 - The gaming engine for multiplayer is super buggy. EXPECT to have between 15-30 frames AT BEST. If you have an i5/i7, you'll do better. If you have an AMD prepare for the hurt. It does NOT matter about your video card or ram(I have a GTX 980  and 32GB of RAM and get around 15-25 frames). The game is CPU intensive.\n\nActually this isn't the proper wording. It's a serious flaw that the game is CPU intensive rather than GPU intensive.\n\nEveryone will say "well upgrade your CPU".

Server syncs are sometimes really choppy.\n\nIt's actually really sad that for $59.99 (about the most expensive a PC game gets these days) that it has these types of issues. Then once in game about 1/2 the guns, scopes, vehicles and others they want you to pay more for.\n\nI find myself many times having to sit back and not play the way I want to but rather the way I know I can shoot and kill people because of FPS issues.\n\nMost I can say is that they did not build this game with the intention of having huge multiplayer battles. If the gameplay type wasn't superb no one would put up with this serious flaw.\n\nNo joke. 15-20 frames the average person will have ....nearly unacceptable for the price paid if solely intend on multiplayer.\n\n10/10 if it was built for large world multiplayer in mind.

The reader should realize that I have almost 2000hrs in ArmA2. The 600 or so listed on my profile here is just since it got added to Steam and doesn't count the time pre-Steam.\n\nSo, as someone who plays exclusively with friends on listen servers, not on big public servers. As someone who plays mostly CTI maps (remember those BIS?), and as someone who spent most of those almost 2000hrs flying CAS in a jet (remember those BIS?), .......I can honestly say that I'm rather let down by ArmA 3 and it makes me very sad.\n\nThe interface has always been clunky from way back in OFP and before. The new backpack system seems to me to just be a reskin of the same thing. It does indeed make it a bit easier to use being able to drag and drop stuff (novel!!), and while I appreciate the work here.....I'd rather have seen the time spent on other things.\n\nTo be fair, two of the devs DID spend time locked up in Greece for a stupid reason. I think it was 11 months? This is something that is strictly forbidden to speak of on their forums for some odd reason. But, I understand this had a huuuuuuge impact on their development cycle as it was their two LEAD devs as I understand it.  I get the feeling that they got back, and shoved development through in order to compete with the (then) new BF and CoD releases. I personally feel this was a huge, quivering pile of mistake. Because......they aren't really in competition with those games!!! It'd be like saying that chess competes with checkers and monopoly. All board games sure but vastly different. Same here! ArmA II was all about trying to make the game more of a military simulator. Though I think they had to admit some limitations here and there with the tech of the day without making the engine only playable on super computers. ArmA III seems to go away from this and I think it's trying to compete even more now with those other games in some ways.....maybe I'm wrong? It just doesn't feel like the team is as worried about realisim any longer.\n\nFor me, the fact that it's set in 2035 is a HHHHUUUUUUUGE turn-off and almost a game breaker right there. That, and there's ONE jet in the game thus far.....one AND it's some old trainer POS to boot.....nice.....well guess this confirms my hunch I've had for a while now. BIS seems to hate fixed wing like Blizzard hates melee! It's all about rotary wing! Which is fine and dandy unless you need an A10 or a Spooky. By 2035 we assume naturally that these have been phased out, so where are their replacements? Hell, at this point I'd be happy with an F15 that I can just fly and do stand-off attacks with from miles away.....oh right that's what the choppers are for!\n\nAm I ranting a bit there? Um, yes sorry, but I was just looking SO foward to this game!!! Heck I even did the pre-order on the delux version!! NOW? Ya I'm kinda not happy about that.\n\nI fire the game up now and then after I see an update downloading. Just to mess around with the undrivable pickups and do target practice with the assault rifles that have recoil like a .45-110 every shot......it's like going to the playboy mansion only nobody's there.\n\nSo, I'd say to wait on this game. I'm still playing ArmAII where I can fly fixed wings even in the base game.

I figure everyone is on the teamspeak server as from what I'd heard "everyone uses ts on Arma" but nowhere in game did it say where the name/address of the ts server and when i asked in the sidechat the other lobby members told me to stop using sidechat. Similar experiences occurred on the few other servers i tried going on as well. The game shows a complete lack of effort to help anyone who has never played an ARMA game before, how to play the online, and the people playing it seem antisocial and uninterested in helping either.\n\nJudging from some of the reviews. the campaign isn't very good either but at least its playable, I'll probably end up on that for a bit in the hope that one day, if i ever manage to get my head around the multiplayer, i won't get constantly mowed down and showed up for the complete noob i am at this game! Overall probably a good game for those new to the Arma series if you have a spare 20 odd hours you are willing to put in to figure out the what is going on in the online game modes, what addons and mods you will need for the game, what ts servers you need to be in, what the controls are, then you will probably reach a stage where you can enjoy the game. But if you don't have that amount of spare time to search the internet for help guides, tutorials, and server info, then you will probably find the game very frustrating.

Some time ago BIS patched this ability out. Who knows why.\n\nEven BIS's bugs are broken. Often bugs happen randomly and in a non-reproducable way. Sometimes the AI driver won't follow movement orders, sometimes he will. There is no pattern.\n\nA big problem is that control of your AI squadmates is much worse than previous games. In OFP your could use tactical view to position your guys, tell them to hold fire and they would do it. This made it possible to set up ambushes. In Arma 3 this is impossible. Your AI will often not move to where you click on the map. A very common occurence is to order your squad to a position 100 meters behind you and they will instead move 100 meters in front.\n\nFriendly AI struggle to see and engage enemy targets. Countless times I have seen my troops blankly staring down their sights at an enemy for several seconds, finally getting shot instead. In contrast, the enemy can still do a first-shot head-shot over iron sights from 200 meters away, something people complained about in 2001.\n\nAI squadmates are little more than extra lives in coop. Even then, due to the broken respawn system, the following is common: your squad gets ambushed and the player is killed. Even with respawn delay set to zero, BIS has some useless camera view that you have to watch for 5 seconds before you can spawn into your next guy. So you watch him get killed too, then start over with the next guy and so on. It is common to have control taken away from you and to watch helplessly as 3-4 of your men are killed while you can not intervene. When a unit is being spawned into, its AI is disabled, making it totally helpless.\n\nAnother bug is when your squad takes fire, they will enter combat mode and you can't get them out of it. They become unresponsive to commands and are basically out of your control. This makes it impossible to break contact or dash to a new position. In other words, when you take fire, you lose control of your AI men.\n\nAnother: if you are a group commander in a vehicle but switch to gunner and then exit the vehicle, the vehicle driver will run over you. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It is things like this that make me think the devs never even play their game.\n\nThat said, enemy AI is improved over OFP. However, the AI still requires 3rd-party mods do basic things like enter buildings, take cover, call for support, crew weapons etc.\n\nAI are even less capable of driving than games. I made an insurgency mission where the enemy starts in a village and spreads out from there, "infecting" the map town by town. However, I noticed that a few minutes after spawning, the enemy technical groups slowed down greatly. When I used a camera view to debug, I saw that most of the AI had crashed their vehicles so badly (whilst safe and driving down empty roads), that they had wrecked most of the vehicles in their group and were now on foot.\n\nLet that sink in. The AI can not drive down roads for a few kilometers without wrecking their vehicles, even when not in combat.\n\nThe implementation of PhysX is terrible and often slows the game to a crawl or crashes it. About one in three coop games requires a restart because a vehicle gets stuck on a building and the FPS hits 4. You will also see hilarious glitches like tanks suddenly flying into the air for no reason.\n\nThe worst thing about Arma 3 is that the developers just don't care. They ignore bugs like the AI combat mode one, but then implement rubbish that nobody wants. So now there is Workshop integration (who cares?), but you still can't control your troops in combat.\n\nAnother example: despite existing in earlier games, there are no females in Arma 3. So what do the devs give us? Go karts! It is absurd.\n\nThe action menu was terrible when OFP was released in 2001, and Bohemia has made no efforts to improve it. For those not familiar with it, you have to use the middle mouse button to control essential actions. Say you want to climb a ladder, you might accidentally set off your satchel charges instead. Or a single mis-click and you turn off your helicopter's engine. There are several mods which show how this could be done better, but again, Bohemia just doesn't care.\n\nA great point is the modding community. There are tons of fantastic mods that add units, islands, functions and even fix Bohemia's shoddy work.\n\nPeople will tell you that Arma 3 is some super-realistic military simulation. It has realistic elements, but it also has magic medkits that instantly heal you. The tanks are STILL using a hitpoint system and can be killed with any weapon as long as you hit it enough times. Also, tanks still do stupid things like get into combat, inexplicably expose their rear armor to the enemy and then use their coax to engage an MRAP whilst ignoring some AFV that is shooting them.\n\nThe artillery system is a joke. Some of the special round types (such as guided shells) don't work at all.\n\nThe naval aspect is just a novelty with zero value in the game. There are no true naval assets, the aquatic elements serve absolutely no purpose and are useless in game.\n\nIn those rare cases when it all comes together, nothing breaks and you are fighting the enemy instead of the game engine, Arma 3 can offer a very fun experience that no other game can (mods are essential though). But even if you get the game for free, you will need to spend dozens of hours researching and installing mods and learning how to avoid the bugs. Arma 3 is broken and unfinished, you will have to invest a lot of time to make it work for you. Vanilla offers a boring, unpolished, unfinished experience.\n\nIf you really want to see what Arma has to offer, just get Arma 2 and its addons. It is much cheaper, has about 500% of the content of Arma 3, is more stable and has far more mods. In fact one of the major modding projects for Arma 3 is to import Arma 2 content. Arma 2 has far more islands and factions. You will not have to deal with all of the bugs Arma 3 introduces.\n\nI imagine some fanboys will attack this review. But I have been contributing to OFP/Arma community for over a decade. I am sick of waiting for Bohemia to take their game seriously and fix the bugs.\n\nI could go on and on, but this review is already long. One final bug: the one where you suddenly start flapping your arms and floating in the air like a bird.\n\nBottom line: Arma 3 is definitely not worth the money. Arma 2 can provide more than Arma 3 at a much lower cost and with less bugs. Even if you get Arma 3 for free, you will have to invest a lot of time and effort into it to make it playable. Even then it will still frustrate you 33-50% of the time.","November 30, 2015","false","798.7"," 206 of 396 people (52%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","52","206","396","35","37"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chuvalo/recommended/107410/","Chuvalo","Niipaa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chuvalo/","233 products in account","Oh ArmA. ArmA, ArmA, ArmA. The abusive relationship we have shared over the past 4 games has become more abusive, and less fun, and all it took was one title. One title full of empty promises, and most likely just a tech demo to fix the engine up for DayZ 2. Let me elaborate on my disdain for what used to be one of my favorite game series, and the company that I used to respect above every other.\n\nThe quick and dirty, would I recommend ArmA 3? Not by a mile. Sub-30 price tag, sure, you'll get your monies worth. But even for all the modders trying to save it, this is not a complete game. You should not have to pay 60 dollars to go and download a number of COMMUNITY created additions to feel like you actually have a full fledged product. If some of that money went to those modders, then I'd say support THEM, not BI. But it doesn't. Imagine buying a car, but having to go out and purchase the doors and steering wheel separately. Sure the car runs, but just how useable is it?\n\nA quick glance at my steam page would reveal that I highly praised BI's adventurous approach to ArmA 2, and OA. I loved ArmA with a blazing passion, even though it's considered the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the series. OFP shared a warm place in my heart as the birth of one of my favorite mil-sims. Sure, since OFP, the series has had its caveats and nuances, but you quickly learned to take them with the massive amount of fun the games provided. So where did ArmA 3 go wrong? What could one title do to tear my respect for 3 other games (+ 2 Expansions & DLC)? Well, lets start with the company and work our way up. You see, riding on the heels of the massive success that DayZ was thanks to word of mouth and LPs, BI somewhere seems to have got it in their head that the same business practices most AAA companies do (Incomplete Games for Full Price, DLC strategies), could be done to their small communities. And you know what? They were right. We all bought into it. BI slowly came to realize that they could do less work, and still make more money, because their communities could turn nowhere else. What amazes me most about DayZ, besides the fact that it is still in Alpha after almost 2 years, and that it's lead creator left, is that all it really did was show what ArmA 2 was already capable of. Massive, persistent worlds with Mil-Sim themes. Just, with zombies.\n\nBut, this is not a review of DayZ, this a review of ArmA 3. Any ArmA community member worth his or her grain of salt will remember all the broken promises that now lay at ArmA 3's feet. Disguising as the enemy? Gone. The Railgun tank, one of the coolest features at E3, and the only one making the future worth giving a damn about? Poof. All the underwater showcases, hinting at perhaps real naval gameplay? Nope. Planes? We got 3. Funny thing is, all you Deluxe Edition owners should open up that Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures manual it comes with sometime, and view all the planes we should have had. The reskinned C-130 and F-35? Fugetta about it. That's right, we couldn't even get recycled content.\n\nNow, let me be fair, ArmA 3's engine is a massive improvement over previous series entries. And OFP/ArmA has always been one of those games where the community really takes it the final step with endless content. But Vanilla, the games were usually very playable, and very enjoyable. This is where ArmA 3 comes up the shortest. While the engine is great, and getting better with each patch, not only are we still denied even a basic amount of content, but the underlying issues since OFP are still there. 2013/2014, we still have an action menu. BI, please. Not to mention that AI has somehow found a way to get worse with all these improvements, rather than better.\n\nYou know, some people actually say ArmA 2 people were spoiled because we had OFP and ArmA 1's content all rolled into one. I find it hard to give sympathy to the people whose job it is to create content and games. Who get paid for it. In closing I will say this. ArmA 3, as a game, is complete and total BS. ArmA 3, as a platform, for people to show their skills in modeling, texturing, and coding, fantastic. If you want ArmA 3, do it to support people who make great content. Just don't expect a full fledged game, for the full fledged price.","January 10, 2015","false","751.5"," 31 of 57 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","31","57","0","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acesential/recommended/107410/","Acesential","Acesential","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acesential/","586 products in account","The ARMA series has always been more of a simulator than a video game.  As such, it is not easy to get into.  There are tons of keybinds, the movement systems feels wonky due to being so tied to the animation system, and confrontations seem more a test of patience rather than reflex, engagements usually at 100 meters or more.  It also doesn’t help that the AI can be incredibly… incredibly… stupid.  Despite this, the series has garnered a strong following that has created a community of serious players that is hard to find anywhere else.  Now, comes ARMA 3…\n\nARMA 3 is not a fundamentally different game, but the developers have learned from the past, and they have given this iteration a sense of polish that makes it refreshing to this jaded ARMA fan, and very enticing to those curious about the series, but otherwise intimidated by ARMA 2 and 1.\n\nFirst off, ARMA 3 looks stunning.  The island is modeled after a real Mediterranean island, and it shows- there is a strong sense of authenticity as you walk, run, fly, and fight through the landscape.  It is worth plopping down a unit in the editor and just walking around, absorbing the sights.  The vastly improved lighting engine really adds to the entire experience.  Lighthouses illuminate the world convincingly, and fires cast an impressive glow.\n\nWhat makes the game feel so much better is the improved controls.  No longer do you move like a "drunken mudcrab" as one of my friends so succinctly said.  Indeed- the past games always made movement a struggle, with its reverse mouse acceleration, clumsy walking and running, and strange deadzone/free aim mechanic (which a lot of ARMA fans swear by, but I personally detest).  Now with ARMA3, the mouse is no longer hampered by that pesky reverse acceleration, movement is more fluid (with some nice little touches such as tactical pace), and it introduces a fantastic modifier system that lets you pop up and down, left and right, for each stance.  It’s a simple addition, but adds so much to the combat, especially in a world where no cover is a perfect chest high wall.\n\nThe game also comes with a powerful editor.  While it is extremely daunting, even the most passing user can make some interesting scenarios, and for those who really want to learn, there are tools that will let you decompile other people’s missions to see how they do things.  It’s very much worth exploring, especially if you enjoy thinking of tactical “what if” situations.\n\nWhat is most impressive is that my experiences with ARMA 3 so far have only been in alpha.  Despite this, it runs and plays great, and things can only get better from here.  Already, with the second update, performance and stability has increased tremendously.  As an alpha, I am already recommending this game highly.  Honestly, if you are tired of the constant closed quarter combat corridor shooters like Call of Duty, and if Battlefield 3 just doesn’t seem real enough for you, check out ARMA 3.  It just might scratch that itch of yours.\n","March 12, 2013","true","543.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is one of my Favourite games of all times, since ArmA 1 and CnC Commanders was released.\nPeople are complaining about the missing campaigns, being impatient and just douching all over the place because its not a CoD.\nThis game is just like the best MIlSimulator ive ever played, right after ArmA 2 OA.\nBohemnia interactive did a very fine job. It has bullet penetration. The soldiers are highly customizable and damn... it is even supporting Mods and encouraging people to create stuff.\n\nIf you want a real multi-player and FPS capable game, please buy this. Its just amazing. Graphics and Gameplay is O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G.\nArmA 2 Needed an additional mod, called ACE, this game here, does not even need any more realism mods, because it IS Realism itself!\n\nWorth the money. Fun to play.\n9.5/10 -Acekiller.","November 11, 2013","true","311.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

I myself can say that I am somewhat pleased with it, the Map is HUGE and very fun to explore it's just with a 200 square kilometer map you would have more then just 14 air vehicles, maybe more planes and helicopter. They did mention they will be releasing new DLC for the game thank god I bought this when it was in Alpha. Otherwise I wouldn't be buying all that DLC. Bohemia in my opinion needs to step up their game and realise there is more to please then just the general European public. :)","July 21, 2013","true","123.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KazumaKat/recommended/107410/","KazumaKat","KaZumaTree","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KazumaKat/","433 products in account","If Call of Duty is a Hollywood "military porn" movie, and Battlefield is the docudrama on military subjects, Arma is the trip down to the local military base, spending time on the range and on the obstacle course, and learning the real deal from the real people. Its about as close as you can get without signing up.\n\nArma 3 is a sandbox infantry simulator with a focus on authenticity, set in a near-future ficticious scenario of 2035, wherein NATO is but a shadow of its former (aka: current-day) self, and a new enemy of Iranian origin begins a localized takeover of a small collection of islands in the Agean Sea, leading to a potential "flashpoint" of a wider war between NATO-allied nations near the Medittereanean and the Iranian-led "CSAT" forces, with Greek-based freedom fighters and the Greek army caught inbetween.\n\nThere is a large focus (stemming from 4 games prior, not including expansions) on realism, and not the Hollywood "realism" that Call of Duty or Battlefield would throw at you. This game has proper modelling of terminal ballistics (range, ballistics drop, penetration, deflection, windage), proper modelling of the kilometers of distances you'll oftentimes have to travel, proper weapons, vehicles, and equipment modelling and mechanics, and proper tactics and strategy implementation.\n\nHow proper? Well the seminal game of the series, let alone this infantry simulator genre, was the penultimate "Operation Flashpoint" of 2001 (now named Arma: Cold War Assault), which led to the development of the Virtual Battlespace 1 and 2 interactive training simulator aids that are currently being used by world militaries around the world, alongside the next games in the series (with the new name), Armed Assault (or Arma).\n\nWhilst there is a singleplayer campaign of due note (and one that is highly recommendable to newcomers to the series as the campaign since Arma 1 has always been structured to deliver a solid singleplayer experience at the same time introduce and teach the fundamental mechanics of the game), the real focus of the game is in its sandbox nature, allowing a very fanatic and vibrant community to create missions of all kinds, oftentimes with a multiplayer bent, for the game. Many of these missions are in the Steam Workshop, a first for the series.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of this game is extensive and ranges from straight-up "hardcore" simulation fanatics, exercising proper military procedures, tactics, and actions, to GTA-like -Life servers, Wasteland (read: DayZ in Arma), and everything in between (Insurgency, and Domination/Invade&Annex). In fact, many of the aformentioned gameplay types are all community-born, with the different communities that play Arma oftentimes having vastly different variants of each type, with many having a lot of bleed-over into each other, or being a singular experience on their own. One's multiplayer experiences are oftentimes directly tied to the quality of the people that share the same experience with you, and Arma's many communities are a notch above the expected grade, with all kinds from laid-back to straight-up, oftentimes with people who are former and even current serving military. You wont feel alone if you look around, and the people you will find are of all kinds, many for the better.\n\nThis game is highly recommended to those who feel that Battlefield is not a solid enough experience and want to get deeper into the mindset of a soldier in a more authentic worldspace, and want to see how and why military tactics of today work they way they work, from close-quarters battle (CQB) in room clearing, to urban MOUT combat and open areas, to infantry - mechanized - armor - air interplay and supports.","February 26, 2014","true","589.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is the best Multiplayer simulator and is definitely an amazing purchase that I've made and I'll never regret.","December 10, 2014","true","776.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm a fan of the of the Arma series, and Bohemia Interactive as a compnany.\nI bought Arma 3 back when it was in early access as an alpha. Back then, Bohemia was releasing regular updates that included in game content. I've become very skeptical of Steam Early Acess titles, but I trusted Bohemia Interactive as a company I have bought from before and have been happy with my purchases and received many hours of enjoyment from their previous titles. (Arma 2 and Carrier Command to name a few)\n\nArma 3 Eventually hit Beta, and later final release. After the "Finalized" product was increased in price the in game content soon stopped flowing. Then the Karts DLC was released. I thought "Oh this is just some fun thing the devs made some weekend." I passed on it as it had a kind of high price tag for just a mini-game calibre addon. Now the Helicopter DLC came out. It costs around 16 bucks. With these helicopters came new game mechanics. You can now tow vehicles via one of the DLC helicopters. Keep in mind, Arma is a game that has an active community of modders, scripters, programmers, mappers and artists creating new content every week.\n\nThat's not to say Arma 2 didn't have its share of DLC. However, for comparable prices you got a new singleplayer campaign, a few scenarios, and an array of vehicles opposed to just two. This is the direction I don't like to see Arma go. When I bought the PMC DLC for Arma2, it felt worth it. I got more hours of gameplay by myself and singleplayer and many more options for transport and weaponry in multiplayer. The Arma3 DLC seems unfair. The two combined are offered for a reduced price, with both DLCs (around 25 dollars) You get three vehicles, (A kart and two helicopters.), a few outfits, and a starter pistol.\n\nOn top of that, this game requires pretty fancy hardware to run above a steady 30 frames. I've found that this a very processor intensive game. I recently went from an I3 processor to and I7 and now make 40 frames pretty steadily on very high or ultra. However, when flying or otherwise moving fast, I still experience some heavy frame drops. These don't make the game unplayable by any means, but they do happen somewhat frequently (usually when flying over large villages with lots of models, namely Kavala.) For CAS pilots, you're almost always flying very low to the ground, and very fast. The added frame drops increase the challenge of flying CAS in urban areas.\nNow for people who are using lower end processors, you'll find looking at a village, even not directly (through terrain or a building) will drop your frames by atleast five. For people controlling Zeus you'll find that lag increases very quickly for your players the more things you put onto the battlefield. It becomes apparant a lot sooner than you'd expect for a game on the scale of Arma 3.\nSpeaking of scale, a word often used when describing the main map, Altis. Altis has a huge perfomance difference comparatively to other maps. Now, obviously, the bigger something is, the more intensive it is to render. I NEVER noticed differences in performances from Chernarus to Takistan, to Namalsk, to Zargabad, to Utes on Arma 2. Granted, Altis is a lot more urban than Takistan for instance, and to be honest, I'd rather play Takistan if I can go anywhere on it. I've been on Insurgency servers where going to Kavala is against the rules because spawning AI in there increases lag to a huge degree.\n\nBeing a finished game, Arma 3 feels a bit empty on the side of vehicles and weapons. There are TONS of outfits, but I'm pretty sure there's less than 20 guns (not counting variants) For a game as large as Arma, you'd think there would be a large array of weapons, similar to Arma2.\n\nAside from that, being injured and out of breath REALLY kills your aim, it doesn't really feel right to me but I can live with it.\n\nAlso, using scroll wheel as an action menu is still awkward as hell, but you get used to it. Again. I can live with it.\n\nThat's my gripe with Arma 3 right now. Here's what I like:\n\nOtherwise, Arma 3 has great potential. The Zeus gamemode is innovation I've been looking for in gaming for a long time. It allows someone to take the role of a Dungeon Master and create the story of the mission as it proceeds. With that it is tricky to be/find a good Zeus. Once you can make a challenging, but not impossible mission for your friends, it is a blast for everyone. It's even fun to mess around by yourself as Zeus. You can create your own missions, and since the AI is good it's still challenging. I love Zeus and hope to see similar concepts in other games in the future.\n\nFlying is very tight. Flying is as near perfect as it gets for me. I am very happy with the flying system in this game, I have not tried the advanced flying mode yet, but I imagine Bohemia put the same care and attention into it as the now standard, default mode. The land vehicles turning radiuses seem huge, but they are military vehicles.\n\n\nThe singleplayer story is a lot more intuitive and better paced than Arma 2. I have not beat it yet, but there have been many moments I have enjoyed. It is set up in a three part act, much like a movie, the middle being climax/dilema. The first act is rather short. Other than that, so far the campaign is much more engaging than Arma2.\n\nThe community for Arma, if you're not aware is terrific. I love being able browse for addons other users created. This allows units to personalize their gear and vehicles to better suit their playstyle (Navy, Marines, Airforce, ETC) There are tons of mods that make the game so much more involving and immersive. If you get this game, I'd say it's a must to download a few mods.\n\nI know I said the scale is too big above, but if there's some things Arma does right, one of them is scale. When your on Altis, or Chernarus if you want something that runs better, You feel like you're in huge area, and there could be fighting ten kilometers from where you're fighting. Because of this, everything takes time. Getting a tank to a battlefield to tip the balance of the fight is a hard choice to make, because that fight could be lost by the time the tank gets there.\n\nGunplay and movement are silky smooth, however, balistics seems a bit off. Some enemies seem to just absorb bullets sometimes. Bohemia included modified stances so you don't have to download a mod. The modified movements are very useful.\n\n~~~~\nSome things I don't like that aren't Bohemia's fault:\n\nServers feel pretty empty at the time I'm gaming, and takes a while to find a good operation.\n\nYou can no longer host a forward private server for your friends, due to the Gamespy closing, Steam took over, I don't know if they'll bring it back, but that was definitely part of the reason I got into Arma. It was very easy to pick up and do a mission with a couple of buds.\n\nToo many Altis Life servers.\n~~~~\n\nAll in all, I think Arma 3's path will change. The community got pretty upset over the helicopter DLC, and with good reasons. I like this game. I still play it today. Is it worth fifty or sixty dollars? Probably not right now. However, this game isn't by any means bad, and if you enjoy a more simulator feel when playing a first person shooter, I would say that this would be a pretty good game to get.\n\nBohemia, I hope you gain my trust back.\n\n(Sorry for any typos, wrote this late at night)\n\n","November 19, 2014","true","543.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has sleek graphics and very realistic gameplay; incidentally, if you're looking for Call of Duty or Battlefield with tight corners and insanely over-powered guns and dumbed-down ballistics, you, sir, have come to the wrong place.\nAs said by Runekn so perfectly:\n"Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediately."\nThe community is incredibly active, and if the game is missing something (a jet, or faction, or gun), there are modders out there currently hard at work making this game more incredible.\nAt the time of writing, the first of three campaign episodes have come out, the next slated for early next year. The game is becoming more and more intricate as people "leave" ARMA II to rest for a bit while they pursue ARMA III and more Scenarios are being made (thanks to Workshop Integration).\nOverall, this is an excellent game, and if you're sick of CoD or BF, need a dose of excitement or realism, or just need a satisfying filler while the sequel [of CoD or BF] comes out, ARMA III will give the experience yourself looking for.\n","December 15, 2013","true","353.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being "Zeus" it has made gaming to a whole new level.

Once my spotter and I got there he began calling out targets as he glassed the town with his binoculars searching for our target, a war criminal wearing a black beret and aviators, known as "The Jackal". Once we found our mark we compared him to our notes and the descriptions matched. I noted his location and then marked a right triangle on our map, finding that I was 320m North and 340m west of his position, the hypotenuse of the triangle was 467m (our distance). Then accounting for a 160m height differential between the target and I, our actual distance was 493m. Due to a slight Northern wind of about 5kph I adjusted my shot slightly to the right, I took the shot, striking the target in the right shoulder, killing him instantly.\n\n\n\nI had to use geometry and trig to play a video game.\n\nI approve 100%","September 17, 2013","true","139.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is a pretty good balistic simulation for vanilla arma but you can find mods for very realistic ballistics. I love pretty much everything about Arma except these two things, of course, nothing is perfect. The game requires a pretty powerful computer setup to run effectively, even with my Nvidia 770 graphics card, larger battles decrease frames quite a bit. And finally, Arma's controls can be rather clunky at times, the stance/lean controls specificly. It can be a problem at close range where a real human could move much faster.\n\nOverall- 9.5/10  definetly worth the price if you can run it and enjoy Teamwork and tactical combat.","February 21, 2015","true","287.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've had multiple problems and even mangaged to fix the issue after hours and hours of searching for the answer to the issues.\n\nNow as Beta was a complete horror and full release was right around the corner I decided like many others to quit playing and go back to some good old ArmA 2 A.C.E. and waited till the games full release.\n\nAs I was pumped for the full release I noticed that nothing had changed from the beta. Same maps, same vehicles, same sounds, same weapons, and same factions. The lack of things for the Sea was a huge disappointment because the ArmA 3 engine actually has a working water system and it was completely wasted. The lack of Air vehicles especially no big cargo plane makes traveling on altis boring and hard to move from place to place.\n\nAlthough it says its a ArmA game I dont feel as if it compares to its counter parts. Yes, a graphical update has been put up for the game itself but after playing ArmA 2. I dont feel the immersion of ArmA:Gold Edition and  ArmA 2 in ArmA 3. but, it does have alot of neat things like futuristic vehicles, amazing hud system, stance system, amazing animations, ability for both customization over weaponary/uniform and a bunch of downloadable mods/maps that can keep you playing for hours just like ArmA 2.\n\nI'm just disappointed that they didn't take their time on this game. Why couldn't they have made this game better by looking at what players loved in the previous games like the ACE mod or even some of the other cool things like I44, VTE, and etc.\n\nAlthough all the bad things I have said its still a game in development and could possibly have a big turn around. I just hope this game becomes better in the future so I can start enjoying it again.","April 8, 2013","true","575.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

My rig = 2x GTX970s + i4970 + 16GB DDR3.\n\nThis is by far the best online shooter I've ever played. The emotional experience of playing online is on par with that of the HL2 single player campaign (although the games are nothing alike.) Everything in the game is rewarding if you stick around to figure it all out. Every day I play this game I love it a little more and I've had it for about a year. Hard to get bored in MP because there are so many different roles to perform (fighter pilot vs. tank crew vs. combat medic vs. sniper vs. drone operator..etc). I get bored of games easily and this one has managed to keep my interest.\n\nThe setting and gameplay is similar to the Battlefield games, HOWEVER--\n\nThe Battlefield games are arcades. This is a MILITARY SIMULATOR. You can simulate the tedious monotony of being a plane or heli pilot, ground-pounder, medic, tank crew, +others. I prefer the helis because they are very realistic in both physics and detail, including working gauges.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone looking for an in-depth military simulator that is more rewarding the more you play.\n\nI rate Arma 3 (MP) 89/100\nFor reference:\nI rate HL2 (SP) 91/100\nI rate BF4 80/100 (on a good day.)","June 9, 2015","true","669.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This was back in alpha. it sucked ♥♥♥, and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! Completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being "Zeus" it has made gaming to a whole new level. Since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named STDelta. Its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. Would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming.

I've had multiple problems and even mangaged to fix the issue after hours and hours of searching for the answer to the issues.\n\nNow as Beta was a complete horror and full release was right around the corner I decided like many others to quit playing and go back to some good old ArmA 2 A.C.E. and waited till the games full release.\n\nAs I was pumped for the full release I noticed that nothing had changed from the beta. Same maps, same vehicles, same sounds, same weapons, and same factions. The lack of things for the Sea was a huge disappointment because the ArmA 3 engine actually has a working water system and it was completely wasted. The lack of Air vehicles especially no big cargo plane makes traveling on altis boring and hard to move from place to place.\n\nAlthough it says its a ArmA game I dont feel as if it compares to its counter parts. Yes, a graphical update has been put up for the game itself but after playing ArmA 2. I dont feel the immersion of ArmA:Gold Edition and  ArmA 2 in ArmA 3. but, it does have alot of neat things like futuristic vehicles, amazing hud system, stance system, amazing animations, ability for both customization over weaponary/uniform and a bunch of downloadable mods/maps that can keep you playing for hours just like ArmA 2.\n\nI'm just disappointed that they didn't take their time on this game. Why couldn't they have made this game better by looking at what players loved in the previous games like the ACE mod or even some of the other cool things like I44, VTE, and etc.\n\nAlthough all the bad things I have said its still a game in development and could possibly have a big turn around. I just hope this game becomes better in the future so I can start enjoying it again.","April 8, 2013","true","575.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frankaloons/recommended/107410/","Frankaloons","Frankaloons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frankaloons/","93 products in account","Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.\n\nFirst of all, some history.\n\nAll of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.\nOperation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.\nARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.\nARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.\nArma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.\n\nThe game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independent. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by enemies wanting their land, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. NATO peacekeepers are doing their best to, without violence or conflict, keep the CSAT or OPFOR from the East, away from the island. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and CSAT starts attacking both of those teams. Also, NATO's having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.\n\nIt has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.\n\nAltis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.\n\nFirst of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.\n\nAs a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.\n\nAnd medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.\nHere's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/\n\nWith Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.\n\nAs BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.\n\nAs an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.\nHere's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/\n\nWith Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod.

So much to do, guns to shoot, vehicals to drive, vehicals to FLY, and items to wear and use. I do remember my very first time ever playing, I booted up the game into altis life, and as I sat on the porch of my home, I watched as a police officer arrested 4 men in their underwear. As they all kept screaming "APD (altis police department) IS ILLUMINATI". And as the officers kept repeating "NO WE ARENT SCRUBS". As I progressed through the game, discovering new modes, maps, missions, and more, I grew a liking to king of the hill, me and my buddies would roleplay it so hard. We would sprint through the all out war field, wondering if we would make it out alive, as my head medic, takes a sniper round to the leg, and hits the ground. I looked to the sky, making sure it was clear, I saw an enemy parchuting to the ground, obviously ready to kill us, I raised my rifle, and shot, and I watched him fall to the ground, dead. I read the kill feed "Jesus Christ was killed by Moist Potatos". My team yelled "YOU KILLED JESUS! RIGHT OUT OF THE SKY!" I advanced to my wounded soldier, and I stated "youll be okay, its just one shot". He looked me in the eye, and said, "its okay boss, its my time, let me go in peace". As my eyes began to water, and drip, I told him I would fill his request, and I clicked, "Cancel Revive". The water from my eyes splashed onto the keyboard, my palms began to sweat, and I became shaky, I yelled to my team to keep going to the objective, and I laied down next to my dead medic, and waited for the sniper round to hit, me. As the bullet landed right in my head, I went happy, I did not regret my choice. As I respawned, and I saw my medic standing at the base, I cried, again, and shot that little mother f*cker for not getting revived. So, he shot me, and I got mad, and force shut down my computer. Ill never forget that game. The game my medic puss*ed out, and turned into a lil b*tch. Ill always smile when I think of that.\n\n11/10, this game deserves a bigger fan base than it has, it is SO worth it. Not tired of it after all these hours.

Is it just me or is $16 rediculous to fly 2 new helicopters? Yes, i own it because i bought the DLC bundle. Im not saying dont buy arma but think about the stupidity running through their heads about these ideas... Might I also mention that the helicopter physics in the AFM (Advanced flight model) is somewhat exagerated in some areas.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frankaloons/recommended/107410/","Frankaloons","Frankaloons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frankaloons/","93 products in account","Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.\n\nFirst of all, some history.\n\nAll of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.\nOperation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.\nARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.\nARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.\nArma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.\n\nThe game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independent. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by enemies wanting their land, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. NATO peacekeepers are doing their best to, without violence or conflict, keep the CSAT or OPFOR from the East, away from the island. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and CSAT starts attacking both of those teams. Also, NATO's having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.\n\nIt has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.\n\nAltis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.\n\nFirst of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.\n\nAs a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.\n\nAnd medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.\nHere's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/\n\nWith Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.\n\nAs BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.\n\nAs an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.\nHere's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/\n\nWith Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies.\nSign up to play here: http://www.thezombieinfection.com/\n\nAlso, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.\n\nIt is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.\n\nIf my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3official\n\nThanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!\n\nFrank\n\n\n\n\n","February 23, 2015","true","904.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

It has sleek graphics and very realistic gameplay; incidentally, if you're looking for Call of Duty or Battlefield with tight corners and insanely over-powered guns and dumbed-down ballistics, you, sir, have come to the wrong place.\nAs said by Runekn so perfectly:\n"Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediately."\nThe community is incredibly active, and if the game is missing something (a jet, or faction, or gun), there are modders out there currently hard at work making this game more incredible.\nAt the time of writing, the first of three campaign episodes have come out, the next slated for early next year. The game is becoming more and more intricate as people "leave" ARMA II to rest for a bit while they pursue ARMA III and more Scenarios are being made (thanks to Workshop Integration).\nOverall, this is an excellent game, and if you're sick of CoD or BF, need a dose of excitement or realism, or just need a satisfying filler while the sequel [of CoD or BF] comes out, ARMA III will give the experience yourself looking for.\n","December 15, 2013","true","353.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

At the distance he shot at it would be impossible with an assault rifle.\n\nI've never really found ArmA as a game i would play by myself because it becomes boring and repetitive especially when you keep dying and most of the game consists of travelling to the battle.

I noted his location and then marked a right triangle on our map, finding that I was 320m North and 340m west of his position, the hypotenuse of the triangle was 467m (our distance). Then accounting for a 160m height differential between the target and I, our actual distance was 493m. Due to a slight Northern wind of about 5kph I adjusted my shot slightly to the right, I took the shot, striking the target in the right shoulder, killing him instantly.\n\n\n\nI had to use geometry and trig to play a video game.\n\nI approve 100%","September 17, 2013","true","139.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

We've played a few of the multiplayer modes and recently been playing the Battle Royale mod, (which is a BLAST when you finally get into a reliable server).\n\nAs others have mentioned, this is more of a combat simulation. It's unforgiving, which is why players need to use actual tactics to accomplish a goal.

This game makes Battlefield look like Call of Duty. This game has no linear gameplay, no solo mission, none of the garbage most of the modern day shooters have to offer.

Once i dragged half of my bleeding team out, i was assigned a special job, i was given satchel charges to blow up the objective, when i came up to the tower i had a little trouble setting it, but never the less i manage to place down the charge, as i ran back in a big rush to the heli evac, i looked around and saw the tower blow, it came crashing down into the hill.

Seriously, it fills the void.\n\nDon't buy this game unless you have a computer that can handle it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nConstant updates improved the game and made even vanilla gameplay a genuinely enjoyable experience, let alone the helicopter an marksman DLC.\n\nMods are better than ever. ACE 3 finally came out in an early state, but hopefully realism will flourish in Arma again. RPGs are improving a ton in mods with Arma 3 Life and other mods, as well as survival types with new content. RHS bring back US and Russian Forces in A3 quality and new maps continue to bring interest.\n\nStill requires a good build to enjoy the game. Although it's been much improved, still needs optimization.\n\nYou'll also want a good sound mod and Blastcore particle effects mod... its amazing.","February 13, 2014","true","825.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zestysock/recommended/107410/","zestysock","Cpt. Cthulhu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zestysock/","41 products in account","The latest installment for the military simulation franchise which has been around for eons is a very nice step in the right direction in general. Arma 3 Features two new maps called Stratis (which can be compared to Utes of Arma 2) and Altis, which is a mammoth sized map that stretches roughly 27 kilometers in East to West length. The Arma series has been prone to a multitude of bugs and poor optimization, which is still evident in the latest insatllment, yet the optimization has been FAR improved in this version of Bohemia Interactive's spotlight franchise. The graphics in this game are very improved and look beautiful on Ultra settings (that is, if you can run it). This game is still prone to glitches, bugs and sudden extreme drops of framerate without warning. Some of the bugs are eveident in player movent, which has been vastly improved upon the last installment, allowing you to take on 9 tactical positions when shooting. The movement is far less clunky and works much smoother than Arma 2. Some of the movement bugs can mean that you accidentally can get stuck in a rock or wall and end up dying from being squashed. The vehicles have been greatly improved offering far more realistic physics (however the physics are not on the par of games like Forza 5) with realistic vehicle speeds. The vehicles on the other hand are painstakingly delicate and fragile than before making vehicle operating quite frustrating at times. The weapon mechanics have been totally overhauled since the previous Arma game with new damage mechanics and far more realistic recoil effects. Arma 3 also has added a new dimension to its already diverse playability, adding a more in depth (no pun intended) maritime experience. This allows you to dive to the depths of th eocean and use submarises as well. Some of the things I want to see in Arma 3 are missing such as the ability to take cover behind doors of a vehicle whilst riding in it to avoid being shot easlliy (for example, if you are driving or in the passenger seat of a car you can hold a button to allow you character to switch into 1st person view and duck behind the dashboard and door of the car). Another missing feature is the ability to shoot in vehicles with you character's weapons allowing for military simmulation dirve-bys. My final verdict of Arma 3 is a very solid 8.5 out of 10. Arma 3 offers a very vast and expansive game that has a nearly infinite replayability, yet some of its bugs and optimization hold back Bohemia Interactive's flagship series back once more. If these glitches were to be fixed Arma 3 could be a very famous game that could be a serious threat to games like the Call of Duty franchise or Battlefield franchise as well. Buying this game is a choice you will not regret and with a little time and patience, you can have a blast on this game.","May 18, 2014","true","428.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

I love it and hate it at the same time at different moments. The increased modding capabilities really made me really interested. The main thing that REALLY disappointed me was the lack of variety in the weapons and vehicle department. They weren't really unique but the gear system helped add more variety to the cosmetics of the characters but, that doesn't really help due to the fact the weapons don't have much variety. I love the Arma 3 campaign, not as personal and deep as the Arma 2 campaign but still fun. There are still SOO many bugs that need fixing and Optimization for multiplayer FPS wise is very bad at the moment too. I still give this game a 7/10 since it has many abilities from Arma 2 and is still fun. Expect a lot of bugs though and a few random FPS drops but, that doesn't really effect the gameplay as much.","March 26, 2014","true","94.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yes.","October 30, 2014","true","378.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

But in my experience of the game its a bit like pancakes. So here is the recipe for success\n\nINGREDIENTS1 large egg or 1 egg and one yolk\n½ pint/280ml milk\n4oz/110g plain flour (4 heaped dessertspoons)\n1 tbsp melted butter\n\nMETHODBy hand: sift the flour into a bowl and make a well in the middle. Break in the egg (and yolk, if using) and add a pinch of salt and a splash of the milk. Whisk the egg, gradually incorporating the flour, to make a smooth cream. Whisk in the rest of the milk and the melted butter.\nWith a blender: put all the ingredients in a blender jug with a pinch of salt. Whizz until smooth. It should be no thicker than single cream.\nBrush a hot pan with vegetable oil before adding a ladleful of batter and swilling thinly around pan, tipping the pan so the mixture spreads evenly. It will begin to cook immediately: pour any excess back into the bowl.When the pancake is browned on the bottom and the very edges are beginning to lift away, give the pan a shake to make sure the pancake is loose. If it is sticking anywhere, use a spatula to loosen it. When it moves freely, then you are ready to toss it - or, if you're less confident, use a spatula to turn it over. The other side will only need a few seconds. Slide out of the pan, and try one of these delicious toppings","May 25, 2015","true","026.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

ArmA 3 is a tactical fps/third person shooter simulator. Quite a mouthful huh? ArmA 3, I would have to say is by far the best game I have ever played, and until ArmA 4 comes out, the best game I will ever play. Bohemia has truelly one upped most, if not all, shooting games out there to date. And with the mature, professional community that plays ArmA 3, it is not hard to find excellent modifications to the game. Some of the best community game mods I can recommend to you right now are Altis Life and ArmA 3 Life.\n\nHowever, should you find yourself more interested in the tactical side of ArmA, there are units out there that replicate real world military units, that provide tactical gameplay, as well as assisting you to better yourself in the field of ArmA 3. But before you go do anything, be sure to play the campaign, as that will help you learn ArmAs mechanics, and assist you in your career of ArmA. While I myself am still looking for a role play server. There are plenty of MilSim units out there though. 173rd Airborne Brigade, 15th MEU. Currently I am apart of the 173rd and can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it.

I know few people who gave up on this game because they could not instantly learn everything. (My opinion: I consider complicated games more fun tbh)\n\nIn Arma 2 (OA) I used to love armored tanks, and stationary artilery, but Arma 3 seems to lack both of them, there are both tanks and stationary artilery in game, but they don't feel same and are very less varied, thats just my opinion.\n\nGame would be nothing without third party modders and developers.\n\n9/10 - Really good game, could use more absolutely different maps (outside greece, for example something similar to takistan from arma 2 oa, you could use mods, but yeah..)\n\nEveryhting above is just my opinion, thanks for attention, and hopefully you enjoyed my review.\n","August 9, 2015","true","216.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I know few people who gave up on this game because they could not instantly learn everything. (My opinion: I consider complicated games more fun tbh)\n\nIn Arma 2 (OA) I used to love armored tanks, and stationary artilery, but Arma 3 seems to lack both of them, there are both tanks and stationary artilery in game, but they don't feel same and are very less varied, thats just my opinion.\n\nGame would be nothing without third party modders and developers.\n\n9/10 - Really good game, could use more absolutely different maps (outside greece, for example something similar to takistan from arma 2 oa, you could use mods, but yeah..)\n\nEveryhting above is just my opinion, thanks for attention, and hopefully you enjoyed my review.\n","August 9, 2015","true","216.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

ArmA 3 is a tactical fps/third person shooter simulator. Quite a mouthful huh? ArmA 3, I would have to say is by far the best game I have ever played, and until ArmA 4 comes out, the best game I will ever play. Bohemia has truelly one upped most, if not all, shooting games out there to date. And with the mature, professional community that plays ArmA 3, it is not hard to find excellent modifications to the game. Some of the best community game mods I can recommend to you right now are Altis Life and ArmA 3 Life.\n\nHowever, should you find yourself more interested in the tactical side of ArmA, there are units out there that replicate real world military units, that provide tactical gameplay, as well as assisting you to better yourself in the field of ArmA 3. But before you go do anything, be sure to play the campaign, as that will help you learn ArmAs mechanics, and assist you in your career of ArmA. While I myself am still looking for a role play server. There are plenty of MilSim units out there though. 173rd Airborne Brigade, 15th MEU. Currently I am apart of the 173rd and can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it.

The single player content, showcases and training are good. The real meat of the game is in its multiplayer though. Admittedly, it can be a bit confusing at first if you're a new player, as some servers require you to download mods before you can join the server. There doesn't tend to be a whole lot of "vanilla" servers out there. However, the mods are fantastic and worth the effort, especially if you play them with a group of people.\n\nMy favorite experience thus far was when we were playing the "Insurgency" mod (military vs terrorists). There's a mod called Task Force Radio, which in a nut shell provides much more realistic radios to use. Each faction has their own encrypted radio, various channels you can switch to and various ranges of radio (long range and short range). As the military, we were attempting to locate intel that was known to exist in a village. A squad was unfortunately KIA, and for the next two hours, the military was getting picked off constantly. I even deployed with a buddy deep into a mountain with full camo, let my team know that where I was and I had good sights on the village, and not 2 minutes later I got sniped even though I was hardly exposed and never took a shot. Later, it turns out they stole a radio off a dead squadmate and were listening to our radio chatter and our positions for 2 hours and we all had a good laugh as the terrorists won.\n\n10/10","December 30, 2014","true","66.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Yet it has tons of bugs, it's fun. If you are concerned that you won't like it, try watching some Altis Life videos on youtube, and buy the game when it is on Summer or Christmas sale on steam. Now, lets get to what really matters. There are two sides to this game. There are the RP servers, and then there are the MilSims. The RP (RolePlay) servers are easy to get, it deals with Altis and turns your  gaming experience into a life, which then you have to develop your character and become friends (Or enemies) with others. You can mug, kidnap, and ♥♥♥♥ (If you're experienced) other people. This gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs, and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun. If you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode, then go check the Millitary Simulation Servers. There are fewer of them, but they can be still be fun. This gamemode provides a damn good simulation of War on Altis. Ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops, this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in. That's all, hope it helped!

Don't take this the wrong way as ArmA 3 is a great game with the custimation or charcters, weapons and more but my biggest problem (and others) it that it lacks the conventional warfare that most ArmA fans were looking for. This was all found in ArmA, weapons you have heard of and excist but if you want these in ArmA 3 you need to mod them in. Another problem is that the map vareity is terrible, 2 maps...really? Plus the PVP is worse than ArmA 2 (somehow???). But this game has outstanding graphics and alot more features than the previous games.\n\nPros:\n-Good Graphics\n-Extra customization\n-Underwater yay!\n-CAN be operator as ♥♥♥♥ (but needs mods)\n-Better character movement and vehicle control\n-Better campaign (If you want to play it)\n\nCons: (Some are my own opinion)\n-Lacks realisic warfare\n-Needs mods to have half the weapons, factions and vehicles of ArmA 2\n-Again 2 maps really?! ArmA 2 had 4 on release...\n-Damage models are screwed in PVP which is worse than ArmA 2 somehow??\n-Getting shot makes you character do a ♥♥♥♥ing disco dance move which makes no sense at all\n-Good Graphics: I expand, you need a good system to even run this game on Low-Medium as I found out before I upgraded, even now with my new system (runs GTA 5, Far Cry4 etc on Max above 60fps+) this game runs like a dying dog, ArmA 2 i could max it and get 50+fps all the time, sometimes on ArmA 3 i struggle to get 30+fps.\n\nBut remember this review is MY opinion so take from it you will.
