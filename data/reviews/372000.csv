Many different ways to build your character, but limited (Reason in cons).\nHuge map to explore.\nMany levels giving it an interesting goal to get to cap. Current cap at this time is upwards of nearly 300 levels.\nMany items to gear your character. Most classes can go 1h + offhand/shield or 2handed weapon allowing you to go tanky or focus dps.\nYou generate TP (In-game Cash Shop currency) overtime, to a maximum of 5 TP. You can use this to get several items which includes Megaphones to use global chat (or shout chat for this game.\nCosmetics can have stat improvements to buff your character. (Con below to go with this.)\nCollections are rewarding by giving you bonus' for completing them. These bonus' are also carried across your entire Team (family/characters). (Con below to go with this.)\nFairly large storage which can be upgraded is a nice change from games which only allow 10-20 items to be stored.\nUpgrading gear isn't NEARLY as challenging as some other games making it nice to be able to upgrade gear. Your "fail chance" never drops below 51%.\nI feel this should be here. The game has a lot of grinding, you get to points in the level curve that you've completed all quests on both sides of the map and the next area is 10+ levels above you. You are forced to grind for 5-10 levels unless you've saved your EXP cards you get from questing to boost you through the curve and over to the exp reset. This can both be a pro and con since some people like the grind and some people hate it.\n\nCONS:No P2P trading for free users. Even Token is limited to 30 trades a month.\nCan't trade Silver (In-game general currency) through trading.\nExtremely limited AH, only 1 without a Token. Even with Token its limited to only 5 items for sale.\nAH is on a ridiculous timer to claim silver after an item is purchased. Nearly 2 days wait to retrieve most sales.\nAH takes a HUGE cut of profit, 30% might as well vendor the items unless they're worth 1mil+ even then you lose a ton. Token users get this reduced to (?15%?)\nLoot distribution is allocated to persons dealing highest amount of damage on every setting. Tested and confirmed, aprox ~90% of the time the person with highest damage gets loot. As an aoe wizard I clear groups and get most if not all loot over my friends in the party through-out the zone. Even on round-robin I had gotten 5 items before someone else got 1.\nBuffs are limited. Yes you heard that right, BUFFS are limited. There are skills that increase how many buffs you can have, and buffs that give you more... buff slots. Token users can have more buffs.\nLimited dungeon entries. You can't freely grind dungeons like, nearly, EVERY other MMORPG out there. For some reason its crazy bad if you can grind exp/loot in a dungeon, limit is 2 entries per day, 3 for Token users.\nLimited Global chat, or shout chat. You need to spend TP (In-game Cash Shop currency) to buy Megaphones to talk in global (shout). There is a pro to this as seen above though.\nSome of these limitations are to stop gold spammers/sellers (RMTers) but are completely useless since there are still hundreds of gold spammers per day. The only real thing the limitations do is destroy the multiplayer aspect of the game.\nSelected wrong class for advancement? Sucks to be you, make a new character, enjoy grinding to 200 again. You can buy a Skill Reset potion which will allow you to reset skill allocations, but not your chosen class advancement.\nTokens CAN'T be given to people to allow them to become premium, since you can't trade to non-token players. Even if you could trade, Tokens can't be traded except for through the marketplace. ADDITIONALLY, only Tokens bought through TP (In-game Cash Shop currency) can actually be sold.\nGuilds can't be made unless you become a Templar class which is Swordsman ONLY access. As far as my own research has gone, you need select it for your 7th class advancement, which is pretty much end game, before you can even think about leading.\nAttribute training is limited to RESEARCHING 1 at a time, 2 for Token users. This can be confusing as the game says you can only learn 1 at a time, but it actually means you can only research 1 at a time. You can learn ALL attributes, it just takes time (and Silver).\nEnchanting a cosmetic costs an Enchanting Scroll from the TP Cash Shop. Enchanting is extremely RNG and you could waste $100 and not get anything worth anything.\nCollections can be complicated. You must first find a hidden chest (if there is one) in the Area you are to start a collection. Then you must collect misc material drops which can include rare accessory's and armor or weapons. Additionally, you must take the collection crate to allow the collection to an NPC in town. To complete the collection you need to put the items in the collection vendor which consumes them.\nSpecific class restricted crafting. Some Classes (Archer/Wizard) have a special class advancement allowing them to craft special items. You must take that class over a DPS/Support class in order to make these items or buy them from someone who can.\nYou must talk to a specific TP Cash Shop vendor to buy TP items. you need to plan ahead or risk needing to teleport back if you want to grab an item (Soul Stone, EXP tome, etc)\nWhen upgrading an item after X amout of upgrades you have a chance to fail and lose potential, after all potential is gone the item will be destroyed. Trading, team sharing, adding a gem socket, or buying an item from the AH causes the item to lose 1 potential instantly.\nWhen using Team Storage you decrease item potential by 1 making trading items between characters just as bad as buying from the AH.\nI didn't know where to stick this info since it's both Pro and Con.\nControls can be funky. (I haven't played with a controller yet.) There are 4 modes. Auto, Keyboard, Mouse, and Controller.\nCurrently I reccomend Mouse controlls. It makes the game play like a normal Top-Down ARPG, point & click to move/attack, 1-0 to use skills, and multiple action bars for more skills. F1-12 open misc windows, help, character info, inventory, party, friends.\nKeyboard mode was too funky for me to play with, you don't use your mouse at all unless its interacting with menus. Letter keys for skills (not numbers... dont ask me why) I was forced to use this mode so I could use spacebar to interact with something to gather something without attacking at one point, probably a bug.\nI have no clue how controller mode works, but I've heard some good and bad, so I'll leave it at that until I can test it.\nNot sure what Auto mode does. Seems to switch to auto after you've selected your prefered mode.\nGame starts you in Keyboard mode. Switch to Mouse ASAP unless you like that mode.\n\nFinal notes:\nIf you didn't get founders pack 2 or 1, or are F2P on release, My experience without a Token was; The game is NOT an MMORPG. It's a Single-Player-with-other-people-walking-around-kill-stealing game. The lack of many key features makes it very hard for me to consider this an MMORPG while the only thing you can do together is party/quest/grind\nMy Experience as a Token user opened up a lot more MMO stuff, however there are still some insane limitations that shouldn't exist. Mainly Trading, and dungeon entries.\n\nAdding this in because of someones comment.\nYou can buy a premium Token for a ton of Silver from the AH. ATM this price is about 500,000 Silver which can be midgame.","March 31","false","125.7"," 931 of 1,205 people (77%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","77","931","1","29","77"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036188611/recommended/372000/","76561198036188611","Sinon's Ass Online","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036188611/","25 products in account","Strongly recommend this for veteran MMORPG players\nIf you're in for a long, detailed read then proceed. That's just my writing style. If not then there's a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nIf you're a veteran MMORPG player from the golden age of MMORPG's, you've come to the right place. Tree of Savior is just about the only MMORPG to release in this decade that caters exactly to those that are fond of hardcore MMORPGs of an age long ago. The style, feel, input and feedback of the game pays much homage to MMORPG titles such as Ragnarok Online. In fact, the original director of Ragnarok Online is the director for this game. You can rest assured that this game will keep you busy with lots to do and much fun to be had.\n\nNow let's get into the actual critic. This is actually my first review but I've played MMORPG's my entire life and have played this title for more than my actual listed play time.\n\nPROS :\n\nExtreme class diversity\nUnique class system\nCustomizable stat distribution\nRustic, nostalgic art style\nAmazing soundtrack\nHidden sub-quest lines\nRandomly generated events\nSupport-type player friendly!\nBoss monsters have attack patterns\nAlright. Let's put everything into context.\n\nFirst and foremost is definitely the rustic feel of this game. The art style, atmosphere, music, everything just plays so well into constructing an amazing world for you to explore. The art style is extermely reminiscent of Ragnarok Online and some view Tree of Savior as the "true" sucessor to Ragnarok Online. You have all the amazing customizability and environment from Ragnarok Online put into a much more modern take on the same genre without losing it's original feel.\n\nThe biggest attraction of Tree of Savior would definitely have to be the class system. Tree of Saviors class system is very unique in that a player can custom tailor their class to fit their specific play style. Are you a "Swordsman" class but prefer to use many new active skills instead of basic attacks? Advance into "Highlander" or "Barbarian" to progress down those paths and gain access to a whole new branch of skills. But maybe you enjoy using basic attacks. If that's the case, you can choose to further hone your skills as a "Swordsman" and invest further into your original first class instead of advancing into a "Highlander" or "Barbarian". Tree of Savior gives players the opportunity to "Rank up" their current class instead of advancing to a new class and increase the maximum skill levels of their current class' abilities, giving them potential to be stronger than those that followed a different path if utilized correctly.\n\nTree of Savior also encourages players to diversify their class choices to fit their play style. Just because you chose the path of a Wizard and advanced into a Pyromancer doesn't mean you're stuck being a flame based magic user forever. You can easily advance into a Cryomancer at the next class advance and become both! Just because you chose the path of magic doesn't mean your only role is damage dealing. You can advance into other classes that compliment your current set of skills as well. A Pyromancer has the ability "Flame Ground" which sets an area ablaze dealing Damage over Time. Should a Pyromancer also advance into a "Linker", a class that specializes in monster manipulation, the "Pyro-Linker" could set ground abalaze, "link" together monsters, and drag them over the fire to be slow roasted. There are plenty of classes with complimenting skills such as this example. The greatest thing about Tree of Savior is finding them all and trying them.\n\nCustomizable stat distribution is a very big thing for me. It means that the game does not have a "preset" style of playing that the game has already defined for you. If you feel like being a warrior class that goes complete glass cannon and forsakes all durability put everything into Strength and have at it. If you feel like playing a Wizard up close and personal you can easily stat in some extra Vitality for some health. If you feel that you want to shoot arrows faster rather than harder, you can easily stat in Agility for some speed. Being able to customize your stat inputs helps you refine what your playstyle would be instead of just following along a guide.\n\n\nNow onto the cons. A game without cons does not exist. But Tree of Savior has some debateable cons so let's get into them.\n\nCONS:\n\nLinear Leveling system\nBizarre map layout\nSegregated maps\nGrind\n\nTree of Savior players on a linear leveling system of starting at level 1, to infinity. That is to say, there is no level cap. In concept, this is designed so that players play at their own pace because there is no race to a "end game" goal to do content. Players will just play at their own leisure finishing content as they progress into different worlds and areas. However players must be reminded that this was originally a Korea MMORPG. It takes alot. alot. Of grinding to progress speedily. In my humble opinion this is actually a good way to gate players from speeding through the entire games' content in a single week. But in a game whoms biggest emphasis is replayability by creating multiple characters in different classes, it just slows down progress a ton and doesn't feel great. Grind is both a necessity but a gimp when it comes to MMORPG designing. In all honesty comparatively to other MMORPG's, the grind isn't so bad but it is there nonetheless.\n\nThis may be a smaller point but the map layout for Tree of Savior is a bit strange. You'll be progressing linearely through the game and maps and everything will be placed within your level zone, but should you decide to explore a bit the map directly underneath your level 20 map could be a level 100+ map. Now the monsters won't instantly agro and oneshot you or anything, infact they won't agro you at all if you're out of the level gap, but it's just a bit strange unless you're the explorative type. Because of the linear map progression based on current level, you'll never really re-visit older maps save for farming specific materials or major towns and adjacent fields.\n\n\nMy conclusion for this game is you should definitely try it. Whether you're an MMORPG Veteran or a newbie to the genre the experience playing it was amazing and you won't experience another game like it.\n\n\nTL;DR It's not even that much. Go read it. I put my heart into it :'(\n\nWow fine I'll add an actual TL;DR cause people are downvoting me cause there isn't one\n\nTree of Savior sums up as\n\n+ Player-tailored Skill system\n+ Hardcore classic MMORPG\n+ Immense amounts of replayability\n- Grind (eh.)\nIf you enjoy exploring different class combinations to find that one style that you really enjoy, try ToS. The grind isn't that bad if you don't have intention to blaze through the game. Amazing game to play with friends and setup super cool party combinations. Very classic game that is considered the successor to "Ragnarok Online", the king of MMORPG's in Asia in the past.\n\nThanks for reading my very first review :) See you guys on Tree of Savior.","March 19","true","215.9"," 372 of 473 people (79%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","79","372","473","27","10"

One of my favorite things about it is the International community, everyone speaks different languages, everyone has a different grind, a different strategy on doing things.. Tree of Savior has the most toxic, most racist playerbase i've ever seen!\n\nThey pretty much runned the Brazilian players off the server! Some are to blame for recent exploiting, but others were really nice.. anyway they're all gone now. IMC moved them to a different server and there goes 1/3 of my friends list, the few that are left are being automatically blocked due to some bug after the previous maintenence, so I currently have nomore friends.\n\nI'm writing this here because I wanted to write about it at the forums, but I'm constantly getting 404 errors or the forums would not load at all.. yeah i'm getting tired of this game and it hasn't even fully launched yet\nAlready bought the expansion to Guild Wars II and thats where i'm going.\n\nSo to anybody thats waiting on this game, or dying to play it.. don't get your hopes up its gonna be a big waste of time and disappointment, no doubt the game will be overrun by gold spammers and botters once its F2P","May 4","false","478.9"," 1,256 of 1,674 people (75%) found this review helpful 98 people found this review funny","75","256","1","98","79"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotharaxe/recommended/372000/","lotharaxe","Lothar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotharaxe/","36 products in account","It is hardly worth reviewing this game, given the hype around it is so high that people couldn't care less about listening to other's views on it. There are many videos on youtube covering this game, guides, wikis and many other material, so if you haven't already clearly decided that this is the best game ever, you probably haven't seen enough of internet latelly, or maybe you aren't yet convinced that it is that great of a game.\n\nIf you meet any of the last cases, then maybe my review will see an use in your screen.\n\nFirst of all I do not recommend this game, based on my own personal reasons, expectations, and experience with playing in two betas, and open release.\n\n(1). Obligatory Linear Questing.\n\nBe not swayed by the similarity and countless links to Ragnarok Online, which is the main reason of the hype surrounding this game. Tree of Savior's experience is hardly anything similar to it.\n\nInstead of keeping it's "Soul Predecessor"'s legacy of open and free to explore world and lore, Tree of Savior falls to the exhaustively explored style of Obligatory Linear Questing, in which the player is forced to go through a linear story quest from the beginning to the end, being carried through a linear path along the maps to see the end of the story and the entire content.\n\nDisappointing isn't enough to start describing the feeling of having to do the questing line for every character I made, which, on itself, is hardly entertaining or interesting even once. To skip dialogues is the most trivial if not natural reflex in this game, given how obvious the story is:\n\n"Darkness was sealed by the goddesses."\n\n"But now Darkness returned and the goddesses are nowhere"\n\n"The chosen one (you) will find them and save the world"\n\nThat's it.\n\nAnd of course, since the story is shoved in your face, that makes it even less appealing. Tree of Savior's lore isn't good enough to make a movie out of it, or cinematics, or cut scenes, or animations, ANYTHING. It is worthless. Who cares?\n\nInstead of learning from Ragnarok Online that had a open world with lore scattered through it, and you had to, individually, find them, IF YOU WANTED TO, that made the discoveries a lot more appealing. That also led to Ragnarok Online creating individual places in the world with extremelly interesting, and sometimes creepy, stories. Some of them needed quests to be unlocked.\n\nBut no. Shove the extremelly boring and clichê story in our faces through a "Must Be Done" story quest line, like any other MMORPG in the market, because that's "just how it is done".\n\nBad choice developers. Bad choice.\n\n(2). Class System Wastes It's Own Diversity Potential.\n\nSince the game has around 80 classes, the game developers decided that they had enough classes to use and throw away. In this game, classes have linear skill power. Which means that the first classes are weaker, and the later ones stronger, turning skills and classes in the beginning of the game almost completelly useless later on.\n\nNevermind if you enjoyed playing one of the first classes, it will be completelly useless in the late game.\n\n(3). Class System is Too Diverse for no Resets.\n\nDespite having 80 classes and even many more class combinations, the game doesn't offer a class reset system.\nWhich is absurd. So far it seems players can only have about 22 characters, given they buy the right "Barracks" for so. Even with 22 character slots, it isn't enough to explore all the game's classes and combinations, which tells how limited the player's experience of the game is going to be.\n\nWhy not allow players to switch between classes they've unlocked, like in Final Fantasy 14, or Eden Eternal? It makes absolutelly no sense for such a design choice, given the absurd ammount of classes, and how many class choices and combinations end up breaking your character into something so useless that it gets stuck. Yes...\n\n(4). Some Class Choices and Combinations are Useless.\n\nIf you have tried Wizard III in Tree of Savior, directly, you have discovered through the most painful way that you will have to delete your character, because it is useless. Given the diversity of class combinations, and the linear grindy questing, there are many ways to get stuck in this game with a frustrating character that doesn't work. And you can't fix that.\n\n(5). Lack of Item Transfer Between One's Own Characters.\n\nBut hey, you can at least transfer your stuff to a new character right? If you've found yourself wanting to delete a character given how useless it is, remember that you cannot transfer all your spoils to another of your characters, unless you have help from someone else, or buy a token with real money. Way to waste someone's time!\n\n(6). Fails to MMO.\n\nDo you enjoy waiting for that specific mob to respawn so a high level player appears and instantly kills it? Do you enjoy competing with 8 players for 4 Tree Saps that respawn each in 5 minutes? Do you enjoy the fact that your high level character cannot play with low level characters, because the level of them will not synchronize?\n\nKill Steal, Resource and Mob Competition, and lack of Level Synchronization. Failures of old times, design consequences that were constant in old MMOs and tended to disappear in the last few years are back, reminding people how MMOs weren't about playing with other people, but annoying the hell of each other.\n\n(7). Wasted Potential.\n\nThis game's design point towards the possibility of an extremelly fun dungeon-crawler, focused on the flexibility and diversity of builds, focused on killing monsters, trying different builds, and different party combinations, you know, just like Ragnarok Online.\n\nThat is almost how this game is already, except that everything is wasted on it's own limitations. Killing monsters randomly is hardly worth experience (unless you have a party that is alone in a specific juicy hunting spot, that is extremelly rare btw). Trying new builds is limited, because there is no class resets, and dungeons are extremelly hard, rare and stupid. Plus, there is no level syncronization, finding new party members becomes harder, and playing with your friends even harder.\n\nMost of the content is focused on questing, which gives you a fractioned experience between useless and meaningless walls of texts and dumb annoying objectives, that instead of working as unique content, like in its "Soul Predecessor", Ragnarok Online, in which questing was mainly used to unlock places and obtain rare and unique equipment, in this game, and like almost any other MMORPG in the market, quests are just more of the same, they are just means to obtain XP. A completelly wasted effort to create content just for the sake of obtaining the same reward: Experience. Something that could be obtained by just killing hordes of monsters. Wasted content.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs a Veteran Ragnarok Online player, and a player of over 180 hours of Tree of Savior divided in two betas I was extremelly disappointed with the way they carried the development of this game. There are many nonsensical design choices that just, clearly, remove fun from this game, turning it more inconvenient and extremelly grindy, with no respect whatsoever to the player, to the community, and to the game itself. They learned absolutelly nothing from Ragnarok Online (including the mistakes), the mechanics are mostly old fashioned, and many decisions, mostly made as a way to explore the Free to Play model, end up destroying this game's experience.\n\nYou WILL be swayed by the graphics.\nYou WILL be swayed by the soundtrack.\nYou WILL be swayed by the class options.\n\nBut eventually you will find that the game had no substance, and you will be morbidly disappointed, for the horrible failure this game is.\n\nI'm sorry to tell, but this game isn't worth that much time, even less any coin.","March 28","false","190.5"," 908 of 1,304 people (70%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","70","908","1","57","94"

And some classes are taged by community to play roles even if they cant do it (sword man classes have "tank" if you have 1 circle in def class or clerics are "runing hp bot" even if thyere speced for melee dmg)\n\n2. boss camping (high level players) will just sit 24/7 and mnopolize world bosses that are one of the "end game" features ( and it doesnt matter if that boss is in 50,100 or 200 lvl are they will camp it).And with that they can control the whole server market prices\n\n3 Totaly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ merket restictions made to fight RMT-that whay devs say. This crap only hits normal players and RMT parasiotes dont care or its not hiting them that hard. For example if it set that 1 flower costs 100 silver you cant sell it for lower price than 100 (and some items have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ high min prices thats not even worth losing money to just list them in market because noonewill buy it)\n\n4 Lags freezes crashes dc etc are worse and worse with every patch(to the point that after 400 h gameplay i have enought of this game or play 1-2 max when servers are empty)\n\n5 bugs explots etc that were reported in betas and are not fixed till this day\n\n6 no comunication with devs - there was one staff member on forum that care about players and comunicated with us but then she got fired for trying to suggest to devs what ppl said on forum and from that point its total silence. Ppl in froum made a lot threads to convince devs to change F2P release due to bugs etc and devs pushed it anyway not fixing anything (after a fast check on forum i still see some ppl writing that they can log in on some chars fo 10+ days due to some kind of bug)\n\n7 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decision for sub accs or taxes in game and some other ones. For example\n-trade only for token users ( 30 per month....so gl rading crafter pots with friends (1 po = 1 trade count))\n\n-10 market items to 1 item for free users (seling slots),\n\n-30% tax from cash after selling item to 10% for tokens(if you sell it because listing items take youre cash too)\n\n-50% tax on crafting classes (for example to get small "profit" ppl need to sell something for 100 silver if they set it for 50 theyre get nothing and if they set price lower than 50 theyll lose silvers)\n\n-no circle resets - lets sey theyve released mroe classes and theyre not synerging with classes you already have ? well leave/delete char with 200,300,400+ lvl and make a new one\n\n-only 6 ppl in world boss fight with the highest dps will get cube with items(as i said before max lvl ppl are camping bosses so ppl with lowerlevel/worse gear wont get any chance to get loot)\n\n-guild can be made by picking a cricle in one class tree (sordsman cricle 7 so around ~220 lvl)\n\n-talth - this item is for guild but everyone can drop it...wel its not a problem if everyone can drop it but 99,99% of the time boss drop from dungeons.world boss/ daily mission dungeon etc will drop talt for you (drop from those boss cubes are TALT boss card and rare items)\n\n- restrictions on cards, Cads are used by 3 classes (atm) and for xollection/card game ( thats so rng that you can lose 20 time in a row and then win to lose again 10 times and so on) yo can sell/trade/trasfer to other char in youre acc them because reasons. So if youre one of those 3 classes that are using cards as dps source you need to grind extra hard to level up youre card that is used for dps (any by extra hard i mean doing dungeons and rerolling boss cubes (the higher level the dung the more it costs) because most of the time youll get talt)\n\n-drop rate-looking at some database sites (even korean one) sometine yo can see devs laughing in youre face because they know that drop rate is low and its broken. You want to get one item for collection (collections will give you very small account wide stats (for example +5 to health regen or 1 crit rests)) gl with grinding bec ause some items are so hard to get yo can kill 10k mobs and dont get it and while grinding you can also drop a lot items that have drop rate like 0,1,0,001 or so drop rate. I was raised by grind games and then kr grind games but some items here are so freaking hard to get its unmaginable (example....+5 hp regen collection item drops with around ~0,01% from mob that spawns every 20-30 min with 1-3 mobs that can spawn in a location when everyone is questing and high level players are farming him for high level recipes or card level colleciont with +3def that needs boss card from bosses that yoy can fight only ONCE per character because theyre quest bosses)\n\n-spawn rate -the biggest naile in the coffin to this game. THIS IS A GRIND GAME and spawn rate is so low sometimes you can kill 60 mobs in a map before first one that you killed will spawn and if you add to it limited channels (1-15 lvl ~10 channels 50 lvl 6 channels 80-90 4 channels and after 90 or 100 there are only 2 channels per map) and a lot of ppl (it was hard sometime in EA to make a quest/farm something and not its/itll be even worse) its a nightmare. And thos leads to ksing other (support char that are alone will be most hurt)\n\n-limited dungeon/mission etc - youll get 2 (3 for token users) chances to go to dungeon that give you a lt of exp(if youre in+/- 5 level range but the highr you are the less exp youll get) but if you get dc/bug/crash or god know what 1 entry is lost( and for ppl that are more dungeon focused in other mmos wont like it)\n\n-"forcing" to play in party-in early levels its too easy to play and you can mostly solo everything( exept world bosses) but later on ~190-200 level youre "forced" to play in party to progress. Mobs have OP dmg and HP to compensate broken ai so soloing (if youre solo player or youre friends are not online) is almost impossible (for some clases) or impossible at all\n\n-not fixing gampead controls (that were reported in FIRST beta)- one of the points that devs were proud of then the game was still developed. Some functions are not working and you cant change key binds on gamepad options so if you want to play using game pad forget comfy char/couch because you will need to use gamepad,keyboard,and mouse to\nplay\n\n-and many many more\n\n8 Some stats are useless.\n-hp/sp(mana) regen is so slow its useless so ppl dring potion\n-spr is useless for almost every class that does not have skills scalled with it\n-evansion is good for phys dmg but forget about magic dmg you cant evande magic\n-Con is only good for max hp\n-and the last stats STR and INT have 10% boost every class rank some ppl dump almost everything in it and those stats give +1 min and max dmg\n\n9 No countermeasures for bots. Its cute that now and then devs will say "hey weve bannes x ppl for being bots" and they you see bots in a 50 lvl map that youve reported 4 times in the last 3 days\n\n10 Almost no optimization. Games does not care if you have a 500 $ or 2000$ PC in city you will have 20-25 fps same with maps where a lot of ppl are farming (or even in 5 man dungs with flashy spell spam)\n\n11 PVP is thrash due to bad balance between classes (mage classes are the bet for pvp because magic cant be evaded)\n\nThere are more cons a lot more but im too tired to write them ( thyre probably in other reviews),\n\nAt this point i cant recommend this game to anyone. Game has a lot of potential but IMC is too small to fix everything in reasonable time (well bugs that were reported in beta are still here to it show how fast they can fix something),\n\nIt can be good in future(probably) and you dont mind cons try it but if youre an old RO player dont bother... RO is still better","May 14","false","449.7"," 231 of 318 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","231","318","7","4"

I've separated the game itself from the publisher's handling of it because that's a different, much uglier, can of worms.\n\nPros\n+ Great music\n+ Great art\n+ Some aspects of combat, like landing hits, feel satisfying\n+ Some of the quest objectives are creative\n+ Versatile class advancement system\n\nCons\n- Linear progression\n- Lifeless story\n- Player trade is locked behind a monthly paywall. This includes players who have paid trying to trade with players who haven't. It's sub-to-sub only.\n- Account-wide storage is locked behind a monthly paywall. If there is a method to transfer items to alts without subbing, I'm not aware of it.\n- Grind-heavy. Not a con on its own, more on this later.\n- Unchallenging combat\n- Unforgiving class/skill selection. Do research ahead of time because any mistakes made are permanent.\n- Outdoor quest credit is not shared between all players taking part, only party members. This means that if there are fifty players in one area waiting for a quest mob to spawn, it will take at least 10 respawns of that mob for all players to finish the quest, assuming they only need to kill it once and all 50 players are in parties of 5. This is made worse by the current respawn timers, more on this later.\n- Dungeons are very widely staggered level-wise and have a daily entrance level of 2. One run takes about 10 minutes to complete.\n- Questing alone is not enough to progress.\n\nCurrent publisher issues\n- Heavy server-side lag\n- Gold seller spam is rampant. There isn't much the company can do about this this early on.\n- Respawn timers are extremely long, somewhere in the realm of 1~2 minutes, while monsters die extremely quickly and are highly contested. This inflates the grind by forcing players to simply sit in one area waiting for the next wave of respawns because they cannot progress otherwise. Progression is entirely linear and all players must go through the same areas in the same order to quest, so questing areas are always full of players competing for quest credit on the next wave of respawns. Quests that could be completed in minutes may take much longer depending on how many waves of respawns you end up sitting through.\n\nFinal thoughts\nWhile I plan to play this game a bit longer, it's not something I would recommend to friends or something I see myself playing in the long-term. I play it because Ragnarok is dead and this reminds me of it, but the visuals are where the resemblance ends. Progression and questing are riddled with poor design choices that the industry outgrew over a decade ago, the servers are overcrowded, and current respawn timers make play unpleasant. For all of its flaws though, it does look and sound pretty.\n\n2016/04/05 Update\nAn update has made the game much more playable. Some of the worst issues have been fixed (server stability, dungeon queues, and respawn rate were all addressed), though many still remain. The market issues are on being worked on and if they're also changed I'll update this again with a thumbs up. While the game is definitely in a better place than last week, the player trade restrictions, storage restrictions, and 48 hour waiting period to receive your money from sold auctions are all still in place. It's difficult to recommend a game where these features exist.","April 2","false","26.7"," 530 of 768 people (69%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","69","530","768","25","14"

The world map is set up like a giant flowchart. This really hurts the immersion of the game, and in my opinion, is one of its largest flaws. The maps are made specifically to get the player from level x to level y, rather than being an explorable part of the game's world. Every time you outlevel a map, that part of the world becomes useless to you. All of these beautiful areas that you explore become void after you "complete" them because the developers only created them for the express purpose of leveling you through a certain range. This makes the game just seem like a series of rooms rather than a virtual world.\n\nBoss fights are boring.\n\n- They seem cool at first, until you realize that they re-use the same formula for every single boss in the entire game: "traps" (that don't thematically fit the boss at all) randomly spawn around the area, the boss has a distastefully large amount of HP, and it has maybe one attack that requires the player to actually react. The fights are never challenging, and the devs knew this, which is why they gave them tons of HP to compensate (so now we have painfully long, boring fights). The bosses also spend a lot of time just sitting there staring at you, doing absolutely nothing while you whale on them. All of those awesome boss entrances you see in the steam trailers couldn't be more any more misleading to how lifeless the bosses actually are.\n\nMonster behavior is terrible.\n\n- They'll hit you once, and then idle in place for about 3 seconds before they decide to continue chasing you. It makes every monster feel like a training dummy or a ragdoll, which is unfortunate because the combat system itself is pretty fun. They are lifeless, and barely move around on their own. If you've played a Dynasty Warriors game, it's pretty much like that. You have all of these amazing, flashy abilities, but monsters just kind of loaf around and wait for you to blast them all to bits. Cool for a few hours, but doing this for 250+ levels worth of content just isn't acceptable. There are other MMOs that do this, but they have other features that make the effortless slaughter more acceptable. Games like Maplestory and Latale, for example, can at least get away with this type of gameplay because they have immersive worlds that are actually explorable (and even their monsters are more responsive than the ones in ToS).\n\nThe class system just doesn't work well.\n\n- It sounds great on paper, but it turns out to be a pretty lackluster feature once you actually play. It's meant to create more distinction between players of the same base-class, but everyone ends up using the same skills. There are classes and skills that are very interesting, but pointless to pick due to poor class balance. It tends to feel like you're simply the product of the strongest class you have specced into. Even if you aren't technically a carbon copy of another player, the differences will be so miniscule that you feel the same.\n\n- Additionally, the devs have now made it so that you can "go back" through the class tree at any time, which totally ruins the branching sub-jobs. Before, each time you ranked up, you had to choose between one of two classes that had vastly different playstyles (such as a supportive ice magic kit vs. a destructive fire magic kit), or choose to rank up your current class instead. The classes you didn't choose would no longer be available for your character. They removed this restriction, and now you can rank up any class that you've reached the level requirement for. While this technically gives the player more freedom, it makes for much less thematic characters that end up seeming like a mish-mash of the strongest skills from every class. The original system created unique strengths and weaknesses for the player depending on what they chose (more Crowd Control and party-oriented play as cryomancer, or more DPS and solo oriented play as pyromancer?), but now everyone can just do everything, and frankly, that's pretty lame.\n\nThe instanced dungeons feel awkward, tedious, and almost forced, as if the devs just threw them in to fit some sort of MMO standard.\n\n- They don't flow with the rest of the game, the bosses are no different from the bland story quest fights, and they don't introduce any new mechanics. I don't feel like there's a point to them. The monsters inside are often re-used models with inflated hp bars. They're not any more difficult than the rest of the game's content. It doesn't even feel rewarding to complete them; it's just a huge timesink. This is another example of the devs caring less about the soul of their game and more about what is currently popular in korean mmos.\n\n\n=====================================================\n\n\nToS relies on its beauty to divert attention from its terrible game design, which has evidently worked. The saddest thing about ToS is that, as has already been said, it's a big waste of potential. If you're a vet MMO player, you'll know that the modern MMO market is pretty bad. ToS had an opportunity to be something worthwhile in the sea of garbage we have today, and chose not to. The core gameplay, amazing OST, creative spells, character and monster sprites, class concepts, and vivid environments are all great building blocks; they were just put together incorrectly.\n\nThe game's fundamental flaws are mentioned in several other steam reviews (including the current top review), and these reviews always have an overwhelming number of downvotes. Which says a lot about the game's fanbase.","March 28","false","34.5"," 356 of 528 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","356","528","12","12"

For players who prefer a less grindy and expect   instant graftication  and less premium features for payers, this may not be the game for you. This game has its flaws, but the developers passion for it can be shown in thier effort to listen to the community at times.\n\nNew update -\nThe past week has been quite a breath of fresh air reports on bots and gold seller BANNED and relocation of actual server to respective zones, this makes my ping 15... omg..\n\n\nAfter playing more than 220 hours, for all its flaws, it brings me back to mmorpg of old times of grind fest.(beside the market and trade restriction, IMC is trying this to control the gold seller and bots). However the core of the game, grinding and looting, unique classes building for pve; pvp or gvg remains there.\n\nWhile i feel the token restriction is broken for people who do not pay and those who complain.. why not give a consideration that they did not pull the game out of thier butt for free, i mean just get a token and play. In which i must say you could probably grind out to buy ANOTHER TOKEN in the market! (its pretty easy to earn silver at higher level)\n\nThis game is flawed in some areas, but it does bring it back up with its cool classes, artwork and loveee the music. Some aspect of the game is still unpolished, like game graphic optizimation, stronger anti cheat shield, refining the trade system,more detailed skill descriptions. its a diamond in the rough.\n\n(for ppl who wonder why only a single class can form a guild.. i would say i rather not have tons of small self contained guilds crowding server spaces but huge guilds that engage in huge battles.\n\nLastly This game is free in the middle of may.\n\n\nEDIT - i read through the negatives and my thoughts.\n1- Bots\n2- Farming/drop rate system\n3- killsteal\n4- people/bots spamming shout\n5- bugs/coding issue\n6- class balance\n7 - p2w and headgears\n8 - market/ trades\n9-  Limited dungeon\n\n1 - Well if you have been checking ToS website last 7 days, they have banned thousands of botters and gold sellers. so its a good start =]\n\n2 - If you play this game and complain about farm/ grind or drop rate, i have no idea why you are playing this game... i mean there are plenty of mmorpg that has loads of drop (D3) instant max lv (WoW). I mean if drop rate was bump up and farming and grinding was easy, wouldnt it sprout comments that game too easy, maxed level (nothing else to do) and too much drops = market saturation = oversupply = more complaining. so bear with it, Kinda thrilling if it drops a super rare orange recipe for you and you go OMG YESSSSS! i gonna rub it in my friends face!\n\ndrop rate is unfair thats life. unless you wanna play a game that gives u X item for X amt of time or mobs you did? I grinded a monster that dropped a bow i wanted, after being top 3 players killing it and i got zich, i sighed and moved on. its life.\n\nI find the respawn rate reasonable, as you do need to know some class cant kill as fast as others, further more it would be pointless if there was near instant respwan rate, everyone would stand still and hit till kingdom come. learning how to farm and lure mobs is the idea, if there is a mass of players in the map, give other maps a try instead of just bunching your fist in fustration, instead try find new farming spots for yourself =] . STOP googling where is the best spot to farm! jeeze explore and learn!\n\nUPDATE - at higher levels i know you will feel the squeeze, but thats why socializing is so impt in a MMO rpg.. get a team and farm tgt =] and ks others who dare to invade! do missions!\n\nLastly they even give u exp cards! its like cheating =x\n\n3 - To be honest if you hate kser, you wont enjoy much of this game, I remember RO it was practically the norm to taut rivals by killstealing, leading to guild wars and pvp and trashtalkinig, it was really fun! i got the bad end of the stick a few times, but if you do not like killsteal, i think GUILDWARS 2 is a really fun game with zero ks element.\n\ni mean i know maybe people work and study and have 2 hours of play time a day, if thats the case, get to know friends, party up and KS back! stop soloign too much or well you know you can just play...\n\ngasp Archer  -.-\n\n4 - Well you know there is a option to hide the bar on top and in your chat box right? They server splits have come, so you will see more of your native language. And alot of gold sellers spammers has been banned <3\n\n5 - The game has came far and has been working hard to fix bugs, though more springs up at times, [dc at dungeon] i do have to say IMC has been doing a fair job at compensating us and trying to make our gameplay enjoyable! though they have to give us more time before kicking us out for urgent maintance sometimes =x\n\n6 - firstly i believe classes are not balanced too, but to be honest why do you want it be? i mean its fun punishing players who randomly learn skill and classes. I feel this is INTENDED TO MAKE SOME PEOPLE to put in effort in building thier characters. If you want cookie cutter builds, go ahead, but in my experience, the best class builds for pvp are seldom shared. THOSE PLAYERS earned it and experiment it and suffered for it..\n\nJUST taking someone else build and then complaining for it shows lack of effort, it could be your decision to follow it blindly.\n\n7 - to be honest if its purely for pve pay to win you would not notice too much of a difference as i would say tier 1 stat on such headgear is HP. so it doesnt affect u if the other dude has 2.4k hp on total 3 headgear unless you are trying to lure the mob to kill a afk dude.\n\nIn actual PVP. you are given stock items and no headgears boost are allowed. so i don see a problem with that. =x maybe gvg. If people pay to buy gold.. i mean its thier choice and its up to the IMC to ban gold sellers, i do not really see how they affect one's own game play unless you say every single item on market is bought and you never had a chance to get one. =x\n\n8 - This is biggie for alot of players, but do consider as IMC giving people who play lesser a chance to earn some gold. imagine if market has no cap on how many things you can sell, its way too easy for botters and people who played alot to flood the market and push everything down. By capping the number of stuff you can sell, i feel gives more casual players a chance to have a niche market. Also IMC makes rare high lv recipe requiring low level items, giving lower level players a chance (eg mithril).\n\nUpdate - token user can sell 10 items now, intertrade btw characters is free now\n\n9- Now after some players are nitpicking at these aspects. i would go back to saying market saturation, with unlimited dungeon, wouldn't the game be totally unfair for people who can afford 2 hours a day? and wouldnt the items (BESIDE TALT) become more common and the silver will be clumped to players with 16 hours a day to play? maybe there is some middle ground but i do not see having unlimited dungeons as a good thing =x Plus\n\noverall i mostly experience bots considering the negatives.\n\nMY truest advice is  - its just a game.. for all the flaws, i enjoyed it greatly enough to sink 150 hours + into it. I feel most problems arise when people keep comparing other players and how they legally or illegaly exploit the system. i for once enjoy the game with my friends.\n\nIts easy to get lost in jealously of how far and easy some cheat thier way through, but to be honest it does not affect how you play a game unless he is literally beside you ksing and trash talking you all the way. If you do get triggered  easily i might suggest to play in short bursts","April 14","true","304.7"," 392 of 603 people (65%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","65","392","603","26","20"

It's another cash-grab title that will become a ghost town in 1 year.\n\nHere is a long list of problems with Tree of Savior:\n\n1) You can't trade with other players. You read it right! You can't trade at all. The only way to trade with your friend, is if both of you purchase a 18$ token that allows trading for 30 days. And it has a limit of 30 trades per month! Sharing items to your alt character also decreases the trade count by 1.\n\n2) You can't trade silver in a direct trade, even if you have Token. If your guildmate needs to borrow 100k silver really quickly to buy something from auction house, too bad you can't do him a favor!\n\n3) You can only put 1 item in the auction house, the item takes a random time between 30 minutes and 2 hours to appear on the market, after you sell it there's 30% tax, and you need to wait over 2 days to retrieve silver from the market! If you have a token, you can put up 5 items at a time and the tax is reduced to 10%. There is another limitation to the market - the price at which you try to sell your item is adjusted by the system and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\n4) IMC (game developer and publisher) did all of the trade/market restrictions supposedly to fight the RMT traders (goldsellers). It did absolutely nothing. Goldsellers are still littering the game. The real reason behind those changes was to force players to spend 18$ a month on a token.\n\n5) As a result of the above, the market is a joke. If you enjoy a healthy marketplace, that's not what you'll find here. Playing the market to earn money is barely profitable because of the market's flaws. The market is bugged and can be exploited by malicious players.\n\n6) You can't create a guild until you have reached rank 7, which is nearly the level cap of 280. For the whole game you can't be in a guild.\n\n7) This game destroys the social aspects of interacting with other players. I'll make a short list:\n\na) When you make a party, you expect to be able to choose basic loot options. Not in this game. You can only choose Round Robin, Random or Pick-Up. If you play with random people, you can't trust them enough to have pick-up option enabled, because one of them will most likely steal all the loot. There is no class-restriction when looting, no dice-roll system, no greed/need system, no bid system like in B&S. Pray to RNJesus that you get the drops that you need.\n\nb) When you're leveling with a friend, you can't trade without a Token. Even if you buy that, you will be restricted to 30 trades per month. You'll run out of this limit in a week of playing together.\n\nc) Market has so many limitations, it destroys the idea of healthy and vibrant economy. In this game, you'll think twice before putting anything on sale.\n\nd) All the leveling/questing is easily soloable. An MMORPG is supposed to be a multiplayer game, where people feel the need to party up to clear the hard content. Here, the only times you'll need a party is for dungeons or for grinding spots that are heavily contested for.\n\ne) The mob population is too small, there are not enough mobs for everyone on the map. There are not enough channels to accomodate all people. The spawn timer is between 2-5 minutes for almost all mobs! So 80% of the time, instead of fighting, you'll be running around trying to find mobs to kill.\n\nf) Dungeons have a limit entry of 2 times per day. And this limit entry is shared between all dungeons. So, if you do dungeon A 2 times today, you can't enter dungeon B or C. If you have a token, that's 3 entries per day.\n\ng) You can't queue to a dungeon if you're in a party. If you enter a dungeon in a pre-made party, you only get 450% exp bonus. If you queue solo, you get 600% bonus. You either go with people you know and get punished for that, or you queue with random people who probably have no idea how to play.\n\nf) Same thing with PvP - you can't queue if you made a premade party. Want to play PvP together with a friend? Sorry, you can't.\n\n8) The game is, not very advanced in terms of graphical effects and shouldn't be very demanding on your PC. At least in theory. You'll need a high-end PC to enjoy a framerate exceeding 50 fps.\n\n9) You will be getting random screen stuttering all the time. If you play in a party, sound begins to stutter when 5 people are hitting one boss at the same time. It's painful to hear.\n\n10) Dungeons give way too much exp. Consequently, many players will just do their daily runs and log off because grinding on the fields isn't very efficient exp-wise.\n\n11) The issues with lag/latency/server instability are very bad. I've played many MMORPG in the past, some of them right from day 1, but never experienced something like this. On the first day, the only way to login was to select a server, click "Enter" button, then patiently wait for 2-3 minutes to log in. If during that time, you clicked "Enter" button again, you are put right at the end of the queue. There was no way of figuring it out that you're supposed to wait patiently for 2-3 minutes to log in. Most players would just assume that the login is broken and keep clicking on the "Enter" button every few seconds.\nIf you managed to log in, there were queues everywhere, that could take up to 2 hours or more. It persisted for more than 2 days. The lag during combat was tolerable. But, the lag manifests if you want to talk to NPCs or use an item. You can't even pick-up drops from mobs instantly, it takes over 10 seconds for them to be picked up. When walking around, you will be randomly teleported back because of the server issues.\n\n12) There is little to none communication with IMC or their Staff. They don't respond to people constantly complaining about the problems I mention in this review. Some of those problems have existed in the game since the first closed beta, but still weren't fixed. Some of the quests, mobs and NPCs are bugged since over 6 months ago, and guess what? It's never been fixed.\n\n13) The game is tending towards being a cash-grab product. You are blocked from basic functions like trading with other players if you don't pay. In KR, you need to spend TP (real-cash currency) to list items in the auction house. Buying a hair costume costs 20$. You can't trade items between your main and alts unless you have a Token. There is already P2W item in the shop that gives random stat bonuses to accessories, and this game was just recently released. Despite the players' reaction in KR and overseas, they will probably keep bringing more P2W items in the future.\n\n14) The cash shop is a big joke. First of all, there is no global chat in this game. The only way is if you use a megaphone, which costs TP to buy. You get 5 free TP to use each day, and one megaphone costs 1-2 TP, so you can use some for free. But it's not nearly enough if you're a market person, and you will be forced to spend real money just to communicate with players.\nThere are not enough cosmetic items in the shop, and they're way overpriced. If you're a Wizard, there's only one costume you can buy. Costumes are class-restricted. There are only 6 costumes in total right now. The hair costumes are overpriced, and it costs way more to buy a female hair than male hair, which is a ridiculous cash grab.","April 3","false","52.4"," 395 of 615 people (64%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","64","395","615","29","28"

I implore you to actually go through the list of reviews and funnel out the massive amount of thumbs down by people who have played the game for absolutely no time considering this is an MMO. There are also people who are down voting it simply based on a mechanic they dislike rather than giving it a proper review.\n\nNow onto the actual game review. I am currently around level 230 with the current cap being 280. I suggest you do research into the type of character you wish to build and the paths it will take.\n\nCurrently there are quest available till around level 235 and from that point on you will actually need to really grind if you wish to reach the maximum level. If you do research you will find you can reach level 200 without any grinding at all fairly easy(Don't waste cards).\n\nAt level 100 leveling gets easier as it opens up daily missions and quest which scale to your level.\n\nThe game offers controller support, keyboard support and mouse support. However I will say controller support needs to be refined a bit more to allow key mapping.\n\nGraphical settings are fairly basic but they are now adding more to the game to help improve the experience of those who need them.\n\nThe musical score in this game is phenomenal and its fairly rare for most mmos to keep you wanting to keep the OST on rather than mute it and listen to your own music.\n\nThe game offers a wide variety of classes to play each with unique skills to make use of.\n\nWhile you could very well solo in this game up to a certain point with no issues its highly recommended you try and party though content. Not only will you get through the content faster but leveling will be faster and its great to make friends at the same time.\n\nA cash shop does exist but as of right now 4/26/2016 its in no way P2W which is great.\n\n\nCons -\n\nThe biggest con of the game currently is that there are quite a few restrictions which are getting worked on due to player feedback. I don't however believe this game deserves a bad review because of them which if you notice is where the majority of the thumbs down come from.\n\nBots are a problem in every mmo and just like those this game will have bots they are however publicly announcing bot bans every day and added a system so players can report the bots they see.\n\n\nAll in all I highly recommend if you want a new mmo to try this game out and then form your own opinion afterward on if its worth your time or not.","April 26","true","915.4"," 228 of 351 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","228","351","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemoncakes/recommended/372000/","lemoncakes","[Dota2Wiki] Lemoncake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemoncakes/","50 products in account","Lots of people are comparing this game to Ragnarok Online (RO), but Tree of Savior is actually more similar to another famous IMC game, Granado Espada (GE). The same group of people worked on all three games, and it shows.\n\nWhile its art and class design is meant to invoke RO, the teams system, item shop, megaphones, EXP cards, map design, audio, and even costumes are basically copied from GE.\n\nThe Good:\nVisually beautiful\nLarge map with many zones and assets\nVery content rich for a brand new MMO\nMusic by the legendary soundTemP and friends (same composers for RO and GE)\nNostalgia.\nThe Bad:\nToo much stuff locked behind microtransactions. Without a paid token, there are heavy restrictions on trading.\nBots and gold sellers. Every game has a few, but it's an all-out infestation here. IMC isn't even trying to stop them.\nIffy controls. The keyboard system is not accurate or fast enough for PVP, and the mouse system is not as fluid or responsive as say, Diablo 3.\nUnpolished. Problems with hitboxes, bugged quests, invisible walls, etc.\nUnsuitable music. The throbbing techno was an good choice for the grimy world of GE, but not here. The RO soundtrack alternated between light ambiance and memorable themes, which would've suited ToS better.\nThe Misunderstood:\nQuesting may seem linear at first, but becomes more open world later on. The map progression system is identical to GE, but not fully open world like RO.\nGrindy for a modern day MMO. Roughly as grindy as GE, but thankfully nowhere as grindy as RO. Some people like this, some people don't.\nThe class system feels overwhelming at first, but it's designed to create highly specialized characters that provide a niche service to parties or the entire community (crafting, upgrading, etc). This is similar to RO, and indeed many skill concepts in ToS are borrowed from RO/GE. But due to the grinding, there needs to be easier/cheaper ways to reset characters.\nConclusion:\nAs with RO and GE, Tree of Savior was created by a talented team with big ambitions, powerful artistic vision, but poor quality control. These are the type of creative folks who have great ideas, but don't know how to package or deliver their product professionally. This has resulted in rough launches and patchwork gameplay (especially questing) during the early days of all three games.\n\nThat being said, RO and GE both went on to be very successful MMOs. If there is one thing that could doom ToS, it's the excessive restrictions for non-premium players.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, the game is clearly a labor of love with much content to explore. If out of nothing but nostalgia, I would still recommend giving Tree of Savior a try.","April 2","true","198.5"," 212 of 349 people (61%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","61","212","349","14","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScottWithTwoTs/recommended/372000/","ScottWithTwoTs","tdues","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScottWithTwoTs/","257 products in account","EDIT: Since I wrote this review, IMC has announced they are going to allow users in Klaipeda and Orsha to transfer to a new SA server. Also, they are adjusting prices for in-game items fairly according to each server after the migration to fix any advantage a player from a different region may have due to the different rates of inflation around the globe. This is why 'Fractured Community' is crossed out below, as the developers have done all they can to solve this problem short of forcing people out of their servers.\n\nLet me start by saying Tree of Savior has its flaws. They are as follows:\nProblems with bots which the development team is aware of. Already they have patched in a bot report system and I assume there are more fixes in the works.\nBugs which are plenty, however not game breaking. There are some oddities in the gameplay of some of my friends who have played where sprint does not function properly. There are cosmetic bugs to be found here and there, however I haven't found anything in my own experience of playing around 22 hours that was game breaking.\nServer lag is probably the biggest issue with the game to-date. Even in its current state with only 'founder' access to the game there are many times when the servers are populated to the point of gameplay becoming affected. Sometimes lag is to the point where you can't kill an enemy until it settles down. One can only hope they do something to improve the performance of the servers.\nFramerate can drop below 60fps in heavily populated areas even on a good computer. Running the game on a GTX 980 I did not expect to experience any visual lag in a game that emulates a 2.5D appearance. In the big cities of Orsha and Klaipeda though you will certainly drop below 60fps and see noticeable frame drops.\nFractured Community on the server I play on, Orsha. While I have nothing against my brothers and sisters in Brazil, there are too many Portugeuse-only speakers on Orsha for an English-only speaker to become very invested in the community. While the title of the game on Steam says it is the English version of Tree of Savior, it is obvious that the Brazilian community deserves their own server.\nFree players can't do much in the current version of ToS. You can't trade or put up more than 1 item on the marketplace at a time. Of course the developers need to make money...so for now this is their solution to incentivize buying premium for the game. The developers have said they are looking for a way to allow free players to trade, however you can't help but think it will be limited in some way. Only time will tell what economic decisions the devs will have to make with the game. Thus is the nature of F2P.\nCharacter customization is weak. You can choose male or female, however there are limited options for both genders.\nSo what is there to like about Tree of Savior?\nCombat is probably the biggest pro in Tree of Savior. The action combat in the game is satisfying. Every wave of enemies you kill feels like a blast of progression towards the next level. Each class in the game plays a unique style and takes advantage of spatial awareness in the action combat. Boss battles utilize this very same aspect of the game. If you see a boss charging up an attack, don't just stand and auto-attack, run!\nControls feel old-school and backwards at first (I mean arrow keys to control...what is this 1993?!), but once you understand how to access the game's different menus through your function keys and get familiar with moving around it all feels very intuitive. Even something as simple as teleporting to a completed quest is made easy with just a quick press of backspace. It's nice how almost everything in the game able to be controlled without lifting your hands from your keyboard.\nVisuals are great in Tree of Savior. Everything is rendered in 3D, but the game is textured and lit in such a way that you could swear you're looking at the 2.5D Ragnarok Online. It's a beautiful effect, and it makes exploring more enjoyable. Each area in the game has a unique environment and flora. This is a game whose graphics have character. You will dangerously wander into higher level areas if you don't keep your eyes on the road.\nInterface is good. It is nothing revolutionary but everything is where you would expect it to be. All your menus are accessed through your function keys, F1-F12. This is unique for an MMO where 'I' is typically your inventory, 'E' will access your equipment, etc. It takes some time to get used to, but it's actually a relief with the action gameplay to have all your menu buttons out of the way of an accidental keystroke.\nClass diversity is wide ranging. You can play any style you want with 80 possible class combinations. Some classes can advance to higher levels, or 'circles'. Some classes appear to have limited usefulness in the current version of the game, so do your research before dedicating yourself to a particular line of classes. That being said, no class is the wrong choice as long as you know what is and is not recommended for that particular class. Again, do some basic research on the many guides and manuals written by the community and make your own informed decision of how you want to play the game. EDIT:A note on classes...while there are 80 different choices of classes in Tree of Savior, not all of them are a viable option. In fact, many of the circle 3 classes are weak and don't provide any useful skills. It is worthy to note as well that only one or two stats per class are really useful, for instance a swordsman player set on going Hoplite may allocate stats to only STR, STR and DEX, or STR and CON. At the end of the day whatever class you choose know that ToS is a game about damage and your choices have to reflect that to succeed. Thank you Indeed for contributing your insight in the comments.\nThe Verdict\nTree of Savior is a fun little F2P MMO. In a lot of ways it feels like a Frankenstein cross-over between Maplestory, Ragnarok Online and an action RPG game like Torchlight. There are plenty of flaws in this early localization of the game, however the flaws that do exist are not game breaking and have not stopped me from enjoying the game 22 hours in and counting. It is a visually impressive game that offers satisfying combat, tight controls, and a large number of classes to choose from. Free players are extremely limited, character customization is weak, there is a fractured community of different languages, plus bugs and server lag are plenty...but to me these are lesser cons to the powerful pros of the game. I recommend Tree of Savior for someone looking for a different take on MMO combat.","April 18","true","35.4"," 189 of 312 people (61%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","61","189","312","9","10"

Play only if you played RO.\n\n10/10 for Art, Style and Concept\n4/10 for Implementation and Gameplay\n\nPros:\nNumerous Classes - very versatile builds. (Of course, there are meta builds, and not-so-great builds. But you'll really have to try in order to screw-up your builds.)\nRetro RO-style gameplay given an update.\nGorgeous Art\nLoads of content, especially from Level 100 onwards. (Completing the daily dungeons, missions, party quests and solo repeatable quests can easily take an entire day. Especially if you timed it around the daily resets.)\nGrinding is minimal if you pace your exp card usage correctly, and do the daily content. (Not necessarily on a daily basis. :D)\nCons:\nBugs, bugs, and more bugs. Especially if you're on the South American server.\nPrivate messaging system is broken - Get every player you wish to play with often on Discord/Telegram/Kik/Skype/etc as soon as you can.\nBots and RMTs everywhere - they need to implement captchas and/or more efficient ways for players to report the bots/RMTs.\nTrade restrictions - implemented to deter bots/RMT and failing in every way possible.\nPersonal bug point #1 - They don't have warp points for every map and only the swordsman class has dash. It takes clerics ages to get somewhere. Having to run through 2-3 maps each time for a repeatable quest is pretty ridiculous.\nPersonal bug point #2 - Mouse control mode is glitchy. :x\nSome servers are totally overpopulated, and it's sometimes impossible to get into dungeons. #TreeofSpacebar\nNo Stat resets! - Hope you don't cry every time you re-roll. (*Some* players got the stat reset potion as part of the early founders' DLC, but there's no sign of IMC introducing the reset potions.)\nGuild system is terrible.\nI play this because:\n1) I played RO, and *love* the visuals.\n2) I'm not affected by most of the bugs/problems that others face. Some inconveniences yes, but that's about it.\n\nBut for others...? Take your chances if you wish.","May 13","false","227.2"," 51 of 78 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","51","78","0","4"

There are so many things wrong with this game.  I played this game since head start and have a level 230 (280 is the max level you can be) with a bunch of alts.  I have been through so many annoyances in this game and I'll list them out:\n\n-Trading system is terrible.  You cannot trade silver for items or give silver to friends.\n-So many quest bugs.  I'm still stuck on a low level story quest because it won't let me and many others to click on the NPC.  It has been posted on the forums, but IMC doesn't acknowledge it and the bug is still around.\n-Auction house is terrible.  Takes 30 minutes to 2 hours for your item to be posted on the auction house.  If your item sells it will take 48 hours to get the money!\n-Instance drops are very low.  I have done this one low level instance every day for 3 weeks and still haven't received the two items I've been looking for.\n-Buggy skills and clunky fighting!  The fighting isn't smooth in this game at all.  The skills feel clunky and awkward.  Playing a wizard class I often find that my skill doesn't go off when it's suppose to.  For example, when I cast hail the casting bar will charge up and my character will do the animation at the end to cast, but hail never goes off and my character is frozen for a second or two.  I then have to re-cast it.  Also, some times the ground skills won't go to the place you want them to be.  For example, your cursor can be on a monster and your character can be facing the monster, but when you use your skill it gets placed somwhere completely different.\n-Lag!  If you enter a map with a lot of people you will get lag.  If you fight a world boss with other people around you will get lag.  This happens to everyone and it doesn't matter if you have the best computer in the world and the fastest internet.\n-Long loading screens.  Lots of people experience long loading screens in this game and there are tons of loading screens in this game.  The loading screens take a very long time when entering a populated area like the main city.  One time I had to wait 5+ minutes.\n\nNow I will talk about PvP...  To get your pvp fix in this game you'll need to find another guild's tower which can be anywhere on any field map.  Once you find the tower, your guild leader has to declare war.  It takes an hour for the "war" to start.  Once it starts, you can pvp the other guild for 7 days and you can kill their tower.  There is no reward for killing the tower and there is no reward for any thing.  There's also no rank system.  It doesn't tell you who got how many kills and it doesn't keep track how many GvG battles your guild has won.  Nothing.  The tower will eventually get destroyed no matter how well you defend it in the beginning because no one can defend the tower 24/7.  Some times an announcement will go up if you kill the other guild's tower so the whole server can see it and some times the announcement never happens because the game is buggy like that.  Some times you can heal your tower and some times it bugs out and won't let you heal it so the enemy guild can just slowly kill it with one hit here and there no matter how well your defending it.  Also, when your fighting people they can just switch channels in the middle of the fight easily or drop guild tag in the middle of the war so they don't have to worry about PK.  There's no point having a tower up all the time.  The only real use out of it is to level your guild up so you can add more spots.  Guilds start off small with only 30 spaces for people.  You can use talts to level up your guild by clicking on the tower and it takes a lot of talts.  That's the only real reason to have a tower up.\n\nNow I've been trying to put up with all these annoyances I've listed.  But I'm going to be quitting now after reading the recent patch notes...\n\n1) Guild Related\nA. The guild master will be able to set the guild to 'Neutral' by checking the [Declare Neutrality] option on the Guild UI.\nB. Guilds may not declare war on other guilds or have other guilds declare war while 'Neutral'.\nC. It is not possible to Declare Neutrality during war.\nD. Neutrality will be maintained until manually changed by the guild master.\nE. Only guild masters are able to change the 'Neutral' state of the guild.\nF. 7 days must pass in order to change the guild status from 'Neutral'.\nG. Guild masters are now able to declare war on up to 3 guilds at once.\n\nThe little bit of PvP that was in the game is now ruined for me and my guild.  It's already hard to find PvP and this now will make it pretty much impossible.  It basically says everyone can put their towers up without a care in the world because they can choose to be neutral thus never have to participate in this game's sad excuse of GvG.  I was really hoping they would have a system like War of Emperium in Ragnarok Online, but this new patch shows me where IMC's heads are at and it shows they are going to be doing the opposite of what me, my guild, and many other guilds want.  They want to make PvP non-existent in this game.  I really wanted a great guild vs guild system, but it looks like we aren't getting that.\n\nI liked the variety of class builds and stats in this game (except the fact that int doesn't play a huge roll in wizard dmg) and was willing to look past the lag, bugs, and clunky controls...  but this was just the last nail on the coffin.  Didn't think the GvG could get worse than it already was, but IMC proved me wrong.  I was planning on making this my main game, but I just can't stand it any more and will be quitting cause the PvP is pretty much gone and I don't want to play a pure PvE game.","May 23","false","005.8"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","43","65","4","9"

Characters models shows decent and distinct design from each class and to each gender. Though at most times you'll be finding yourself to be looking similar to other players for Tree of Savior doesn't go indepth into character customization.\nDue to the character style and maps, this does give off the "RO" Nostalgia for most veteran MMO players.\n\nArt for NPC's are good, it gives of a different feeling from just being another "Anime-esque art".\nThe environment and Map backgrounds are decent, they give off the right feel for each map for their theme.\n\nMusic: 9\n\nBGM, Here is one of the good things from Tree of savior. The BGM for each map are different and gives out off the right vibes depending on the map and its theme. Boss Battle BGM makes you feel that you're fighting something extra ordinary, THOUGH this wil get repititive until later on for each boss fights.\n\nHere but not the least: Gameplay, Community and Management, and oh also Replayability.\n\nGameplay: 7\nThe game starts of quite good to decent until you hit poor, rock bottom.\nTree of savior revolves MOSTLY around on auto-attacking. From each class, to swordsman, to cleric, to wizard, and archer based classes will be relying on auto attacking whenever their skill rotations are in cooldown or as such until they reach the cherry on getting their supposedly rank 6-7 classes.\nSkills and Combat gets really stale for a while since Characters to Enemies, from mobs to Bosses will all likely be using/re-using the same skill animation and combat animation.\n\nProgression in the game is very, linear the only spice that adds to it is that some quests are hidden from the quest log, in which A) You either consult a guide online or B) You spend the time exploring and talking to every NPC you'll be seeing in one map. Questing in the game can get REALLY STALE until the higher levels, in which some are riddled with RNG-based item fetching and etc..\nDungeons. The Dungeons in Tree of Savior are either your to go to for EXP at lower until high level grinding but as how it is the the entrance limit for such instances are limited to only 2 runs globally for all dungeons, and 3 runs for token users. Though I do not find any necessity to even limit such runs to a minimum to 2-3 runs daily globally tied to exactly just 2 tickets to use for once a day to a dungeon, which you wont be able to run others after.\n\nTree of savior possesses a number of different classes branching from their main class from Either, Swordsman, Cleric, Wizard or Archer, with a total of more than 80 classes.\nDiversity for each class in a game is a plus to me as it divides classes into roles in a party.\nThis is a plus in my book, BUT at most times thanks to the META only a number of class builds and combos are gonna be significant for end game or PVP, in which making a number of class combinations irrelevant. Another thing, Diversity, like I've said just now; Diversity in roles but the issue is that each class branch either feels the same feel in regards to combat or skills, only difference are in terms of bonuses, weaponry used or gimmick.\n\nThe game's cash shop is quite empty as many would wonder but most of the part it doesnt have any pay-to-win niche items aside from the enhancement scroll that boosts RNG-based stats on a headgear accessory. Though one more thing, at early levels you might be bothered that some features are locked from the usual free to player, such as trading, storage being shared between your characters, limited amount of items listed on Market(Auction) and having an outstanding 30% tax from selling anything in the market. Not to mention taking money from the auction takes up to  48 hours.\nPremium, aka Token is the answer to most of these locked features and limited slots but it doesnt reduce amount of days to take out the money from the auction/market but reduces the tax to 10% though!\nI can't really complain much but this is quite a wall for someone starting from the ground up which maybe inconvenient for the new player in the early levels.\nThe good thing about Token(s) are they aren't exclusive to paying players only. They can be sold in the market by other players, but they cannot be traded amongst token users thru normal trading means. Even though Tokens can be sold in the market/auction, The Price for it stands near the point where you should already even invested where their price stands. Which would take you either to be around getting near Fedimian or already around level100+ to even afford one through silver means.\nAlthough Tokens and auction/market are riddled with such walls, they did help combat RMT at some point of level but RMT/Bot users are getting smarter each day and are still eager even with the ban waves from IMC (Good Job IMC for being active in doing so!).\n\nCommunity: ?\nIn terms of the game community, The game itself has a friendly bunch but at the same time there are hardcore white knights in terms of either light or heavy criticism; Ranging from the Developer's stand point of deciding things and from the game's core gameplay. But overall the game's players are friendly enought or either too quiet enough.\nOh for the love of all bad things, the game also has bots around.\n\nManagement: 6\n\nIMC has been "transparent" and been working hard to serve the game to the international audience.\nBut with decisions made in the past in announcing Open Beta to be free from sometime ago into a sudden change of plans into deciding hosting an early access with a price tag of 50$.\nWith such action this suddenly took a great turn into dividing the playerbase, though in light of the majority of the community disliking the early access model. IMC had rather made tiers of purchase for it, In which the community has approved.\n\nOne more thing, the fight against RMT and Bots. IMC has stated the reason for having the early access was to combat such illegal activity but the community are divided into either thinking they're just doing this for PR or are actually honest about it. Though no deterrent really last that long if it wasn't really supervised or well made, as bots and RMT were rampant during the early access and with some exploits on the background but IMC has been doing quite well combating them.\n\nThough at the current state of management IMC has really been sloppy with assisting the game's needs and stability. Which I hope be improved upon in the future.\n\nReplayability:\nGame gets really stale even for a grinding game. It doesn't offer much any feel of accomplishment or triumph. PVP is unbalanced for most of the part and it needs to be polished. PVE aspects as like I said it gets stale as it doesn't offer other gimmicks or necessities besides  stated above even with Guilds.\n\nConclusion, The game may not be for everyone to play on but it does have its own gimmick and perks. It also gives off the same Nostalgia from playing RO from long ago but it just doesn't feel the same way.\nThe state of the game and how it's being handled is quite so-so.\n\nThe game right now feels unfinished and still needs tending to.\nGameplay and  Management-wise, "Premium" aspect of the game feels like a necessity more than a "want". Overall its a game with potential to grow but with its current state and management, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nWell, That's pretty much it..

I purchased Founder's Pack 2 around the release date, spent ~135 hours on the game and leveled up 4 characters to 68, 70, 74, and 109.  As I made my way through mage tower 2f on my ranger, I ultimately had a lonely realization that this game is a waste of my time.\n\nSure, I can plow through tons of mobs with minimal strategy, but I did the same things in all the other maps.  I rarely come across other people but when I do there's of course there's no interaction as we're racing to get through content.  Seeing bots on field maps just discourages me even more because I'm wasting my time sitting at the computer while others automate this hamster wheel process.\n\nMy token just expired and I just simply don't enjoy the idea of the diminished results from my time invested.  I could use my TP to buy a new token but I'd just be prolonging the inevitable.\n\nThe game just isn't exciting or compelling enough for me to continue.  I don't get satisfaction from facerolling through quest bosses, grinding for collections, or racing through boring dungeon runs and being rewarded with amazing talt or crappy boss cards.  After achieving the first few ranks it's a long way to experience new skills or classes.  There's no pvp at my level that I'm aware of. I like using a DS4 controller but even with target lock activated it's not really locked and it tries selecting mobs outside of my attack range as another mob is a couple steps away from me.\n\nBottom line is that there's just too much time required to invest for what I consider lousy rewards.  How many hours does it take for 1 meaningless stat point?  More than I'd like to know, that's for sure.  I really wanted to enjoy this like I did with RO, but the fun factor fell off very quickly.","May 9","false","135.2"," 95 of 159 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","95","159","3","0"

We've been expecting this game since a lot of time already. Which makes us all impatient on the appearance of problems we never heard on the making.\nBut this game has at most 2 week on the market (being hitted quite hard with bricks for details that CAN be fixed) So be patient before picking up the torches and hop on the hate train...\nOn to the all powerful list of pros and cos...\n\nPROS:\n\n+The game enjoys of a great variety of classess and internal builds, in which we can see for now that none are better than the next. What do i mean with this ? You can actually enjoy the game and feel useful with almost any kind of build you pick fancy (It's true that some might be more or less useful early on the game, but that's it)\n\n+The soundtrack is simply amazing, passing from Techno, to Metal, to theme background music in a way you don't feel stuffed or bored with it. Which is ALWAYS a plus in games you're planning to be more than 1 hour a day.\n\n+The gameplay actually feels refreshing, having a MMO without point and click, as well as having something of a response with you to actually avoid things, instead of just a stat calculation feels very nice.\n\n+The game is adapted for a controller support as well as mouse and keyboard\n\n+The content of the game is actually overwhelming, and we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg for now.\n\n+The game feels relaxing and enjoyable, you're hooked to continue playing without actually feel exausted for it.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Talking the elephanth in the room here, the trade system... It's true that the Devs are doing what they feel best to fight against the Gold sellers in game... But the messures they are taking might backfire pretty soon, once they have the general population of the game without access to general features such as trade.\n\n-There is a lack of visual customizations on the game, basically everyone feels exactly as the neighborg, there is no way to add a personal touch to a character besides a really small headgear (I pressume this content would be added later on, but they are lacking a bit on that for now).\n\n-The Guild system is depending on a specific class to actually have it. I would have been fine for so called class (The Templar) would have beneficts on the momment of making a guild, or even managing it.

I can put up with a great many problems, and it takes a LOT to rattle me or get me upset enough to start complaining or bashing a company beyond a few jokes cracked here and there.\n\nHaving said those three things, and having put more than 190 hours into a game that I still do love, and still feel offers an amazing gameplay experience, with today's patch, I can't possibly continue to ignore what's going on here.\n\nIMC you have done all of this:\n\n1) Implement absurd restrictions to try and stop goldsellers and bots which only hurt real players without affecting goldsellers or bots in the slightest. Remember, goldsellers and bots exist for one purpose. To sell game currency, and to cheat their way to get it. They have unlimited time, effort and incentive to dedicate to circumventing your restrictions. Real players don't. They are frustrated. Many have or will simply quit.\n\n2) Set out a release schedule for the game for 3 months staggered early access, and then listened to the community, going back on your plan and instead releasing a one month early access. The servers were not ready. Commander Load Fail crashed things left, right and center all through early access. Now, nearly two months post-launch, the lag is STILL intolerable with no end in sight. Stability isn't even a pipedream at this point, especially for the SEA and SA servers who can barely play the game, because in 2016, it seems that you have contracted with a company who can't even provide basic DDoS protection for your servers.\n\n3) Announced free to play and then pushed it back two weeks because the game wasn't ready. You held multiple 24-hour maintenances to manually accomplish server transfers, a task that other game companies can automate in 10 minutes. When the game still wasn't ready you launched free to play anyway with even more devastating restrictions on free players. The free players came, and the servers crashed, spluttered and crawled again, even harder this time.\n\n4) You launched free to play with all of the restrictions on free players, without any method to let those free players purchase TP to alleviate their restrictions. Now that you have finally released your absurdly overpriced one time DLC packs that BARELY include any TP, about a third of your potential customers have already quit.\n\n5) During this entire time, you have refused to communicate with your player base on ANY level, including issuing cut and paste, irrelevant responses to support tickets, ignoring almost every keystone community issue as if they didn't exist, and issuing patch notes weekly for bug fixes that could have been accomplished by one intern working part time. Are you working on something big? Is there a reason that none of the kToS patches are being pushed here? Do you even PLAN to have the kToS patches applied here? Are you doing ANYTHING? We certainly don't know.\n\n6) You take weekends off in a 24/7 customer service industry, leaving your product non-functional to entire subsets of your (paying) playerbase for DAYS at a time. In any other industry, your company would be bankrupt, shut down, your CEO and anyone in even the most remote position of authority would have their jobs nixed.\n\n7) You FIRED your community manager for doing what she was supposed to do. And you replaced her with a soundless, emotionless void.\n\n8) When paired with all of your other problems, including but not limited to:\n\nbizarre, constant lag, disconnects, abilities misfiring, chat randomly being eaten by the ether (and while we're on the subject, the Orwellian chat filter that would be out of place in a children's game, much less one with blatant sexualization, panty shots and etc.) characters getting stuck, players being unable to get into dungeons, or being kicked out of dungeons once they are, the constant goldseller spam, bots camping high level grinding areas pushing legitimate parties out, world boss monopolization, lack of rewards for pvp, the glitchy market limit system, lack of meaningful rewards for pve (weeks with nothing but talt), class balance issues, item balance issues (arde dagger and cafrisun best in slot for 200 levels for -every- class without fail), the unsustainable economy (~10 high end items with absurdly luck based cost-enterprising, and the diminishing demand/cost for materials, creating a compelling reason for players to buy from goldsellers who are ever-present), poor translation, artificial grind walls and newbie traps, and glaring lack of social features (even a guild requires a rank 7 character to create), and many others I am probably forgetting:\n\nIt is clear how you feel about this game. Which is to say that you don't. You have no industry awareness whatsoever, and this is coming from someone who has played numerous F2P games in the past, from the likes of Nexon, Webzen, Aeria and etc., all companies who are notorious for their poor customer service. You somehow manage to project even less of a positive image than they do. Incredibly, this is the first time I have ever actually felt like I enjoyed playing a game more than the developers enjoy making and maintaining it.\n\nSo why with all of these issues have I continued to play, and why am I done now? Because no matter how many issues I think the game has, I can deal with them if I believe the developer cares and is working on fixing things. I played FFXIV (the original) which was one of the most poorly received MMOs EVER, because I still liked the core game, and because Square-Enix acknowledged their mistakes and decided to try and fix them.\n\nWith the release of these DLC packs for $30 and $35, it is apparent that you believe you deserve the cost of a AAA game for putting forth zero effort. You do not market. You do not improve server stability. You do not communicate with your players. You do not address major game issues. You can't figure out how to implement the purchase of your own cash shop currency. You can't hardly claim overhead worthy of those prices, because you have nothing to show for the fruits of your labor over the last two months. You simply give no ♥♥♥♥♥ about Tree of Savior, beyond hooking the 1% of whales who will pay any amount to rule the roost in a game that is 5% good game, 15% Nostalgia and 80% catastrophe.\n\nSo here you go, IMC. You want to know how to take a straw and break a camel's back, and alienate even a calm, loyal player Look at your own actions over the past 60 days.\n\nI'm done, and whether or not the white knights left will rush to defend you against this post is of no concern to me, because I know that even they have their breaking point, and if I'm at this point, I'd imagine it isn't far off.","May 25","false","296.8"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mobasher/recommended/372000/","Mobasher","Troll2GG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mobasher/","64 products in account","Product received for free\n\nDo not bother with this game. It suffers from horrendously poor coding and lack of developers and employees who actually have a say in what happens to the game on the international release team.\n\nSome issues include not being able to play many of the classes such as those which have cast bars or consume items to use skills because casting is slowed artificially by the poor network code. The skills will take 4-5 seconds longer to do anything even though their cast bars have been full, and in the case of item consumption requirements (most later classes and several early-mid classes), the skill wont cast until the server notices the item has been used (4-5 seconds longer again).\n\nYou can expect a 4-5 second delay when interacting with any objects/NPCs in the game as well by the way.\n\nOh, and some skills, such as Psychokino's Gravity Pole cause the game to crash, which means you won't be finding many parties as that class or others that are similarly broken (you think this is temporary? Go look up how long this gamebreaking issue has been allowed to exist).\n\nOther classes have random incompatibilities with the mouse and keyboard (the two main play modes) control modes such as not being able to turn while using channeling skills in the mouse mode or auto-targetting objects like fireballs as an archer who can't hit them while in keyboard mode (so all your auto attacks fizzle).\n\nIssues beyond coding include free to play players only being able to sell one item at a time on the auction house (at 30% cut), and ALL players (including paying members) having to wait 48 hours to retrieve any sale profits. Silver is otherwise untradable (directly), so players have already begun using materials as currency. Traded equipment and materials either lose potential or become untradable, and many items in the game are untradable to begin with (gems for example).\n\nYou have four character slots and there will NEVER be an option to change one of your job classes for any of the 7 ranks that exist for each (eventually will be 10+). If you go X1 - X2 - Y1 - Y2 - Z1 - Z2 - Z3, and any of X, Y, Z get nerfed or just didn't work out for you, you have to remake your character.\n\nYou cannot transfer between your own characters without a token (198 TP), and even if you pay for one you can only transfer ONE item at a time (you can expand to 2 for 200,000 silver). Your personal storage is limited to 50 and many items, such as gems, don't stack.\n\nYour gems drop on death and they disappear RAPIDLY, so rapidly that the server lag can sometimes make it impossible to get back in time solely from load screen durations.\n\nYou get 5 FREE TP maximum, which can only be used for megaphones, soul crystals (revive on spot), and repair kits. You may as well buy the crystals to avoid gem loss, and you will have to turn off megaphone shout to avoid losing brain cells since everyone using it is begging or spamming nonsense (says a lot about the playerbase).\n\nThe main issue that got me was the lack of support when things go wrong, which they will. You will NOT receive useful responses or support on the forums or to your support tickets since there's barely anyone on the international ToS team that can help (they most likely can't even communicate with the developers).\n\nNot convinced? This is a copy of support's reply to the second of two tickets (they skipped the first) some (long) while after their submission:\n\n"Hello Savior,\n\nThank you for contacting us. Unfortunately lost items or gems due to being dropped when dying in the field are not retrievable if left in the field for a couple of minutes. We advise that you put your gems in your storage for safe keeping, or use a Soul Crystals when you dies in the field to able to retrieve the dropped items immediately.\n\nIf you have any other concerns, please do contact us again.\n\nRegards,\n\nTree of Savior Support Team"\n\nThe support tickets were about dying while in load screens and dying while in cutscenes, not about how to keep hundreds of gems in my fifty slot personal storage. But don't worry Saviors, "use a Soul Crystals when you dies in the field" and all will be well.\n\nIgnoring other issues, the game content itself is currently shallow. Tree of Savior would not suddenly become amazing if they addressed all of the problems above. It feels like the game should still be in Alpha, MAYBE early Beta.\n\nMost of the game is typical grind and there is only so much to do at the moment besides that. Max party size is 5, and there really aren't that many dungeons (which you have a limited number of entries to per day anyway). Like Ragnarok Online there are several open world bosses you can TRY to farm for rare gear (which are not nearly as interesting as items in Ragnarok Online and are far fewer in number), and there are also non-instanced dungeons to mess around in. However, this content is not particularly exciting even from the get go, so I can't imagine surviving on this game without deeper content. What's worse, overcrowding makes it so multiple parties are competing for notable farm locations, and all you can do is channel hop (never really helps), leave, or engage in KS wars.\n\nYou need someone in your buddy group to make a Templar (Rank 7) if you want to MAKE a guild (they are the only class that can be a guild master; you can't transfer to a different class type). Alternatively you can join someone else's guild for access to guild content (Guild Tower, Guild Wars, Guild Events), but none of said guild or dungeon content even compares to essentially any other well known MMORPG.\n\nIf you are interested in PVPing in this game, only horrible imbalance awaits you (worse than Ragnarok Online). There are arena matches from 1v1 to 5v5 in addition to guild wars, but the honest truth is the combat oriented classes aren't even remotely balanced, and I'm not talking about classes being equal for dueling or what not, I am taking into account niches and group play. Hell the stat system itself is broken since damage gains from Strength and Intelligence are severely limited. Only classes in the Cleric branch can heal by the way, not including minor indirect sources of recovery (vampire and increased natural regeneration) limited to a couple classes.\n\nThey did try to make a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online (RO), but the fact is RO still exists. Making a game that is almost the same and only somewhat improving the graphical quality (at the cost of horrible instability; this game does NOT run smoothly) is not really an upgrade. Tree of Savior also has less content than RO even though many aspects were blatantly copied, so having to wait for the game to catch up is not a pleasant thought either.\n\nIn 2-3 years could this game be something worth talking about? Yes. Will it? No. As stated, the team behind Tree of Savior, particularly the international release, is not currently capable of ever making that possible. My suggestion is to avoid the game in its current state so that it is not ruined for you forever in case miracle improvements are made down the road.","May 22","false","87.6"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

There's no sense of community in the game. There's no zone-wide chat to cooperate with others, there's only global chat (which takes a consumable item to use) or party/guild chat.\n\nAs an MMO, it's a failure. The game doesn't rely on healers or tanks for dungeons and missions. Bosses simply get zerged while they mindlessly walk towards their aggro target and use AoE attacks. Healers sometimes can save you when potions are on cooldown, but generally they're unnecessary. Class balance is AWFUL and the AI is really bad, so if you play a pet class be ready for frustration.\n\nLeveling goes up to 280 or so with stat points, skill points, and class progression that you cannot undo (some can be undone with microtransactions, but others cannot). Core gameplay consists of:\n\nQuesting - Standard uninteresting MMO fair with minimal rewards.\nExploring - Small reward for discovering 100% of a zone's map. Very difficult with the base UI, but mods make it less confusing.\nCombat - Hit a few cooldown with 15-60 second cooldowns. Then procede to auto attack a bunch, even if you're a mage or priest. Then use a mana and/or health potion to continue. There's no challenge to be found at all.\nDungeons/Missions - kill a bunch of trash and then fight several bosses. This gives MUCH more Exp for the time invested than anything else you can do, yet it has a daily limit of 2/3 for each. Basically this is your "daily quest."\n\nThe game is full of bots spamming their websites in town or in the global channel. Completing quests and grinding Exp can involve more waiting than killing between sitting at a bonfire for SP if you choose to and waiting for monsters to very slowly respawn. There's also the option to camp world bosses that spawn every ~4 hours, what fun!\n\nThe UI is clunky, and while there are 3 control modes (gamepad, keyboard, mouse), none works 100% correctly. The servers have awful performance despite a very small playerbase, and the game itself cannot maintain even 10fps on a GTX 970. I've routinely seen my FPS go above 120 and below 10 in a very short time period. As for lag and loss. It's on baby!\n\nIf you want to try the game and not pay anything, feel free I don't think that's a bad idea. Focus on doing all quests (you need to talk to NPCs, they don't have an exclamation over their head) and exploring all zones. Don't use Exp cards until you are desperate to level up.\n\nIf you wanted to spend money on this game, please don't. It's in a horrible state and probably won't improve anytime soon.","May 23","false","47.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","6"

RESTRICTIONS, RESTRICTIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS\n\nRagnarok Online was my childhood game, when I found out about the release of this game I immediately bought the highest priced Founder Access without a second thought... after 2 weeks I immediately regretted my action.\n\n1. Trade restrictions in this game is one of the most ridiculous one I've seen in my 15 years of gaming experiences, for the very reason that it is the first of its kind which actually caused trouble for my progression in-game as I tried to transfer materials from my main character to alternate (through storage slot temporarily enabled by premium subscription) only to find that some part of my materials are unable to transfer across. To make things worse, I then realized that it was now impossible for me to transfer back the materials from my alternate to my main. The game developer has justified their poorly implemented restrictions for the glorious purpose of stopping bots and gold sellers, and yet I see endless numbers of gold sellers bot-spamming ads in the main town everyday and bots running rampant in popular dungeons.\n\n2. Unreasonably, or I should say, utterly stupid loot system with ridiculous drop rates for some items will make you totally feel like quitting the game at days when RNG doesn't work in your favour. To craft a mid-game equipment, the recipe required me to farm for 15 materials from a group of extremely weak monsters who spawn in very few numbers. Coupling with the fact that the drop rate for the said material is 0.75%, and general low spawn rate of certain monsters including this one, I have in fact attempted to farm for the material for hours and didn't get any at all.\n\n3. While this game succeeded in emulating the fun experiences of old school mmorpgs, they have unfortunately also retained features from the past which are obsolete and unacceptable in modern mmorpgs. Not only that, they have also incorporated some of the most despised features of a modern mmorpgs - a premium subscription option which treats non-premium players like worthless garbage with further restrictions (such as no item transfer between characters of the same account) on top of the abundance of restrictions already in existence.\n\n4. Server lag and instability, I don't even have to mention much here.\n\nThe game, being spirit successor of Ragnarok Online, attempted to emulate the "old school" mmorpg format which many old fans including me really appreciated it much. Unfortunately many of the features from the older mmorpgs have become reprehensible in modern games such as the idea of making people grind for items with drop rate as low as 0.01%  from monsters which are slow to spawn and yield no exp gains. Worst of all, they have placed unreasonable restrictions on trading which would have helped to relax the overly stressful grinding of loots, for the very purpose which they still fail to achieve at the end of the day.","April 12","false","70.9"," 239 of 437 people (55%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","55","239","437","19","10"

Don't be fooled, this is the formulaic follow the breadcrumbs quest MMO with an interesting visual style and pleasant music. This will only appeal to RO fans who played the game only for cute monsters and hats.\n\nAlso might I add that there is an item called a token that is basically required to play the game and function like a real player, this item expires monthly and costs $18, so essentially this game has a scrip higher than any of the AAA offerings. The primary issue with this VIP service is the ability to train two attributes at a time, the attribute system itself being one of the game's main flaws as it works of off mobile game style timers, obviously being able to have two of these going at once gives a player quite an advantage. Other perks include things you'd consider so basic that the idea of paying for them never even crossed your mind, such as trading between your characters.  Hair costumes have stat upgrades that function off of cash shop purchases as well.\n\nSome may say that these things can be purchased with in-game currency, while this will be helpful to some invdividual players, it will also have a PROFOUND impact on the economy of the game. The wealth distribution will become very top heavy, VERY quickly.","March 29","false","8.8"," 144 of 261 people (55%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","55","144","261","8","6"

Yeah the graphics look nice, the music is nice, and the choice of classes gives you the hope of endless possibilities but there is so much going wrong with this game it's hard to even start.\n\n1.) Not noob friendly... If you do pick up this game make sure you put in the time to learn about classes, builds, and exp walls. I understand that no game should hold your hand, and thats how I like my games but many people end up wasting their time and end up rerolling. So study before you even make a character. Just a sidenote I had two of my buddies quit because they were just casuals and wanted to jump right into the game. I respect people who just want to jump right in and have some fun but this isn't that type of game.\n\n2.) Yes there are a lot of bugs and lag issues pretty much at all times. It doesn't really matter how good your rig is. This game is not optimized to perform well.\n\n3.) Yes there are always bot spammers selling gold etc. You can go back to a location a month later and find the same bots farming under some generic name like farmingbot128. I assume they use numbers just to show their dominance and persistence. It's probably their way of saying "hahaha you can't get rid of me! lolololol#@!$"\n\n4.) Trade/Market restricions. Well first off you are going to want a token if you plan on using the market. Hell I'd go as far to say you want a token to play this game. Back to the point you can't trade gold, and your market will be limited to 1 item for sale with a 30% commission if your f2p... dat tax doe. As you can see the developers try very hard to limit the bots/goldsellers but it has only ended up hurting the players gaming experience.\n\n5.) The Grind... The grinding aspect of this game is not meant for all. It is long and feels unrewarding. Expect to grind a lot at later levels 140-16* and at 200+. A tokken should heavily be considered if you don't have one. And Exp Tomes can really help you save time. Yes you have to spend money to reduce stress... this is a buy to win game.\n\n6.) Dungeons and bosses feel lackluster. Dungeons just don't feel good to do as most people just rush bosses. There might as well not be any trash packs. On top of that magic mobs can really mess your day up if you aren't tanky enough and don't have a healer. You have to pray that you get matched with tank/healer if not premade. Most boss mechanics don't feel very challenging either. The tank/melee are the only ones that have to worry about boss mechanics most of the time while the range dps can stay safe away and just drool on their keyboards.\n\n7.) Where is the PvP? Where is it! All guilds are now neutral and team battle should have been functional since release. Seriously where is team battle, is it ever going to exist? I mean these things are advertised in the game info. You may as well take that off because your just false advertising your game. Unreal\n\n8.) Imba Imba Imba... Imba everywhere. Do expect a handful of classes to be better than others. I don't advise going swords unless you plan on going full tank, or for a pvp build (cataphract). If you choose to be a dps swords you will hate yourself later on. As for me I hate myself because I made a cataphract for pure pvp.. no peltasta for tanking... And guess what there is no pvp for me to do even with being in a guild. No grind groups will want a swords without pelt, you will have to make your own group. On top of classes being imba items are also imba as well. There are few items to select from in general that are miles better than the rest. There are low level items that exceed much higher level ones so as long as you have those few good items you don't have to worry about upgrading to much.\n\n9.) Incompetent developers. These guys don't address any issues or make any attemps to respond to the community at all. Posts by these guys are just a few sentences long and mostly just "we are sorry, thank you for your patience." Stop being sorry give us some information about whats going on god damn it. This game has the potential but there is a lack of polishment and any concern to address issues to the public. Far as I'm concerned they are just milking this game for the quick $$$ now and letting this game die out.","June 2","false","466.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Is that really the only thing they thought was worth taking from RO? Why do we still have sterotypical western MMO tropes seeping into eastern MMOs now as well as every single western MMO? Why do developers STILL think that to make a successful MMO you need some intricate combat system that will never be good, because MMO combat is never good, but it is better to make a boring combat system that works than a boring combat system that doesn't. Most of the classes in Ragnarok played by holding left click, Runescape had a combat system where you left click once and wait until the enemy died for crying out loud, but it worked, and those games were highly successful. And stop forcing sheep hearding, mandatory linear quests for god sake, give players the means to find out how to level on their own.\n\nAnyway, it's basically RO with the entire gameplay system cut out of it to be replaced with ♥♥♥♥♥♥, overused and boring modern MMO tropes that I listed above, plus a very very terrible version of the class system from RO.\n\nThe positives\n-Art style\n-Music\n\nThe negatives that I care about\n-Ultra clunky keyboard/controller based movement/combat system with practically zero targeting and you feel you have little control over your abilities, highly sensitive to ping, feels horrid when you aren't close to the server. The choice of this movement and combat system in a RO-esque/top down view MMO is utterly bizzare, the fact this isn't point and click like Dofus, Wakfu, RO and other top down games I'll never be able to work out. Why did the developers feel they had to be totally different here, but copy tropes everywhere else?\n\n-Zones are horrifically small and feel totally crowded, made worse by the fact mobs spawn clustered in portions of the already tiny zone rather than randomly placed, your quest area is potentially smaller than the screen.\n\n-Mandatory linear questing. You linearly progress through the zones, the ones you pass through, you won't return to. There is absolutely no open world elements whatsoever, you cannot go anywhere you want when you start the game like you can in RO or many other games for that matter. Even WoW has more choice on where/how you level than this game. This is the worst part that makes the game totally different to RO, terrible and destined to be a failure. The modern obsession with this system is a plague and developers can't seem to work out that if you do this your game dies most of the time. Add this with the tiny zones and you get double the cancer. What if I told you that it is possible to make an MMO without quests, or have them as optional side quests or ways to unlock other things? Well you can and I hope to ♥♥♥♥ MMO developers realise this soon.\n\n-Class/skill system is kind of like they wanted to make it similar to RO, but change it so it is unique. Cept it is super stupid because early classes have limited abilities and branch out into new and totally different ones that don't actually complement each other. You have to get bow skills as an archer but then you can eventually get skills for daggers, but when you have daggers, whats the point of the bow skills you just learned. Half the time the old skills are weak and redundant later anyway. I'm not sure why they added 5 billion different classes and grouped them under a mere 4 starting classes. RO had 6, and they branched off into two more, then never branched again, but the starting classes had skills relevant to the classes they turned into, ToS doesn't.\n\nThere's more issues but there's no point mentioning them because of the reasons above.

Moving through maps you will get the occasional greeting from random players, players asking for help, people who really want to interact with others, which is a great thing for an MMO to have.\nDespite this, I cannot recommend this game to anyone right now.

There are 2 weeks left until this game goes free to play and a one month headstart does not amount to much with all these issues plaguing the game.","April 11","false","75.5"," 61 of 110 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","61","110","2","0"

I've been completely hooked since.  Taking a quick break from leveling up to address some of the major complaints people have.  There's a very cool game here, it needs work yet but don't let the negative reviews make you miss out because there's something great about this game and I could see myself playing it for a long time.\n\n- Unique approach to trading.  This is a major complaint for a lot of people but I think it's great. Most of the complaints are from new players that tried to trade their wooden shields off to a friend and then to an alt and found out they couldn't. In the long term it should keep the games economy very healthy and empower grinders instead of flippers. Materials can only be traded once, all mats go from source > crafter no flipping possible.  This is amazing,  increases the value of farming mobs instead of playing auction house simulator.  Equipment can be flipped by premium users but everything has a "potential" stat used for improving items, and this stat gets reduced by 1 with every trade.  This means items become less valuable with every flip until they also become untradable when potential reaches zero.\n\n- Bots.  Every free to play game has bots.  Every subscription game also has bots.  As long as wealthy westerners are willing to spend thousands of Euros / USD on their mmo characters every month there will be people in places where electricity is cheap making their living by botting MMOs.  This doesn't seem any worse in this game than any other free to play game I've played. Everything instanced is party based and any bots out in the world are very visible.  Anyone suggesting that the bots are worse here than anywhere else hasn't been paying attention to what has been happening in their MMOs for the last decade.  The trade restrictions do have a HUGE impact on what bots can accomplish despite what others are saying.\n\n- Server problems / lag / fps issues.  This is a legit problem, but has already improved since I started.  There are some FPS issues still but IMC seems to be working on them.  Lag has noticeably reduced for me in the last week.\n\n- Elite players controlling high end content has been a complaint I've seen a lot.  So what? it's competitive PvE, that's why these guys bought founder packs for the headstart.  We'll all get there eventually.  Even so, IMC is changing it so single bosses can't be monopolized by one group.\n\n- Class balance.  Ever play an MMO that didn't have these problems?  Game is fresh, give it time.  More importantly the meta has not yet settled and from the guides I've read and gear / class suggestions people make on reddit, most of the player base is entirely clueless on the games mechanics.\n\nThere's a great game here that, like most MMOs, has had a very rocky start.  An amazingly deep class system reminiscient of final fantasy tactics, awesome small features like being able to teleport back to any quest giver once you complete the quest, an interesting 'team level' system that gives you bonus exp for all your characters based on your total exp gained (so get one guy to high level, the next is much easier).  Quite a few interesting new approaches to MMO tropes in this game.\n\nThis game does a lot of things right,  and as far as MMOs go is in much better shape at launch than most I've played.  If IMC continues to improve it which it seems they are this game will become something pretty special.  Don't miss out because of a bunch of ragequit reviews, the game has problems but assuming it improves (and it already has in the last two weeks) there's something here you might not want to miss. If you like ARPGs and MMOs at all, give it a try when free to play re - opens.","May 30","true","322.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I first read reviews and saw the first 70 or so were all negitive so i decided i was not going to play.  Then one of my buddies picked it up and got my curious.\n\nThis game is not complete.  There are only 7 tiers of job classes taking you to about 225 for the last one.  As far as i can tell, they do not plan to stop there and stuff will be added in the future.  That being said its very similiar to releasing a beta of the game.  That is not as bad as it sounds though.  The game is pretty solid with what it does have and gives you a pretty wide range of classes to play.  Thousands of different job combos for each of the 4 classes.  And different ways to play through the game.\n\nIn this game you can grind like a mad man, or you can do daily dungeons and quests and level multiple guys at the same time quite effectively, or you can quest.  If you quest, instead of getting the exp reward instantly they give you exp cards.  Those cards can be saved up and used to push you through tough levels for you class or however you want.  A neat and varried system.\n\nI have a coin, but i can say that i played about a week without one and the difference it makes it pretty insane.  Can't really imagine playing without one ever again.  The coins unlock many features that are used to limit and frustrate you into supporting the game.  I'm not sure if this is the best tactic, but it got me to buy it.\n\nThe crafting, item upgrading, gems, cards and pets are all pretty well done.  Crafting is actually relevant for obtaining some of the best gears.  Upgrading makes almost all peices of gear better in some way.  Gems provide neat buffs depending on the peice and can be leveled up to provide bigger buffs.  I like these systems.\n\nThe worst part about this game is bots and how they are trying to handle them.  Atm bots are to a degree ruining certain farmable crafting materials prices by having them constantly farmed.  This sucks but it also makes those mats cheaper for those looking to buy instead of farm, but it makes the farming yourself harder.  The restrictions on trading and the AH can get pretty frustrating.  They were put in to stop bots, but not really working.  They are however semi frustrating to real humans.  All in all though, they have already patched and made quite a few of them better.... provided you are using a token.  The most frustrating part is that you can't move gold between your characters, and if you buy any item off the AH that has no potiential, it becomes bound to that character.  These are not that huge as far as negitive impacts go.\n\nI've only had lag for 1 day.  It was the day they split servers.  Can't really say its an issue at all.\n\n\nTL:DR\nIts a solid start to a game with many many fun choices to explore and play out.  Bots suck, but aren't that big an issue atm.  Alot of the complaints i see are solved by supporting the game and getting an in game Token for premium features.  That doesn't mean its pay to win, just lowers frustration level with trade and item limitations.  Meaning if you don't have a Token you must be patient.\n\n","May 15","true","219.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/firscyth/recommended/372000/","firscyth","Firscythe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/firscyth/","228 products in account","If you get over the fact that this is early access and the game is thus affected by a plethora of bugs, this game has a great foundation upon which to build a great MMO. Most of the complaints aren't against the game's design itself, but bugs, server issues and temporary solutions to problems. I'll list a few problems:\n->Sometimes your character will be stuck in limbo because a map is unavailable or bugged, or they'll have something that stops their progress(usually fixed within a few days)\n->Servers are laggy and unstable, which results in long spawn timers, a select few classes' skills being annoying to use and unplayability during rush hours.\n->The translation is still being worked on and some quest text is missing.\n->The leveling curve may be slightly off balance in some regions, requiring grinding or creative exploration to keep up with leveling.\n\nConsidering IMC has shown time and again they are dedicated to making this into a good game, they have my full support and I fully believe these problems will be fixed given enough time and support from the community.\n\nNow for the pros:\n->This game's class system is great in that it allows for creativity and different synergies, although you'll want to study your build before you jump into it.\n\n->Partying is incredibly fun and satisfying, since you'll always feel you bring something to the table(unless you make a very specific solo build) and even if you're just grinding on the same spot the interaction between players keeps the gameplay interesting.\n\n->The questing is really enjoyable in this game because you'll find yourself often gaining new abilities as you level, keeping the experience fresh throughout all of it. Unlike certain games, you won't learn your main combo at level 10 and repeat it until you're max level, as every so often you'll change classes and gain new abilities to play with.\n\n->Although some will claim pay to win, I feel like there is nothing a paying player can buy that gives them an edge in PvP other than making money fast. If you don't mind other players leveling faster than you because they paid(and not affecting you at all), this game is really fair in it's real money use.\n\n->You'll always have something to do in this game if you like the core gameplay, as there is almost limitless growth from just exploring new areas and obtaining difficult-to-get items from crafting. You don't reach max level fast and play dungeons for a year until the expansion: Leveling and growing is the main focus of the game and it's built to last a while.\n\n->Not considering bugs, the game's combat is really fluid, exciting and unique. I feel like they did a great job when just running around killing monsters for no reason feels fun and I forget I had to keep questing.\n\n->This game's music is absolutely lovable and I haven't opened my playlist once in all my time playing.\n\nSome cons, so I don't seem biased:\n->There is no monster tagging in this game, and some populated zones will have you frustrated from getting kill-stolen by people.\n\n->A few rare quests seem to take so long for no reason, like the time I was boredly mining coal for a good 20 minutes.\n\n->This game has a ton of bots and silver sellers. They mostly don't bother me as they're restricted to a few zones farming, but if you don't like that you'll be annoyed. Although I do believe IMC want to end this problem, their approaches so far have failed and I don't know who will end up winning the war. Ragnarok Online, often compared to this game, was basically bot land.\n\n->It is possible to make bad, irreversible decisions with a character which may cause players to be frustrated in the late game if they didn't plan beforehand. I advise you to research the game or copy a well-rated build for your first character.\n\n->If you're the PvP kind of person, I cannot guarantee this game will be balanced considering the ENORMOUS variety of builds and possibilities. In Ragnarok Online, a much simpler game, some classes were utterly useless while others had very specific, unfun niches. If you're expecting to play PvP your own way, expect to lose. Note that as this is still very early into the game I'm just guessing how it'll be, from experience.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is incredibly enjoyable and better the more friends you have. I see a great future for Tree of Savior and it's community, if IMC is capable of handling the launch issues they currently have.","April 3","true","934.6"," 71 of 130 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","71","130","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaftikins/recommended/372000/","zaftikins","Leo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaftikins/","481 products in account","So here's the short and the long.\n\nThe short: Tree of Savior is a RO-like MMO that, while very fun and very promising, has a bunch of issues at the moment. Play it if you want something fun, gorgeous and nostalgic, and are willing to put up with stupid translations, horrible servers, janky optimization and some F2P restrictions.\n\nThe long: Tree of Savior is fun. It has a great foundation. In many ways this is like Ragnarok Online but it stands enough on its own to not seem like a simple clone. There are 80 classes, hundreds of levels, tons of zones, gorgeous music and visuals, lots of cute ♥♥♥♥ to collect and wear, so on and so forth. But it suffers a major problem. Its creator (IMC) is Korean, and its creator is new to the MMO field. This means that there are a lot of cultural disconnects where Korean players enjoy playing one way and Western players enjoy another way, and there are a lot of rookie mistakes, like thinking hiding global chat behind a paywall or prohibiting trade to premium players would stop gold-selling (it didn't). The servers are total ♥♥♥♥ and suffer from constant lag spikes, crashes, and rubberbanding. Luckily, IMC does seem to care. They've made changes quickly during the early-access based on our feedback, and they've given us Premium items (like exp tomes and enchant scrolls) as an apology for the issues. To me, this is huge, because they could just as easily have said "Eh, launch problems, all MMOs have that now" and ignored us. So if you're willing to put up with that ♥♥♥♥ for probably 1-2 more months while they hammer out the bugs, I think it's a great game with a great foundation and you'll have a lot of fun with it.\n\nAlso if you can read Korean and write with at least a 3rd grade English level, please help translate this game. It's all fan-translated, and right now, most of that translation is awful and only a step above DUWANG.","April 10","true","114.5"," 52 of 94 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","52","94","5","0"

The game's primary billing is its art style and music, crafted under the direction of Kim Hakkyu, who originally worked on RO and here proves he had a heavy hand in the uniquely charming, colorful world that continues to draw players both old and new into the RO habit regardless of all the gameplay flaws of that ancient work.\n\nIn TOS, that vision comes alive on the wings of modern MMO design. Instead of slaying your PC to load in HD physics-enabled 3D models with a billion variables for weight, scale, facial features, decal textures and hair morphs, TOS presents a clean, tightly-designed visual aesthetic that at once pays homage to and surpasses the charm of RO. Every scene looks like it came straight out of a storybook, filled in with richly colored illustrated environments and greeted by distinct-looking characters in anime style.\n\nWhen you aren't chilling to upbeat synths you're on a streamlined, fast-paced bender of action/RPG goodness. Cutting down hordes of mobs is the order of the day, unhindered by one of  the smoothest control schemes I've ever tangled with, cleanly autodetecting keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs on the fly. Numerous waypoints let you scale expeditions to your liking without getting lost. Numerous game sounds alert you to the various activities on screen, from loot pickups to mousing over UI elements. Even typing in the chatbox has SFX to let you know that, yes, you are interacting with the game and not just quietly throwing words into the void. If there is one thing this game does right, it's the fact it doesn't get in the way of you playing it.\n\nAnd its flaws are numerous, from oversights in programming and design to the toxic philosophy of F2P gaming. Lacking a heavy investment in debugging and QA, IMC has been patching reported errors (including a glaring LUA exploit that literally destroyed guilds) since day 1 of early access, and continues to be plagued with unpredictable downtimes, emergency maintenance, unreliable latency and bumpy framerates. (I run a  GTX 660 and can maintain 30+ fps in a crowded city, yet users with more powerful machines have had severe trouble, and I don't mean the "Wahhh give me 120 fps 4K gaming" kind.)\n\nTOS is ambitious with a mix-and-match style of class and skill progression, which as far as I know is a rarity in Asian RPGs, which strongly favor strict linear progression and locked archetypes. The fact you're rewarded with class-specific costumes that you can also swap between as you like also makes the prospect of playing a dilletante extremely enticing. Unfortunately, the way skills and classes are unlocked and gated prevents most combinations from gaining much synergy, and failing to plain is usually a plan to fail. As is typical of these games, raising stat and skill levels is a crapshoot at best, and resetting them will cost a premium in time or money; sadly, there is no class reset available as of writing, which could leave characters with less-optimal builds in the lurch as content development continues. Here's hoping that various classes and skills are buffed or reworked to let the crazy diamonds shine on!\n\nAs well, there are various restrictions on the economy and premium-locked benefits that have angered even the most faithful fans. Not requiring class skills for the majority of crafting was a wise decision, in my eyes, at least. Requiring a Swordie to give up a class rank in order to create a guild, maaaybe not. Price-fixing the Auction House and actively hindering F2P users' AH interaction? Extremely questionable.\n\nBut code, as error fixes prove, can be rewritten, and there is potential for TOS to rewrite the code on what an immersive, fun, and beautiful MMO can be, particularly because it has no breast slider.","May 18","true","172.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","0"

In short, even after 400+ hours, I don't recommend this game. Also be wary, lots of these positive reviews are from brand new players who are too caught up in the huge amount of early game content and haven't yet hit the wall of restrictions and inconveniences that only exist in this version of the game. After a while, the nostalgia just can't mask the flaws...\n\n+ Very nostalgic and brings me back to the days where I played a lot of RO and MapleStory\n+ Big variety of classes so you can be very creative with your build if you want to be\n+ Early-Mid Game goes by super fast so just by playing a few hours a day, you can experience a lot of the game\n+ Lots of different control schemes, controller is fun to play with imo\n+ Great artwork and soundtrack\n+ Cool gameplay mechanics. Think interactive quests and action-mmo combat.\n\nAnd that's all the positive things about this game, to me. Here's everything that is wrong with the game in my opinion:\n- Huge class imbalance. While you can any build you want, only a handful are viable after a certain level and even then, most are undesired for end-game content. Lots of classes are just plain underpowered and we haven't gotten any class balance changes for 2 months. (korean version has gotten them)\n- Terrible game optimization. The way this game was programmed makes it utilize your CPU for most of the graphical processing instead of your GPU, and on top of that, it's written to only use a single core of your CPU. I have 300+ FPS on League of Legends on maxed settings and struggle to maintain 120 FPS on this game. Most of the time I'm averaging 70 FPS in fields, 30 FPS in dungeons, and like 15 FPS in populated towns. ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.\n- Terrible servers and netcode. I don't know why they bought servers that start to lag unbearbly with just 2,000 players online, but they did. Everyone's suffering for it. Also the netcode of this game was written with the Korean infrastructure in mind. Some classes can't even be played to their potential because your ping will never be low enough or consistent enough to combo/spam effectively.\n- Bugs. Yeah, every new game has bugs. But lots of these bugs have been around since the beta of 2015 and they haven't been fixed. Lots of them are gamebreaking. Yet another issue that is dragging IMC's name in the mud.\n- Unforgiving for new players. Yeah, if you ♥♥♥♥ up your build then you will start over. So all new players need to a good amount of research on what they want to play before making their characters. There are also no free skill resets or even a buyable stat reset. So if you done goofed, ya donezo.\n- Lack of late-game content. Yup..PVP Battle League isn't live yet, GvG, Guildwars and etc. are a nightmare due to the poor optimization of this game. Right now the only thing to do once you hit cap is farm World Bosses for drops, and attempt the "Earth Tower" dungeon that nobody's beaten yet. Not that big of an issue since IMC is adding more content, slowly.\n- Freemium Token. Gives movement speed, bonus hunting EXP, and takes off a lot of restrictions regarding Auction House and 1:1 trading.\n- Trading and Auction House restrictions.  If you have token, then you won't really feel as hurt by this as F2P players. Pretty much whatever you trade when you don't have token becomes untradeable. You can only have 1 (10 w/ token) item in the auction house, and 30% (10% w/ token) if whatever you earn off a sale is taken as commission. They're working on improving this, but so far it's still garbage.\n- Cross-character Storage. You cannot transfer items across characters if you don't have token. WTF. With token, you are given ONE transfer slot to use. You can go get 3 collections so far that increase the limit by +2 each. So if you do go through all the hunting and farming required to get the items to fill these collections, you will have 7 slots. Even then, you still cannot transfer untradeable items or even premium items. They're stuck on whatever character you bought them on. ♥♥♥♥ this.\n- Lack of communication from IMC. For the most part, IMC doesn't tell us much and responds to issues so late that people end up quitting because they can't play for almost an entire day before issues are addressed. They also don't keep us in the loop about game patches that we should be getting. They tried at first, but for the last couple of weeks, we haven't gotten anything that addresses the serious complaints.\n- Website/Forums always down. This probably has to do with their ♥♥♥♥ servers, but yeah, you can't ever access the forums or website when you need to.\n\ntl;dr: game is too buggy, laggy, and imbalanced to recommend. fun concept, ♥♥♥♥ execution.","May 12","false","592.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I love it. It has great potential overall to become something big. Gaphics are nice, there's the BUT the publisher/developer, IMC Games, is a total mess.\n\nHigh latency on every server, disconnects, bugs, glitches, uberly high queues to enter the game, over population, not enough servers for high populated areas. The producers barely communicate with the community, there's no news regarding the game issues, it's like they don't even speak english and have no representative in their team to do so and give the community an answer their claims. It takes hours, sometimes DAYS, for them to even read the official forum.\n\nThe game is full of unresolved problems ever since the first beta over AN ENTIRE YEAR AGO. It's the same old problems for way too much time with no resolution at all. Totally unacceptable, specially when they had more than two or three beta tests over the last year. Specially when they sold ALOT of founder's pack. The game "officially launched" as Free2Play a week ago with no stability at all and a totally unprepared team to manage it.\n\nI strongly recommend people who haven't played the game so far to stay away from it UNTIL IMC Games get their sh#it together as your game experience will probably be undermined due to all the problems around.","May 14","false","908.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Better stay away from it and spend your worthy time on other games out there.\n\nThe game itself is good with class system, graphic and storyline but IMC ruins it completely. Everytime IMC makes a decision on update, the outcome is always extremely stupid.\n\nThey limit many features and make the gameplay more complicated just to prevent botting such as no silver trading, limited trading, limited market prices, 48hrs delay on market trading. And we still see a plenty of bots every map/channel. For those spamming silver sellers bots which should be easily monitored and banned, they still alive till this day.\n\nMoreover, many of the bugs and problems like server laggy, dungeon matching, dungeon disconnected, FPS dropped, no translation, etc., have been known since CBT or early OBT but still occurs and no sign of improving at all.

Great music, great art, fun class system. There is a lot of grinding to the game and to all the people complaining about camped zones, I have a few tips.  If you are in a heavy populated channel,  change channels and start inviting or requesting invites for a party.  When a party member kills, obtains,  activates a quest item it gives credit to all nearby party members.  I have not had any issue finding the mobs or quest items needed.\n\nThe biggest problem and turn off currently is the LAG.  If you have to pickup more than 1 quest you have to change channels and wait for load screens or you end up sitting at the quest person for minutes waiting for server to respond with the NPC dialog box.  This goes the same with most quests that require you to activate items.  The first action on a channel seems lag free and then it goes downhill fast, making constant channel switching the most efficient way to play.   This is garbage and servers need to be updated asap.   Also because some channels are constantly being restarted by the server causing a disconnect when you join a mew one, you can end up back into a waiting queue if you do channel hop so be careful.\n\nTL:DR -  In the current state of things I would not recommend this game due to the shoddy servers.  Please save yourself the trouble and do not start playing on F2p release because you will end up frustrated and disgusted quickly by the server states.  Wait maybe a month or 2 after release and then give it a go.  It is a beautiful game but the lag issues were present in both CB's and its doubtful to be resolved upon f2p release.","April 4","false","69.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

This game has potential, but there's a whole bunch of silly things (In my opinion) that need to have been dealt with before the games release.\n\n-The lag, I can understand because it's new and it'll have a bunch of F2P players coming in; but it means I haven't been able to try out classes that need decent ping, and buffing is a nightmare.\n\n-I dont understand how the optimisation in this game is so bad. You can have everything on the lowest settings and still just about scrape by 30fps.\n\n-Awful quality of life in game. They focussed more on bots than real people who would play the game. Bots won't care what you do, they'll still do bot things because they don't have opinion, every MMORPG has them and it's just something that needs to be accepted.\n\n-They put up pay walls behind tokens, but didn't have an option to purchase them on release, and you still cant buy them almost two weeks later.\n\n-Now here's my biggest issue: The spawn rate. Grind MMORPGs are probably my favourite. Yeah, the whole instant reward from questing with exp cards and all that is fun, but I do enjoy getting with a group of people and just grinding my way though levels, because it is nice when you go through that work and achieve a high level. Unfortunately, the system has low spawn rate with pretty mediocre experience gain. Along with the system that gives you less experience/damage the larger your level gap from the mob is.\n\nAll in all, I think once they get the game going it could be very good, just these issues make it a pain.\n","May 22","false","102.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game is full of game-breaking bugs that didn't get fixed since the CBT, the game is a grind-fest with horrible monsters AI, bosses are badly designed(too easy = no challenge), you won't get challenged by their mechanics, only by the fact that all the monsters 200+ have HUGE HP and OVERPOWERED homing skills that you can't dodge. This isn't fun at all.\n\nThe game proposes a ton of classes for you to waste a lot of time trying to create the BEST class you feel comfortable with, when in fact the game isn't balanced at all, making only a few viable builds. For example, swordsman tree is so bad, that even if you do a full DPS swordsman build, you won't be able to outdps a FULL tank/con mage.\n\nQuests are boring, just a way for you to get max level easier, but all those problems I stated aren't the worse of them. The game has been around for a while and all we get are patches done by their company's trainee, cause they only fix bugs that don't interfere with the game. They company don't listen to the players' feedback. I have reported a few bugs I have found and I all got was an automated response from their ticket service.\n\nOh, and the game's optimization... Oh god, this game is SO BADLY OPTIMIZED that you will get 0~10 FPS(in bosses/gvg's etc) even with the BEST RIG avaiable. The servers are always FULL and LAGGY, I live close to the server and my ping is around 200 when I should in fact have a ping of 10~40.\n\nThe good points of this game are: awesome soundtrack, beautiful design, but these are easily overshadowed by the bad management of IMC and the game's poor gameplay.","May 23","false","576.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Even if you have low ping, the npcs themselves will lag while interacting with them. making quests uncompletable. But depending on situations you may be able to complete them, same goes with skills and stats, you may have added some stats/skills but wondered why it hasn't been applied - its lag, of course this affects anvils, storages, etc.\n\n- Game is poorly optimized. - In fact the game isn't optimized at all, you can easily get higher fps and smoother gameplay in other demanding games like FPS games, dota, Battlefield, COD, Counter Strike but this holy game have epic framerate drops which produces fps lag.\n\n- The SEA Servers [Varena + Telsiai] are kind of the most overpopulated servers and with that, Telsiai is restricting new players from joining it (in favor of Buy 2 Play early access exclusive access players) temporaily(very long temporary)\nHeck, you can't even access SA servers.\n\n- IMC/Developer ♥♥♥♥s up, they/the game can't have a server that handles a lot of connection like how maplestory does. Their server can't handle the greatness of how we can have a lot of maples in maple and have 0 lag.\n\nGo on and have hours of gameplay from this, I'm writing this review based on what I've experienced.","May 20","false","43.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Just no. There are still many broken functions in the game and the company (IMC, yes that is you) have not addressed or fixed yet, like a typical money grabbing mmo company they do not respond to the players professionally and many still have their support ticket unresolved, waiting for days. Their staff do not respond on the forums as well and guess what? Your characters are stuck on the server you choose and not transferable except for the one time they did a month ago , which in this case, no new players will even notice about and invest their time in the wrong server until they realise the lag and snapback is not worth it and dont want to switch servers because you have to start from scratch (everything will be gone even your premium items). Until the company fixes itself, the game is still a big NO, no matter how fun the game is.\n\nEDIT : Lets not forget the tens of bots spamming 20 lines of chat selling in game currency for real money (RMT) and IMC does nothing to get rid of them, as a bonus, everytime you teleport to a town it swaps you to a high latency channel with many bots spamming. Even better? The game code has already been exploited and there are already cheat bots.

I want to say this game is great. I want to say that the hours of time I lost playing this game where not fun. I want to say how much I hate this game.\n\nThe problem is , I don't hate the game. The grinding WAS fun...But the game has major flaws and issues, and as such the game is not great, and the game won't get a thumbs up.  As of this moment with their new "DLC" the game has officially been unistalled. I am not going to list all my reasons, because all you need to do is google and you will find the HUGE firestorm of all the issues this game has.\n\nTo be fair, i will list some of the largest glaring flaws the game has so that It doesn't look like just a cop out.\n\n* Some Skills Freeze the game. This is a known bug that has been a issue for a while and yet they havn't tried to fix it.\n* Skills that Freeze the game LAG Others on the same map. If your game crashes using the skills, other people on the map will suffer with you.\n*Some Classes unplayable due to the lag. Many skills lag the game as well and the skill animation goes off but the attack does not. You are frozen and stuck while using this attack and things are attacking you and take no damage to the "invisable" skill.  Worse yet, if the skill cost an item...and you use the item but don't get the skill. Waste of Resources.\n*The Gold Sellers are Cheaper then the DLC prices. This one is kinda self explanitory. The game says its geared to make sure that gold sellers arn't going to run rampent, but the gold sellers are still all here and yet we still have the inconviances.\n* LACK OF ANY SORT OF PRESENCE IN FORUMS. This is the largest glaring issue that I have. The official forums seem to lack any sort of moderation at all, No "official" person has come on to state anything other then "This is happening" and off they go. Nothing said is heard, it all falls upon Deaf Ears.\n\nIf you want to play the game though and push though all the BS, then go right ahead.

It's got a lot of issues.\n\n- The leveling system is broken. Monsters have massive HP bars and give very little experience when killed, which turns leveling up into a massive chore.  The game keeps giving the player these XP scrolls for some reason, instead of bumping up the XP you get from killing monsters, which is the whole point of a game like this.\n\n- No PvP mode. Seriously? PvP was a huge part of the late game in Ragnarok Online and it's baffling to me how it's nowhere to be seen in ToS.\n\n- Lack of Gear Customization. The card system in Ragnarok Online was awesome and it had a lot of depth. In ToS, you only have these boring gems that have no depth to them whatsoever.\n\n- The developers LOVE to toot their own horns, saying how deep the class system in this game, and how many classes there are, when in reality, the class system in ToS is not even half as deep as the class system in Ragnarok Online. Quality, not quantity is what I always say.\n\n- The Boss Fights are BORING and repetitive. Do you guys remember how awesome it was to fight an MVP in Ragnarok Online? How badass they looked and how they could one-shot your character if you weren't careful? ToS's bosses have more in common with Diablo 3's than Ragnarok's bosses.\n\n- Lack of an Attack Speed counter/stat. This is more of a personal opinion, but it really bums me out how you can't really measure or change your attack speed in the game.\n\n- The controls are terrible. When your Korean MMO controls best on an Xbox 360 pad, you know you got problems. The Mouse controls are buggy as all hell and the Keyboard controls are just not fun to mess around with. I just don't get why they didn't stick with Ragnarok Online's control scheme? You shouldn't have to play a PC MMO with an Xbox 360 pad.\n\nThere's a reason why people still play Ragnarok Online 11 years after it came out. That game has depth, it knows how to keep the player engaged, it has an awesome PvP mode, group events, Guilds actually mean something and above all, it's fun to play. Tree of Savior looks better and that's pretty much it. I'm absolutely devastaded by how this game turned out, but I'm not gonna be deceived by its familiar code of paint like a lot of people did.

Lag.  The lag is awful and I don't think it'll get any better once the game gets out of the 'month early access'.  It'll only get worse.  Not to mention when I played earlier, channels were crashing, leaving a lot of players to go to 3 channels.  I ended up logging out because getting any quests done was next to impossible.\n\n2.  F2P players are at a disadvantage.  You can't do trades unless you have the 'subscription' aka token active.  Like really????  Trading is a basic feature in nearly every mmo!  Account wide storage is also behind this wall, which can be a real pain if you're playing more than 2 classes.  You get extra speed too, which is useful, but this could be a problem in PvP down the line.\n\n3.  Shoutting gold spam.  Every night I come on, I have to block the wall of gold spam.  It wouldn't be bad if the chat wouldn't lag the game.  ~_~  At this point, just turn shouts off.\n\n4.  Quests are boring.  Very generic quests, but how many ways can you make kill -insert mob here- interesting?  Also, make sure you cover every base on a map, quest NPCs are not marked, so you have to watch for a npc anc click on them to see if it's a quest.  Can miss out on exp because you're not combing every corner of the map.\n\n5.  Research is a must.  Before you play, I would highly suggest you goggle the game and see what builds are recommended.  Granted, there's a skill/stat reset, but you might save yourself money/time by doing some research yourself.\n\n6.  Some bugs.  I came across 2 quests I could not complete.  Both of them, I could not interact with the object I needed to interact with.\n\n7.  Combat is rather boring.  As a cleric, I lay down heal, lure monsters in to attack them, and if the monsters are 'floaty', I have to bash it to death with my mace.  Rinse and repeat.  I'm hoping there's more involved at later levels, but so far, I'm not impressed.\n\nThe good about this game?  It's a very pretty looking game and the music is there.  But as they say, graphics cannot save mediorc gameplay.\n\nCould this be a good game?  Yeah, with some polish, it could very well be a good mmo.  But in it's current state?  I don't see myself playing it long term.  I might use as much as I can on the token I used and just move on to something else if nothing comes.","April 3","false","27.6"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","21","37","0","0"

Probably. Would I recommend this game to RO Players? No.\n\nFirst let's just start off from my background and why I wanted to play the game, and I'll be very brief in this.\n\nTL;DR  We played alot of RO back in the days and loved it\n\nYears ago, I and my friends fell in love with an MMORPG called Ragnarok Online, it was the best mmo we've played for a long time, to the point where we would even use our monthly allowance to pay for time in the game instead of things like food and stationery. The game had everything we loved, great music, vast world, danger even in safe areas, and the freedom to decide on what we want to do, how to do it, and how to grow our characters, it was basically a great adventure for all of us.\n\nYears past by, and we heard of Ragnarok Online 2: Gate of the world, the music was alright but the game wasn't that good, and then there was the infamous Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the second, I don't want to go into the details on this but let's just say that we decided that we're better off playing E.T. the video game (we didn't), than RO2.\n\nAnd then Tree of Savior was announced, and boy were we excited, we made a promise to return together and we waited, and now that it officially opened, we were disappointed...\n\nTree of Savior isn't a bad game as a whole, it has good points like;\n- The freedom to build your character however you like\n- Nice music (though personally not as great as RO1's)\n- Great artwork and design\n- Good flow of combat\n- Easier UI\n- The Goddesses are packed with good "Plot" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)b\n\nHowever it is packed with problems that does put a damper on the game such as;\n- Bugs\n- The requirement for premium to do things like trading, or setting up a buy shop, or even selling things in the market (you're limited to how much you can sell, and there will be higher tax imposed)\n- Lag, even with good connection, you're prone to experience game stopping lags\n- Botters\n- Spammers\n\nAnd because we were expecting it to be like RO, here are the problems of the game from my perspective;\n- Lesser rate of healing while sitting\n- Handheld throughout the game with quests, so we don't really have much of a choice in progressing.\n- The premium feels Pay2Win-ish\n\nConclusion\n\nSo would I recommend this game to others? Probably. Would I recommend this game to RO Players? No. So far i am not impressed with how IMC has handled the game, or even the game itself, I am hoping that it would eventually get better, but that has to wait","May 10","false","62.4"," 36 of 66 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","36","66","2","0"

To start off I had played Ragnarok Online for a couple of years an had plaed other MMOs as well. So let's start off with the Pros:\n\n1. Good Graphics - artistic and unique\n2. Satisfying gameplay - gameplay is really satisfying since most skills will often have a substantial effect on opponents and allies. There are still some skills that need tweaking and bug fixing; however, I woudl say that the game's gameplay is still really solid.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Grind- I have reached level 190. I can tell you that I have reached several grind walls already but the grind in this game is absurd. What happens if you're 10 levels above or below a monster? 10 levels above a monster = less exp (starting from being 5 levels below or above a monster); however,  being 10 levels below will make the monsters hit you harder in addition to having much less exp gain. It's gotten to the point that you really have to read on guides on how to use the exp cards efficiently due to the nature of the grind of this game and how unforgiving it is in terms of gaining experience due to leveling restrictions.\n\nTo top it all off, skill resets are only allowed through the use of premium currency, which is extreemely poor taste due to how much grind is involved and how the skill descriptions are really poor.\n\n2. Trade restrictions - My god... I have never seen a game so heavily restrict on it's trading before. You can list only 1 item on the market (non premium user) and you can only trade with other players without the use of the in game currency, which prompts you to barter. Access to the market is only in towns as well. This makes market use cumbersome and often not worth using for the most part, at least from my experience.\n\n3. Pay to win- sever items from the cash shop give combat advantages. Token = movespeed. Enchant scroll = provides you headgear with stat increases. Mind you that these increases are quite substantial, regardless of what people tell you otherwise.\n\n4. Techinical issues- bots, server instabilities, etc. Can be fixed\n\n5. Class Balance and equipment balance - can still be fixed; however, I really will say that the items and class balance are really out of whack right now. As an example for equipment, I am loaded with recipes but I have no materials to craft them even though I keep killing monsters, which often have spawn rates or mob densities that want us wanting more in normal maps. Not that the materials have any value on the market anyway nor can I actually sell them anyway due tot he trade restrictions hahaha.....\n\nOverall, the game is still really rough around the edges and has still to go through a lot to improve. Currently, seeing how this is going to lift it's limited access soon to F2P players, I want to warn prospective players that this is brings in a lot of the archaic and not so good aspect of past MMOs and fails to bring the sandbox feeling of RO in the game with all the restrictions involved.\n\nTL;DR - remove restrictions, improve archaic and obsolete MMO design (e.g. old world boss design, market access, bad spawn rates, etc.), make the grind more bearable, and balance issues in terms of skills and equipment aquisition.","April 30","false","231.3"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","22","39","3","2"

When you do login you will have to get used with pings of 250ms-1000ms.\n\n-A lot of bugs:\nThe main one is a bug called "Commander Loadfail" where you can't enter a map and it disconnects you to login screen.\nThe only way aroud so far is changing to another channel until you find a suitable one. But I got two characters that went in this bug in a place where there are only 2 channels and bot are bugged.... so dead characters\n\n-Gameply boring as hell:\nThis game has nothing to do with Ragnarok gameplay.\nThe quest line guides you through the game like a 4 yo child. You cannot move around by yourself.\nAll the monsters are merely a formalitty, since you can kill them all by just holding the Z (auto attack).\nFells like mobile games for kids.\nOn top of that throw in a Stamina system where you can`t move around too much or the character becomes tired and you have to sit and wait until it recovers.

Some are in the publisher's control, some aren't. I'm going to skip the ones that are not in the publisher's control.\n\n1) Progression/Gameplay\nA lot of good mmo's in my opinion is like going to a theme park. Can go on whatever rides you want, a guide is going to give you a general direction, but at the end of the day you will have progressed through the theme park doing what you want. This game is like going down a corridor. You HAVE to go through every zone that the game tells you to, in the order they want you to. Now that isn't necessarily a problem, until you realize that even when you follow all the game's instructions, it is almost impossible get to the appropriate zones at the appropriate level. Why? because there are secret quests chains, that are more or less manditory if you don't want to grind, and if you miss these quest chains you won't have enough experience to level up to get to the next level without being underleveled. Now that also isn't a problem until you find out that the spawn rates in this game is extremely low which means that you have to fight other people for mobs to kill. The problem is that this isn't like any other MMO where you tag it and its yours. The person that gets the killing blow in gets the credit (this is also a problem for questing, since everyone is fighting everyone else to get the last hit in). So what you have is, a bunch of people who have finished the quests in the area that are higher level than the people who just began the area, camping mobs that those lower players need for questing because they themselves are too underleveled to progress to the next area.\n\nFor example, I've finished every quest I can find and I'm in a level 50 zone, but my character is level 42. This means that I need to go back to a level 40 zone as a level 42 competing against people who are probably level 35 who are trying to finish their quests. They can't finish it because I'm out last hitting them, so they go back to a level 35 zone to try to catch up to 40, etc etc.\n\n2) Lag/Server Issues\nThis is early access so the problem might be too many people being in the same area at the same time, but there is a huge issue with lag and response from the servers. Sometimes I try to interact with a NPC and  they don't respond until a couple seconds-minutes later. This might be alleviated if they got more servers or if the number of players drop in the areas. This might be the reason as to why the spawn rates are so low as to relieve some pressure off the servers. This is only going to get worse after F2P comes out.\n\nOverall, there are problems in this game mechanically that are totally fixable by the publishers, but whether they will is another story.","April 4","false","15.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It was not enough players without the VIP could not negotiate in game. They apply an abusive increase on the founder's patch, and consequently, in the future sell of the TP (pay coin of the game).\n\nThe IMC announced that: $9 per 100 TP, using the conversion that Steam frequently use: BRL 19.99 per 100 TP.\n\nOne Token costs 198 TP, or approximately USD 20 / BRL 40. A bit expensive to enable the "trade".\n\nNow, using the current conversion. USD 20 will be BRL 70. Very abusive.\n\nAnd what is the excuse? Simple "limit the bots that are messing up the game!!". IMC is disturbing my friends and me. The bots are still in there and they are going to stay there forever. While the game have players to buy silver and give profit, they will be there.\n\n\nNow I do not play.

Já não bastava jogadores "free", ou seja, jogadores sem o vip (TOKEN) não poderem negociar. Eles aplicam um aumento abusivo nos pacotes founder’s. E consequentemente, nos futuros pacotes de venda de TP (Moeda paga do jogo).\n\nComo informado a IMC vai cobrar 9,99 por 100 TP, usando a conversão que a Steam costuma usar seria 19,99 por 100 TP.\n\nUm Token custa 198 TP , ou seja, aproximadamente 20 dólares ou como antigamente, 40 reais. Abusivo para um mês vip? Abusivo para poder TROCAR ? Sim.\n\nAgora, usando a conversão atual. 20 dólares vão ser 70 reais. Abusivo? Certeza.\n\nE qual a desculpa da IMC? Simples, "limitar os bots que atrapalham o jogo!!"\nIMC esta atrapalhando eu e meus amigos. Os bots continuam lá, e sempre vão continuar. Enquanto tiver player para comprar silver e dar lucro, eles vão estar lá.\n\nAgora eu? Talvez não esteja.

If you're going to play this game, be aware that you will probably run into a lot of issues. While the base foundation is there, the game is simply not ready for public access. Tree of Savior has one of the most over the top trade restriction that are built to combat gold sellers but wound up punishing its playerbase instead. Due to this games' low spawn rate and mob reward system, you're going to run into a fair amount of killstealing where you won't get quest progress or credit if you don't last hit a mob. Shout chat is still filled with gold seller shouts, and bots are running around freely in unpopulated and populated areas (granted, what free to play mmo doesn't have bots doing just that). There have been exploits, dungeon entry issues, server and channel entry issues, glitches and a lack of optimization that makes you question if IMC just wanted to push this out to make as much money as they can before it dies out.\n\nI've also written a more detailed review and overview which you can visit by heading to the website below:\nhttp://freetoplayreview.com/tree-of-savior-review","April 21","false","154.1"," 57 of 107 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","57","107","0","1"

Soundtrack is great.  the class system is wildly varied and would be a blast to play around with... you know, if the game was actually functioning the way a customer should expect a game to work.\n\nThe server lag may eventually lessen as players leave, but poor developer decisions may continue beyond that to keep this game from being fun even then.

If you want to play with your friends, forget about it. Unless you co-ordinate with them on what time to play and quests to do its going to be impossible to play with your friends. Someone is going to eventually overlevel and out quest the others while they're offline and once theyre back on again it's going to be 'Hi, I'm lv 100 now...try & catch up to me...cya in the next  7 months".\n\n2. As others have said this is a mandatory linear quest system so following the above example if you plan on playing with your friends...you're going to have to be doing the EXACT same quests EVERYTIME. Boring. They could have made it an open world like RO with CHOICES to do side quests or story quests for those who are interested in the lores.\n\n3. Party system: most people have their party set as private and unless they can understand you they probably wont invite you. Of course dungeon parties are different but good luck getting into/finding a field one if youre shy.\n\n4. THE MARKET SYSTEM is atrocious especially the UI. If someone brought an item of you, you'd have to wait at least 24 (or was it 48) hours to retrieve your silvers. So you'd better have those spare silvers left for pots.\nThe trading system is also non-freebie-friendly.

I don't hate it, but I have, already in fact, recommended to a friend to hold off on getting it. I think one day it COULD be really good, but I don't believe there are any defininig qualities of this game that would get me to recommend leaving a different MMO for this one.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-The biggest weakness to me has to be the story. It is translated fairly well, but even still it's very flat and bland, and unexciting. I'm almost level 50, and I honestly couldn't tell you anything about it....I know you are "The Revelator" or whatever, and you're trying to save everything. That's about where my lore knowledge ends. It was just so dry to me that I stopped caring after about 5 hours in.\n\n-Secondly, as I mentioned above, the game feels very dated. When you come from a game like Elder Scrolls Online that has modern features, this just seems very lacking. You can't trade, crafting is laughable, and there is no other way to progress other than grinding and doing the mindless, monotonous quests. Hell, even Ultima Online handled this whole thing better. ToS makes you feel railroaded, and after 5 hour all of the monsters start looking the same, even the bosses.\n\n-Lastly would be the fact that you can EASILY mess up your character, and most people will tell you it's just better to reroll to fix it. This is ridiculous. They give you NO guidance in-game, guides online are incomplete, and people still have conflicting ideas of what affects what. As a new player, I was terrified to put points into anything, and even after reading countless topics, I am still not sure if my guy will be useless later on. This is 2016, and I'm an adult with a life. I really don't want to put 50 hours into my guy just to find out I need to start over.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n-The graphics are really pretty.\n\n-The community is friendlier than most MMOs\n","April 7","false","22.4"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"

What got my interest in this game was the art style and the liberty of the class system. It had potencial.

I agree with the majority of negative things people are saying in the reviews: The interation with other playes is scarce, the class system isnt well developed, its very linear, the story seems really nice at first but it doesnt progress in a interesting way... The game tries to fool you but you can quickly see its flaws. I know this is free to play and all, but Eden Eternal did a much better job with a cute style, a wide class system, etc, wich is a game that I played a lot and loved it.

The largest problem of the game is trading restrictions: free players can not trade at all and premium players are limited to 30 trades per month, furthermore once an item that isn't equipment is traded, it becomes untradable, which kills the game for merchants. The auction system isn't any better − free players are limited to one auction slot, while premium players have 5, which isn't nearly enough to sustain a healthy economy. Furthermore, there is a 48 hour delay before silver can be withdrawn from the auction house, which makes a lot of players not want to bother with it altogether.\nThe only ones who don't deem to suffer from all of these restrictions are bots and gold sellers, for whom it is a dream come true, considering all the extra clients they're getting because players aren't able to earn silver fairly. IMC has promised to soften the restrictins, yet have done nothing of the sort for two updates. And now to make things worse Steam regional pricing has been removed without warning, making the already expensive premium currency unaffordable for the majority of players. This just continues to show that IMC don't care about their players and are only trying to grab some fast cash.","April 19","false","409.8"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","34","63","0","0"

I play MMOs cuz I love socializing and meeting new people. I can do that twice per day, per character then it's back to solo grinding quests in the field :P\n\nI really wanted to love this game and I tried... 76 hours and all of those hours were playing the game, not idle or AFK. It was fun, really. But the restrictions everywhere just wore me down and tired me out. I couldn't do it anymore.\n\nI feel like the people who will really enjoy this game (After they fix the lag... don't even get me started there LOL), are people whose playstyles match with the way the dev restrictions sorta... I dunno how to put it? The devs seem to want you to play their game exactly how they think you should play it? That's kinda how I felt while playing it. I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that, I had to wait for this.\n\nIn the end, it just didn't work out for me. Maybe it will work out for you? I'm not going to recommend it because I do feel an MMORPG should have a lot more player freedom to play than this game offers and "Bots and RMT" should never, ever drastically compromise player experience. Inconvenience? Sure, compromise? Nope! So that's it, give it a try and see if it works for you but it certainly is more of a 'niche thing as a result of all of this.\n\nEdit - I have decided to uninstall after browsing the forums for awhile. People seem to white knight and justify horrible game design decisions and the game company is just going to be lead around in a circle until they get dizzy and pass out. There are just so many problems with this game, so many little tiny issues that just eat at you every step of the way and while a lot of players are trying to fight for change, the white knighting is out of control. I feel like IMC will not be able to make the right decisions and the game will ultimately continue to die.","May 24","false","154.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Trying to stop the gold selling the developers turn off the option of golf trade player-player ( meanwhile the gold sellers are using high price items to do the same thing or just buying a item for a high value in the market). So the gold sellers are still using bots, spamming the chats and selling silver while normal players are restrict. btw if you don't have premium account you can't even acess the public stash, so you'll have trouble to transfer that great staff to your wizard.\n\nMonsters: there are so little of them, sometimes there are only 5-10 in the whole map. A single party can easily clean most of the maps and them you have to sit and wait for the long respawns. Some monsters can be erased from all the channels by a single player crossing the channels for rare monsters.\n\nSupport: my ticket already have a week, so I really pray to never have any serious problem.\n\nThe game is good, you can have fun. But you will have trouble with the market/trades and you won't have a good time while trying to farm for mons. It's a grind game that you can't grind because of the lack of monsters. They are also really trying to throw the players in certain servers.

( with MMO lagging capability).\nYou can probably grind to LV up but it will be tedious and boring. The fastest way to LV up in this game is to quest.\n\nLet's get to the detail.\n- Level design is BEAUTIFUL BUT BAD ,especially in the begining where it require players to run around the map to the same place over and over and over again. It get better 90 LV later and might troll us to do it again every few quests.\nMy suggestion is - choose to start from Orsha than Klaipeda - better level design better rewards, less running in circle.\n\n- Class Advancement looks very interesting that we have 50-80 classes to play but it is actually hard, confusing and there is no going back once player choose one( as of this patch). Once you mess up the only correction is to reset and play again.\n... it feel good once you get it right finally...\n\n- Skill cooldown is an ABOMINATION !! TOS will not let you spam skills like in RO instead even less powerful skill will require players to wait for 30 seconds to do 200% damage burst ... did I mention you only have 1-2 attack skills per class advancement?\n\n- Status distribution is BORING !! The game is designed to have max LV around 500. Each status point we distribute early game is very insignificant. it feel really weak to have 50-100 status points in damage stats such as STR or INT a few PVP builds  tends to go fully HP oriented since skill damage doesn't scale much with the stats.\n\n- Server lag will be fixed. Once it is this will be one of the game most people can enjoy.\n\n- MUSIC IS GORGEOUS !!!\n\n- GRAPHIC IS BEAUTIFUL !!! AND UNIQUE !!!\n\n- While the game itself is not really optimised ... I play it at 60 FPS the it drop to 15-25 every now and then. Everytime I walk pass people and open a god damn map... or buff people ... or do AOE kills... I kinda don't mind it much. I heard a few people does.\n\n- IMC garunteed there will be 200 bosses  to fight over ... they are all camped by high LV people and monopolised the market.\n\n- You cannot trade money - I think they try to stop Chinese gold scammer but they still use Marketplace to do it. In the end this affect the in-game economy a lot.\n\n- Trading only allow for VIP people, still no money trading... even VIP have limited number of times they can trade.\nSo I don't trade... much.\n\n- TREE OF BUGs !!! bugs are every where. Seems like this tree attract more bugs than Bugframe or Bugscroll online.\n\n- Game designer decide to help solo player ... with x6 experience with dungeon finder but give no bonus to normal party ... talk about double standards.\n\n- Why am I still recommending this.... I'm drunk I guess. forget it play the game. see for yourself.","May 19","true","374.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

(3 upgrades with bad options, taming not ingame, farming only 1 out of 6 possible seeds were available and +1 member cap per guild level)\n\ni was quite demoralized after i realized how much the guild system was lacking, i ended up making a new character in the hopes of having more fun. but in the end i never really got the feeling of "fun" my only goal in the game was getting the guild. now don't get me wrong i would most likely have played allot more if the guild had a good system but that didnt seem to be the case.\n\nbut it wasn't just the guild system that was bad.\nthe dungeons in this game were tedious, no real inovation in them. playing as a tank it felt like i was just taking the hits hoping i would not die. the mobs just didnt die quick enough. hell tbh the mobs were stronger than the bosses in most dungeons. and tbh that was the sad part about most of the dungeons. i never felt like any of the dungeons were fun.\ncomparing it to aura kingdom(AK) or ff14 dungeons all mobs, bosses and area's were bad.\nin AK and FF14 it felt like you were tanking. in this game? well lets just say it didnt feel like any of that.\n\nwhen i started that new character i quickly came to the realisation that the only way to play the game anymore since launch was to ks ks and ks. hoping to get the exp while people run amok. it wasnt fun to play. even knowing were to go didnt speed things up.\n\nfinally at launch i expected them to finally add propper things to the TP shop, well lo and behold. they added nothing.\nin the i think 2 months i was playing this game they added 1 set of costumes that were all PINK. yes i'd love to see my warrior in pink. i really do. (sarcasm)\nthe fact that after choosing a class i wasnt able to change it ever forces you to go with other characters for other builds.\n\nthe chat system was so tedious that half the time whisper chat didnt work. matter a fact everything in this game was just a shell of what it could have been.\n\ni must say after a total of 420+ hours of playing this game. i never really felt great playing it.\ni hoped for the game to get more fun when i finally had a guild to play it with. but even that was just an illusion of my imagination.\n\nanyway, with this last review of the game i leave the game behind me.\n\nthank you for reading and maybe in the future this game might be worth looking at again.\n\nfor now,\nthis was Rogue_Wolf\naka Fancore\n\nSigning off\n","May 14","false","422.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But your item takes 30 minutes to 2 hours to show up...\nYou have to pay WHEN you store item in your bank, and WHEN you withdraw items from it (it's not much money, but still...).\nYou got to buy your teleport scrolls (which is normal), and then you got to pay to USE them...\n\nThe servers are not up to the task, it keeps lagging, it didn't even actually have been released (only founders can play it for now, and I don't think it's a big part of the upcoming population).\n\nThe most of my time playing this game, I was waiting for it to load... When I got my class level 15 as a magician I had the possibility to "evolve", and I decided to become a pyroman. So I had to teleport to a house (LOADING), take the quest, get out of the house (LOADING), get in another house (LOADING) and kill two monsters, teleport back to the first house (LOADING) to finish the quest, and then get out of the house (LOADING) to teleport at the sanctuary (LOADING) and finally get in action (but I wasn't able to teleport to the right level of the dungeon and had to walk deeper which means MORE LOADING).\n\nAnd it's not even like the loadings are fast, no, they often took more than 1 minute to complete (I don't have the best computer, but I was expecting this game to have a well optimization given the look of it).\n\nThere is so much more to say... Freezes, game crashing without any reason...\n\nSo, I would rate this game 4/10 at most. I really wouldn't recommend you buying it.

I won't list all the flaws and perks because you can find those mentioned everywhere, but I will instead list what I personally consider to be the main flaws of the game, the features that are making me turn away from this otherwise decent game.\nMy apologies for the lenght, but I can't express myself in a more concise way.\n\nA multiplayer game that encourages you to be antisocial.\nDungeons provide more experience if you join the queue solo, and belive me when I say you NEED experience badly, you won't pass on the opportunity, therefore you will feel discouraged to group up with your friends to do them.\nNo chance to create chat channels in game and it takes an almost-max level character to create a guild (if you want the guild chat), if you want some sort of interaction you ought to join one of the many discord channels the community is providing.\nThe limited number of transactions discourages you from trading items with your friends, potions to heal them, or equipment so they can try yours, or even just random loot to complete the daily quests (go out and collect xxy item).\nDamage delaers are encouraged to killsteal as much as possible, not just because they are selfish, but in many cases the very slow respawn rate on enemies, encourages players to play as "every man for himself". Supports get the short end of the stick.\n\n\n\nA grinding game without places where to grind.\nAfter a certain point, roughly level 210, your main source of experience will not be quests (like it will have been until that point) but grind. With grind players usually refer to the endless repetition in killing certain monsters for the experience they reward. Personally I joined this game for this, I was actually disappointed to find quests in there, and I'm sure many of you are interested in this product for the same reason; yet, when you finally get to the point where you can grind, there are not enough maps/channels. At around 220 the maps where the xp/hour is above a certain level are just 1 for each level range, with this I mean that you will live on one particular map from level 210-235, then you move to another map.\nYou don't get to chose which map you want to grind on, your level dictates that. This would be almost acceptable if at least the respawns would be high enough to keep up. Intead, what you will experience is groups of 5 men running through an area, clearing everything worth killing and then changing channel, repeat this for all channels on a map and then back to channel 1; if more than 1 group are doing it (this is always the case, think about it, if one map hosts players from 210 to 230, there will always be plenty of them) then it is about doing the same I listed above while also kill stealing the other groups.\nNote that I say there is just one map at any given level, not because everyone is a min/maxer and they won't settle for mediocre experience, but beacuse only certain maps have monsters worth killing for xp. To give you some numbers, if at a certain level killing random easy monsters would net you around 300k exeprience per hour, grinding in the right maps and killing the right targets would give up around 6kk/hour. These numbers fluctuate with the level of course but you get gist of it.\nAlso a personal note: grinding seems to be an afterthough, when they realized that quests were not giving enough experience to make it to the cap, they decided to buff certain mosnters on certain maps to reward a lot more xp, have a lot more HP and deal a lot more damage (this also forces grouping, which is a good thing IMHO, even though many do complain about it), but this point is jsut my personal take on it, I might very well be wrong.\n\nAll in all this is a decent game where the developer, not for greed or malice, ended up making very poor choices in how they implemented most of its features. If you like socialization, healthy multiplayer behavior, you will have a hard time here.","May 8","false","301.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Even though it is a really good game overall, it is not complete, and the company will not reply to you about any problem you face."\n\nIt is a great game. Honestly, it is. Tree of Savior has surprised me with an awesome class system and some adventure I haven't seen in ages. Nice and fair Dungeon system (with bugs, but it is understandable for a game that has only been out for little over a month), Parties/Groups, and Questing. The storyline so far is also surprisingly good.\n\n...BUT...\n\nUnfortunately, the company behind Tree of Savior has been leaving a lot to be desired. I understand every game has bugs, but some of them are little to not understandable at all. We have a whole game server, which was recently created, with players migrating their accounts from other servers. Those players have been locked out of the game. They can't connect and they can't play. It's been close to a week, and we've had ZERO response from the company except for one "We're looking into it". Some players are looking for alternative methods to connect to the game server, through Proxy servers and whatnot.\n\nWe've also had several issues with the Trading system and Guilds. You'll find several hardships while trying to transfer an item to a friend or another character, and creating a Guild is only possible by a single character class, which is only obtainable very very later in the game. You have to dedicate several days of playing to level up a character you will not use, because it is the only way to create a Guild for you and your friends.","May 9","false","336.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

I'm okay with the features the token gives you aside from the speed boost (as I'm sure PvP zones will be introduced and this will eventually become a P2W feature) since PvP seems based around classes that can escape/teleport/flee to safety, heal up, and come back to the fight.  If you're going to give a speed boost, just make it enabled for PvE zones only so that it's just a way to level a character faster, not a feature that becomes necessary to win in PvP.\n\nOtherwise, I can't recommend this game enough.  The gameplay is super fun and addicting and if it weren't for my work and school schedule right now, I'd probably have sunk the entire last 2 days into it.  I absolutely love the punishing class system but I agree that skill resets should be locked behind in-game currency (silver) and not behind premium currency, just make the respec extremely expensive so that people think twice about it.  Otherwise, the possibilites seem endless when it comes to customizing your character and plenty of the skills seem viable for PvE and PvP.  It forced me to do some research before playing the game so I had an idea of where I was going to put my skill points and attribute points.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nEDIT: Charge full price for the game, don't make it F2P.  The model you're following is not working right now.  This game feels too empty and single player to be called an MMO.  Where are the /clap /cheer /whatever kind of emotes that are typical of WoW, FF14, or any other MMO?  Why is the market place such a mess?  Why doesn't Round Robin work?  I hear there are guilds in this game; I've yet to see one.\n\nPlease enable trading for free; that's the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard of.  An MMO where you can't trade items.  What?\n\nI would be happy to pay $15/month like WoW or FF14 if the content was good enough to merit it.  Think of it from a monetary standpoint; FF14, with a free 30 days, for $20, has about 400-500 hours of content in the base game.  Just think about that for a second...  Vanilla WoW, when it first came out, had enough content to keep people busy for months for the base $60 game.  This game has enough content for people that are obsessed with grinding and love alts, but I feel that people who want a regular MMO experience will be wholly turned off by the direction and limitations of this game.","March 31","true","137.6"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","31","58","0","2"

They devised a system of reporting, which reduced the number of bots to maybe... half? But half of a lot is still a lot.\n\nThen the software glitches started happening. People simply could not play the game anymore. Multiple rounds of downtime to fix it, and it hasn't been resolved for a significant number of players.\n\nAdding to the  mismanagement in general was the lag that came about from allowing server transfers. More people transferred to specific servers than could be safely managed and now we've all got insane amounts of lag. Dungeons take an hour to pop, if you're lucky, despite the fact that you're matched with a party and good to go within a minute of queuing.

I'm an avid gamer for over 20 years running and this is easily the most horribly, poorly thought out release I've ever had the misfortune of participating in.

This shows that the Developer (or atleast the original Developers a.k.a Koreans) had a vast access to manpower and tools in order to generate all of these beautifully composed musics. They're an essential if you were to indulge yourself fully into each of the gameplay.\n\nNow, the art part. Majestic, beautiful and gives a nostalgic vibe for veteran MMORPG players who missed the Ragnarok days. The sheer pixel of each everything, varying from backgrounds to mobs' heads, you won't find anything that does not fit anywhere, other than also allowing you to appreciate how detailed the surrounding really are.\n\nBut that's where all the kisses and praises ends.\n\nAs far as I have went into the gameplay itself, I could say of one thing. Their server runs on potato. There are major lags hopping on you everywhere, you can't hide from them. You'd get disconnected at times for no reason, failing to enter your specific server etc. etc. This drastically affect the whole gameplay itself since it interrupts your playing experience.\n\nNow, this is one thing that I hate the most. Token users. Seriously? I mean, if it's extra exp buff, movement speeds and things as such, I'd probably find myself unfazed and let it slip past by. But to be a token user so that you can trade between players (OH and not to mention the 30 times limit and the fact that you can only trade between Token users?) Come on, what in the heck is MMORPG when you can't trade between players?\n\nThe commission for using the Market is also neck-choking. 30% of your sale price is a pretty big bite out of nowhere, just to end up turning into useless codes. Again, this may be decreased to half if you were a Token user, thus leading me to believe it's there just to be another 'fish-bob' for players to buy Tokens.\n\nThere are more flaws than I could handle to mention, but as the Developers are actively doing their best to fix the game to be a better day for everyone, I can't help but to give them another chance. Thumbs up for them, and hopefully, for the better future of the game. I'd hate to let go of this game, not when it reminds me so much of Ragnarok.\n\nI will edit this review as time passes by, so do your best Developers, don't fail our hopes and hypes.\n\n23/4/2016 EDIT:-\n\nSeriously Developers? Raising the price of the Early Access Packages, other than also getting the 3rd one out of the shelves? After looking at the prices of these DLCs, they're like 3x times the previous price! Trying to cover it all up with a 50% sale? What a disgrace, I'm utterly disappointed. If this is an attempt to stop bot from spreading, then I rather say this is an attempt to get more money from Early Access Users.\n\nOH AND LOOK AT THAT, PUSHING THE F2P RELEASE DATE? Lame, Developers. Lame. You may say that this is to provide more time for bug fixing and calibrating, but what I see here is yet another attempt to squeeze more money from future DLC buyers.\n\nBut guess what? With all these 'good' reviews exploding, your future seem bleak, my friends. It was such a great game, but sadly, it fell into the hands of stupid devils.\n\nHate\n-  Raikuri","April 5","false","27.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

The game upgrading is so centered in doing unrepeatable quests, added to the high level restrictions, that playing with the same people became a frustrating battle of perfectly syncronizing your game progress with them.\n\nThe last time I played I was level 121 while my friends played half a day more and were ~127 and this little level discrepancy was enough for me to feel bad to ask them to lose their time to go back to where I was.

Don’t even bother buying XP tombs or dungeon resets in the cash shop, you will just end up getting them for free because of how much IMC screws up! Oh and if you enjoy only being able to run 2 dungeons with no premium token or 3 with a premium token have fun randomly getting this error called commander load fail and yes, it counts as one of your dungeon runs for the day and IMC doesn’t care about your time at all. IMC is so proud of their ant size list of banned bots, gold sellers and BR exploiters in game yet it seems like they didn't even scratch the surface.\n\nHeres some fun little stories of playing Tree of Fish Heads, first off they loveee to give a short amount of time notice for anything! So the first time this 24 hour maintenance bs pops up it was a whole 1 hour notice before the game was going to be taken offline, and for icing no the cake they did nothing! Nothing at all during the 24 hours that the game was down!\nTHEN surprise surprise surprise yet another 24 hour maintenance and this time with zero compensation! it took them 48 hours to give out the compensation! But don’t forget when the non american servers got their 24 hour maintenance, ours went down yet again! It took IMC 3 hours to notice this and just popped our server back on like nothing happened! Where’s the compensation for that IMC! Do you think we’re stupid?\n\nLast fun little side note, the Market (Auction House) is horrible! You can’t trade silver to anyone or ever your other characters, so you have to trade random items for other items of value. And I guess TALT is the new currency in the game because that's all you can use to buy stuff from people in a trade! Then when an item sells in the market you have to wait 48 hours or more to collect your silver! Yes I said FORTYEIGHT HOURS for your silver to be available to you from your sold item AND with no token you automatically lose 30% of the silver! And you can only list one item at a time if you don’t have a premium token!

This will probably change your minds.\n\nThis is Darkon's post from the official TOS forums.\n\nUPDATED Hair Accessory Enchantment Odds and Prices\n\ntl;dr: Cost to enchant a Hair Accessory with the exact 3 stats of your choice? $9,709.20 USD per Hair Accessory. Do you want specifically HP, SP, and Crit Damage all at perfect rolls? $5,126,457.60 USD per Hair Accessory. If you only care about getting AOE Ratio, regardless of any other stat on the item, it is only about $13.68. If you only care about a perfect PATK, and don't mind anything else, it would be $327.60 USD.\n\nEdit: Post is for educational purposes only. I can't really take one side or the other anymore because the existence of the item may open pandora's box, or it may end here in its current form. I don't know. Hopefully this helps in your decision about how you feel about Magic Scrolls and the possibility of other RNG benefits IMC may introduce. All RNG formulated with an assumed (until proven otherwise) equal weighting. nizidr helped me realize there are multiple attribute types dealing with elemental damage, and possibly defense, that can stack on the same item. All odds updated from base 1:19 stats to 1:31 (1-17 stats remain the same, 18 Attribute Defense updated to 18-Holy 19-Dark 20-Fire 21-Lightning 22-Earth 23-Ice 24-Poison, 25 Attribute attack split into 25-Holy 26-Dark 27-Fire 28-Lightning 29-Earth 30-Ice 31-Poison) due to previous stats allowing multiple rolls from the same pool of options for those stats only. Appending the 1:19 values at the end for reference.\n\nFirstly, as per IMC, 100TP = approx $9.00. From that we can discern that 1 TP = approx 9 cents and 8 TP (cost of Magic Scroll) = approx 72 cents.\n\nSo.. want to see the odds of getting the perfect 3 stats on your hair accessory using the Magic Scroll that IMC talked about?\n\nIn KToS there are 19 possible stats. Yes, this could change, but since they have confirmed the scroll coming to IToS we'll just have to use these numbers from KToS for now.\n\n19 total stats to choose from and each scroll use has a chance to enchant either 1 stat, 2 stats, or 3 stats. However stat 18 and 19 have 7 sub-rolls each to account for Elemental Attack and Elemental Defense to a specific element. It also appears that while multiple elements can be rolled on to the same piece that no piece displayed thus far has two of the same elemental properties (i.e. a hat may have +Fire Attack, +Ice Attack, +Holy Attack, but not +Fire Attack, +Fire Attack, +Fire Attack) so this is incorporated into the equations at 1:31.\n\nTo get our wanted 3 stat types we'd take 31*30*29=26970, but, that is for sequential odds, and our stat order doesn't matter (HP,SP,CRIT is the same as CRIT, HP, SP for instance). If we give each of the three stats a number we'll see there are 6 combinations:\n\n123\n132\n213\n231\n312\n321\n\nSo we're taking 26970/6 to give us 1:4495, but since we can either roll a single stat, 2 stats, or 3 stats we multiply 4495 by 3 to get the final odds of achieving our ideal 3 stat types on our item at 1:13485.\n\nFor our costs we will simulate a faux 100% chance by saying if you rolled it that many times you will have been guaranteed the roll you want (even if we know this is not the case and you could re-roll hundreds of millions of times and still not get lucky).\n\nSo for a 1:13485 chance, just to get your 3 stat types, not including if the stat values are even high, you're looking at approximately $9,709.20 USD For one piece. $29,127.60 USD for all three pieces.\n\nGoing forward...\n\nMost stats have a variance in what their values can be. For instance, PATK has a range between 21 and 45. 45-21=24, so there are a total of 24 different possibilities for the PATK stat to be. In this example, we'll say you don't even care what value the other two stats are and all that matters to you is having those stats plus a perfect PATK roll.\n\n1:13485 for the 3 stats you want, but we're going to multiply that by 24 since 1:13485 is just the odds of getting all three stats at any random value. So to get a perf PATK and any value for the 2 other stats you want it is 1:323640.\n\nOr, in translation, that roll is worth $233,020.80 USD in the cost of Magic Scrolls.\n\nNow, a step further. What if you didn't care about the other stats at all and only want a perfect PATK value? This accounts for any random stats that accompany your wanted perfect stat of PATK, but also accepts the possibility you may not have any other stats on the item at all. To get this we first accept that the odds of getting PATK on a single stat roll are 1:31, but the odds for getting it on a double stat item are twice as good at 1:31/2 because there are now two possible stats on the item either of which that could be our PATK, and 1:31/3 for a triple stat item. PATK has a variance of 24 so we are looking at (1:31*24 + 1:31*24/2 + 1:31*24/3)/3 or (1:744 + 1:372 + 1:248)/3 which gives us 1:455, or $327.60 USD. Sounds more reasonable, possibly scarily so.\n\nAnd if you only want, say, AOE Ratio? Well, that stat has no variance, and is locked at 1, so you are very likely to get it on your item with (1:31*1 + 1:31*1/2 + 1:31*1/3)/3 giving us roughly 1:19 or approximately $13.68 USD. The chances of getting a really good stat like AOE Ratio, that is always by default locked at its perfect value, is very high.\n\nHowever, as per the example I listed in the other thread, let's say I want HP, SP, and Crit Damage, since these three stats have the highest possible variances. What are the odds of rolling perfect stats on all 3 of those on a single piece?\n\nHP: 383 to 803, 420 possible values\nSP: 76 to 150, 74 possible values\nCrit Damage: 32 to 66, 34 possible values\n\nGetting all 3 of those stat types is 1:13485, getting all 3 stat types with perfect HP is 1:5663700, with SP would be 1:997890, with Crit Damage 1:458490.. add those 3 since each is already its own perfect roll, so...\n\n1:7,120,080...\n\nThat's roughly half chance of winning the lottery.\n\nYou're more than 7 times as likely to be struck by lightning this year at 1:960,000.\n\nNeat.\n\nThe cost of that perfect enchant? $5,126,457.60. Yep, that's over 5 million dollars in case you didn't know IMC, just a heads up lol\n\nAnd since we have 3 pieces we need to enchant.. better make sure they are all perfect yeah? I mean it will only cost you $15,379,372.80 USD.\n\n(Clarification edit: Please note the above figures are only for HP + SP + Crit Damage, as an example, because these three stats have the highest pool of potential values. This means this is the most difficult set of perfect stats to obtain. If you want, for example, a perfect PATK + a specific perfect Element attack + AOE Ratio, the odds would be 1:579,855 or $417,495.60 USD. Not that either cost is something we can realistically afford but it is important to note that the odds of getting your perfect 3 stat combination, all with perfect rolls, is highly dependent on the number of possible values that each stat can inherently have. The more values it can have the harder, and more expensive, it will be to get the best one.)\n\nDo you think its still pay to win?

It's Ragnarok all over again, in many ways: art style, combat system, classes. But that's about it. Everything else sums up to a frustrating experience no matter what you choose to do. I really wish I could play this for months, but I probably won't. And here is why:\n\n- Sluggish combat due to general poor optimization and connection issues: you press a key for an action and it takes a whole second for me to see it taking place. It's impossible to kite and mob correctly because what you see in your screen isn't what is really happening on the server side. I often cast my AOE spells on a bunch of monsters but many of them doesn't get hit (same goes for enemies sometimes outside of the AoE getting hit). How can you have fun playing a game so unreliable? I can't even imagine how it feels to play in group, but I'm assuming it's a complete mess.\n\n- Terrible performance: even my godly PC rig won't benefit at all from this game. A GTX 980 Ti, SSD and tons of RAM won't be abble to run this game smootly. I get heavy slowdowns in town and even in far away maps the fps is far from constant, even though its a little better. And the load times, my god, they're the longest I've even seen. It's like loading GTA city in every screen change.\n\n- The free to play philosophy is dumb. It goes straight against of what RPG essentially means. This is well known in MMO world so I won't dive much into it. But f2p is here in it's classic state. You pay for everything you do in game (in some cases - like equipment and passive skill leveling - you pay a LOT), and of course you won't be abble to keep progression after you reach a certain point, so you'll either buy in game currency with real money or grind your ♥♥♥ to death. Even if you don't care for cosmetics, you'll end up spending much, much more then 60  bucks you would pay for a regular game. The worst part of it is that when you pay, it feels like cheating. Before I waste any dollar on this game I'll just let it be.\n\nSomething went very wrong with the development team at IMC. It's so many core problems I can't even try to figure where they went wrong the most. The game has potential. Even though I can't forgive their nasty fp2 philosophy, the technical problems could, theoretically, be fixed. It's just that it feels like there's a long way to go.","May 17","false","220.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In quotes because they had a Lot of time to test the servers and bugs and everything in the paid period and also when the game was launched in korea in middle of december 2015. So they had a few 6 months before launch.\n\nStill the game has some ridiculous bugs, i will name a few (quests that cannot be finished, npcs that dissapears, map bugs with quests and npcs, awful video , audio and ui configuration, and more.) Some of this bugs are caused by the poorest optmization i`ve seen in a while.\n\nThe game is Beautiful, incredible art style, cool combat. BUT there is one aspect that makes it almost unplayable.\nTHE SERVERS ARE A PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥. sorry for the caps. But they are, disconnections,  laggy, desync, framerate drops (a LOT), even if you have just one or two other players around, the lag gets Real.\n\nI will (hopefully) come back again and rewrite this review as a positive one, because i really want to like this game.\n\nCheers.\n\nEDITED *20/05/16\n\nSeems like many of the bugs in the game occur due to poor servers all around the world, the SA server is still down until this day, no word from developers yet, the community is unexisting, most likely the game will die out very, very soon.\nShameful display!!! *as a classic announcer would say.","May 11","false","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are stamina system to prevent character to run too much, but tree root crystal solved it partly, this will somehow affect combat too so I think managing stamina would be fun.\nClasses system are the most interesting thing I like in this game, since you can ended up in a higher class but your middle classes will be different, etc, For example 2 people might ended up being Fencer, but 1 maybe offensive Fencer while the other is more defensive. The drawbacks however is: the game still have some serious lag, bugs and glitches which will heavily affect the game experience.\n+ "Typical Lazy MMORPG guy" view: This game is stupid, why have stamina system? Why hide the NPCs and Quests? Why Monster are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ strong, etc.\n\nSo for me this game is definitely worth trying. I have played for a week now and I'm quite enjoy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grayvisions/recommended/372000/","grayvisions","Gray","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grayvisions/","100 products in account","Can't in good conscience recommend this game. Not even minding the features of the game, it's incredibly laggy, prone to disconnects, huge delays between using an ability and it actually firing, and ZERO means of fighting bots absolutely plaguing every single map to the point of making it impossible to level unless you are a heavy duty DPS/AoE class.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's incredibly niche and way before its time. There is no forgiveness in class/skill/stat choices, with skill and stat resets being restricted to item mall features but even then, no way to reset your class. Several classes are supposedly getting an overhaul because they are that useless, except no notice of when that will happen and what will happen to players that have already leveled those classes, such as Pardoner and Oracle who have almost no attack skills; seriously, whose idea was this? Leveling is slow and grindy which means you can spend months getting to 200+ only to realize that your skill and stat choices have ruined your ability to keep progressing, so now you have to delete the character and restart. Months of progress, down the drain. There's so many classes, so many skills, it's unfathomable to offer that much choice ~without~ educating players at all (as there is no in-game information on classes, their future skills, tutorials, nothing except a sentence or two blurb when you actually choose your class) as to the future of those choices.\n\nFinally, the game lacks any of the player-friendly features that have helped modern MMOs soar. There's no protection from kill-stealing, many classes can't solo on their own, credit for kills goes to the player/party with the most damage leaving higher-level players trolling lower level areas for easy exp/drops to sell that players of the correct level can't compete with, item drops upon death, EXTREME amounts of grinding for small amounts of progress, and so on. The worst part is the soloing, as the game removes the ability for some classes to solo while giving other classes more than necessary means to do so. What this means is, if you're the kind of person that likes partying in games, DON'T GET EXCITED: Just because some classes can't solo, it doesn't mean party play is enforced, or even encouraged. It's very strange to play a game that hinders solo ability yet doesn't give people a reason to party. It seems many classes are just there to look pretty, but in the end, just play a wizard.","May 14","false","52.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I'm specifically writing this review JUST to rant about how much dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they try and pull since the game's full F2P release.\n\nLocalization is laughable. Now, that may not seem like an issue, until it leads to the game flat out lying to you. "You can change your Team Name later on" Cool, so I can change it if I change my mind, right? Yes, but the part they forgot to mention is that it costs money. And that in and of itself is alright, most games require payments to name change. Hell, I've paid for name changes on WoW at least three times. The problem then comes with that since the actual game's release changed how accessible names are allowed to be. Despite the fact that there's 6 (7?) servers, There can only be ONE COPY of a name across ALL of them. So yeah, have fun trying to pick out a decent name in this mess, especially if you already have one on the wrong server. Guess it's time to pony up and just buy TWO name changes, right? :^)\n\nAway from petty naming grievances, some ability descriptions just aren't accurate either. "Charge at an enemy and--" Let me stop you right there, because "charging" means you run up to it. A lot of stuff that said anything like that just had me attack directly in front of me with no movement whatsoever. And, in a game where you can NEVER change your mind about the job path you take, that's kind of a big deal if you don't get EXACTLY what it tells you and you end up stuck with a half-♥♥♥♥♥ swordsman that can't do half of what you thought you could.\n\nSome people don't care about any of that, though, and that's fine. Because there's MORE issues. My connection seems about as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to Brazil as it does to Europe or even my "local" server. CONSTANT lag spikes for no reason, abilities animating, freezing, and then never actually going off, laggy quest dialogue, laggy quest updates, laggy quest objectives... You get the idea.\n\nOkay, and so maybe some people don't care about having to be named xXs14y3rzx2 and playing with 50-5000 ping depending on the time of day, but even ***THEN*** there's problems still. Major hub cities, even on damn near entirely empty channels, cause severe framerate drops for me and literally every single person I talk to. You get 200 FPS in the field, go to Orsha, and suddenly bam. Nice Titan you have there, enjoy your chugging 5-15 FPS because you had the audacity to look at an NPC.\n\nThe longer I write this review the angrier I get and the more stuff I can think of to complain about. Gold sellers! Literally everywhere, and while there's posts on the forums by the staff themselves calling out accused (and banned) gold-sellers, it doesn't seem to do anything. If you want to report somebody, you have to actually go FIND THEIR CHARACTER because no matter how hard I tried there were no right-click options in the chat to report them. There's no cooldown on chat messages, so you can bet Channel 1 chat is literally nothing but infinite bot spamming.\n\nI'm most angry about this because I was genuinely enjoying myself for the short while I was lying to myself about all of these stupid problems that should've been resolved well before a full F2P release, on Steam of all things. I'll reinstall it and check up on it in like a year or two, and if they've fixed crap then I'll update things and play again. But as it stands now, the game is just a laggy, Brazilian, slow-paced MMO copy of Ys and that's not what I was waiting for since it was announced.\n\n","May 19","false","28.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

It is so ♥♥♥♥ing obvious that this company is equivalent to every OTHER company that licenses a game and tries to milk the ♥♥♥♥ out of the players. It's still in beta and it's disgusting pay to win features is already shoved down your throat. I don't get it, they had the option of attaching a bunch of cosmetics and people would buy that but instead they charge people with "premium token" that literally restrict the most basic functions of the game.\n\nThey literally removed almost every basic feature you can think of in exchange for a premium token that you have to pay with real money. You're not allowed to trade with other players and you walk like a snail and you don't have much space for characterization and don't even think you can more than one buff at a time during a party. Oh and 30% taxation to the ♥♥♥♥ing market. Like oh god why? And the money doesn't even come to you for TWO DAYS. And of course premium players don't suffer any of that and have some other benefits as well. Of course you're going to get those snarky players that say it's playable as long as you have the "knowledge" but cmon, who would want to play through this?\n\nAnd the monsters. ALL THE MONSTERS ARE RECOLORING OF OTHER MONSTERS. I swear I saw only up to 20 monsters in total of my entire 20+ fields and dungeon exploring. Seriously I even looked up some veteran videos of 200+ leveled players fighting the SAME monsters I was fighting in different colors. You got to be ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me... Not that this is part of IMC gaming but the developers part. But seriously. I never seen so much abuse of the recoloring tactics as Tree of Savior. You guys had such a beautiful game going, I don't even feel like there a universe in this game, it feels like a giganitc map of one same thing lol...\n\nAnd gold botters. Everywhere. In megas in EVERY FORESEEABLE CHANNELS IN THE ONLY TWO TOWNS EVER AND IT LAGS THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF YOU. Also the gold botters within the first week of this game is so out of control that it's actually cheaper to buy gold bot's gold, and buy the prenmium coin than actually buying the premium coin. Literally the cost of your lunch is enough to pay for your silvers that last up your entire gameplay. Thats how disgustingly broken the gold botters are. But I guess IMC gaming only method of handling this issue is banning the botters. Which of course anyone who plays mmo knows that it doesnt actually fix the problem at all. So sad.\n\nThe kicker? It doesn't even get better. I've played enough bootsy companies games that I know it won't get better. Because none of these companies care about making their product better, they care about what they can do to milk the cash out of the players as much as possible, because short term profit > long term profit.\n\nSeriously this game had so much potential, but the licenseship of this company ruined everything and the poorly optimized game. I can handle the fact I will only see the ♥♥♥♥ing Pawn and Pawndel every other dungeon in 20 different colors but I can't get over how I am never ever allowed to trade unless I have to pay. Which btw they haven't even set up a cash shop yet.\n\nGood game for it's forseeable flaws. ♥♥♥♥ company that makes you want to rip your eyes out. ♥♥♥♥ IMC gaming, no one has ever heard of you guys and there is a reason for that.","May 19","false","45.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

They put a lvl requirements and now the bots by the time they reached the level they get pretty quickly banned on the SEA server.\n\nFor the token trade. I for one think that this a relative fair way for TOS to make money and it also makes it difficult for gold sellers to sell their gold.\n\nNow the Cons are:\n\n1) Server performance is absolutely terrible , especially on weekends. I shudder to think that when F2P comes out, honestly the servers might go down due to high number of players.\n2) There's no grinding (you can just do quests) but agree that certain quest lines you have to fight with other teams for the mobs and that can be a problem.\n3) Why are they still using TCP/IP for their communications, they should be using UDP.\n4) Tthey honestly should follow Warframe Peer to Peer system for how the game handles instances. This puts the hardware costs on the player side and thus TOS can make even more profit. (Understand of course this is very unlikely as this will require a whole revamp of their systems).\n\nThe pros:\n\n1) Graphics are really nice and looks waterpainted\n2) Music is absolutely beautiful\n3) The combat is action paced, but not as latency tied down as B&S (for most classes).\n4) Community is rather decent when against a world boss (auto res, help to heal , etc....)\n\nWhen the F2P folks come will do a final review of this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boler619/recommended/372000/","boler619","AlexX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boler619/","134 products in account","Hello I have a fletcher lvl 231 and after playing a lot since it became F2P I really start to see the truth of this game, this is all my opinion and things I have had to bear with while playing.\n\nIf you are looking for a MMO that actually lets you be a trader with a free trading system, this is clearly not your game. ONLY if you have a token you can do 1:1 trades with other players, you can buy from the player market for a normal amount of silver which is not too bad. But sadly, most of those sellers are goldsellers and bots (Yes.. There are so many of those and sadly they don't seem to get banned and if they are they will simply create a new account and carry on with the same business) Tokens are a must if don\t have one, you will not paly on the same level as token users because it gives you so many perks.\nYou have delay from 30mins to 2hours once you have registered an item in the market.\nSILVER can't be traded and instead IMC had 'the great idea' of making an item called talt which is used as if it was silver, as of right now, talts are worth around 6k silver which means that you will need an insane amount of talts to be able to pay for a weapon that is worth lets say 4millions. All of this is mainly focused on trying to avoid goldsellers and whatnot, but it is a tragic decision on IMC's hands, after all they're showing that they're that vulnerable to goldsellers that their game was modified by them.\n\nMaps in this game are almost as simple as the quest but they are somewhat nicely done when it comes to colours and artstyle but extremely simple and straight forward, dont worry you wont get lost.\n\nLet's move on the quests, the main quest storyline is not great but not bad either but seriously if you want to quest this is not your game either, I'd go play The Elder Scrolls Online which has way better quests. The side quests are ridiculous.. I've tried every MMO in the last years and I have not found any game so badly done when it comes to quests diversity, all this game does is to make you do quests that you either have to kill a rather easy mini-boss or you have to protect an area/someone. It is horribly repetitive after a while. Some quests are bugged and unable to be done since closed beta but there are also some cool hidden quests. Also, the XP card system is nice and refreshing but makes the game slightly easy by the first levels.\n\nThe game is too confusing, no matter who you ask they most likely will not be able to give you a clear answer even if they have been playing since closed beta. When it comes to claases and specially stats, the game is really messed up and confusing, no one really knows anything and if they know then you'll ask someone else and will tell you something different, there is not a clear pattern on what to follow even top rater builds end up being really bad at the end. This all leads me to speak about the stat system, plain and simple which is good but with a really and huge problem, if you misclick or mess up slightly with your stats you can say goodbye to that character, meaning you won't be able to reset your spent points by all means.\n\nDungeons ar enothing special either, when you get lucky you will have a cleric in the team if not prepare to die so many times that your entire gear will be red and broken, amtchmaking is not too bad but sometimes ti will get bugged and if you dont cancel it you will be stuck into it forever and I mean forever.\n\nI almost forgot to talk about another huge issue that this game has, lag is a major issue. If you want to keep a steady pace while questing I'm afraid it will not be possible due to the NPC lag, basically you'll have to stand next to it after clicking on it furiously for atleast 1 second and maintenances have not fixed this whatsoever. Also to mention that if you use a skill that consumes an item, let's say you consume and skill that consumes an arrow well, then.. You're most likely dead if they mobs are around your level or if your character is a glass cannon this being simply because you will be frozen on place after using that skill, I'm not sure if this is a lag related issue or something to do with the coding but this is really annoying and will most likely get you killed while playing.\n\n\n\nI won't talk about the community because in a MMO with many players on it you'll run into every kind of person.\n\nBut overall, I expected something better but I ran into a repetitive game that feels that has been done in order to make goldsellers' life hard and which has failed poorly.","May 31","false","246.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Hopefully the prices will be reasonable in iOBT.\nExtremely linear quest progression. You literally just go from one area to the next within 5-10 levels of you to complete all of the quests there. Then, you proceed onto the next and almost never go back to the former map unless it has good mobs to grind on.\nI've played this game 407 hours of this game just from iCBT2 alone. I can't wait to invest many more hours in this game during iOBT exclusive access to test out tons of builds I've come up with. I've even written a few guides on some. If you liked Ragnarok, definitely check this game out. It's not P2W (yet and hopefully never) and it's just a ton of fun to just explore the world of ToS. It can get really grindy at some points though but they mostly fixed that by adding even more quests. :D","March 28","true","702.5"," 120 of 234 people (51%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","51","120","234","10","1"

Improved clarity of some parts. Prefaced my F2P experience with my iCBT experience.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really, really really did. I've been waiting for months for it to come out for F2P, I watched Etup grind for hours on his stream, basking in the huge variety of classes (like one class that can plant grass, friggin grassplanter support dude...) and hyping me and some friends up for it for the longest time.\n\nAnd it only took two days before we got completely fed up with the bullsh*t.\n\n\nNow, I didn't get all too frustrated when I was playing iCBT, I was gunning for the Alchemist class (which is probably a mistake, fair warning) but was stuck on Tenet Chapel at around Level 35~40 because I didn't have any leveling guides at the time. I fell into the same "trap" that I will explain later on in this review. There was nothing to tell me that I could have gone to the Orsha side of the map after starting on Klaipeda.\n\nFurther, I was experiencing a HUGE problem with MP consumption. I was nearly bankrupted all the time because of how much I had to spend on MP potions and how I have to chug them constantly. Again, without some sort of leveling guide to tell me that spellcasters who love to spam spells should heavily prioritize SPR over INT (and maybe get some CON for solo survivability but I was doing that anyway).\n\n\nFirst of all, lets look back at the catastrophe that was the Closed Beta. It was a bit of a lagfest then and apparently IMC didn't get the memo that it was time to beef up their servers in anticipation of the huge influx of players that would come on F2P release. They didn't do a damn thing except release a 2nd SEA server. There are STILL too few channels in critical maps and STILL too many channels in spots people will breeze by or not even smirk at.\n\n\nSecond we have how awful it is to party sometimes. All of you are on the same quest, but when one of you turns in that quest and it just so happens to lead into a boss fight immediately with no warning, your friends are pulled into your instance, and upon beating the boss, there's a very good chance that you will have to fight that same boss again (and again depending on how many are in your party) so your friends can complete their quests, because I'm sure it's because you didn't coordinate turning in the same quest at the same time and waiting before moving onto the next part. It's still bullsh*t that this is even a thing. Don't force people into boss fights upon accepting a quest.\n\n\nNext we have spawn rates, amount of mobs, and drop rates and how, when these factors are tied with how many people need a certain mob for something. The spawn rates are absolutely abysmal in most areas. The quest mob needed for the Hoplite advancement in Tenet B1? Takes roughly 2 minutes to spawn.\nEveryone knows this. Everyone has complained about this on the forums as far back as Closed Beta. And yet IMC doesn't do anything about it.\n\nThe amount of mobs needed for quests (even critical advancement quests) are too few and sometimes the spawn rates are abysmal to compensate for this issue. The quest mob for the Hoplite advancement? There are only two of them, period.\nEveryone knows this. Everyone has complained about this on the forums about it. IMC doesn't do anything...\n\nThen when you add in a *chance* for a quest item to drop on these mobs that are too few and take too long to spawn, you're adding salt to the wound and giving a big middle finger to the players (especially some Swordsmen advacement quests). The Hoplite advancement? Yep, you guessed it. That mob that takes a long, long time to spawn and are too few and far between... has a *chance* to drop his quest loot.\nEveryone knows this. Everyone has complained about this on the forums about it. And IMC hasn't done a d*mn thing about this.\n\n\nNow lets talk about the one thing that is probably on everyone's mind:\n\nHow bad is the grind?\n\nIt can get bad. Really bad. Back to what I said during my iCBT experiences, about how I didn't have any leveling guide on-hand and thought it was a good idea to pop your Level 3 (and up) EXP Cards instead of saving them to skip past the grind spots, well, if you did that... you're in for the ride of your life, because good luck kid, you're gonna be stuck grinding in a known "horrible grinding spot" that the people who wrote those leveling guides compel you to skip past.\n\nAnd even still, when you hit the higher levels (200+), most of your time will be spent grinding quite a bit per day just to hit one or two levels (and I'm talking 10-15-ish hour sessions).\n\nNow most people won't mind this, it's not like Dungeon Fighter where there's a Stamina system in place, and there's nothing to pressure you into leveling in a certain amount of time, but I would want the leveling and grinding experience to be a little more smoother and a lot less tedious and monotonous. I'm sure if I had played as long as it would take to reach the level 200s~, I would've already made 50 alt characters/accounts to experience all of the different classes and give up on it, because the endgame... well...\n\n\nAll of the experienced and battle-beaten players who have managed to reached endgame knows...\n\nthere is no f*cking endgame except one dungeon and world bosses that are camped endlessly. Let's face it, Etup had already moved on from this game as soon as he hit max level. Some of his friends didn't even bother to reach max level before they stopped playing. They aren't coming back unless IMC comes out with some new content, but God only knows when that will be, they won't even listen to the players to fix the issues everyone is complaining about.\n\n\n\nI only wish IMC took the time to make themselves stand out from all the other F2P games out there in a positive matter, not giving themselves the negative reputation they are giving themselves now. We should have listened to the reviews on the Korean's take on KToS, about how IMC doesn't give two sh*ts about the playerbase and how they are driving their Ragnarok Online successor into the ground.\n\nPlay at your own risk of frustration and bullsh*t, but to me, it was a waste of time.","May 11","false","19.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Just bother and look else where for fun. You'll just find frustration and regret.\n\nReasons:\n\n- Economy is sealed tight. I say this cause you have to wait 2 weeks for your character to be able to put something in the market. Once you can put an item up for sale in the market, and its been bought, you have to wait 2 days to retrieve the silver that you earned by selling that particular item. With all of that, you lose silver and you can't progress through the game cause you can't access to silver that you have but not really. It'll just sit there in the market for two whole ♥♥♥♥ing days.\n\n-Its not a MMO. Sure you can grind on monsters, farm items and be in parties. But its more like a RPG. You have to go through all the bosses and all the stupid stories to progress through and be able to access other areas in the game. You simply just cant travel there.\n\n-You die, you drop all your ♥♥♥♥ing gem stones and who ever finds em keeps em. First and for most i'd like to explain that gem stones are very important ingame. They help your character become stronger. Its really hard to find gem stones and very easy to lose them.\n\n-To actually "Trade" in the game or sell. You have to buy a thing called tokens with real cash. Once you have that you have 30 days to trade with people.\n\nAll in all i despise the game. I thought it would be fun cause of the system and it looks similar to ragnarok online.

Let me explain..\n\nThe game is supposedly open on the 28th of this month/last month, so i downloaded the game so i won't have to deal with downloading it later. Patiently waitted for the opening on the 28th of April, and April 28th came and gone and it's still not open for people to join. Now the 6.0 hrs i got is from loading the game, cause it had this half cut percentage meter below. God knows why its done so poorly but whatever. And i checked if i can get in, but to no avail, you still need to buy the Founder Packs to get in. When it was stated that it was going to be open on the 28th, sure. Whoever from sources they told me it was delayed till next month, now from what i recall and know. I could be wrong or totaly right. They might pull a longer release delay just so people will buy more Founder Packs, and deprive the other people that cant afford a Pack to get in the game. Ive seen a few games pull this before, dangling the carrot on a piece of string to a person chainned and blindfolded. And the carrot at a reach enough for you to touch it with the tip of your tongue, but far enough that you cant eat it till the chains pull you back. If the developers of this game, put another arbitrary delay again. This game is destined to be a Pay 2 Get Inside system, saying "uhhh were suppose to release this week, but were gonna delay it till next week cause reasons.." then delay the release further, cause why not? People will buy Founder Packs to get in the game, lets milk this till dust comes out of the udders of the cows.\n\nOverall the game gets a stunning 2/10 till i can get inside the game itself, i will not retract this review. If you can call it a review at all, waitted hand and foot to get inside to give it a good review. But they can't be arsed to release on time and promise, my review will be half arsed like they are.\n\nPS. They should remove the Release Date notice, and change it to "Pleaze Buy More Founder Packz!!!!" Just fitting, seeing how blatant they are in lying on the Release Date.\n\nUPDATE: So they moved the release date to May 10th, cause their adding servers some says. And or applied something to the game that warrants a push back. Details are skethcy at best, no unified answer to why they really pushed back the release date to 12 days from the original release date. Will dig into this whole deal deeper, to find out the real reason for the push back release date.\n\nApparently hackers is part of the reason, people that refund for the Founders Packs and people thats in Russia and Brazil? Wtf seriously? Anyways, ive read that they were doing vague stuff on the server dev side. https://treeofsavior.com/news/?n=378 direct link to their post on their website, to make things clearer. Will post more after the game releases, maybe not. Cause theres a 50/50 chance that they might delay the game again to the near end of May or next June.

It's not bad per se, but this is probably the fastest I got burned out from playing an MMO. What.. around 1 week?\n\nIt's marketed as a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online, but I really don't feel the resemblance besides being 2.5D and having somewhat similar art.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the game is somewhat poorly optimized and starts lagging considerably at around 10+ players on-screen, dropping to a janky 40 fps for a medium setup like mine. For reference, I can run something like The Witcher 3 on max settings at around the same framerate. For a 2.5D game, this is very concerning.\n\nGameplay-wise, I don't think it even captures the charm that RO had in its time. The overworld there was huge and exploration was fun... plenty of towns and dungeons to explore in no particular order. Here you've got like 2 towns and levelling is as linear as it gets. Go to this map.. level up a bit and do some quests.. now go to this conveniently adjacent map.. level up some more.. rinse and repeat. As for the quests, whereas RO's quests were hidden and scattered like easter eggs with interesting rewards, the quests here are a dime a dozen and either just kill, fetch, or click quests for some amount of XP and disposable gear.\n\nI won't even get into the player trading, auction house, and botting.. a lot of people already have those covered.\n\nWho knows.. maybe it all gets better in the late game.

Sadly, those are just about the game's only good aspects.\n\nSevere gameplay restrictions, regular FPS and server-side lag issues, a growing Bot and Gold Selling problem - these are only some of the negative points in an otherwise not-too-bad-but-sort-of-shallow Korean grindfesty MMORPG.\n\nFrom a development standpoint, gameplay is solid but superficial and sometimes repetitive. There are more than enough classes (and customization thereof) to play around with, but generally they all fill a similar trinity-like role, with the exception of some world-mechanic requirements (Templar for guild creation, Pardoner for purchasable buffs, that sort of thing). The large variation of skills are bright and colourful, but they scale rather poorly into the later stages of this release of the game.\n\nFrom a publisher's point of view (oh boy), IMC leaves much to be desired. Firstly, some of their restrictions plainly don't make sense. I feel like a lot of them are methods or workarounds to handle the already large amounts of Bots and/or Gold Sellers found on servers. This defeats the purpose, though - you are removing the aforementioned in order to improve player experience, by limiting player experience? Restricted dungeon runs, minimum/maximum market sale values, timed withdrawals on your items, severely hampered alternate character slots and storage systems...\n\nAs an example, without the game's "Freemium" 30 day installment, you are limited to 2 (two) dungeon runs per day. In total. Not per dungeon, no - in total! That's ridiculous. Paying what seems to be around $20 for the Token (which can also be purchased with the in-game currency of silver) let's you run that dungeon once more per day. What's worse is that the drop rates of useful items are so very slim, much more so than any other MMORPG I've played before.\n\nLeveling has been painless thus far (I currently have two level 100+ characters) and therefor I am thankful, because the grind is real, ladies and gentlemen. I just haven't hit that part of the game yet, but if the leveling guides/Reddit is to be believed, I better strap myself in for what I can only describe as a boring rotation of skills for hours on end...\n\nThe Reddit community is decent, the in-game community is non-existent. With a very small cap on maximum guild members (25-35), getting into one isn't the easiest of tasks - creation of guilds harder still.\n\nI recommend trying this gorgeous game when it goes Free-to-Play, without spending a cent of your valuable money until you hit at least level 115. Not a moment before should you give IMC a dollar's worth of time - not until they start listening to the community - who have already made more than a few viable suggestions, which, while they may not cure the botting problem, will certainly curb the influx to an extent where the game can be considered playable.\n\nRATED SCORE: [ 5/10 ]\n\nOnce I have a few dozen hours' worth of end-game content, I will re-evaluate my current position. The ball is in IMC's court, after all...","May 5","false","193.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","2"

It takes all of the best qualities of its spiritual predecessor Ragnarok Online (tons of unique classes, gorgeous and charming art style, fantastic sound track) and improves upon them greatly while also introducing a vastly improved action based combat system and countless other fun features.\n\nI have played most of the big name MMO's out there, and many of the lesser knows as well. My limited time playing ToS so far has been far more enjoyable to me than any other MMO I can recall. The gameplay itself is imenseley satisfying, and the number of incredibly unique and awesome class skills available in this game is mind-boggling. The variety in skills goes way beyond anything I've ever seen in an MMO. There are classes that can telekenetically throw monsters into walls, guys that can stick monsters onto the end of a spear (like a fork) and use them to pummel other monsters, a centurion class that can allow for your party members to join "formations" with you (allowing you to take control of them all as a unit), necromancers that use the body parts of defeated monsters to create summons and special attacks, and so much more. It really gives you a lot to strive and look forward to as you progress through the game.\n\nSeriously don't listen to the negative reviews complaining about launch week server issues or lack of dev support. It is by no means any worse than the launch week of any other popular MMO, and if you actually look for it you can see that the devs have been doing a wonderful job at keeping the community up to date with their latest developments (GM's have even been responding directly to countless player questions on the announcement section of the forums, as well as announcing progress and fixes in-game via global messages). They even changed their entire launch schedule within a day based on player feedback (ultimately basing their plans around the results of a player poll). Any issues it does have at the moment will without a doubt be a total non-issue in a couple weeks max, so permanently marring the games score based on a few debatably bad days is ridiculous.","March 31","true","31.1"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

What you see is more or less what you get, and it's not hard to figure things out.\nComprehensive built-in completionist support.\nFairly varied class and playstyle options.\nIndividual players can be very eager to be social and party.\nIt really is F2P, early access aside.  People complaining about certain restricted features ignore the fact that buying access for a month with game cash is relatively cheap to anyone playing regularly.\n\nCons:\nNo PVP.  Future PVP will be unbalanced and have severe level requirements.\nDoes not respect your time in terms of levelling, you will never be able to try very many aspects of the game for yourself.\nFull of half-measures for controlling bots and goldsellers.\nCommunity makes the same cancerous, preteen jokes all day.\nClasses scale harshly- your super-fun playstyle may not work at all at high level if you neglect classes that literally unlock later.\n\nOverall:\nIt's fine.  A pretty standard package.  It really is a streamlined RO, regardless of what some hipsters say.

I've tried a full reinstall of the game, and I've also contacted support not once, not twice, not three times, but four times.\n\nThey have done NOTHING to help. Literally nothing. This is by far the worst support team in any MMORPG I have come across.

My character has been stuck for days, I've been trying to fix the issues on my own, since support seems to not care much. I would not recommend this game to anyone now, until support gets their act together on actually helping people.

It is littered with bugs, server lag, poor design choices and a lack of variety and content past level 120ish.\n\nPros:\n+fantastic art style - this looks very unique compared to it's modern counterparts while at the same time feels familiar to anyone who has played ragnarok online\n+satisfying combat - combat feels fast and fluid and attacks have a very satisfying feel upon use\n\nCons:\n-Server lag/crashes - when you are limited to 2 dungeon runs a day and the exp gained contributes a signficiant part to leveling, it is stupid for the instance to crash and boot you out while consuming a daily dungeon run\n-Horrible way to counter gold sellers/botters - gold sellers and botters are still rampant and doing a google search on gold sellers, it is easy to tell that all the measures this game has in place hasn't worked. On the down side, it is terrible for actual players. Non paying customers can only trade playing customers but any traded item becomes character bound (destroys resale value once you outlevel your gear). You can't trade money to anyone - friends included. Auction House allows only 1 item listing for non playing customers with a 30%  AH fee (10 items with 10% ah fee for paying customers). You can only collect money from the AH after 48 hours.\n-Lack of content for progression past level 120 - unless you count endlessly grinding mobs for 0.01% or doing daily dungeons as content. Current max level is 250 - 300 so there is a huge grind wall ahead...\n-Dungeons become painfully long and repetative - dungeon design is uninspiring and only worth doing a handful of times but most people go for full clears not because it is fun but because of the vital exp needed to continue the grind\n-Though it is free to play the game is severely gimped without a subscription. It becomes impossible to meaningful play the AH without a subscription. For a grinder, efficiently killing things is ontop of the list of priorities but withouyt a sub your character moves significantly slower and receive 30% less exp\n-Character stats cannot be reset as of today and while skill points can be reset - job changes are fixed. As such, without a lot of prior research, there is a very likely chance that you will need to reroll if you want to play something that is decent.\n\nOverall, this game starts off being alot of fun with it's nice visuals and initially fun combat but soon devolves into your standard korean grinder. Implementation feels old and dated (something from 10 years back) and the sad thing is...there was no reason to make it as bad as this. Taking queues from say GW2 - you don't have to gimp non premium player progression - just add alot of visually pleasing cosmetic goods in the cash shop. IMC didn't need to lock down trade features so heavily to try and prevent botters. Worst of all, there was no reason to make the grind wall as severe as it is...The game has an enormous set of classes and builds to try, I would much rather play a variety of different classes and builds rather then grind a single character ad infinitum.","April 27","false","313.7"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","3"

If you like games like Ragnarok Online or other Korean mmos you should automatically love this. However, if you haven't played any games like this before, but you like Diablo style games including Titan Quest, Grim Dawn, and Diablo 3 you should also feel at home here. This is more MMO than those games, but the combat is similar although a bit slower. There are a bajillion paths for ranking up your class, as well as no refund on Stat distribution which you do yourself. You can follow a guide so you don't mess it up, or experiment with new characters over and over. This is reminiscent of Diablo 2 and the constant creation of new characters to test new builds. The gameplay is quick and fluid while being very fun. If you have friends to play with, multiply fun times 10. There are plenty of people around and grouping is easy to do and suggested by the game. Very quick and painless to drop in and out of groups to do something specific or just to hang out and kill things.\n\nThis game can be as grindy, or as theme park as you want it to be. There is so much to do, and so many choices with your character that being unique is likely as well as fun and rewarding.\n\nI 100% recommend this game even if you've not played anything like it before. It should be great for casual gamers as well as hardcore gamers who want to put in extra time. There is no Pay 2 Win here, only a premium token which provides subscriber benefits, not unlike other games in this genre who are Free 2 Play. Increased experience, auction house selling slots, more money dropped from monsters and the such, but nothing that others can't get themselve in game. These same tokens can be sold on the auction house for in game money if you don't want to spend real world money on them.\n\nI expect this game only to get better with age, so get in as soon as you can to become a great member of the community early on!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadbird-zael/recommended/372000/","deadbird-zael","Zael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadbird-zael/","16 products in account","Simply put, Tree of Savior is fun as hell and it isn't a clone of World of Warcraft.\n\nNow then, allow me to elaborate.\n\nFirst of all, the music is phenomenal. The tracks are well composed, diverse, and beautiful. If that isn't enough, each area generally has multiple tracks so that you aren't listening to one song on repeat which is a really nice touch that most developers overlook.\n\nSecondly, the graphics. While not hyper realistic or over the top, the graphics of Tree of Saviour are an interesting blend of 2D sprite components and 3D cell shading that create a gorgeous artistic style that can still be run by lower end machines.\n\nNext, even at low levels, your skills feel powerful. Your moves have nice flashy animations that are impressive, and monsters explode on death making huge group kills ever so satisfying. Bosses are fun and interesting, scaling in challenge as you level up and progress through the story.\n\nMoving on, the questing experience is different from other games. The NPCs that provide you with side-quests are often unmarked, so for the first time in a game in years I found myself talking to all the NPCs in an area. I learned about my surroundings, found a ton of extra quests, and enjoyed the exploration / interaction aspect that this deisgn choice creates. I do understand though that this aspect of the game isn't for everyone, so it is definitely something to be aware of.\n\nThe Cash Shop is purely costume and convenience items and steers clear of a Pay to Win environment. In fact, most of the Cash Shop items that matter at all are tradeable like the Premium Token, Tree of Savior's subscription equivalent.\n\nCharacter customization may seem scare at character creation, but when you realize that the vast majority of the character customization options are both toggleable and available from the Market, Achievements, and the Class System, the lack of options during Charaction Creation kind of ceases to matter.\n\nThe Class and Statistic Systems are intense. There are over 80 Classes in the game and there are a boat load of combinations that you can build. You assign your stat points too, giving you complete control over your character.\n\nThe amount of options you have to control your character are fantastic. Want to use a Keyboard to do everything? You can. Not a fan of Keyboards and want to use your Mouse for everything? You can do that too. You like kicking it old school and want to lean back and use a Controller? Well, that's also an option. Want to switch between them? The game will just swap on the fly. You could drop your Controller and break it mid boss fight, and just start playing with the Keyboard if you knew your keybinds. That's awesome, cause Mouse and Controller batteries always seem to die at the worst times.\n\nFinally, if you played the original Ragnarok Online, Tree of Savior feels like coming back to your house from an extended vacation. Things are familiar, you have to get used to them again, but above all, you're back home.\n\nI would highly recommend this game. Haters gonna hate, I'm gonna play Tree of Savior.\n\nThanks for reading! Have a good one, and if you're gaming, may all your loots be phat!\n\nZ","April 12","true","465.1"," 31 of 60 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","31","60","5","0"

(Bosses with the circle attack I'm looking at you! -.-) Hopefully some of them will be fixed by Open Beta\n- Lack of customization of character looks\n- Optimization issues\n- Lack of mobs for everyone at certain places. (Again can easily be fixed with added channels in server)\n- Don't fully agree with the trading system it has but hey do what you gotta do to keep those bots out I guess\n\nThis game is definitely a grindfest but has story elements that keep it interesting whether that is a positive or negative; I'll leave that decision to you.\n\nMany things are bound to have changed since iCBT2 but I can confidently say that even with those changes I will be playing this game again when Open Beta hits.","March 19","true","433.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel the urge to quit this game everytime I walk to town. Gold sellers spam in every channel to the point you literally can not chat in town without going to a very far corner. And the devs do nothing about this, they could have a mute function, chat cooldown, GM monitoring,etc but no, they're too busy thinking of new way to restict legit players\n\n+ As I said, they punish regular players, not bot. They're trying to reduce human interaction to the minimum. Everything is restricted, no trade between players, only 1 item on market without token, 48 hours wait before you can get the money from the items you sold, team storage requires token, etc. You're no different from a bot playing this game, grind, do quest, upgrade equipments, repeat. No human interaction needed except for partying.\n\n+ LAG! LAG! LAG! Even in the least populated channel the delay is horrible. Your character attack twice on screen and only one damage tick appears. And don't even bother with charging skills. Fully charged skill with minimal damage is the norm in this game.\n\n+ Stupid AI and ridiculously short buff duration. I get that they want to prevent bot from afk farming, but dumping down the game just for that is ridiculous. Your pet, your summoned, your converted mobs, etc are stupid as hell. They do nothing and have no damage. The only thing they do is making your lag worse. Buff duration is too short to make support classes worth while, most of the time the priests don't even bother buffing you because it's such a hassle to rebuff every minute. And did I tell you that the buff aoe is so small that you'll miss most of the time?\n\n+ A lot of game mechanics are not explained in the game. You have to read on the forums for that.\n\n+ The game is no where near polished enough for open beta. This is more like early access. You literally have a dozen quests with descriptions like this "Kill %s", "Find %s", "Get %s". And it is near unplayable without a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fanmade addons because the game UI design is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.\n\nIn conclusion, don't play this game unless you have a lot of time to waste, because that's essentially all you'll do in this game.","May 23","false","144.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The way I see it what matters is the experience itself and not the game's features, if you're looking for a good time with your friends, this might not be as fun as Ragnarok, and by that I mean, you don't get to stick to your friends, the questline will push you further and further into more missions rather than make you grind mobs in a group, eventually you will find yourself teleporting from map to map to complete your missions and so on, so forget about team work unless you're running a guild which is incredibly expensive or dungeons that you only get to do past level 50 twice a day.\n\n2. If you like to play by the market and go full merchant shekelstein, go ahead, but not without premium, so forget your profit because you won't get any with a 30% tax and no currency trading or whatsoever, you can only trade items and with premium you get a 10% taxation on the market, which is still a great rip off in your profits, IMC crippled us good here.\n\n3. Another problem you might find is leveling up, not that it's hard but you'll have a hard time figuring out when to use your exp cards and knowing what maps you should clear first, also, you must clear all maps and do all quests otherwise you stagnate late game and get stuck with no cards and no missions, you mustn't do them too late nor too early, otherwise you'll have hard time grinding less than 1% exp mobs, worst case scenario your equipment gets trashed and you are left broke with no money and no conditions to come back.\n\n4. Unfortunately, aesthethical customization is an issue, you don't have many options besides your hair which you don't even get to choose the color, you'll have to grind mobs to get different colors, and hats are mostly either expensive and hard/impossible to get or they're so common everyone has them, very limited in my opinion, a waste for such a well detailed game. No visual diversity at all.\n\nPros:\n1. Great characters, great animations and the music is simply amazing, it won't make your head ache and it synchronizes damn well with the map themes, the graphics are awesome and certainly drew most of the game base by it's aesthethic sense 10/10 for drawing efforts.\n\n2. After the updates there is no lag and mostly no bugs, not sure if they fixed all classes but it's all good as far as I've gone through, the players in the brazilian server are quite friendly and will help you out, and most certainly will need your help in return sooner or later, goldsellers are unable to profit due to no silver trade and steam currency packs are now selected by server and will probably have different prices, so no more exploiting, no need to ♥♥♥♥ everyone equally like before, IMC disposes of a bad decision making team shame on them, but it's fixed for now, I hope.\n\n3. The game simply offers you many features and builds, you'll find yourself immersed in your class, be it a full highlander glasscannon or a supporting hybrid tank heretic gypsie druid, althought some classes are useless as far as I'm concerned, you can ♥♥♥♥ up your character easily so don't go around doing stupid ♥♥♥♥ pretending to know what you're doing.\n\n4.

Just go and see for yourself, it's grindy but fun, everything about it is well done and the gameplay feels really great, the PvP is pretty fun too, the game is one of a kind, go check it out!","May 16","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Contudo, o jogador deve saber muito bem o que pretende fazer para montar seu personagem, pois não há poção de reversão de classe caso faça alguma coisa errada em sua build (pelo menos IMC ainda não lançou algo do tipo, o que futuramente creio que existirá). Existem muitos problemas no game, mas isso não quer dizer que ele seja ruim como muitos têm comentado. Sim, o sistema de troca é péssimo, mas é uma maneira de evitar os goldsellers de vender dentro do game. Esperamos que a IMC faça alguma coisa eficaz em relação a esses vendedores e aos bots, pois é realmente irritante você tentar comprar alguma coisa no market e não conseguir ler o painel de vendas porque os malditos bots floodam sua tela com mensagens de venda; ou os bots que ficam farmando itens em locais específicos, atrapalhando a vida dos players.\nTirando esse lado ruim que o game ainda apresenta, os graficos são bonitos. A jogabilidade é boa, a música então é excelente. É um belo game, não vejo problema em questão do P2P pois paga quem quiser. Claro que existe a questão daqueles (assim como eu), que pagaram o pre-release para acesso antecipado e querem fazer valer o seu dinheiro no game que investiu, mas galera, entenda que tudo que é novo passa por adaptações e as vezes leva tempo para deixar o game em um estado perfeito.\nRecomendo!","March 30","true","375.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it also allows you to simply play a common, known class or to try something unique, different and fitting for your own playstyle.\nThe soundtrack is amazing.

Ill keep playing it though to see where it will lead.. I play on the EU server and i also regret to inform there is alot of SERVER LAGG due to all the bots and players.. Monster Respawn timers are really long and stupid to wait on ( i for one waited over 15-20 minutes for 2 rare spawns for a quest to appear ) Besides that note the game is quite fun just gotta be sure to get every and all quests that are in the area of your lvl and make sure to Eat the EXP Cards as they come great way to power level..

Some of the interaction with quest items take a few button presses for it to register.\n\nIf using a controller, at the begining the bit where you have to use up down left right to see how the controls work only works with keyboard, so I had to switch to keyboard mode to get rid of that screen.\n\nAlso, no resolution setting for fullscreen? Had to go into user.xml to change that..\n\nAlso felt like my character kept getting weaker as I progressed, I chose cleric which understandably will have lower attack but still, it just felt like the attack did barely any damage even though I kept putting points in int which it said increases magic damage, the cooldowns on Heal and Cure were waay too long, they also heal too much considering you can set it to only heal and not damage. I'm not sure if you can use a range autoattack but my character would hit the rod instead of casting a ranged attack, I had to switch to shield and sword, on a healer to defeat a random side quest world boss thing....\n\nI don't understand how this is fun.\n\nAnd let's not forget the rmt spam bots.......... I found a mod that blocked and reported the spam which fixed the issue but the game devs can't even think of creating something similar or partnering with the mod creator.\n\nMaybe this game should've stayed in beta a bit more, it's not exactly playable to me as it is.","May 13","false","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The bots are horrendous, the spawn times, even after the buff, don't allow for the current amount of players in the map to progress.  The classes are underwhelming, especially if you stay within your "Circle".  Also, PVP is pretty much restricted to end game only.  The only PVP that I've even seen this game have is GvG.

Nostalgia, Brings back the memories of Ragnarok Online for those that played it, most of the design decisions are remarkable very close to what RO had back in the day.\n\n2 - Quests/Open to explore, you have the base main quest you can follow, gain XP and learn the ropes that way, from there you can either jump into grinding(some people like that) and grind for your levels, aka why I said "open to exploration", and there's the "Hidden quests" on each map you have a set of quests that aren't that hidden, where by simply talking with the NPC's the quests are there, I found one or two quests already on a few maps that are triggered by items or simply by walking into the area, very interesting concept.(you can chose to do these or skip them.)\n\n3 - Combat/movement mechanics(a breath of fresh air.) in this day an age where most of the mmorpgs movement and combat mechanics are simply doing a copy paste of the base system we had with EQ, some others going the point and click route, the fact that you can play the game almost not touching your mouse, using the keyboard or the same with the gamepad, its different, new, to me at least.\n\nCONS(this is subject to change)\n\n1 - F2P, so its currently with the usual stuff you see on popular mmorpgs, full of bots running around grinding to make "silver"(the currency used to pay repairs and do other stuff like buy equipment.), the usual standing bots on towns selling Silver aswell, bare in mind that IMC is doing their best to keep the game free of this plague, but we all know its a fight hard to win, or loose.(more methods to combat this are being thinkered by the Dev team from the information provided from them to me, so its something to keep an eye out.)\n\n2 - Lag/server issues(this may change, the game just launched, its normal that EVERYONE wants to give it a go, and with the Bots/gold sellers in the mix, you can imagine how the servers struggle, may change like I said with time, once the hype dies, the server machines get upgrades and more servers pop up.)\n\n\nNow the question everyone poses, is it worth to give it a go and play? in my opinion, yes, if you like anime style graphics(2D?) and grind mechanic ala Ragnarok Online(you can choose to do quests tho if you feel bored, and you will.) its the right game for you, if you are unsure if yer going to like it even after reading all of this, I'd say still give it a go.\n\nOne thing I must say is that, "reviews" by other people should be taken as opinions, when the game can't be branded good or bad, instead of going for the reviews of other people, TRY THE GAME!\n\nYou never know, you might find something you find interesting to play huh?","May 16","true","118.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Trading system is sucks, and you need to wait for 48hrs after succesfull transiction at brokers npc and yea people need talts for trading eq/item and dont forget only can be traded between token to token user.. if this system used to prevent gold seller well its failled indeed.. gold seller is everywhere and there always a way for them selling gold.. common dont u see it, they make the other players suffering just to prevents from this gold seller.\nFurthermore, this mmo is 80-90% solo by questing none stop from all maps, i miss an mmo where i can get friends and played together, grinding at normal maps is kinda useless since the mobs spawn are just too slow, sometime u will really hard to clear the quest since the mobs on the maps are all gone and need to wait like 1-3mins to appear..duh..\nFor the dungeon, there are pretty hard to get party but theres a party finder system that automatch and help u to get in the dungeon but unfortunately they will fail u everytime.. for example, u need to wait for 30min to wait the party match, after gettin inside the dungeon u will see theres no healer, no tank, and people inside like complaining so much at the end they gave up so ur gonna lose 1 entry just like that. sad but this always happen to me. The party matching really need to upgraded, and the dungeon is always full.\nif this doesnt take any action the game gonna lose alot good player since the leveling kinda bored and pretty tough.","May 14","false","438.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I would be fine with it, if the game was optimized. But it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ auwful. And don't wait for devs to trully optimize it (since they would need to do a complete overhaul of the game code).\n\nI can play GW2 on high settings with constant 60 FPS during WvWvW (where zerg vs zerg with 50+ ppl is pretty common). Here I get 10-15 FPS in dungeons and 5 FPS in cities. People with much better rig than mine don't get more than 5 FPS in ~10-men PVP.

Plenty of content, good looking environments. It IS a bit of a grind-fest.\n\nThe problem is the server populations are composed of a metric crap-ton of bots and the actual players are farming rare drops in lower zones and so a zone instance can easily have NO MOBS IN IT.  Zero. I traversed an entire zone and encountered 3 mobs. There were several archer bots running around though. I assume they were bots, most players don't name themselves "hUuWUISI" and "IWNAoofiawi".\n\nYou can't use the trade board for 3 days after you join a server, which was done to help prevent RMT bots from selling crap on the board; problem is there are easy workarounds for that, so all it does is keep you, the new player, from being able to get decent cheap low end gear.\n\nSo, should you try it out? Yes. Should you stick with it and play it as a primary MMO? Probably not.","May 30","true","35.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Too much bot, when you go to the main town you got spammed per an army of bots, when you look the global chat you always see an announce for RMT.\n2. The game got over limited, you can only do 2 dungeons per day instead of 5 run PER dungeons at the beta. If you are a F2P player, you can't use some feature, example the party storage.\n3. You crash/Lag without reason due to the fact that the code is poorly optimized, one of the worst optimization that I've ever seen.\n4. You can't really trade see: https://treeofsavior.com/news/?n=356\n\nOne of the reasons for these limitations is normally to prevent BOT, but this isn't effective at all, the only good point for IMC is to make you cash all month for an useless token for using all the feature of the game.\n\nPro:\n1. Great class, you can make "your" proper class. The current system of job is very good in this aspect.\n2. The Dungeon/Instance are good but too limited see #2 of Cons.\n3.

The game has a solid foundation on most elements. There's a rather large world to explore with many different settings and furry animal sprites and the background music is stunning (although a little out of place in some zones) and the controls feel simple but great. You can jump to dodge attacks and skills, attack jump and overall the hitting animations and skills feel impactful and satisfying. The main appeal is obviously the class system as well as the long-term progression potential in the game, similar to what you'd see in Ragnarok Online.\n\nUnfortunately, the similarities end here. IMC felt like they had to turn most of the leveling experience into humdrum questing, which while not as terribly monotonous as most MMOs due to the variety of activities, is still pretty linear and predictable. There aren't many functional differences between maps either and most of the monster and boss difficulty is laughably easy for most classes. What feels fun at first quickly becomes a very repetitive grind which you have no choice over. Grinding mobs themselves is terrible in this game due to low spawn rates and overall low exp gains compared to dungeons and questing. In turn, this means your whole 'endless level' meme is just a bigger number for the typical endgame you see in most MMOs, which is easily attainable in a month or so of soul crushing quests and dungeons.\nThe class system, while great in theory feels ultimately pointless most of the time since the content is too easy (or too annoying). Despite the interactive party system the game has very little incentives to actually group up since any group activity can (and is encouraged to) be automatized with dungeon matchmakers... In the end most of the old school feeling of finding parties or grinding with friends is thrown out of the window.\n\nThere are also other terrible design decisions, such as the extremely limited trading unless you buy a monthly sub. For a game that encourages experimentation with so many classes it feels odd to not even allow gear transfers between characters unless you pay (and don't forget you'll have to do redo all the quests over again everytime you reroll). The cash shop is mildly pay2win as well and knowing IMC's track record with their previous games, it's only a matter of time until it becomes a massive P2W fest.\n\nIn the end, I think this game has great potential and boasts a great baseline of building blocks, but IMC ultimately fails at trying to push the envelope and create something unique out of them and instead settles on creating another dull, forgettable Korean MMO just like Granado Espada. All the modern MMO troupes are back: the humdrum questing, linear leveling experience, little choice on player freedom, extremely streamlined solo content and penalizing just about any form of player interaction doesn't spell a long-term experience. It's also bug ridden some skills and classes don't even work the way they're supposed to, plus the optimization leaves a lot to be desired for a 2.5D game.\n\nWhile I encourage everyone to try it out once it goes F2P I can't really recommend anyone to pay for EA let alone spending anything in the cash shop.","April 6","false","107.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Combat feels good, classes are interesting, guild wars and bosses are fun and it looks beautiful. Now the reason for the low reviews is that it is managed so badly:\n\n1. The clear balance issues on classes makes the combat unfair (anything past peltasta C1 in swordman tree doesn't matter. the whole class tree is a glorified aggroer/tank).\n2. The game doesn't work with many people at the same time which makes guild wars and world bosses a slideshow.\n3. And lastly the bot prevention: doesn't seem to prevent it at all, but makes trading with other people a chore.\n\nNow despite this all, I still enjoy it. It's more of a good beta game, rather than a finished product and I'm fine with that.

Unleashing devastating aoe attacks on large groups of monsters doesn't get old.\nCharacter building has a lot of depth. Character levels increase base power with stat increases and every 15th class level you choose new or higher tiered sub classes, and as a result ToS offers a rare depth of character customization.\nBad stuff:\nP2W. (This is debated.  With an expensive monthly premium token you get access to a movement speed buff, +30% XP boost,  trading restrictions lifted, and head enchants with stat increases which are all clearly P2W in my book)\nSome servers are drowning in lag or down for maintenance for long periods of time.\nBots and gold sellers are everywhere.\nCompared to the beta builds, monsters spawn rates are SEVERELY reduced.  In many places much more time is spend sitting around or searching for mobs, than actually fighting things.  Also means it takes a truly masochistic soul to even attempt to complete many of the item collections.\nVery limited character creation, all you get is male/female, one of four classes, and choose your hair style.\nToS shows incredible promise for being a long staying and successful F2P mmorpg once the launch issues with bugs and server stability gets ironed out.  IMC also desperately needs to adress the monster spawn rate situation.\n\nSo with all these negatives listed why is this game still a thumbs up from me?  Cause despite it all, ToS is still an immensely enjoyable game for me that I'm having a lot of fun wasting away my hours on!","May 12","true","193.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Customization creates depth in the game-play. However, players interaction could be further encouraged. Game play needs to be more balanced. More varieties need to be implemented. Given the momentum of the developers, the game has a lot of potentials to be greater.\n\nPros\n\nThis game is an eye candy. The maps and character designs are amazing. It truly stepped up its game in the artistic department comparing to Ragnarok, which was a beautiful game to begin with. The map has different layers of backgrounds creating such depth. You may be crossing a bridge high up in the mountain while finding other players fighting monsters deep in a small valley underneath. A 2.5 D game with such style puts even many 3D MMORPG in shame.\n\nThe game offers an enjoyable RPG experience. It allows so much customization. The number of classes and skills in each allows two late game characters of the same class to have completely different play styles. The drop rate is decent. Gears are easy to get. I never find myself short of resource to buy merchandises. Free users are at little disadvantage comparing to the paying ones.\n\nThe devs are still actively fixing the game's issues. The lagging issue which was causing huge uproar was fixed in a week. The trade system has been brought back. The developers listen to what their customers want and they make it happen. This game is being constantly improved. Hopefully the user experience would be even better in the future.\n\nCons\n\nThe game struggles to create a cohesive experience as a MMORPG. It does not encourage players to cooperate. For example, doing quests alone is far more rewarding than anything else due to the low difficulty of the game. This results in every player focusing on playing alone rather than being part of the greater world. Remember the merchants on the streets of the major cities in Ragnarok making the world so lively? The market place is a cheap replacement to that formal glory. Even though there are plenty players, it lacks a spirit of a living world.\n\nThe classes are not balanced. Despite allowing customization, certain build provides far better leveling experience comparing to another. It requires user to do their homework before actually playing the game. Some skills are traps by being completely under-powered. It is not that kind of game which rewards you for being devoted to a certain path. Hence stepping on to the wrong path means either starting over or buying $ item to reset the character.\n\nLastly, behind its pretty face, the game gets repetitive really fast. All minions on every level feels the same from lv1 to lv50. It is great to fight a boss every now and then, but it feels like the same boss with different skins/animations except a few. Quest comes in different formats, but all too trivial. They should be more distinctive and memorable. However, the hidden ones are really pleasant surprises. I remember finding a red gem which took me to a boss battle against a monster guarding it. Make these more common! Overall, the grinding experience feels a bit bland.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt has been fun, but I am stopping playing this game because the cons outweigh the pros. I will not enjoy the same experience for another 35 hours. The game is still worth a try for new comers.","May 19","false","34.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacDrol/recommended/372000/","TacDrol","TacDrol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacDrol/","454 products in account","Product received for free\n\nHonestly I can't recommend this game, all the issues that arise make it unplayable and frustrating.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun, you got a lot of variety in classes and the combat is enjoyable, not your generic mmorpg type of gameplay, but that's pretty much where the positives stop.\n\nIt tries a bit hard to be Ragnarok, from visual design to certain mechanics, but it's obviously not. If you're going into the game looking for that, you'll be disappointed. There's a ton of monsters to kill, there's a big boss monster awaiting around every corner, but after a while I just start wondering whether those bosses were any different or meaningful to kill, none of them drop any interesting loot and overall the game is lacking in variety of loot. You have only a few tiers of items and often they don't even look different and you won't get any new usable items for a long time. You also find a ton of materials, but you got nothing to do with them, the crafting system is very shallow and boring.\n\nThere are performance issues, the game isn't optimized very well, but it's not a dealbreaker. My computer isn't amazing, like 5 years old at this point and the only times I get bad performance issues is in towns with a lot of people, which doesn't matter that much since most of the gameplay takes place in other areas, so while I see a lot of people complaining about this, I think this is a minor issue that can be overlooked.\n\nLag, however, can't be overlooked. If you ever played Lunia or Spiral knights and experienced lag in those games, you'll know what I'm talking about. This game is an action game that requires you to dodge attacks or attack and retreat, but the game is server based, meaning that every movement and attack you make on your screen doesn't matter, since it first has to register on the server and if there's even the slightest lag, things won't go your way. Even regular attacks become a chore to execute, as your character gets stuck after each attack until the server decides that you had executed the attack. Now you might say that lag is related to your internet rather than the servers, but that's not true, if you don't live anywhere near the servers(not the same continent), you're gonna have a bad time. Personally I get 150ms ping and that's already unplayable, at higher levels you need to react faster, but when enemies attack faster than your signal gets sent to the server and back, the game becomes unfair and frustrating. If the server is having issues, lags rise even higher and you start teleporting back constantly while going somewhere, enemies hurt you long after you ran past them and all kinds of things like that.\n\nThe jumping mechanic seems like an interesting feature for this kind of game, but it is useless and not done right. Most areas don't utilize it, most maps don't even let you fall down from places to lower ground and just force you to go around or don't let you jump over some low obstacles like fences as if there's no such thing as jumping in the game. Jumping is meant to be used as an evasion maneuver and it's meant to be a split second action, but since the game is server based, if you're experiencing lag you can't use that at all to your advantage.\n\nBots and spammers are also a big issue in the game, there's constant spamming and advertising of gold selling sites, the people that spam don't get banned for hours and keep spamming it in shouting chat which scrolls their message across the top of the screen all the time, which can't be turned off. Even after blocking a lot of those people, they constantly make new users and spam more and more of their crap. You also see a bunch of bots around the battlefields, reporting them doesn't seem to help much. I get that this issue is difficult to deal with for the GMs, but it's still incredibly annoying, I forgot that these things even exist considering I haven't seen them for a couple of years.\n\nOverall, I really dislike that this game is so server reliant, I get that it helps prevent cheating and all that, but it's also preventing me from playing the game properly, just like it used to be with Lunia and Spiral Knights for me.","May 13","false","33.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is a lot to love in this game, the warm, hand-drawn art direction and extremely wide class options are instantly appealing. One thing I particualrly enjoyed was the absurdly archaic inspirations they used for many of the game's more unsual jobs. The Divedirbys, for example carves various holy statues in battle, and is based on an actual real world profession. Many other jobs draw from disparate cultural sources including ancient korea, feudal japan, and wide swaths of middle aged cultures in the baltic regions.\n\nHowever, the game is not without faults. It lacks a strong narrative backdrop, and even major questlines are riddled with poor translations and mark-up errors. Town hubs can become almost comically overpopulated, though players can usually fix this by changing instances. The underlying gameplay can also grow repetitive, and consists largely of grinding on the same chump monsters as you cut a path to large boss encounters. With a group of friends, this gameplay is a great backdrop for social engagement, but I can't imagine it would remain fun for long as a solo experience.","May 21","true","13.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I bought the Founders Blah Blah, to be able to play this game, hoping to get much from what I paid. At first, it was fun, coz I am playing with my bro. I didn't mind all its faults thinking that the game will get better and better soon. I suffer from very low FPS, though I have a unit with high specs -higher than the recommended, I suffer from delays and lags in dugeons though I have an excellent connection. I've been into a lot of MMOs, and they all run smooth, except for TOS. I just can't understand why. I am not a techie person, and I don't know anything about optimization and the like, but through reading reviews, I came up with a realization that this game has not leveled with the fun and enjoyment I experienced playing in RO1. That is why, my plans to recommend this game to my friends would remain an elusive dream forever. I still play though, at least a couple of hours in a day, farming for arde dagger, and doing the 3/3 mercenary quest. But to explore the game more? I doubt if I'd still have the interest. I am just waiting for my token to expire, then, I don't know what will happen next. It killed my interest in playing with other MMOs, this game made me tired and unhappy...#peaceout","May 29","false","223.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is a lot to love in this game, the warm, hand-drawn art direction and extremely wide class options are instantly appealing. One thing I particualrly enjoyed was the absurdly archaic inspirations they used for many of the game's more unsual jobs. The Divedirbys, for example carves various holy statues in battle, and is based on an actual real world profession. Many other jobs draw from disparate cultural sources including ancient korea, feudal japan, and wide swaths of middle aged cultures in the baltic regions.\n\nHowever, the game is not without faults. It lacks a strong narrative backdrop, and even major questlines are riddled with poor translations and mark-up errors. Town hubs can become almost comically overpopulated, though players can usually fix this by changing instances. The underlying gameplay can also grow repetitive, and consists largely of grinding on the same chump monsters as you cut a path to large boss encounters. With a group of friends, this gameplay is a great backdrop for social engagement, but I can't imagine it would remain fun for long as a solo experience.","May 21","true","13.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Even so much that it is overwhelming at glance. You are presented with 4 base class options, each of which can further evolve into more specialized variants, tallying up to a total of 80 available classes.\n+ Amazing artstyle, amazing OST.\n\nNegatives:- In it's current state the game runs very badly at times. VERY badly.\n- Many bugged quests, so far I've run into two MAIN STORY quests that prevented me from progressing because they were broken.\n- Gold sellers are running rampant in-game to the point where you have to completely disable the global chat channel to not have your chatbox filled by messages from Zskdfjgklh and friends at all times.\n- Trading is completely locked behind a paywall in a game advertised as "free to play". F2p players have access to the market but are restricted to selling a single item at a time.\n- You're only allowed to enter dungeons twice a day. Not twice per dungeon, but two dungeons per day overall.\n\nOther things:- Premium status gives benefits such as permanent increased movement speed, +20% experience gained from combat and increased maximum buff count.\n- The game doesn't do a good job of educating you about how building a character works. Leveling the wrong stat or picking the wrong class can "ruin" your character permanently very easily. Upon realization you either have to remake or redesign your character, or play with a gimped character.\n\n\nI will most likely continue the game but I would not recommend it as the experience is very frustrating most of the time. Regardless I feel like there is a gem hidden in this pile of dirt, and if IMC manages to fix all or at least most of the issues causing tension in the playerbase the game has potential to be great.","April 3","false","49.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Even so much that it is overwhelming at glance. You are presented with 4 base class options, each of which can further evolve into more specialized variants, tallying up to a total of 80 available classes.\n+ Amazing artstyle, amazing OST.\n\nNegatives:- In it's current state the game runs very badly at times. VERY badly.\n- Many bugged quests, so far I've run into two MAIN STORY quests that prevented me from progressing because they were broken.\n- Gold sellers are running rampant in-game to the point where you have to completely disable the global chat channel to not have your chatbox filled by messages from Zskdfjgklh and friends at all times.\n- Trading is completely locked behind a paywall in a game advertised as "free to play". F2p players have access to the market but are restricted to selling a single item at a time.\n- You're only allowed to enter dungeons twice a day. Not twice per dungeon, but two dungeons per day overall.\n\nOther things:- Premium status gives benefits such as permanent increased movement speed, +20% experience gained from combat and increased maximum buff count.\n- The game doesn't do a good job of educating you about how building a character works. Leveling the wrong stat or picking the wrong class can "ruin" your character permanently very easily. Upon realization you either have to remake or redesign your character, or play with a gimped character.\n\n\nI will most likely continue the game but I would not recommend it as the experience is very frustrating most of the time. Regardless I feel like there is a gem hidden in this pile of dirt, and if IMC manages to fix all or at least most of the issues causing tension in the playerbase the game has potential to be great.","April 3","false","49.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Tree of Savior is meh. IMC is lucky to have people dubbing the game as RO's successor because if it weren't for that, this game wouldn't have built up so much hype. It's just like all the other "modern" MMOs out there.\n\n1. It's your typical theme park MMO; doing quests is pretty much necessary because they give a good amount of EXP (through EXP cards) and certain areas can't be accessed without doing some of the quests.\n\n2. Don't expect to be able to freely play your character however you want, because there's a specific path you must take in order to progress in the game.\n\n3. There are so many classes and this would've actually been good if it weren't for the quests. Wanna try a new class? Prepare to go through the same exact quests you just finished on your first character.\n\n4. Monster AI is so simple and stupid. I can provoke a whole screen's worth of mobs and kill every single one of them with just auto attack. No strategy involved at all. Bosses aren't very challenging either although they aren't as boring as non-boss monsters.\n\n5. So many class possibilities yet so little gear choices. Perhaps the devs spent too much time designing the classes so they completely overlooked the importance of gear options?\n\n6. Trade system is god damn awful. You know there's something wrong when you can't trade the game's main currency.\n\n7. The game has three "modes" - Keyboard Mode, Mouse Mode, Controller Mode. Mouse mode is buggy as ****. The devs shouldn't have implemented it if they couldn't get it right.\n\nIn my opinion, these are this game's ONLY selling points:\n\n1. World and character design\n2. BGM\n\nThose who are looking for an "RO-like game" in terms of core gameplay, don't bother with Tree of Savior. You will be sorely disappointed.","May 29","false","572.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Runs pretty good and I haven't really had any issues with disconnecting or crashing while playing. The game doesn't seem to be particularly buggy in any way either. Lag hasn't been to much of a problem. So far I am having a pretty damn good time with this one. I haven't spent any cash in the game yet but you can earn 5 TP cash currency just by playing. After so much time passes it awards you 1 TP up to 5 total. This is enough TP to purchase an item to res and a megaphone for server chat about once a day if you stay logged in. The graphics are amazing and the game isn't boring either. There are plenty of quests to so with all kinds of different requirements so you won't be doing a bunch of fetch questing or tedious stuff as you progress.

The game is said to be the 'spiritual successor' of Ragnarok online, but it's not. Though I haven't played Ragnarok a lot, the 2 games differ a lot (too much to be honest), so don't be fooled by that silly 'spiritual successor' crap...\n\nI bought this game during early access and even then the game was loaded with goldsellers - yes this pest really buys into early access games to get a market. Sadly though, the developer (and publisher) is not doing much to battle the goldsellers and you can't even report them from chat (all you can do is block them). That being said, there is said to be a tool available that can recognize, report and block this pest for you. And while it's a helpfull tool, this kind of tools SHOULD NOT be able to be used with an online game, because if this can be used, cheaters can also use hacking tools easily as well!\n\nThen the gameplay... Where to start... If you want to 'kill 10 rats' over and over again, then this game is for you. As a MMO (which is hyped to death!) it's not bringing anything new. It's the same old over and over again and a huge grind for levels to hit cap.\nAnd talking about grind... Changing jobs is yet an other grind. Yes, you can easily select what new job you want, but to get it done be prepared to do numerous 'kill 10 rats' quests before you're even able to talk to that one NPC that can help you progress to your next job.\n\nIt's not all too bad though... Graphics are isometric and a very appealing anime style, sound on the other hand feels pretty much out of place for this game and story telling is pretty decent (and corny, but what to expect when almost every tale has been told already :p).\n\nIn general I can say it's 'yet an other MMORPG' to fill the ranks. Nothing real special here for my taste and certainly not living up the hype (yes I did read into the game before buying that early access).","May 13","false","6.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

IMC, the developers, or whoever, need to communicate more openly with the community. The negativity is very strong right now, and for good reason. If you guys don't respond to the community and make it known that you KNOW there are big issues plaguing this game and that you want to fix them, people are just going to keep shouting louder. People desparately want this to be the great game they know that it can be.\n\nAt the core, I know this is a solid game. I was home from work today and was able to play during a low-traffic time, and it was amazing. I was able to connect everytime I tried, the lag was minimal, and I didn't get booted once. This is why there is a such a strong influx of negativity - because people care about the fate of this game. It sounds silly, but it's true! If the game itself didn't have anything to it, it would just quietly die off. For a bit of perspective for those of your just now checking this game out: When it was still in closed beta testing, it had a 9/10 rating. Scrolling through the recommendations was a sea of thumbs up. We're in an "early access" period now, and the community expects better performance, or at the very least, better communication.\n\nAll in all, I'm still recommending this game. If you like the art style, if the gameplay looks appealing, and especially if you were a big RO fan and are looking for a "fresh" spiritual successor, then by all means, buy in. I would strongly suggest you go for the $10 pack, as the two more expensive tiers offer items and incentives that are difficult to make the best use of right now due to the game's performance issues.\n\nIf you're reading any of these reviews IMC, please understand that the negativity isn't because we want the game dead. We just honestly want to see it survive, and we want you to show us that you want it to survive, too.\n\nTL;DR: The game itself is great, and has the potential to be awesome. People are lashing out because they understand this, but IMC is not giving us the confidence right now that they're going to see it through and give the game the treatment it deserves.\n\nOh, and the music is awesome. At least in my opinion.","April 4","true","160.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bidulz/recommended/372000/","bidulz","cal-chan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bidulz/","303 products in account","Note: This review was pared down slightly due to size limitations.\n\nTree of Savior can best be described as a mixed bag: before you put your hand in, you better know what you’re going to get out of it. In this Free to Play MMORPG by IMC Entertainment (Granado Espada, ex Ragnarok Online developers) you start by picking one of four classes and by the end of it you’re one of eighty. Designed to be a hardcore game, Tree of Savior takes ideas from eastern and western games in its genre and blends them with varying degrees of success. Seeing all the beautiful landscapes and legends based on Lithuanian mythology might take hundreds of hours, but it feels like the game was designed so only the most dedicated players will see even half of it.\n\nWhich is a shame, because there’s no denying that Tree of Savior is a beautiful looking game. By using a mix of 2D and 3D the game treads that line between old and new and occasionally looks like a massive vanillaware game. The area design has been fairly unique from my time with it and I’ve been impressed more than a couple of times just from how it looks. Some of the monsters and items start to repeat as early as 30 levels in though which is a bit of a drag, but I figure they had to cut back a bit since there is enough content for over 200 levels of gameplay.\n\nThat’s right, 200! I don’t have a number for the amount of different maps total, but I’ve probably seen more than 40 already and I am over level 100. You do see a lot of the standard areas, like a peaceful looking field or a dungeon filled with monsters, but they change it up enough so it doesn’t get boring to look at. The max level is 280, but the quest content supposedly runs out at about 230, leaving 50 levels of straight grinding to do. That’s a tall order for anyone, let alone a regular player who just wants to unwind for a few hours during the weekend.\n\nRegular gameplay is fairly simple - designed with a keyboard in mind (but you can use keyboard and mouse or a controller as well), all of your movements are controlled by the arrow keys and spells on the keyboard rows, but you can have more if you like. It plays like an action game where you can dodge attacks and dash and jump, just with spells instead of combos. Dodging can be kind of iffy occasionally, as hitboxes or lag make it tough to jump over ground attacks. Most classes are very skill-heavy but the given layouts are pretty comfortable. Unfortunately the only way to rebind keys right now is by editing a file, which just feels like an obvious oversight.\n\nIn fact, I’d go so far as to say that this game requires a lot of research to get the full enjoyment from it. There is no stat reset and skill resets are only purchased with real money. On top of that there are seven ranks for each class and each one has at least two different and new choices in it, so there are hundreds of build combinations per class, with no way to reset or change your mind when you’ve decided, so you better make it count. It’s very easy to make a choice you might regret later, which feels very old-school but also a little frustrating for some. I have been in dungeons where players will tell others that they should be reading this big document talking about the nuances to the combat; a lot of things just aren’t intuitive.\n\nA lot of these minor details have been fixed by the awesome community of the game. There are addons that people have made through LUA scripting and other means that were made to patch holes currently in the game. Gibbed made an addon that shows all the sidequests that you can take, and even displays them on the map so you don’t have to talk to every single NPC or check every corner of every map for quests. Right now most of these addons are unofficial and haven’t been approved by designers, but they mentioned that addons are fine as long as they’re not exploiting the game or giving some players unfair advantages.\n\nUp until now the messaging between players and developers has been pretty good. They listened to the community when they weren’t happy with the price of their early access server, and they are working to fix the ongoing bot problem that has already cropped up. Even though it’s a Korean developed game they are surprisingly talkative and have community representatives that are active on their forums. I think the real problem is that some of the issues the game has are going to take a lot more work to fix.\n\nAlthough beautiful, Tree of Savior is a technical nightmare. I have a decent PC (GTX 760 and a 4590 intel processor) and this game runs very awkwardly, the main reason being that the game doesn’t use your graphics card at all. In an attempt to be playable on every computer imaginable, the programmers also forced the game to run only on a single core. Combined, these two choices make the game run very sluggishly and with lots of inconsistent frame drops and overall shaky performance. If there are many players nearby the game slows to a crawl. If a lot of enemies take damage at once you might see single digit frames per second. These aren’t uncommon occurrences either; even with multiple channels per area, you can usually find many crowded areas with players fighting large groups of monsters at once, which looks cool until it tanks the game’s performance like nothing I’ve ever seen. The good thing is that if you have a PC that can run the game at the bare minimum you’ll probably have the same experience as someone with a great computer, providing an even playing field for all - for better or worse.\n\nSomething about the creature AI just doesn’t feel quite right either. If I attack five monsters at once, occasionally one will just run away which is either a cute feature or an annoyance depending on how you see it. Most enemies are very slow to respond to attacks too, sometimes taking three or four seconds to react to you hitting them which feels very wrong considering how active this game otherwise feels.\n\nSpeaking of, spells in this game also feel a little inconsistent. Either a product of lag or poor netcode, spells will sometimes fail to cast even though I charged them up fully. Some spells that don’t have cast times can be interrupted mid-attack and can be put on cooldown without actually going off while others will be cast regardless, even if I get knocked down. Another annoying thing is enemies clumped together but at different heights can avoid being hurt altogether because of the way the 3D works. This is good and bad as it also allows you to avoid being hit by standing above someone, but it makes playing on hills or slopes fairly frustrating. All these are fairly common occurrences and it makes the game feel sort of incomplete on a technical level.\n\nThere’s a shocking lack of consistency in this game that really makes it feel rushed. I wish they had spent another 6 months fixing the performance and some of the other flaws I mentioned, because it appears a bit unstable. It’s a shame, because there is so much unique about it but I can’t look past the technical problems. This game feels like the result of a Korean designer’s attempt at making a game with a bit of a western feel, similar to what Dark Souls did. Between the layers of complexity and poor performance I fear it that may turn people away once they get frustrated with some of the games’ intricacies, which is a shame because it’s got a lot of cute details that make it fun and feel full of life. I would recommend trying out the game at least because it’s free, but know going into it that you’ve got a long road ahead and might have to deal with some issues along the way.","May 10","true","262.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It's got all that mob grinding we love in a Korean MMO, a fun, great looking art style, plus plenty of quests that you can get lost in for hours. Oh and quick FYI, the music in this game is pretty fantastic.\n\nIt's got some "americanized" ideas implemented, like EXP cards, that you earn throughout questing that give you boosts of exp throughout your whole leveling process, if you choose to do the quests along side your grinding.  Some of you hardcore grinders might like to grind mobs all the way to the top and this is possible with plenty of places to grind. I like to pickup quests and complete all the zones as I grind my way through because of the Collections and Adventure Journal features that earn you small perks along the way, if that's your thing. Side note... another thing I love is that the Collections are shared amongst all your characters server wide. So you are always working towards completing them no matter what character you are playing on.  The current max level in English version (aka iTOS) is 280.\n\nThere are currently 4 base classes being Archer, Cleric, Swordsman, and Wizard. From there you can build many different types of characters with around 80 total classes that have their own skills and abilities.  At the time of this writing, each character consists of 7 total ranks and at each rank you choose one of these many classes to add more abilities to your build as you progress. You will want to do a bit of planning on your build before you start getting too far into the game because once you pick a class you are unable to reverse that decision. There are Skill reset(class ability points) and Stat reset (STR, CON, INT, SPR, DEX) potions in the game but they are not available unless you use the microtransaction cash shop or received a Founder's pack before the official release. Also, they only reset your points allocated. Once again, you can NOT reset your classes once chosen. So research a bit and choose wisely! There are some great tools on Fan Base sites that can help guide you in the right directions. Whether you want to see what the current top cookie cutter builds are or make up your own awesome and unique build, its all possible.\n\nThe cash shop in Tree of Savior uses a currency called TP.  TP will get you things like Tokens, EXP Boost Tomes, Skill reset potions, warp scrolls to get you back to town, etc. Along with cosmetic vanity type items like hairstyles and clothing for your character.\n\nA fun note, in TOS they require the use of an item "Megaphone" to be able to use the /yell chat channel. Megaphones are ONLY accessable on the cash shop for TP.  This seemed weird to me at first but its actually a decent idea to help reduce the gold selling spam bots and lets you decide if that /yell you want to spam is worth the 1TP. The megaphones are 1 TP which means you can easily buy 5 a day when you need to burn your free TP that you earn slowly overtime. Free TP maxes out at 5 and then stops earning so you need to spend it to reset it.  Personally Ive been using TP from my Founder packs and then the  free 5TP to buy a EXP tome per day. It allows me to purchase a Tome for 4 TP instead of the full price of 9 TP. It's not bad for 1HR of 30% xp boost.\n\nYou CAN NOT trade in game currency between players, that includes your own characters. Each of your characters has their own silver.  Though you still see people spamming for trades using other items as currency like Talt (an ore earned from loot boxes on world bosses and dungeons). Talt venders for 5k to venders so its a stable 5k silver coin.\n\nTokens are Tree of Savior's version of that usual F2P "Premium Status".  They give you 30 days of Token user Status which allows you to do things like using the Auction House with less restrictions, less trading restrictions, 30% xp boost, and gain an extra dungeon entry before your daily lockout among other things.  You can still play "F2P" without Token status, you will decide.  Personally I wouldn't play without it.\n\nBTW, I've only been checking out the PvE aspect of the game so far because that's what I truly enjoy.  There is PvP with guild vs, guild and arenas are comming soon. Guilds can declare war on each other making it open pvp season between characters in those guilds.\n\nSo far, as of this writing on May 14th, 2016, I am very much enjoying this game. I've been playing for 15days and have invested about 160 hours.  There is so much to do especially if you are interested in playing around with different classes and experimenting with different builds.\n\nIf you enjoy the Korean MMO style grinding then you should definitely check out this game.","May 13","true","176.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

This is misleading.  The tokens that give your account premium for 30 days are purchasable through the Auction House in game and are extremely affordable currently.\n\nThe Current Cost of a monthly premium token on the Auction House : 500k\n\nThe problem arises in that there are still restrictions even with the monthly token.\nAre they annoying, yes.  Will it cost you money to unlock premium?  Not at all.\n\nServer Maintenance/Lag Issues\nI've been playing MMO's long enough to know that stepping into the grind day one is not the wisest decision.  Every night I receive several rewards in game, and problems get fixed.  It happens.  Personally the biggest problems that friends and myself have encountered so far have already been fixed, but there are some issues that absolutely need to be fixed in the near future, and that I have no doubt will be.  Nothing I would consider game breaking.\n\nSide Note : they have also added two new brand new servers for different world locations since release.  Work is getting done.\n\nDisappointing?  Yes.\nOverall?  Expected.\n\nA Warning to New Players\nDo not start in Orsha.  No matter what.\n\nI'll be blatently clear about this, This area is unfinished, unpolished, and requires a steadily more intense amount of grind, even including an area from 40-60 where there just simply seems to be zero quests, and nothing to help push you through.  Start in Klaipeda.  The storyline is well polished, satisfying, has many more rewards than the Orsha side, and doesn't brick wall you on your quest to level 300 nearly as often.  Do not confuse this with the server also named Orsha,  I am strictly speaking of the starting city options during character select.\n\nPerformance\n1. The client needs to be restarted entirely every few hours, I would say 4 is a nice round number to be safe.  Load times can significantly increase as memory does ableit slowly.\n\n2. The game crashes sometimes.  Thankfully it takes a whopping 4 seconds to boot to menu.\n\n3. I get consistantly excellent frames 30-80 during game, and unlike most modern games, your frames do not directly impact the visual appeal or performance of this game in any fundamental way.  It is however extremely noticeable in cities where population can be absurdly high at times.\n\n4.  No matter how hard my internet chokes, burps, deflates, or otherwise acts up, I stay connected to the game and can resume my gameplay without being punished for it. (This may mean a lot to some of you, I thought you should know.)\n\nCurrent State of the Game/My personal Review\nThis game is a diamond in the rough.  It's a beautiful, and sometimes brutally charming isometric styled grind em up that wants to be played.  The controller support is excellent, my couch can attest to that, And I don't have to think too much about what I'm doing.  I just like to sit back and explode all the things, and so far I keep getting rewarded for my behaviour and I can appreciate that in a game.  I keep getting these deep Diablo feels, and the game keeps reminding me of its FFT/RO inspirations.\n\nThe game is unfinished, put simply.  But I don't seem to mind.  I've been disappointed, engaged, surprised, I've muted the music only to unmute it later, finding that I enjoyed it in the backround.  I've raised a pet by force feeding it silver until it now succesfully headbutts things at the speed of smell.   Ultimately there's a lot I would do to change this game to what I want it to be.  But it's not my game, I'm just here to play it.  And I've been enjoying that so far.\n\nFor all my disappointment in it not being the next Tactics Game, It does a lot of things right.  And it keeps it simple, from the gui and large easy to read buttons, to the immediateness of slapping a controller in my palm and booting the game up in just a few seconds.  It's more of a sequal to Maple Story, minus the socialite nonsense.  You just get to look cool, be what you want to be, and kill thousands of monsters.  And that's just what I signed up for.","April 4","true","86.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Free to Play, Pay to Play, Subscription.  After all, would you spend cash for top of the line server gear if the servers are only going to be under this amount of stress for a Month or two, when the expected lifespan of any MMO is several YEARS?\n\nAside from a CLEARLY fumbled Founder Launch Period, the main complaint of Pay 2 Win sadly something everyone will make because Dota 2 and TF2 offers so much for free already, because Valve can risk losing a boat load of cash.  Something that reletivily indy crew of IMC just dosn't have, so they need to have some more conventional options in the cash shop that Valve can offer for free.\n\nBest I can say is give Tree of Savior some time after the offical Launch and then jump in.  By then, the majiority of complaints currently being seen will be solved, the servers should be stable, and HOPEFULY something has been done about the ♥♥♥♥EN GOLD SELLERS SPAMMING SHOUT CHAT!","April 4","true","174.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zastier/recommended/372000/","Zastier","Zastier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zastier/","274 products in account","[This review is from the first 3 hours of the game at level 20 and will more than likely be updated as I get further into the game]\n\nI have went into this one with very few expectations. Not really knowing much about the game, seeing the negative reviews and seeing as the publishers completely screw the pre-order business model up, my hopes for the game were not all that high. Luckily, so far I am yet to run into a blatant intrusion into my gameplay sourced from the cash shop in the game.\n\n[STORY]\nI will be honest, while I tried following the story at the start, I rapidly ended up going back to just skipping over NPC text. As far as I can tell, the basic premise if that godesses that were once responding to the prayers of man kind went silent and distasters began to strike the world. While the premise of potentially interesting, I found that the presentation of the story wasn't the most engaging, but that could be just me.\n\n[COMBAT]\nMoving onto what is probably the most important aspect of the game, the combat is not the best. Controlls involve moving around with arrow keys/mouse/controller and using a key to do a basic attack, pressing another key to jump. Additionally, each class gets skills to use in combat that can be used from the action bar. Early on, the combat feels really repetitive and perhaps not as engaging as it should be. I can imagine that gaining more skills as you progress would probably alleviate this issue somewhat, however I am not 100% sure on how much more interesting this combat system could get.\n\n[QUESTING]\nQuesting in the game so far was simple, talk to this NPC, go to this location, do this thing the NPC asked you to do. One aspect I did enjoy about questing however was the fact that most quests are hidden encouraging exploration and engaging with NPCs to find side quests.\n\n[PROGRESSION]\nThis is by far my favourite bit of the game, the character progression is quite nicely done. At the start, you choose one of 4 classes, then when you are actually in the game, your progression is separated into two halves. Firstly, there is your chaarcter level which detemines your basic stats such as strenght or constitution. Then you have your Class progression which is how you advance your class and learn more skills. Every 15 class levels, you get the ability to advance your character by either developing your last chosen class, or choosing one of the two additional classes you get every 15 levels. This creates some really incredible customisation options and it's probably one of my favourite progression systems for a game of this type.\n\n[GRAPHICS]\nThis is an interesting one as this game provides a very quite unique artsyle with a very charming asthetic. The game has a very old feel to it, however it looks as a fairly recent game. The stylistic choice to provide simpler animations, less complex feeling world while including a lot of detail into the design creates a very memorable feel to the game.\n\n[AUDIO]\nSimilarily to the graphics, the audio used in this game is fairly unique. The tracks used for the game have a somewhat classical vibe to them, however they are much more lively, sounding like something that would play at a disco, mixed with something that would be played during an epic, fantastical adventure.\n\nIn conclussion, I think this game is definitly worth a go, in the end, its free and in many aspects, quite well done.","May 10","true","17.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

There are multiple ways to build your characters and lots of exploration. While the story quests do seem linear, there are plenty of other things to do in the game and additional content is still under development. Definitely very enjoyable with friends but you can play it solo just fine as well.\n\nSome things could be done better. The restrictions on trade have made the market virtually unusable. There are so many RMT spam in chat, lag, and other general issues that all MMO’s faces. There should be more channels in the higher level maps as the initial group is now pushing through. Some quests don’t work, but I suspect it’s the lag which should lighten up in a few weeks.\n\nWord of advice, this game is a VERY EXTENSIVE and you need to do some research before jumping in. It’s not something you pick up and go. Find some guides, figure out the class system/builds, look into the token system, read the developers announcements, etc.  Buy the early access packages only if you’re willing to support the developers because face it, you will be dealing with queues/lag/errors until IMC make proper adjustments before it’s finally release to the public.\n\nA select few are still going to cry over everything. IMC has been VERY accommodating to the community with all the complaints and whiners. They do listen to the community and make appropriate changes. Please don’t take it for granted. Give them time to sort out any issues and figure out a solution that satisfies the majority.\n\nOverall, it’s a fun game with common MMO issues. Once IMC fixes it and find the middle ground with the community, people can finally settle down and just ENJOY the game already. Jeez.\n","April 2","true","437.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I was relatively excited about Tree of Savior's release and settled on the idea of purchasing early access. Initially I figured the server might not be as stable because I opted to play earlier. It was to be expected that there would be lag or the occasional glitched quest. I believe Tree of Savior is a brilliant idea and overall a good game.\n\nI enjoyed the soundtrack and the new controls were an interesting twist from what I was accustomed to when I played RO. Of course, there are some changes I felt were odd, but nonetheless I thought the changes from RO to ToS were innovative. Also, I understand that despite who was behind the development of ToS that I would not be able to duplicate the same feelings I had when I played RO with friends; it is a different experience, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

From the same director as Ragnarok (2002), it has the same soul, but is modern. Relationship is very much like between Half Life and Half Life 2, in that the new game doesn't fail to preserve what made the first one so good while impressing you with what you didn't know it could be.\n\nBasically, I'll bet my nuts you'll love this if you loved Ragnarok, or even if you like kawaii ♥♥♥♥ in general.\n\nWhat bothers me is, a lot of people who downvote this game actually love it, but very selfishly (else they wouldn't care to write an angry essay for their $10 spent (or would they?)). Generally, they are missing one of two points:\n\nMaintaining an MMO is expensive; it needs to be paid for one way or the other. If you can't afford $50 on a game that you love, then you should probably be making money instead (if you're too young to, then I'm genuinely sorry for you).\n\nMMOs are pretty much always overwhelmed on their first weeks of service with load issues and bugs. For those who don't realize how stressful it is to fix piles of bugs in a production environment: it's like fixing a car that's currently running at 60mph and you're sitting on top of. It gets much harder to work if you can't maintain peace of mind because crowds are yelling "♥♥♥♥ NO WORK" and you're pressed for time as if you're defusing a gas bomb that has already exploded and is currently killing people with gas leaking all over.

You loved RO's 2D sprite/3D world art and general art style\n2. Enjoy top-down camera view action RPGs (D3)\n3. Love deep customization for RPG classes and/or love deep class and subclassing trees\n4. Are ok with the typical grind associated to most Korean MMORPGs and typical slew of fetch quests\n5. Like anime\n6. Hated RO2\n7. Are looking for an MMO with interesting and unique game mechanics in the rpg classes (most of the cool ideas are in the deeper, advanced classes obtained later in the game)\n\nImpressions from CBT:\n\nOverview:\nThis rpg is like Ragnarok Online, 2D sprites with a 3D world; camera is top-down angled view centered on your character similar to other action RPGs (Diablo 2/3, Dragon Age).\n\nCombat:\nTab targeting system for PvP/PvE with a few aoe/ground-targeting abilities. Bonus % modifiers to exp when partying; Party up to 5. Loot options available while in party. Death penalty is item durability loss for both weapons and armor. (eventually up to zero durability (items cannot break imo)). Durability can be repaired via NPC or other players with the right economy class skills. Quests can be shared/completed with party. Raids/Dungeons exist.\n\nSocial:\nTypical social features including emotes, chat, party creation, whispering, announcements via megaphone item to scrolling marqee at the top of the UI.\n\nWorld:\nNot seamless world; hybrid combination of party-instanced areas and server-instanced areas connected by portals. Upon entering a portal, there the next area will load with a splash screen during loading. There are dynamically instanced channels depending on server capacity and population per each instanced area in the RPG world.\n\nClasses and Persistent States:\nAll classes have an associated skill tree and branch from 4 base classes: Swordsman, Cleric, Mage, Archer. Leveling gives you stat points and skill points. Upon reaching key milestone levels, you have the option to either:\n\n1. Unlock new skill trees/subclasses related to the initial base class you chose to be.\n2. Choose to 'upgrade' a skill tree you have previously unlocked, in order to put more skill points into existing skills; thus making those skills stronger/more potent.\n\nIn short; having chosen a base class, you can either become a jack of all trades/swiss army knife, or a master in a particular specialization. 6 primary stats govern several other derived stats; not too simple nor complex and more info can be found on their wiki.\n\nPets/Mounts:\nThere are a few classes that can mount; 3? Pets (as of CBT) can be used to assist you in your adventures. Pets gain levels and need to be maintained (fed, taken care of) and have a relationship rating per created character.\n\nAccount:\nMultiple characters are allowed per account. Pets are shared at the account level between characters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Moonspeak/recommended/372000/","Moonspeak","Moonspeak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Moonspeak/","195 products in account","I almost didn't try Tree of Savior due to the massive complaints, but so far I feel they are all unfounded. If you're looking for a game that is like Ragnarok Online, only new and improved, look no further. The art, music, playstyle customization, and general gameplay is amazing.\n\nFor those who are looking for more information about the general complaints, I've argued against them below, and will update my review as I continue to play.\n___________________\nCurrent Level: 179\n---------------------------------\nThe Debate:\n\n"The game is extremely grindy"\n\nRebuttal:\nSo far, I have only done quests and dungeons, and have never at any point had to resort to mindlessly killing creatures to level. The quests are moderately innovative. While many quests are simply kill quests, others involve things such as disguising yourself as monsters to lure other monsters to their death. Dungeons are similar to other modern MMOs, in that they are instanced, and are queued through a party finder. I would argue that this is far less of a grind than any other Asian MMO.\n\nEDIT: It should be metioned, that when you start the game you choose to start in one of two cities. If you find yourself out of quests, you simply go to the other city and follow the quest chain there. I have heard however, that a wall appears in the mid-100s where there are insufficient quests and grinding becomes necessary. More on this when I hit it, if I hit it.\n\n"The storyline is terrible"\n\nRebuttal:\nAlthough it is in no way unique, the storyline isn't terrible. I've found myself actually reading the text more often than I have in other games. Rather than droning on and on and forcing the story down your throat, ToS delivers the story in short succinct dialogues, which I find far preferable to having to read about every NPC's life story.\n\n"The gameplay sucks"\n\nRebuttal:\nThe class variety of ToS is amazing, and allows you to change your class every 15 class levels. Instead of changing your class you can rank it up, to a maximum of rank 3. You retain your class skills every time you change classes, and thus your character becomes a specific blend of what classes you choose to fit your play style. This allows for an immense amount of customization: from your chosen classes, to which skills you decide to invest in within these classes. The gameplay is fluid and engaging, and lets the player create interesting combinations that other people may not have come up with.\n\n\n"Everything is locked behind a pay wall"\n\nRebuttal:\nAlthough the game requires the premium token to utilize numerous functions, the premium token is tradable, and can be purchased from the auction house using in game currency. Premium tokens last for 30 days, and are the only necessary purchase to unlock all of the features of the game. In a way then, this game functions as a subscription game, that can still be played while not subscribed, at the cost of features until a token is purchased using real or in game currency.\n\nEDIT: 4/11 ToS has issued a statement that due to the overwhelming outcry against trade restrictions to non-premium characters, they are actively working to create a system that will allow for trade for non-premium members. They also are working on a bot/gold-farmer report option to help circumvent current issues.\n\n"The game is full of bugs and lag"\n\nRebuttal:\nI have encountered very few bugs so far, and I honestly wouldn't expect any MMO to be completely bug-free. There are however, issues with lag, and the game seems to devour computer resources in ways it should not. The launch was only a week ago however, and there is plenty of time for the developers to fix these key issues.\n\n\nOVERALL: Tree of Savior brings to the table something that feels a lot like Ragnarok Online, only far more refined. The art and music are excellent, and the storyline pulls the player through the game rather than leaving them grinding on the same mobs for hours. The class system allows for an immense level of playstyle customization, and gives each player an individual experience. Although the game virtually demands subscription in the form of premium tokens, paying real money for these becomes less essential in the long run.","April 9","true","228.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Though the game does vastly limit person to person trading on non-premium accounts (aka: f2p players), I've had no issue thus far playing as a non-premium player.  They seem to have balanced the game and its item drops in a way that supports a solo-player's lifestyle.  Even players who cannot trade with others outside of the marketplace are capable of advancing without much issue.\n\nLike their initial plans to have a 3 month early access period (which they changed for the better due to player feedback), I expect much to change in the coming weeks to remedy many of these problems.  Should I be wrong and nothing changes with the "p2w" aspects of the "required" premium membership, the game still has a compelling story, absolutely wonderful and imersive music (SoundTeMP alone make this game a 10/10 for me personally...), and the ability to play solo using only the self-found gear made available.

The trade restriction is probably the actual worst problem with the game, but its not game breaking, for me at least.\n\nI'd say give the game a chance for at least a week, and see how you feel then. Perhaps wait til the game is free to play if you are worried about any of the server issues that are being discussed in other comments.

But here goes:\n\nThe game is, despite the staggering amount of people throwing down 10 dollary-doos or more, a work in progress. We got in early to both actually play the game and to see if IMC can handle the numbers we're currently throwing at thim. Needless to say, its been...rocky. CommanderLoadFail and his gang have not been kind to us but given past experiences, what MMO has had a flawless launch? Not too many.\n\nStill with little than less of a month left to go IMC has been dealing with the rampant issue of RMTs, Bots, and possibly the developer's curse of fixing 1 bug and spawning 99 others in its place. As a player I'm generally patient, I don't entirely understand or pretend to know the inner workings of a company when it comes to managing an MMO, so I put my hopes in the team to know what they're doing and not entitle myself to anything. I don't particularly hold this game up to other standards as, again, experience has shown me that I can't expect Game Y to be like Game X, otherwise why not play Game X.\n\nGive this a shot if you have money to spare, if you don't then feel free to wait until Free to Play to give it a dip, Tree of Savior's experience is reminiscent of Ragnarok Online and hitherto vastly different from the MMOs in the current market. Which may in fact be one of the factors that drew so many into this game.\n\nJust keep in mind that it's early access, it basically means an open beta so you're bound to see bugs galore and run into trouble every once in a while.","April 11","true","257.1"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

Every item on the market, including cash items worth ~$18 each, all disappeared into thin air. Talking to NPCs or other quest objects, pressing the button for a regular auto attack, switching equipment, leveling stats or skills, and changing key binds can all be delayed for minutes at a time due to lag.\n\n"Premium" status confers such benefits as:\nEnabling direct trade with other players, excluding in-game currency, where items permanently lose upgrade potential when exchanged.\nThe ability to list more than 1 item on the market at a time, which also reduces upgrade potential, and not losing 30% of the sale price to tax. You still have to wait 48 hours to retrieve your earnings, however.\nIncreased character movement speed.\nAccount-wide storage access.\n3 global dungeon runs per day, rather than 2, as well as an extra chance to re-roll boss loot.\n\nThe cash shop includes an item that adds a random amount of random stats randomly between certain values to otherwise cosmetic accessories, set at a price point where free players cannot afford even one per day (nor any amount of time). They can drop one at a time at an extremely low rate from bosses, typically found at the end of limited dungeon runs, to somewhat assuage free players.\n\nExclusive to the international release, the price of certain cash items have been increased, the rate at which players accumulate free cash points has been lowered, the total number of dungeon runs for all players has been reduced, defeating certain bosses grant smaller rewards, some items can no longer be found as loot, several skills have been nerfed compared to the Korean version of the game, and now players' account names must be unique across all servers rather than only exclusive within their own persistent world.\n\nChat is flooded with RMT bots, which still displays in a marquee at the top of the screen, even while blocked, and is not cleared from the chat window unless these features are disabled entirely. Even when hidden, the spam continues to be processed by the client which results in a surprisingly hefty performance hit. More interestingly, the network traffic for chat is sent in plain text, where the timestamp of messages can be altered, causing artificially "later" messages to be forcibly scrolled to every time a newer message arrives underneath.\n\nCharacter customiazation options are barebones, offering 12 hair styles of a fixed color as the only aesthetic change available to players besides their starting class (so no skin or eye color swatches, either). The styles range individually from light to dark, but there is as of yet no way to mix and match between the default styles and colors, not even via the cash shop. A limited set of colors are available as rewards from per-character achievements, and several exclusive styles can be purchased with real money, but it is far from an exhaustive list of all possible combinations. You may never be able to have blonde/brunette/red hair in your preferred style unless it was always that color to begin with.\n\nAt least it isn't RO2.","April 3","true","168.0"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","15","29","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/halcyonTwilight/recommended/372000/","halcyonTwilight","jkc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/halcyonTwilight/","38 products in account","This is a game about the grind. You must feel the grind, live the grind, love the grind. With a current level cap of 250 which will be increased as time goes on, there is a lot of grinding. If you hate running around in circles and killing things for hours on end, then obviously the game isn't for you.\n\nSo what if you do love the grind? Well, Tree of Savior proably still isn't the game for you.\n\nThere is a lot to like in this game. The anime artstyle is beautiful, the combat and movement are crisp and fun, and there are some unique classes with cool skills. But to experience those moments, you'll have to fight through a lot of issues. The most obvious issues are bugs that have persisted through the Korean launch and through various open betas, some of which are completely game-breaking (I'm looking at you CommanderLoadFail). If you manage to avoid the bugs, fret not for the server lag will drop your framerate the moment you run into any decently populated map.\n\nAssuming you overlook the more obvious issues, then you will be annoyed by the less-visible issues. Leveled a character over dozens of hours into through several classes only to realize that the abilities or spells have zero synergy with your build? Sorry, start a new character. Want to know exactly how your spells/abilities will scale with stats? Sorry, deal with the vague tooltips and spell/ability descriptions. Excited that there are over 80 classes in the game? Sorry, a lot of those classes just aren't viable due to balancing issues.\n\nThen we have the issues that are downright hilarious. Without a premium 30 day token, players are limited to ONE market slot to sell items, in addition to waiting 48 HOURS to retrieve money from item(s) sold on the market. Since you rely on money to not only upgrade your equipment but also make sure your spells and abilities scale in the game, it really feels like the developers are giving non-premium players a giant middle finger.\n\nOh, and did I mention that after one of the closed betas the developers took away the ability to buyback items that you may have accidently sold to NPCs? Don't worry though, as the list of items you sold at the bottom of the NPC menus just to taunt you just in case you wanted to be reminded of what bad game design looks like.\n\nEven if you spend the money to skip the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to have an easier experience, there are still things that can't be fixed by real money, like the class balance issues and the unbearable server-side lag. Given the developer's controversial track record in Korea, and how things still aren't fixed despite being relased early in Korea, it's unlikely there will be fixes that the players have been demanding on any reasonable timeframe.\n\nThere is a lot of fun to be had in Tree of Savior, but it is hidden behind a lot of bad game design choices that ultimately sour the gameplay experience. Unless you're just craving something to feed your Ragnorok Online nostalgia or just need a good anime-themed grinder, your time and money probably better spent elsewhere.","April 6","false","55.3"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","15","29","0","0"

I guess the gaming population has become too spoiled that they want to be spoonfed all the time with the features that's only beneficial to them.\n\nToS is a great game. Unlike what other people say, this is nothing like RO - far from it. ToS has an identity of its own but due to tons of existing MMORPGs, definitely some concepts have been embedded on how the game is played (even the skills have some resemblance to existing games). If there's any flaw I see, it would be their servers but I willing to let that go for now since the game has been officially around for less than a month.\n\nObjectively speaking, its lack of 1:1 trade has become a deal breaker to some players but they must understand that until the management has figured out how to fix stabilize the economy naturally (w/c I'm pretty sure they're working on), we should expect stringent rules. So far, IMC has been proactive so I'm not even worried that they won't deliver.

Did CBT and now on OBT.\nTo be honest this is going to be quick and simple  :\nThis game = Grinding. Killing mobs but not like a stupid berserker no like a smart tacticians. Not every map is made for grinding, some are and on those maps spawn is quick on others they aren't for a reason.\nSecond , Grinding, smart grinding. You dont get exp from quest you get card, you are the one to choice WHEN you exp. Are you on a grinding map ? Then no need of those cards. Stay a level or two there.\nAlso to mention : There are gabs of exp need to level. I guess most of people who aren't use to grind a lot will be block on the second gab zone. Lv 85 to 86 Exp needed = 474,895	. To get from 86 to 87 you only need 20,757. See ? Know when to use cards, know when to grind. SmartGrinding. This sh!t is korean don't forget.\nNow that this problem is resolute : LAGS , Yes. Like they said (and this isn't the only time) the last sale day it got really quick. They din't count on that even if they have should. But let them time to cover it up.\nAbout the P2W people are talking about : Dont forget this game is F2P. No money no game. Secondo : In my serv (Orcha) for 500K you can buy a token on market = 1 mounth patrone. Easy. Not easy if you play 2hours/day and if so don't play this game. Next to this the first idea was to avoid bots who is a total faill. If you are a bit infomated about what they do with the community you should know they changed there early access for the community. If community ask at long term i'm sure those things will be no problem. They had to start with something , no ?\nAbout the dungeons : They are caped because you win Talt , Talt is some sh!t you use for guild (i dint have a guild yet so im not sure about what it does) and next to that those are really good grinding zones. Going in a duo (if you can) is a nice place for some easy lvling (exept the lv90 no good exp if i remember good)\nVoilà most of topics i saw god a honest long player view. I LOVE this game i dreamd about a game who would include a class system like this. And i hope people will understant the game launched bearly a week ago and IMC is listening. Give them time !\nCheers.","April 3","true","708.4"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","18","35","0","0"

This game completely goes back to the roots and doesn't penalize you for grouping.\n\nGive IMC some time to work out the kinks, so far all I've seen on the ToS forums are people that truely love this game and want to see it become there go to MMO.

It does have an old timey RO feel to it. And I enjoy the class systems. (a lot of people want to min max really hard). I enjoy playing with friends and having an overall good time. I like the item potential system, instead of having your item just break as soon as you upgrade it you have a cushion to still have it when it becomes low.\n\ncons: this game at times has a terrible community at times and there are some issues that can and will be worked out like the server.\n\nPeople tend to feel very entitled and want everything handed to them. Some don't read or research properly. And while the game will have ups and downs, it'll most likely be fixed in time. They will release more servers when the game offically comes out.","March 31","true","301.1"," 34 of 67 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","34","67","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tivvv3/recommended/372000/","tivvv3","Tivan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tivvv3/","19 products in account","First the bad:\nNetcode is generic and does cause framerate to stop on server lag. Mildly jarring.\nPremium service users get more dungeon runs per day, not just more xp. Pretty random. More on the issues with this later.\nCan sell 1 item a day, but at least you can sell items at all. (Maybe raise to 5, given premium users can sell 10 now.)\nFee of 30% for selling is also pretty high, but not out of this world, especially since ToS doesn't seem to emphasize crafting like Blade and Soul did (which adequately gave people 10, premium people 20, sells per day. Given how important crafting was there. ToS might be fine with less.). It is quite random that premium users pay less than a third of the fee, though. Leaves a bad taste with me.\nShared storage between characters added as a an afterthought to premium users. Either have it or don't have it, imo.\nThe neutral:\nLike most recent MMOs, there's an emphasis on completing quests to progress, over the classic grind. Can't say that I like this (I prefer the model proposed by games such as Phantasy Star Online or Universe, making people go, as team or alone, through maps, without respawns. Kinda like if the dungeon system was designed to be the main thing people do in the game. Not the bland thing it is right now.), but it could be worse. Just means you will be re-playing the same story over and over and over with new characters. (On that note, please, PLEASE, make cutscenes skipable)\nThe positive tradeoff is that you can progress pretty fast if you spend your attention on accepting and doing quests. (Outside of dungeons to grind when they come up, because good XP. Here's where I feel giving premium users more runs AND increased XP from killing monsters is just unreasonable.)\nThe good:\nIt's a fun game\nFun Gameplay\nEnough depth to keep you interested in experimenting with new classes and builds.\nOverall, I would recommend this game, because games are about gaming. Not about how much the people in charge have issues with making monetization not a pain. And it could be far worse, so still, give them some credit.","April 26","true","99.1"," 41 of 81 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","41","81","2","1"

They had a maintenance period today (04/01) and said that they added servers but nothing changed. The dungeons wont even let me in, the party finder function just kicks me out to the character selection screen AFTER waiting for a party and I even get kicked out with a pre-made group.  The game is pretty linear so when I can't enter a dungeon I can't progress!!\n\nIt is the first week of the game, but damn.. Can't they estimate how many players are going to start?\n\nThe mobs spawn in waves, and waiting for a monster in a full map is just not fun.

It's a fun, rewarding gaming experience with some bot/gold spammers issues that are steadily being dealt with. Casual players in particular may enjoy ToS because it's by no means a “hard” game.\n\nLong version\n\nPositives:\n1) Fun gameplay\n2) Cute (shallow but idgaf)\n3) Customizable class system\n4) Lag isn't as bad as people say (I'm at a steady 60fps, rarely lag, only had one crazy experience of warping into a completely empty dungeon where my character could fly)\n5) Grinding isn't physically/emotionally painful until you hit way higher levels. Casual players can get a sense of satisfaction that encourages them to stick around longer— (and in turn that's good for the future of the game)\n\nNegatives\n\n1) Community sucks right now. Full of noobs and bots kill stealing in the early dungeons. I've met some super nice people, but overall morons are in the majority.\n2) Gold spammers! It's so blatant.\n3) BOTS. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bots being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nuisance.\n\n2 and 3 are my main grievances. Spamming/botting is rampant to the point of being intrusive. Ignoring bots is nearly impossible. As soon as I log in my first task is to walk around reporting spammers and botters.\n\nHowever, response time has improved now that f2p hit. I can only hope the efficiency of the crack down on bots only goes up from here.\n\n(And for my shallow negative: 4) I can't buy male character clothing for my female characters and vice-versa; please let me crossdress my characters!

If you were a fan of Maplestory you'll probabaly like this game.\nWhen you unlock a new skill, you feel the wonder, the excitement of trying it out and seeing what other class skills you can mix to make crazy COMBOS. (Playing with friends is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED imo) For example, having the Peltasta Class (Swordsmen) Provoking all enemies around + the Wizard's AOE skills helps demolish mobs in a party.\nWhen i'm playing this game not only am I grinding it out with one character, I get excited to try other classes and see what those jobs branch out to-- and the WORLD IS HUGE! The World feels big and maps have regions, and continents and so and so forth (You get the idea) BIG WORLD, LOTS OF QUESTS, LOTS OF GRINDING AND BOSS FIGHTS\n\n\n(QUESTING / EXPLORING)\n\nThere are literally thousands of things to do in this game and they reward you for doing the little things, like exploring and collecting all the material items-- that you can exhange for some permanent boosts to your character (Just little things like +100HP for example) and everything you do feels deserved. It can be long, but that's what I'm looking for in a game. A F2P Game that I can lose myself in for hours upon hours. Be sure to talk to EVERY NPC! Usually any NPC out in the wild gives about 2-4 quests alone, lots of EXP to help you get along and stay standard / overleveled against mobs. As I said before the map is very big, and with that means more regions, NPS, quests.\n\n\n(ITEMS / GEAR)\n\nItems draws are good, things are good right now I defintely don't feel a P2W aspect at all to this game. However you can buy hourly experience scrolls using money, but it won't make much difference (It's only +30%). You can get great gear already by finishing up quests. And from my experience already it seems that you can get the "PAID GEAR" by going to the marketplace for dishing out some HARD EARNED SILVER. So if you really like to grind GET READY!\n\n\n(DESIGN / GRAPHICS)\n\nThe UI is very clean (Almost reminds me of some LEVEL 5 games UI-- S/O to Ni No Kuni, etc etc). Has the anime ispired characters look down. Wish they wouldve gave more customization with it but eventually there will be more head accessories / costumes that you can wear to distinct yourself from the others. It has a nice blend of 2D / 3D models and unique class skills that gives it the proper atmospheric feel they are trying to convey to you. Overall, very clean, accessible, and should be able to run on MOST COMPUTERS. Even my computer is low-end and I run things smoothly 40-50 FPS. (Low-End Mode helps A LOT! And i dont see much of a graphical difference)\n\n\nOVERALL: 9 out of 10\n\nNow don't bash me for giving out the score just because the servers at launch were bad! I want to raise awareness for this game because it's very good! Everything is smooth, fair, and you get a quality game that I'd say is worth $60+ EASY as a F2P! Love this game, I can see the potential and after launch theres only room for growth-- which will then swallow my wallet because  COZZMETICCKKKS","March 30","true","74.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

Tree of Savior is very similar, and even improves on a lot of RO's good ideas.\n\nIf you never played RO and are curious about ToS, here are the basics: Tree of Savior is a Korean MMO and spiritual successor to the aforementioned Ragnarok Online. It has a anime inspired 2D on 3D artstyle. It looks very good as you can see in the trailer. It is an Action RPG, most closely comparable to something like Diablo. You will either be blowing up large groups of enemies with AoEs, or focusing down one powerful enemy with more strategic single target attacks. They recommend joypad for the best experience, I've just been using keyboard and haven't had any issues.\n\nThe game has a very linear quest structure, which makes leveling go by very quickly. The game has a very complex Job system. Every 20-30 levels you will change classes and gain new skills. There are four starting classes, but near infinite possiblities built into each, complemented by the fact that you can build your stats in any way you like as well.\n\nIt has all of the modern MMO amenities you would expect: auction house, guilds, instances. I haven't had time to try all of these things, but I did do one instance and it was very pretty fun. The game is packed full of unique features I haven't seen in other MMOs, so if you're someone looking to just try something new you might enjoy Tree of Savior. It's only $10 for early access, and will be free soon.\n\nI must warn you though, the game is a bit of a mess at the moment. Server issues, overpopulation, crashing. Its gotten much better in the past week or so but even if you are starting now expect some issues. I hope they get these problems sorted out before the game goes free to play or it will just get worse. Also be warned that many features are locked to premium members only, which requires real money. Things like trading, selling more than one item on the auction house, and learning multiple skills at the same time. These things are in place to counter Gold sellers, but it is really just punishing the players. I hope they reconsider some of these choices.\n\nDespite these issues the game itself is a ton of fun, highly recommended.","April 7","true","39.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you like kawai design class building grinding and hack and slash games you will enjoy tree of savior. Classes are all verry different , the spells are unique and fun to use ( Carve statues , walk on a snowball etc).\n\nThe negative reviews are due to a poor optimisation and a lot of problems/bugs at the moment. But once again this has nothing to do with the game itself. Once problems will get fixed and thing stabilised the game will kick asses.\n\nWhen you want to buy or invest time on a game , you want it to be great , Tree of savior is great. Servers and bug are not. But things can be fixed and will be fixed.\n\nTo finish this , I wont recommend this game if you dont have time to invest on it. It's a korean MMORPG , you will have to grind (kill a lot of monsters) to get lvls and you will have to play a lot to reach max lvl. Devs are working on a PVP system like Ragnarok online WOE (some poeple are talking about MOBA style PVP ) wich can bring strategy in the pvp.\n\nBasicly if they managed to create a great PVP mod and balance classes in pvp (this is a huge job) the game will be 10/10 for me.\n\n","April 3","true","412.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game offers keyboard, controller, or mouse gameplay and the mouse is wonky. It really shouldn't be an option as there are many issues with walking on certain maps.\n\nThe second would be not getting a reward after turning in a quest. After doing multiple quests with my friends and boyfriend, I was the only one who didn't receive my reward and that was it. The quest acted as if I turned it in, so I know I didn't just "abandon" it, and I was able to move onto the other ones WITHOUT a reward. Yeah pretty obnoxious.\n\nLag lag lag lag lag. My god is the lag in this game unreal. I have played plenty of MMO's, and I've never experienced lag like this game provides.\nWhich leads to positioning lag. Basically your character is in the middle of the map, then BAM you're back at the beginning. Absolutely infuriating to deal with.\n\nI guess this is supposed to be a grinding game similar to RO, but good luck finding a map with any monsters on it. Some areas are completely void of any monsters whatsoever, and it's even worse when there's a quest circle above said area. And if you DO find a great spot, enjoy battling the multiple bots on the map who will just KS your mob and you'll lose everything to them cause they're always 30+ levels above and mob drops/exp are based on who did the most damage. And you may think "oh I'll just change channels!", nope won't work because there will be bots on that channel too. Plus as the maps get harder with higher lvl monsters, there's less and less channels to change to.\n\nFor some reason, IMC decided that restricting trades and the marketboard would get rid of the bots but it only hurt actual players; unless you pay for a token to trade 30 times a month. It's just crazy because this is an MMO, what MMO doesn't allow trading between players for multiple days unless you buy a token? Apparently this one. We shouldn't have to pay for BASIC functions of a game, that is crazy.\n\nI'm just annoyed and sad because as someone who played RO for many years, I was hoping this would finally be the MMO to replace it, but thanks to Nexon's sister company IMC, this game is already falling apart due to their carelessness and restrictions that ONLY hurt actual players and not the bots/gold bots.","May 23","false","83.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Can't trade cash shop items between characters, or even silver?) and severe optimization issues/lag... it's not something I can recommend to others.\n\nThat said, I sincerely hope that these issues are addressed in time, because right now I get the impression that the game is simply bleeding players at a fast rate (at least the amount of people you see in otherwise popular spots in the EU server has dramatically decreased).","May 24","false","68.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

With the exception of a few, I'd seriously buy this game's album and not regret it.\nVery intuitive class creation system. Not every mix-matched build or combination will work, but it helps create varied builds between people and freshness when it comes to creating multiple characters.\nGreat visuals. The game knows tone, and knows when to be happy and prideful, or dark and borderline ambient.\nWhile others may disagree, I like the story, though it isn't magnificently written. This game gets dark, and there will be more times when you can't save others from meeting demise.\nAside from hiccups, the controls are very concise and the game allows multiple interfaces to play it: (Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepads.)\n\nCons!\nGame is fairly buggy. As of now, some skills and attack may register odd not due to lag, but the nature of the attack itself.\nAs expected for a global/international game, there is lag. But it is much more than you expect.\nOptimization of game is fairly poor. My computer's rig isn't powerful, but it's been known that the game runs on a single core within your computer, so performance is certainly lacking.\nCharacter Customization is fairly lacking thus far. I expect this to be adressed in the future as this isn't a hard thing to fix with time.\nThe game has a fair amount of linear gameplay, but at the same time one doesn't have to level up the same as others. It's not a sandbox, it is a grinder.\n\nAll in all, if you particularly grind based games, I recommend giving it a try and seeing if you like it. It is not for everyone, but for those who end up liking it will get hooked as the core of the game is honestly FANTASTIC. Right now though, lag and bugs may hinder gaming experience. Try it, and support it if you can. This game is not perfect, but it is great and a brilliant way to shine some light on this stale MMO market. If you can get friends for the journey, it may also be worth making a group for it.\n\nGood luck, and may the goddesses stay with you.","May 11","true","523.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But I’ve not experience anything close to a deal breaker.\n\nSome people say its alot of grinding but If you complete all quests chains and do you daily dungeons you can get by just fine.\n\nIt is best played with a controller, mouse support has been added later due to community asking for it but it has some problems.\n\nThe combat system uses a lot of ground effect skills, it revolves around positioning your character and the monsters at the right place at the right time. AI is really nothing to be impressed but sometimes the enemies stop before running into your damage area and wait till it dissolves which I find amusing.\n\nA lot of classes to choose from to build your character. You can focus skills to get max impact or spread to get more skills and manage cooldowns.\n\nOn a down side it is really not very challenging.

Now i am happy i didnt. Game has a lot of flaws, most major atm are server issues, euro server is not even that populated and it constantly lags, i am playing archer and i do double dps when it doesnt lag.\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ auction system - you cant buy/sell anything for 72 hours when you start to play, when you finally can start selling tooltips on items you put on auction(average price and stuff) are completely wrong, you need to check every material(and after 72 hours i had about ~90 of them) manually. But that isnt everything, even if you manage to sell something you need to wait 48 hours to get your silver. This makes absolutely no sense to me.\nOther major issue is forced party play. Being in a group gives you more xp then solo. In full group you can get 450% more xp per monster, considering half of the areas are dead/close to dead this makes no sense again. Why should solo gameplay be punished in a grinding game, i have no idea.\nNext issue is dungeon queue. Considering you get even more bonus xp(600%) if you dont make premade group for dungeon, you need to queue for some to get good xp. Well, 99% of the time you just gonna stare at 'Searching for party' window for hours if you have nothing else to do. Also game has no info on dungeon locations, but that is tolerable considering queue mechanic itself. Queue should be long distance and not require you to wait at dungeon entrance, period. Oh and 1 more thing about dungeons, 90% of the time you get nothing, there are total 2(+1 when you get premium token) entrances COMBINED per day. Actually its not that bad since you cant even find group for 1 dungeon, lol.\n\nNow about good stuff, art/locations/quests are actually pretty enjoyable, characters are really cute.\nBut considering party play will probably stay same and I am really not a fan of grinding normal monsters with other people, i have doubts i am gonna enjoy playing this game further.","May 14","false","57.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If you like action-based MMOs, I highly recommend for you to at least try this someday, since it is free now.\n\nI have only played one day, on the day of release so far.\nI've played both keyboard and gamepad mode and both were smooth once you get used to it. I loved how they used the similar gamepad hotkey key-mapping and UI as FFXIV.\n\nThe combat system is really fun to me, it is similar to games like Lunia maybe. It feels kind of like a fusion of Ragnarok Online 1 and Lunia.\nIt's action-based and you can attack while jumping. As a wizard, you can jump, then immediately press attack as you start the jump, and keep repeating this to keep yourself 100% mobile while attacking. This is great for bosses.\nAlso, I only played a few seconds on a brand new swordsman and noticed their normal attack does splash AOE damage to multiple monsters if they're close enough.\n\n---\n\nThe problems I had, and greatly hope they will improve in the future are:\n\n- The restrictive chat system and bot spamming. There is no specific filter/player mute system, so you cannot prevent shouts from appearing in most chat tabs... and the chat history keeps jumping and not scrolling properly from all the bot spam... so you cannot really read what your party/friend is saying.\nThere was a bot in town in the very center, spamming a tower of chat, and you could not see anything behind them. This was very confusing as a newbie, and all I could do was use the "Report" button, but that wouldn't really solve anything if a GM isn't on to kick them right away, unless you're gonna wait however-many days in that spot. I'd much prefer a blacklist/mute option.\nAlso, you cannot say some words which are not particularly bad-words for a T-rated game, such as "yaoi".\n\n- With a gamepad, I could not find any way to switch around the key mapping, only for keyboard keys. So, this means you must use the "X" button on an Xbox 360 controller, to attack. That can be confusing for people who are used to using A or B in other games.\n\n- KSing in areas with few channels. the party system is great though, so send invites to others in your area to work together and share quests. I think this isn't a fault of the management, but just the amount of players from the game just opening for free on the first day. It will calm down later for sure.\n\n---\n\nOverall, I think the good things outshine all of the bad things, except the chat system, since this hinders socializing, which is important to me in online multiplayer games.","May 11","true","139.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","4"

You got a message saying that the Channel is Full? Well, F*CK YOU! You lost your Teleport Scroll and the money you paid for it!"\n\nEasily avoided if the system wasn't f*cking stupid and consume your Scroll when you click to use it and start the Teleport Animation instead of when you finish the Teleport Animation and reach the stupid place you want to be. Or at least give the scroll back when the Channel is Full.\n\n"The Channel is Full."\n\nI don't know what they have in their heads to think that a game based on Channels for EACH MAP would work, when you're on a random map, you're fine, but when you try to enter a City, you can't because all the stupid Channels of the City is Full.\n\nI will not even mention the Lag, the horrible game optimization and the clunky combat system/combat animations, because I will give the benefit of the doubt of the combat being clunky due to the lag.\n\nThis game has a cool Class System (even if I don't like the restriction of only Templars able to create a Guild, I like more restrictions to create a Guild, but Class Lock isn't one of them, and the fact that the game don't have an Assassin class because of the Lore, everyone is a Savior and an Assassin class wouldn't fit in the lore and yadda yadda) and art, but for now, you really should avoid it.","May 13","false","18.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It really had a ton of potential to be a great game. Unfortunately the company running it has caused problems and ruined their own game. The combat style is fun, but allows every player to afk farm certain mobs (due to static respawn points) by simply setting a book on their attack key. There is no forced logouts, which means (you guessed it) bots are RAMPANT. Half the palyers you meet will seemingly teleport around your screen and attack mobs before you can, or you are simply fighting them for spawns. This problem is awful from level 15-40. The bots seem to die off a bit after that, but I haven't made it to max level to see what that is like.\n\nIMC has done NOTHING about their botting problem, nor about the pretty toxic playerbase whom are pretty rude at the best of times, I can only imagine their attitude is due to their profits. Someone is supplying these people with tokens, be it themselves or others, and they are getting paid. The economy is a joke, and the restrictions placed on trading an item or using their auction house are god awful.\n\nI really enjoy their game, but until the botting problems and gold spammer problems are fixed a bit, I can't recommend this game to other people, which is such a shame.\n\nIf you made it this far, I'll share some of the things I love and hate.\n-There is quite a lot to do\n\n-The art and music are AMAZING. Totally my style.\n\n-The combat is fun, but if you lag with a melee class you will be VERY annoyed in short order. (Most of my lag is due to my poor internet connection, not the servers but the punishment from the lag is totally lost melee attacks. Like, I attacked, I saw my character swing his weapon... and NOTHING happens. Unless you attack 2+ times, this will happen with a bad connection and you will almost always lose that first attack.)\n\n-Real-money is the ONLY option for resetting your skills or stat points. This is good because it means your choices matter, but this is really bad because it means new players are required to research everything BEFORE starting the game, or simply picking a cookie-cutter build that walks you through each step.\n\n-Sadly, you are locked into your class choices. If you pick the wrong class, or the class you picked turns out to not be so fun ONE time... Guess what? Better start over. Even if you are level 200 and simply made a bad call or thought something\nworked a different way.\n\n-There are very few resources for information. I know this is due to how new the game is but, ecause of the beta testing, a lot of information you find is old and has since been changed. Even trying to research a good class selection or which stats to pump at max level is next to impossible. Which is why I feel being locked into class choices is such a bad idea.\n","May 13","false","188.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Calling the game "pay to win" after you couldn't get your build correct is not fair. I honestly wish skill reset potions were not an option.\n• Grinding\nIts an MMO, grinding is going to be in the game, that being said the game does a REALLY good job at limiting grinding untill around level 130. The first time I actually grinded in this game was level 130, up untill then smart XP card usage, dungeons (arguably grinding, but not really), and sidequests got me there.\n• Server Lag\nYeah, it can be unbearable at times, though going on lesser populated channels will help this. Hopefully this is adressed in the future.\n• Frame drops\nAgain, what the hell, my 980ti should not be choking in cities. Frames are only an issue in cities or areas with high amount of animiations, and I believe you can turn off animations for others. 98% of the time I had 60+ fps.\nIf you want to play this game, do your damn research to avoid trobles down the road, and if you are skeptical wait untill it's free to play.","April 10","true","62.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game has some huge fundamental problems.\n\nThe game features several different controls depending on how you want to play. It's great that they offer the ability to change on the fly at any point. However, it does come with the problem of things like keyboard prompts appearing while playing with a controller.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather bland. It's slightly more active than a typical M-M-O game, but still lacking. The addition of awful server lag every time I played didn't help in this regard. It always felt like too many people were in a channel even if it displayed the capacity as being on the lower end. Sometimes you would also get thrown into the high capacity ones for seemingly no reason.\n\nTowns have plenty of silver spammers already. The speech bubbles that appear with their world chat spam will cover the UI / menus and be incredibly fustrating to deal with on the first encounter. Thankfully you can turn these global chat bubbles off and save yourself some pain. HOWEVER, the worst part is that the bubbles will actually LAG your game, and what does disabling them do? Only hides them. YOU WILL STILL LAG. I kid you not.\n\nTree of Savior quickly runs out of quests for it's newbies. Around LVL 30 you'll hit a wall of a lack of quest lines in the starting area of your choice. Now you can go to the other starting area and progress through that one as well, but variety is pretty much non-existant as far as I could tell.\n\nThe class system is where the meat of the game is. Plenty of options to choose and pick from.\n\nThe game is free though and worth taking a look if you have the data to spare. Honestly to me it's just another MMORPG to throw in the bucket. I'd recommend Path of Exile if you want deep and complex character builds with RPG elements. It's free to play as well.","May 15","false","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

All games require to kill mobs but BELIEVE ME, I played games where the grind was WAY more serious than the TOS one. (I'll just say Warframe as an example because grind is everything in that game yet I still love it.)\nThis game is really good played with friends too because if you make a party, quests where you have to collect items become much easier but if you play solo EVERY BOSS I encountered so far was perfectly soloable. Maybe it's because I'm a Pyromancer? I don't think so but if you have trouble it's really easy to make a party and find other players. There are always at least 5 parties in the busiest channels and a couple in the less crowded ones.\nAnother great thing is in fact, the CHANNELS because if a channel is too crowded or if you can't find the right mob, you can always change channel and find a less crowded one where monsters will respawn.\nI've heard many people complain about lag but I'm having no problem so far and my PC is kinda old too. If you experience lag you should change some settings, go to a less crowded channel and close unnecessary applications but, seriously, it's a 2D game, if you can't even support this kind of game just go buy a new PC and shut up!\nThere are many interesting mechanics that I still didn't even try yet and the game has just been released so I have faith many good things have yet to come but my overall experience has been extremely positive!\nI've played this game for a whole day and I absolutely did not feel bored! It's been so long since I last played such a good MMO where the atmosphere and mechanics are so smooth you would just play without stop. (GW2 and FFXIV were my latest favourite MMOs)\nI love the fact that there are many subclasses so you can choose your favourite style but BEWARE, the game is not meant for EVERY subclass to be played but instead, it's made so you can create really rounded but specialized characters. You need to decide which classes you want to go for beforehand and you'll find out the gameplay will be very smooth! I was disappointed by this at first because I wanted to play every subclass but then I realized it was absolutely unnecessary because if you take a close look at each class's skills (and NOT ONLY THE ATTIRE because let's be sincere, we all want good looking outfits haha) you'll see you will not want to play every class but instead get better at a couple ones that compliment each other well.\nEveryone has it's own preferred build but you can always create a new one. :)\nAnother thing I love is the fact that you can jump around and some places can be reached only with jumps. The game encourages you to explore all the map to find hidden treasure chests and I think it's amazing because it's not like other games where you could just avoid half of the map and go on. You even have an Adventure Diary (I don't really remember how it's called) that keeps track of everything you did and sometimes you get rewards so everything you do in this game is worth doing!\nI guess the only bad thing about this game are the gold sellers but seriously, EVERY GAME has them so just ignore them or just switch to normal chat so you won't read them.\nAnyway, I seriously recommend everyone to at least TRY THIS GAME and do not be discouraged by the reviews because it really all depends on your tastes! I was discouraged by the reviews but then I tried the game and loved it so you should too! Trust me! :)\n(Besides, I think to better enjoy a game you need to have a bit of fantasy too. If you empathize with your character a bit everything will be more beautiful. If you just call you character "Dumbdog5" and just play to reach endgame and troll people in PvP then of course you won't like the game.)\nSo rembember, TRY FOR YOURSELF, THEN JUDGE!\n\nI hope you found this review useful! Happy gaming! :D","May 15","true","27.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The quests will outlevel you or glitch and tou're forced to stay in particular zones grinding out mobs for 10-20 levels, some of which are being "camped" by 5 person parties. It's easy to get invited to one of these parties but it gets very boring to grind. I can spend hours grinding with no objective and level up several times, and this is just 30-40... there are hundreds of levels. Not to mention leveling up your job as well which is a 15 level grind that is objectively slower than leveling regularly. Once you reach level 50 you can begin doing dungeons, I haven't actually made it to 50 yet. I made it to 40 just doing quests and grinding out level 30-40. If you have that kind of patience, to each his own but I need some faster gratification!\n\nThe game really suffers from FPS problems, the fps meter they conveniently place on the screen shows 60-100fps then quickly dips to 6fps when the screen gets busy. This really sucks because you're consistently grinding, and if you're smart you're in a party which makes the screen busier. The game is very demanding apparantly and I don't think it has much to show for it. I really support the idea behind this game but I thought the execution really needs some work. It's hard to be immersed in your character and creating an alt because that's a million more hours grinding which actually feels hindering.\n","April 2","false","23.6"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","18","36","2","0"

It's still in beta so if enough people speak out their issues with it. Maybe things can change, just like their terrible idea to make a 3 month early access pay wall of $60. Really glad they changed this, it would have set a new precedence for up comming online titles.\n\nMy Pros~\n\n1. Beautiful game, it's not huge on graphics but it's unique art direction felt fresh and different for me.\n2. Interesting classing system, though it kind of lacks in variety whenit comes to unique skills. It still feels solid.\n3. Optional quests that you can complete multipul times for "Greater" rewards.\n4. A unique achievement system that covers defeating every monster, completing a map 100%, and crafting system to list a few.\n\nMy Cons~\n\n1. Poor marketing choices by the Devs, Too many pay walls, they could be making more skins and vanity features to make profits. But instead they bar key game play aspects/features from players by adding pay walls to virtually everything.\n2. Typical fetch/kill quests. Not a huge con, but it's worth mentioning.\n3. The leveling system feels like a joke. You will hit moments where you are forced to grind to get the next quest very early on. And simple mobbing feels like a chore. If you like grinding games, this wont be a issue for you I guess.\n4. Bot Gold Sellers Galore! Even though it's pay to get in right now! GMs seem either asleep or don't care.\n\nOverall I would recommend not buying it. Just wait for release then give it a shot. Game has decent potential, and I'm hopeful... Just it's a really rough start for a game which was trying to sell a $60 entry fee for 3 months early access. Hype was real, but I am disappointed.","April 3","false","16.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The1Flame/recommended/372000/","The1Flame","Velox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The1Flame/","155 products in account","Most of the negative reviews are a direct response from the very dedicated players to the publisher's inexperience at handling the innate problems that come with F2P games (goldsellers, and balancing monitization with actual cash flow and keeping the pay 2 win aspect low) as seen by the high play time on most of the negitive reviews.\n\nCombat is extremly satisfying, and requires quite a bit of thought in larger fights. It's far from the typical tab-target that the screenshots and videos imply.\n\nAt the time of writing this, the pay2win is very low. You have a few restrictions placed on selling things via trading post that can be removed by purchasing a $20 item, which itself can also be purchased on the trading post. There's 3 hat slots that can have stat enchants added to them with scrolls that cost a small amount of premium currency. You passively gain premium currency every day, which caps out at 5. The cap can be temporarly raised to 8 though guild vs guild pvp, allowing you to buy said enchant scrolls. Pre-enchanted gear can be freely bought from other plays on the trading post.\n\nThis game is still absolutly fun to play, and I've definitly gotten more value out of it than the $10 I payed for pre-release access. So far the game seems rather themepark, but questing is incredabily simplified, allowing you to focus solely on the flow of combat or quest mechanics instead of the poorly translated story filler you don't care about. The storyline itself is well spaced out and easy to follow (unlike most other asian MMOs.)\n\n9/10 definitly one of the best early game experiences I've had in an MMO.","April 9","true","294.6"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

I'll let you decide whether these are Pros or Cons.\n\n- Great visuals and artwork. The game looks great!\n\n- Soundtrack is really good and blends well with the game. It can get repetitive on some maps though (some techno/trance songs for example).\n\n- The game is incredible poor optimized. Even with a high end spec the FPS will tank for no apparent reason.\n\n- Despite the Staff already made some modifications to the original F2P plan, non premium players will be heavily restricted on some aspects of the game that really makes no sense (ie cannot share items between own characters/alts, can only post one item on the Auction House).\n\n- Cash shop seems imbalanced and expensive for some items (Token or premium membership cost about U$S 18 a month).\n\n- Combat engine is great, but watered down by skills with really long cooldown and dull enemies.\n\n- Many if not most of the skills scales poorly, rendering them useless in the late game.\n\n- Monsters can cc you for days. There are no diminishing returns on monsters cc.\n\n- There were several issues with the servers since launch. Even though there were some improvements, there are still some problems with the servers (as of 5/6/2016 many SA players cannot even log into the game for example).\n\n- Classes are not really balanced. This could be expected from a game that just released, but after the beta and so much feedback from the users, you would expect a better job from the devs (there were some ninja nerfs that made no sense at all for example).\n\n- Staff handles the communication in a weird way: sometimes they are very vocal about what they are doing, why they are doing it, and so on. Some others they don't say a word for days.\n\n- Monster spawn rate is awful. You have to literally wait for two minutes for each wave of monsters. Also, monsters respawn in the same spot, which translate into parties sitting down on the very same spot por hours, waiting to the mobs to spawn, wiping them out, sitting for two minutes straight and starting all over again.\n\n- The game is extremely linear for the first 200 levels. This is not really a problem for solo players, but after starting for the third of fourth time, it gets really old and boring.\n\n- Social aspect of the game is lacking: this may be for several reasons, but the fact that the game is ridiculously linear makes it hard to party up with friends that fall behind.\n\n- Itemization is lackluster at best. There isn't a big pool of interesting and exiting items to choose from.\n\n- Mouse controls are a nightmare sometimes. It makes you wonder if they actually played and tested the game before release.\n\n- The game provides you with many and very interesting to choose from. However, if you don't do a lot of previous research, you have no way to modify your choice.\n\n\n\nI'm going to leave the bot / RMS spammers out of the list, because they are a plague among ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes these days. However, if this is something that concerns you, please be aware that there are a lot of bots / gold spammers ingame. Like A LOT.\n\nIf you are interested on this game I would recommend until it goes F2P as in its current status I wouldn't say its worth buying. It has a lot of potential, but IMC games needs to start listening to the community feedback if they want this game to survive.","May 6","false","494.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Of course,  A LOT of players had also started at the same time. The volume of players are too much for the servers and you get kicked out once in a while. And logging in takes a lot of time especially if you're the 300th player in the waiting list.\n\nThe lag time was so bad, you can't even talk to the NPCs. I've been clicking a character for five minutes without any progress. Sure there are a lot of channels to choose from in case it lags too much. But in today's game, I logged in on a channel in color white, single circle expecting to have a smoother game play. Sadly, the problem remains the same.\n\nAlso, you can't even proceed to the next part of the map since the server is full. I tried jumping around from channel to channel without success. And a crowd is already forming in the entrance/exit to the next map. And well, we were all waiting...and looking bored... to logging out.\n\nThe game itself without the moments of lag is pretty awesome. I liked the instant teleportation to the NPC to get your reward once the quest has ended. I also enjoyed choosing and experimenting with the skills set to each job.\n\nI hope that the developers (or whoever) fixes the problems soon. It's too early for me to give up but sooner or later, most gamers would throw in the towel for a smoother play.\n","May 11","false","94.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is not just a minor issue, its very absurd and noticable in game and extremely obnoxious. From what I hear it has been like this for a very long time with no pending fix in sight.\n\nThe game is fun, if you can look past the choppyness and the all around poor optimization. Delays on actions and buffs, unable to dash while the map window is open etc.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun though, as stated above. There are some negative points as well like if you reach weight capacity being unable to move, the concept of "stamina" which renders you unable to run after so long and of course who could forget losing all of your gems when you die, permanently.. why!? I get there are realism aspects of these traits but I personally find them annoying.\n\nFinally, I was also quite interested in dabbling in the cash shop for the game, maybe support it a little since I enjoyed RO so much. Yet there isn't one available yet, I figured it'd be a day or two tops before they re-released the cash shop once it went f2p. It has been the better part of a week and still waiting.

All the overly cutesy, cartoony 2.5D feel of BoFIII, coated with UI and levelling similar to the old D2 Hacker. I often turn away from blatant anime games and/or ridiculously 'cute' games where supposed threats to your character are along the lines of giant Turnips that smile at you while you're battering them upside the head with a big stick - but on the other hand, I've always enjoyed a game with a grind - one that doesn't just fade away after 50 levels and leave you hanging with lacking end-game.\n\nThis'd be far, FAR easier to enjoy if the server wasn't such a mess. Those on EU who decide to play at peak time (or anything earlier than stupid'o'clock in the morning, for that matter) are in for some very, VERY frustrating lag. If you're a night-owl and have no issue with stupidly cute anime trite and are looking for a vast time-sink, ToS may be for you. There's no hand-holding here, so if you've played the likes of Path of Exile, you'll be familiar with the 'trial and error' side of character progression, spread over 300+ levels.\n\nSoundtrack is solid, mostly upbeat ditties and some overbearing dance or trance, but overall it suits the game and can add some enjoyment to the long grind you're in for.\n\n7/10 thus far - and I'm only scratching the surface -- but if the servers don't improve, I have no doubt I'll eventually get tired of slapping things 5 times before actual damage gets registered.","May 22","true","43.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vileguy/recommended/372000/","vileguy","Vileguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vileguy/","327 products in account","The game has very little to offer beyond longevity. There's no sense of community in the game. There's no zone-wide chat to cooperate with others, there's only global chat (which takes a consumable item to use) or party/guild chat.\n\nAs an MMO, it's a failure. The game doesn't rely on healers or tanks for dungeons and missions. Bosses simply get zerged while they mindlessly walk towards their aggro target and use AoE attacks. Healers sometimes can save you when potions are on cooldown, but generally they're unnecessary. Class balance is AWFUL and the AI is really bad, so if you play a pet class be ready for frustration.\n\nLeveling goes up to 280 or so with stat points, skill points, and class progression that you cannot undo (some can be undone with microtransactions, but others cannot). Core gameplay consists of:\n\nQuesting - standard uninteresting MMO fair with minimal rewards.\nExploring - small reward for discovering 100% of a zone's map. Very difficult with the base UI, but mods make it less confusing.\nCombat - hit a few cooldown with 15-60 second cooldowns. Then procede to auto attack a bunch, even if you're a mage or priest. Then use a mana and/or health potion to continue. There's no challenge to be found at all.\nDungeons/Missions - kill a bunch of trash and then fight several bosses. This gives MUCH more Exp for the time invested than anything else you can do, yet it has a daily limit of 2/3 for each. Basically this is your "daily quest."\n\nThe game is full of bots spamming their websites in town or in the global channel. Completing quests and grinding Exp can involve more waiting than killing between sitting at a bonfire for SP if you choose to and waiting for monsters to very slowly respawn. There's also the option to camp world bosses that spawn every ~4 hours, what fun!\n\nThe UI is clunky, and while there are 3 control modes (gamepad, keyboard, mouse), none works 100% correctly. The servers have awful performance despite a very small playerbase, and the game itself cannot maintain even 10fps on a GTX 970. I've routinely seen my FPS go above 120 and below 10 in a very short time period.\n\nIf you want to try the game and not pay anything, feel free I don't think that's a bad idea. Focus on doing all quests (you need to talk to NPCs, they don't have an exclamation over their head) and exploring all zones. Don't use Exp cards until you are desperate to level up.\n\nIf you wanted to spend money on this game, please don't. It's in a horrible state and probably won't improve anytime soon.","May 11","false","120.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

But when gold sellers start to lag your gameplay by spamming, I would have imagined it would be fixed in a month. Haven't noticed any difference in attempt to fix it.\n\nClass system is certainly interesting. It's also major pain in the butt as it's confusing beyond belief. If you happen to make bad pick with class (which is really easy to do, if you haven't studied all the variances) you might not notice it before going a lot further in game. Also not to mention picking wrong class will mean you have to reroll the character as this game is redundantly harsh with picking your route. Picked wrong stat for your build? Too bad, you are out of luck with this game.\n\nAs a korean game, it's mindless grindfest. In itself it isn't a problem, but without good dungeon/raids party system and so on it grows old really quick.\n\nI have understood this should be spiritual successor to Ragnarok online, but it seems to miss so many things that made RO good. There isn't same sense of adventure, the same quality of mob design, the same unique sound world. It might be because of nostalgia, but having been playing RO quite frequently, I certainly feel more like playing that than this. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. There is better grindfests out there.\n\nIt's hard to think of good qualities to say when bad sides are so numerous.","April 29","false","63.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Moreover, I'm a MMO fan and I spend over 7 years on WOW. To be honest, I'm kind of tired of 3D MMO. Tree of Savior really got my attention. But after nearly 20h game time, I totally change my mind and I realize I spend 50$ purchasing piece of ♥♥♥♥.\nSo, to be more bojective, let me talk more about its pros and cons.\nPro:\n-Beautiful image\n-Good BGM\n-Classes and skills\n-Similar with RO\nCon:\n-Bad system optimize\n-Bad server\n-Super lag\n-Large lvl gap between different areas\n-Bugs\nI never expected a perfect early access game experience because I know there should be many problems before open beta. But I am really really upset about its bad server and system optimization. For example, I speak to NPC and after 10mins that NPC makes response. Moreover, FPS is another big problem.\nI doubt this game is incomplete.\nDon't purchase early access. Even if they cannot solve their server problem or optimize system, you'd better not play this game when it is open beta.\n\n\n中文评论就他妈一句话：垃圾游戏，卡得运营商全家上天爆炸\n游戏评价本身就蛮主观的，这个游戏我又多玩了一段时间，总而言之就是游戏本身很好，然而这个垃圾服务器只能让我给出这个游戏负分滚粗的评价。问题是我在美国，我玩的美服，我用的50mb的光纤依然在忍受着垃圾服务器带来的垃圾游戏体验","April 4","false","25.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now i am happy i didnt. Game has a lot of flaws, most major atm are server issues, euro server is not even that populated and it constantly lags, i am playing archer and i do double dps when it doesnt lag.\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ auction system - you cant buy/sell anything for 72 hours when you start to play, when you finally can start selling tooltips on items you put on auction(average price and stuff) are completely wrong, you need to check every material(and after 72 hours i had about ~90 of them) manually. But that isnt everything, even if you manage to sell something you need to wait 48 hours to get your silver. This makes absolutely no sense to me.\nOther major issue is forced party play. Being in a group gives you more xp then solo. In full group you can get 450% more xp per monster, considering half of the areas are dead/close to dead this makes no sense again. Why should solo gameplay be punished in a grinding game, i have no idea.\nNext issue is dungeon queue. Considering you get even more bonus xp(600%) if you dont make premade group for dungeon, you need to queue for some to get good xp. Well, 99% of the time you just gonna stare at 'Searching for party' window for hours if you have nothing else to do. Also game has no info on dungeon locations, but that is tolerable considering queue mechanic itself. Queue should be long distance and not require you to wait at dungeon entrance, period. Oh and 1 more thing about dungeons, 90% of the time you get nothing, there are total 2(+1 when you get premium token) entrances COMBINED per day. Actually its not that bad since you cant even find group for 1 dungeon, lol.\n\nNow about good stuff, art/locations/quests are actually pretty enjoyable, characters are really cute.\nBut considering party play will probably stay same and I am really not a fan of grinding normal monsters with other people, i have doubts i am gonna enjoy playing this game further.","May 14","false","57.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

With the exception of a few, I'd seriously buy this game's album and not regret it.\nVery intuitive class creation system. Not every mix-matched build or combination will work, but it helps create varied builds between people and freshness when it comes to creating multiple characters.\nGreat visuals. The game knows tone, and knows when to be happy and prideful, or dark and borderline ambient.\nWhile others may disagree, I like the story, though it isn't magnificently written. This game gets dark, and there will be more times when you can't save others from meeting demise.\nAside from hiccups, the controls are very concise and the game allows multiple interfaces to play it: (Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepads.)\n\nCons!\nGame is fairly buggy. As of now, some skills and attack may register odd not due to lag, but the nature of the attack itself.\nAs expected for a global/international game, there is lag. But it is much more than you expect.\nOptimization of game is fairly poor. My computer's rig isn't powerful, but it's been known that the game runs on a single core within your computer, so performance is certainly lacking.\nCharacter Customization is fairly lacking thus far. I expect this to be adressed in the future as this isn't a hard thing to fix with time.\nThe game has a fair amount of linear gameplay, but at the same time one doesn't have to level up the same as others. It's not a sandbox, it is a grinder.\n\nAll in all, if you particularly grind based games, I recommend giving it a try and seeing if you like it. It is not for everyone, but for those who end up liking it will get hooked as the core of the game is honestly FANTASTIC. Right now though, lag and bugs may hinder gaming experience. Try it, and support it if you can. This game is not perfect, but it is great and a brilliant way to shine some light on this stale MMO market. If you can get friends for the journey, it may also be worth making a group for it.\n\nGood luck, and may the goddesses stay with you.","May 11","true","523.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
