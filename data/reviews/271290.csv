The reason the Steam stat is wrong is because Hawken has been available for download since 2012, and it only recently became available on Steam. If you don't believe me, here's a couple of links to screenshots proving it right here: 1 and 2[i.minus.com]\n\nEver since I first got into the Alpha way back in 2012, I've been absolutely hooked to Hawken. Hawken is an excellent first person shooter in the tradition of games somewhat along the lines of arena shooters like Quake or Unreal Tournament, but with a nice mech flair that gives Hawken a very unique feel. There are well over a dozen mechs in the game, all with their own play styles, strengths, and weaknesses, and with quite a bit of customization for each one, from the way they perform to the way they look. You can unlock these customizations simply by playing a mech, or by buying them with the in game currency. Free cosmetic customization options unlock as well as you level up the individual mechs (mech level) and your overall earned experience across all mechs (pilot level).\n\nWhen I first got into it, I was a little worried since, as a free to play game, the possibility of pay-to-win rearing its ugly head was always a possibility, but my fears remained unfounded. Like all developers, these guys need to make money, but they've limited the pay-only stuff to the cosmetic options like camos, thrusters, and repair drones that all have no effect on game play. You of course have the option to buy new mechs and such straight away, too, but it's never a requirement. All the mechs and weapons are balanced very well overall, and there has never been a single MUST HAVE mech or weapon that gives you an advantage over everyone else.\n\nI did, personally, buy a Brawler the moment the game entered open beta, as I knew from the closed testing it was the mech for me. However, every other mech, weapon, item, and internal in the game was bought with the currency I earned simply through playing - and I have them all. There is a grind - but it is nowhere near as heinous as it is in plenty of other free-to-play titles out there, and I enjoyed every bit of the game play, I never once felt like I was having to grind out the equipment. On top of all that, the community in this game is phenomenal. I never wanted to get involved in an official community, or in a clan before. It had always seemed stupid and pointless and bleergh. However, I was slowly pushed into it with Hawken, and it's been a tremendous experience. So many of the players are extremely helpful, the developers are friendly and responsive, and my experience as a whole with this game was profoundly affected by my interactions with the community here. Seriously, it's shockingly good for an online game.\n\nTl;dr: There is no third person. This game is great. Go play it.","February 11, 2014","true","96.9"," 1,430 of 1,734 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","430","1","0","124"

Most of the things can be purchased with HAWKEN Credits (the currency you'll get for completing matches etc.), but most of the customization-items will cost you Meteor Credits (currency you'll have to buy with your local coin). Still, there is no need for you to buy in-game items to make it more "balanced" -- weapons can also be bought with HC or can be unlocked as you progress. Thank you for this, devs! :3\n- This game will bite large chucks out of my social life. God f**king damn it.\n\nThe ugly:\n- There's nothing ugly about this. Seriously.

I've been playing Hawken since last march, and it is by far one fo my favourite games that I have ever played. I've spent about $50 on it over the course of a year and felt that I got every dollar's worth out of it. It is by no means perfect, and has several flaws in it that range from annoyances to game breakingly bad. So do I reccomend Hawken as a game to spend your time and money on? Read on and find out.\n\nFirst off, Hawken looks FANTASTIC, with good (but not the best) optimization and physx support. Hawken just looks awesome! Simple as that.\n\nHawken is a class based game, which means that there are 18 mechs that have specific roles within their team. Meaning that there is an optimal way to play each and every mech, which means that you won't be able to dive into a conflict head on and be a monstrous killing machine in every mech. A Tech (the medic class) should not be a frontline assault mech in the same way a Brawler (a fat, heavy, burst damage mech) should not be a sniper. It is important to either pick a mech that suits your preffered playstyle and learn different playstyles according to the mech you're playing.\n\nYet another thing that I like about Hawken is that there is no such thing as 'lonewolfing'. It is impossible to try and play Hawken like you would play CoD or a similar FPS game because you cannot kill more than one mech by yourself. You are not fighting squishy humans that can be killed with one shot to the head by a pistol, you are fighting 20 meter tall bipedal war machines. Mechs do not die very easy, and therefore it is nigh on impossible to kill 2 mechs at once, much less an entire team. Hakwen is a game where you NEED to stick with your team and communicate with them in order to be the most effective you can be.\n\nThe amount of weapons for Hawken is also gratifying. Each mech has a permanent secondary weapon and with a primary, alternate and 'prestige' weapon unlocked with in game currency or real money. one thing that is very important to mention is that with the exception of a select few mechs, ALL PRIMARY WEAPONS ARE VIABLE ON ANY MECH. Just beacuse a weapon is called a 'Presitge Weapon', it doesn't mean that it is a flat out upgrade. Almost all weapons on all mechs are viable, it just depends on adjusting your play style to fit with the weapons you're using.\n\nHawken's controls are also unique. One of the things that every player should learn how to do early is on dodge. You can do a dodge side to side by pressing shift and the side movement keys. While it may not seem like much, dodging is probably the single most important thing you can learn in Hawken. It can be used for dodging missiles, hiding behind cover, getting into and out of combat and even for movement. Once you learn Hawken's movement controls, you will never forget them.\n\nHOWEVER, Hawken is by no mean a perfect game, and there are several issues that  need to be adressed. The first, and biggest, of which is the enormous skill gap that players WILL encounter in beyond mid level games. Once you reach a certain MMR (Typically around 2100-2200), the number of games you will be able to join will be few and far between, and when you are able to join you will rarely enter matches with people of your skill level. I'm currently sitting at 2200 MMR and I either end up playing with relatively new players who I can murder with ease, or with the "Super Leet" players who have been playing since alpha/early beta that can kick my ♥♥♥ in seven different ways. There are not enough middle ranking players in Hawken right now, so there is no kind of playing field for mid-high ranking players within the community ATM. It makes it rather frustrating to play PvP, but the alternative mode isn't a good alternative.\n\nThe AI game mode, where you and a team fight against AI controlled bots is often overlooked by the majority of the community. It's a good way to learn how to play with new mechs and weapons... or at least it would be if the AI wasn't so f**king cheap and atrouciously designed! The bot desgin in Hawken is some of the worst I've ever seen, with perfect aim, higher damage output and key input reading being the main issues. The bots can and will dodge shots that they shouldn't even SEE, shoot you around corners due to the fact that they have NO LATENCY WHATSOEVER and do higher amounts of damage to you than you could hope to do to them from ridiculous ranges. While the AI mode isn't Hawken's most popular mode, it is still in the game and desperately needs to be fixed.\n\nThe third issue which I feel is hurting Hawken's potential is the sheer number of cheaters, hackers, and aimbotters that are flooding the community. I can bearly play a match without seeing at least one or two players who are clearly aimbotting or wallhacking. Even if I'm playing as a mech that can turn invisible, I still get sniped by players halfway across the map with full auto weapons. I hear tell that there are plans to put an anti-cheat system into Hawken soon, but until then I don't feel that PvP is worth my time due to the rampant cheaters, limited server selection and limited number of people of my skill level to play against.\n\nMy fourth complaint is the awkward viewing. As anyone who has played Hawken before can tell you, there is a turn cap, so you can't do a 720 degree spin with one flick of the wrist. In fact, in my experience it feels almost like negative mouse acceleration, due to the fact that you need to set your sensitivity just right in order to avoid overshooting, which can be a pain in the ***. It's something that I find irritating, but not game breaking. If you can get used to the turn cap, you'll be just fine.\n\nLastly, are Hawken's maps. Some are great, like facility, frontline, werckage and uptown, and others are crappy (I'm looking at you bazaar. You too bunker). Most of them are well desgined and fun to play on, and map knowledge is definetely an important skill to learn in Hawken. But the way the maps are built leaves a lot to be desired. It is very easy to get stuck in a wall if you dodge into it, the debris on the ground is annoying since it gets in the way of your shots and there are some maps that you can break (Not saying which ones though), and climb on top of the ceiling box to shoot people from. These issues are incredibly annoying and can ruin a good match.\n\nSo in summary, here are the pros and cons of Hawken in its current state.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent graphics/aesthetics\n-Large variety of mechs/weapons\n-Unique and fun movement mechanics (easy to learn, hard to master)\n-Encourages team based play\n-Giant robots shooting other giant robots!\n\nCons:\n-HUGE player skill gap\n-Broken map design (clipping into walls, leaving the map boundaries, etc.)\n-Hackers and cheaters everywhere\n-Broken AI\n-Awkward turn cap\n\nDo I reccomend you play Hawken? YES, absolutely! It could be a lot better than it is in its current state, but I have faith that Reloaded will take good care of Hawken.","April 5, 2015","true","584.9"," 146 of 159 people (92%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","92","146","159","18","6"

But the game is, as stated in the requirements not for the most average gamings pc's, i maintain a steady framerate at medium, high is just a little too much for my Gaming laptop, runs on max on my rig no problem.\n\nf2p Fairness 10/10(while you certainly can buy items with credits purchase by real currency, the game never feels like it is pay to win, and the gameplay is always fair. pay if you feel like investing into your favorite mech(s) or grind the game and earn it!  all  you can pay for is customization and convenience (battlefield for example, in  bad company 2 allowed you to purchase shortcut packs to different classes, and that is a full retail release (AAA) at that so is it so wrong to pay 5,10, or over 9000! on a game that is certainly worth it and completely outdoes its f2p tag.\n\nControls/Navigation-10/10 i found the controls extremely easy to get used to and all of the default mapping was great for all options, and everything is relatively easy to manage and navigate\n\nCommunity 9/10- in my first hours of hawken me and my best friend were eager to learn and the community was certainly helpful on not ony the forums but also in game chat. some minor annoyances occured in game with people complaining of\n"Hackers" or "p2w losers" but overall i have had a great experience.\nOVERALL SCORE 9/10 Must Try!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you for reading, i would also like ot note that i installed hawken purely for a quick fix for titanfall, but soon realised that this game might be the king of mech games afterall, it takes mech combat and gameplay and makes it amazing, without the need for any desire to ever leave your mech(why would you, anyways?!)  this was my first full review and i thank anyone who took the time to read it!, i will hopefully build on it in the future with more examples, notes. but for now, back to the game!\nTLDR\nHawken is the S#!t.

It's got good design, fun gameplay, and nice graphics.\n\nHOWEVER: Hawken's Dev team is pretty much completely disbanded. You won't get any form of support, updates, etc. from the dev team because the dev team no longer exists. Ingame purchases with the premium currency also won't really work. (EDIT: Apparently, the game is now being worked on by some new devs.)\n\nHOWEVER: Despite being unoffically dead, the community is still active, the game is balanced and fun, and its good enough that you can continue playing it. The "EPIC MANUEVER" feeling of tricking someone into attacking a hologram, then going up behind them and letting loose with a rifle is more then enough to keep you playing. Not only that, but the game's F2P model allows you to actually unlock everything related to gameplay (IE, not cosmetics) simply by playing the game. You can unlock all the mechs with the non-premium ingame currency.\n\nThe general statement: Yes, its dead. Yes, you won't get any support from the Devs. However, it's still active, and its still fun.","February 21, 2015","true","46.5"," 98 of 109 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","98","109","15","2"

While the game may feature some balance issues these are being addressed and the team is very dedicated to delivering a great experience. This isn't your typical mech simulator though, this is a fast paced FPS mech game more akin to arena shooters like Unreal Tournament or Quake Arena than Call of Duty. You have to learn to play within the restrictions of the mech such as turn rate caps, fuel levels, speeds, and so forth. This makes for some very rewarding combat that puts skill above all else. And before you ask yes you can purchase mechs, internals, and items with real world currency this doesn't give you an advantage unless you've taken the time to get good with the mech, weapon, or whatever you've purchased. There is no best mech or anything like so you've got nothing to worry about there.\n\nHawken also has one of the best F2P models I've seen since the only content that is locked behind a pay wall is cosmetics only. Everything else can be purchased with currency you earn in-game and the earn rates aren't bad at all plus the team is still implementing more ways to earn Hawken Credits.\n\nThis is definitely worth a look for anyone looking for a good fast paced FPS and you can't argue with the price of free. Hopefully the game won't be on Early Access for long with the Nemesis Bundle so as many people as possible can try it out and see what Hawken is all about.","February 12, 2014","true","685.6"," 348 of 463 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","348","463","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Braethias/recommended/271290/","Braethias","Braethias","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Braethias/","263 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst, let me say this game IS enjoyable. I do like certain elements, and I certainly had fun playing this game, and still play it now and again on occasion. If you lack other games, by all means give it a shot. It has vs. and co-op, so there's probably something for you in it. Pacing is very good, it's fast, there is very little respawn delays, combat has a tactical element to it, and overall design strikes me as very well thought out.\n\nThat being said, I do not recommend this game. I played it off and on during it's pre-steam release, and had no real trouble progressing through the ranks, I was able to get things for my mechs, and generally had fun doing it. Now, with the steam release, it supports the pay to win model FAR too heavily.\n\nFor one, unlocking a consumable permanant item is good, but you have to buy the same thing per mech. It's not globally unlocked. Which means if you want it, you have to buy it every time you want to try a new mech, which means that every time you do, you start with nothing. Or, You could pay 10 dollars and have it now.\n\nDon't have any mechs? I was playing around, and each mech ranges in cost from 8k-18k in-game money. In a round, i got from 100-300 per (100 for middleground scoring TDM, 400 for MVP in co-op to wave 20) Weapons cost 6k+ for the alternate one and two each, meaning averaging 150 a 15 minute round, or 10/minute means 10 hours. To unlock one low cost thing. Or, You could pay 10 dollars and have it now.\n\nAs you progress, you gain both mech levels, and pilot levels. Pilot levels grant access to more potent/more frequent use permanant consumeables, internal mech parts, and mech levels allow you to use the alternate weapons. You are not able to buy those items until you reach a specific rank/level with mech or pilot. Or, You could pay 10 dollars and have it now.\n\nBuying the parts with actual currency bypasses both the progression gates, and the grind to unlock anything. If you have nothing but time, and have the patience to grind out 60-70 hours, it will work for you.

Smurfing run rampant, and unless you drop money to unlock what you want, you won't have the competative edge to do well.

Game modes include variations of PvP and co-op, but no single-player campaign as of now.\n\nThe game has a steep intial learning curve, but a seemingly endless depth to the level of mastery (think skiing). It has big hits (think NFL and NHL) and explosions (think F1). It has immenesly satisfying, clutch skill shots (think NBA). It has misdirection and stealth (think chess). It has ganking and flanking (think DOTA2/LoL). And more!\n\nGraphics are still pretty, sound is immersive and overall design is unique. Matches often achieve down-to-the-wire balance. Playerbase is small, but helpful. A few bugs, but all minor and none game-breaking. It is Free-to-Play, not Pay-to-Win.\n\nOverall, Hawken one of most unique and rewarding shooters on the market. So... Why haven't you installed Hawken, yet?\n\nIN DEPTH REVIEW\nLet's start with the question on everyone's mind: What happened to Hawken?\n\nBACK IN THE DAY\n\nHawken was developed as F2P first person mech shooter by the now-defunct Adhesive Games and published by the also-now-defunct Meteor Entertainment (WAH wah). After garnering a lot of hype and many awards from E3 2012, the game was released to the public on 12-12-12 in open beta. However, due to numerous factors, Hawken failed to capture a large enough player base to gain any long-term traction.\n\nNOWADAYS\n\nHawken has since been purchased by Reloaded Games, a game publisher with experience resurrecting online multiplayer IP (see APB: Reloaded (also, I just got that!)). The playerbase, while small, remains a constant mix of new and dedicated players.\n\nNow that's all out of the way, we can move on to the useful bits of the review; the cool section where you'll learn what Hawken is/isn't and some pros/cons to help you decide if this game for you. I mean, you know how reviews work, I didn't need to explain that.\n\nUnleash the bulleted lists for selective reading!\n\nUSEFUL BITS OF THE REVIEW\n\nHawken is:\nFast-paced - Boosting, jumping and dodging speed up the pace of the game.\nAssymetrical action - Different classes, mechs and weapons taken a step further with pilot's choice of items and internals (passives).\nMultiplayer - 6v6 up to 12v12 PvP in 4 game modes: TDM, DM, Missile Assualt (cap and hold) and Siege (unique to Hawken) as well as 4p co-op bot destruction.\nA MOBA masquerading as a twich FPS - The mental aspect of team comps, abilities, cool downs coupled with the physical aspect of aiming, shooting and dodging.\nHawken is not:\nMechwarrior - Hawken is a different experience than Mechwarrior and traditional mech games.\nP2W - You can pay for XP and credit boosts, but players gain no in-game advantage other than unlocking early. (besides, the starter mech is a Golden God!)\nSingle player - No single player campaign as of the date of this review.\nPerfect - there are still minor technical issues (walls OP), but nothing that greatly diminishes the experience of the game.\nPros\nVery Balanced - Assymetry is difficult to pull off and keep everyone happy. Every mech has the potentional to be deadly in Hawken and matches that don't have an influx of new players joining mid-match often come down to the wire with close scores and even sudden death.\nGorgeous Graphics - Looked amazing in 2012, and still looks great. The designers put an enormous amount of detail into various aspects of the maps and mechs. Users with higher end cards will want to run Hawken on highest settings to achieve the highest frequency of dopamine squirts due pleasing visual stimuli.\nImmersive Sound - Hawken rewards players with 7.1 headsets or surround sound setups. The sound design rewards pilots who key in on audible clues. The Sound designers also added nice suble sound effects, such as the rippling of a roof flap on a tent in a tiny (well, man-sized) market in a desert bazaar.\nDuels - One of the sweetest moments in Hawken is when you 1v1 an enemy without interference from your teams. Any mech can beat any other mech - if you die in a duel, it was your own fault, and perhaps that's what makes coming out of them alive so rewarding.\nHelpful Community - Every online competitive game has ragers, and while Hawken is no exception, the majority of players are happy to help new players with tips and overall strategy. Just ask, don't rage! If you encounter someone who is ragin'. just remember the same rules apply in Hawken as they do elsewhere: do not feed the trolls and they will go back to their underbridges.\nNo One-Shot Kills* - I love shooters, but getting constantly sniped from a guy on mountain top 8 klicks away can get old quickly. Players at full health can still die quickly, but never from one shot/barrage from one player. *(Note: small mechs beware of predator traps)\nCustomization and Leveling - This may not sound like a "pro" list item to some shooter fans, but Hawken implements it well enough. Customizing game-affecting weapons, items and internals as well as cosmectic changes like skins, chassis parts, cross-hairs and even cockpit decor (bobbleheads and half-eaten chinese food ftw!), the gameplay is made deepener through a sense of progression and self styling.\nDeep Level of Mastery - Years after the release of Hawken, players are still finding and perfecting minor techniques to improve their game play. And like any great shooter, practice makes perfect.\nA Truly Unique Game - Hawken is a game many once-abandoned players revisit again and again, not only for the reasons above because it does online PVP in way that no other FPS really does. We're not talking about unique game modes, but Hawken's very distinct atmosphere and play style. There is a reason Hawken won so many awards at E3 2012 and players who can make over that initial learning curve hump will see why.\nCons\nVery Small Playerbase - This can affect new players simply by virtue of being placed in a server with someone who has a lot more experience. Usually when that happens, chances are YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME.\nDifficult to Learn - A few people take to Hawken's gameplay naturally in just a few matches. The majority of new players, however, take a while longer to feel comfortable in the cockpit of their mech.\nLong Grind on Mech Leveling - It can take anywhere from a few days to couple of weeks to level a mech fully. This can be tedious if you're just trying to unlock a later-level weapon for that mech without paying to unlock it early.\nLag Issues on Far-Away Servers - "Well, of course!" you say. We all know online PVPers want low pings, but pings that reach 70-80 or higher show an immediate affect on gameplay.\nUncertain future - One developer and one publisher are now donezo (technical term) after releasing Hawken and a new developer bought up the rights for a song. No one knows what will happen going forward, but is this different than most games these days?","June 10, 2015","true","888.8"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","59","67","4","4"

There's no support whatsoever. If something breaks, new hacks appear, someone's griefing - anything - you're simply on your own. This sometimes leads to sad things like how it's no longer possible to recover your account if you lose or forget your password, and the old hawken forums getting closed down without a word. There's about 0% chance that the game will see any further patches, additions, or updates.\n\nHawken has a long history, but at this rate, not only will the game cease to exist, but all memories of it will be lost. For instance, did you know that at one point, the devs and the internet at large were convinced that hawken would rival League of Legends' playerbase? The game was so hyped, they were gonna do a TV series, a card game, a movie, comic books, toys, and a youtube exclusive show. Only the card game actually made it, and it's allegedly more balanced than hawken itself.\n\nRIP, hawken, 2011-2015. Never left beta.\n\nWhile you can still play this game, know that the servers could go offline at any time, and any money you put into the game won't actually change anything, feed any developers, or even lead to new content releases. Thus, for obvious reasons, it's not recommended that you purchase MC for any reason.\n\ntl;dr hawken could have been great, but it's dead. Play while it's still up if you feel like it.\n\nUpdated july 10th, 2015.\n\nAfter a long period of nothing, and being abandonware, Reloaded games bought out the rights, the assets, and everything. Adhesive disbanded in absolute silence, only to reform as NACHO games. They were quickly sucked into some kind of lame 'partnership' with FREE REIGN, a publisher who may or may not be the renamed company behind games such as infestation: survival stories/War Z, Big Rigs, and other such AMAZING titles.\n\nThe former adhesive developers, proud and competent beyond other shovelware Z-grade developers, are now making generic 5v5 modern warfare shooters, their current project titled BURSTFIRE.\n\nIt's been over half a year, and Reloaded games have done absolutely nothing for hawken, citing the same technical debt and etc. as adhesive before them. The closest things to progress were a rebalance of heavy grind, so new players can actually play the game, the forums being re-opened, and some kind of dev interview streams.\n\nDue to immense ego growth, and delusions that hawken will rise from the grave, the mere mention of complaints on the steam forum is now enough to make the brainwashed mods threaten you with permanent bans - because you know how poorly managed the game was, that little has changed, and that said mods are the remains of a corrupt, elite circle of dev friends who largely led hawken down the dark path it took in the first place.\n\nSo in summary, a bad game made by bad developers, bought out by another bad developer, played by the remains of a bad playerbase, got put in its place, and everybody who was involved in the project is now either bankrupt, caught holding the bag, or working on the most blatant shovelware, which is the way karma intended it to be.\n\nI wouldn't touch this game with a ten foot pole, even for laughs.\n\nUpdated april 13th, 2016.\n\nTo hopefully no one's surprise, the Reloaded devs have proven just as incompetent and tardy as the original Adhesive team. Since the last update, very little has been done, and patches are now months apart, primarily consisting of old, formerly unused content (cockpit items, camo colors...).\n\nIn an absolutely unforeseen twist, the new team is now under some kind of NDA, and can't talk about anything, all the while promising that year X is the year of hawken, big things in 60 to 90 days, just you wait for us to hire this guy, and please go buy our newly minted physical merchandise so we can keep feeding you lies every other month.\n\nIt's almost like we've been here once before, or something. You're still not allowed to talk about the game's failings, the old team, or how useless the new team is. If you do, the forum moderators will delete your posts and ban you. This extends to the official forums as well, which are seemingly under some kind of iron fisted rule for reasons that are known only to Reloaded. Hilariously, they spend far more time monitoring their forum than they do working on the game. Even the old Adhesive logo still remains on the splash screens.\n\nBy far the biggest joke of all is that Reloaded put the game back into early access. Yes, you read that right. It was a released game, but now it's in early access. I didn't even know you could do that.\n\nWhile all of this was going on, Burstfire released, the Adhesive team proved for the second time that they're not fit to make games, and after failing for a few months, Mr. Big Rigs himself shut the game down, fired Adhesive/Nacho, and partially refunded money spent on the game. I want you to consider the implications when the man who made Big Rigs and War Z cancels your game and fires you for being incompetent.\n\nIf you're reading this, and you're one of the poor fools who got suckered in when the game changed hands, congratulations! I hope you bought all those hawken coins, hawken t-shirts, fed Reloaded 100 dollars for MC, and pushed the game really hard on youtube. Please do make yet another comment, telling me how wrong I was a year ago, and how wrong I remain to this day, and that the next team will surely be the salvation of hawken.","January 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 157 of 221 people (71%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","71","157","221","9","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/garudaramuda/recommended/271290/","garudaramuda","Y'Karis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/garudaramuda/","135 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHawken is one of the most engaging games I've ever played. Often I shy away from competitive shooters, but Hawken's community has a casual and welcoming atmosphere, even amongst advanced players.\n\nRegarding community-\nTypically, the people you meet won't take the game too seriously, and sometimes lobbies can fill up with players who love to chat about the game or organize fun, gimmick matches. Hackers are few and far between- The only hackers you'll come across are aimbotters, who can easily be killed with proper teamwork or clever use of cover and items. Basically, the Hawken community is great. Even on opposing teams, people won't get mad talking to you.\nMatchmaking- I haven't found any difficulty finding matches in the US region during most waking hours and can still find a few games late at night. However, if your performance is incredibly high, finding a lobby that matches your skill level can be difficult, which leads to players creating new accounts to play with others of lower skill. However, said players have put thousands of hours into the game- if you want to play the game casually, matchmaking isn't an issue in the slightest.\n\nRegarding price model-\nHawken has 2 types of currency. Hawken Credits can be earned through achievements, ranking up, and simply playing matches. Hawken credits can be used to buy unlocked primary weapons, new mechs, usable items (don't worry- they come back every time you respawn), and "internals" (essentially, passive effects for your mech).\nThe 2nd currency is Meteor Credits. These can only be earned through community events or bought with money. They can be used to provide a boost to your earned credits or experience. Additionally, Meteor credits can be used to purchase weapons (even if you haven't unlocked access to a weapon yet), mechs, and cosmetic items such as new taunts or paintjobs.\nThe rate that Hawken credits are earned isn't perfect- you'll be earning a lot more as you start before you stop receiving bonuses. However, there are semi-regular events which provide doubled HC earnings, and switching to a team with less players provides a nice bonus. In addition, daily win bonuses are available for each mode. I haven't spent a cent on the game as of yet, and in 30 hours of gameplay I've acquired 7 mechs and outfitted all of them with plenty of items, weapons and internals. The rate may be a little grindy- but each mech is unique and fun to play, and the game itself is an absolute blast. Earning HC actually feels like a reward rather than an obligation, and I haven't found myself bored with my selection of mechs before acquiring the funds for another as of yet.\n\n\nThe gameplay revolves heavily around teamwork and coordination, so you wont be seeing many players on Deathmatch.\n\nHawken's gameplay differs from many shooters- mechs have a limited turning speed, meaning it can be hard to keep your reticle on a quick mech that rushes you down. To circumvent this, you have the ability to dodge from side to side- this helps not only with dodging strong projectiles, but quickly adjusting your position to move your reticle onto an enemy. However, dodging has a short cooldown attached. Boosting (sprinting) everywhere is discouraged- this will drain your fuel meter until you can no longer boost, and disables you from firing weapons for a short duration after ending the boost. Mechs can also use their fuel meter to hover in the air- however, the height that can be achieved is limited, and your maneuverability in the air is greatly limited, making you an easy target for any player.\nThese mechanics seem to make it very easy to suppress targets, as anyone who attempts to rush in on a defended point has no way to fight back, and will likely die in seconds to a full team. However- you can instantly shoot out of a dodge, and one mech- the Raider, has the ability to shoot while boosting for a short duration, with the role of breaking up a defensive team and causing chaos while their teammates provide supporting fire and move in whilst the other team is distracted.\n\nAlternately, there's another approach that I prefer greatly- stealth. Each mech is equipped with a radar. Everytime you fire a weapon, boost, dodge, or jump, you will appear on a nearby enemy's radar for a short duration, in addition to appearing on radar once in the enemy's line of sight. In most firefights that involve a large portion of the enemy team, the enemy will be completely focused in one direction, allowing a lone mech to walk around, undetected, and attack the enemy team from behind. Organized flanking can be devastating to an unsuspecting team- ESPECIALLY with the mechanic of repairing in mind.\n\nWhat is repairing? Repairing is one of the main methods of restoring a mech's hp. Repairing puts you in a third person view with no radar, and will not begin restoring hp until a few seconds have passed. The mech cannot fire or move until a few seconds after repairing is stopped. If an enemy mech is hit while repairing, the process will be cancelled. If a repairing mech is caught off guard, they're most likely dead.\n\nOne of the greatest joys in Hawken is finding a player and organizing a flanking ambush on the enemy team- either verbally or nonverbally. Hawken's gameplay greatly encourages tactical play, and a team that sneaks up on enemies will likely prevail.\n\nAnother tactical aspect of Hawken lies within mech abilities- special augments for your mech that can be activated after a certain cooldown has passed. Almost every mech has a unique ability (only 3 mechs share an ability in the game) that can greatly change how a skirmish plays out. As mentioned earlier, the Raider mech has the ability to shoot while boosting, which can be used to chase down an opponent at high speeds, or to sacrifice yourself to give your team an opening to attack. Other notable examples include the Infiltrator, which can make itself nearly invisible and undetectable on radar until the mech attacks or runs out of fuel (which the ability constantly drains).\n\nThat about wraps it up- many other mechanics will explain themselves, or be found through experimentation. Don't be afraid to look up guides on mechs and maneuvers.\n\nTL:DR\nThis game is an absolute blast if you get into it, and extremely easy to play completely free. There're plenty of handy techniques to learn, coordinating with teammates feels good, and duels with opponents can become very intense and action-packed. Every mech has a completely different playstyle, so if you ever find yourself bored, you can try out one of the free mechs, purchase a new one, or even just change the weapons and items you're using for a new experience.\n\n\nMy biggest hang-up with the game: development.\nAdhesive games went under a while ago, and only recently was Hawken picked back up by a new company. While we receive updates every week, new content is still a ways away, and said lack of content has led to a small community. However, the game is still populated. I highly encourage you to give the game a go and maybe invite a few friends- after all, it's free.\n","August 8, 2015","true","100.4"," 53 of 62 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","53","62","3","0"

The game fills a niche place in the market to be sure, but that dosen't mean you shouldn't try it.\n\nThe Good: GIANT MECHS WITH GIANT GUNS!! Really though, it's Michael Bay the Video Game. Huge mechs duking it out across a bunch of different maps. There's a whole host of mechs to choose from, depending on how you like to play. This game is NOT PAY TO WIN. IT JUST ISN'T. SO STOP SAYING THAT. Everything related to gameplay can be unlocked with in-game credits. Mechs, items, internals, the works. The only thing you have to pay for is swag, like paint jobs and different chassis.\n\nThe Bad: The previous devs (Adhesive) shut down, and left the game in limbo. Then Reloaded came along and picked this game up from the ashes. This just happened recently, and Adhesive really screwed the game up, so there's gonna long turnaround before the current team can actually release anything new. In the mean time, some balancing needs to happen, but nothing soulcrushing. This game plays like an arena shooter (UT04 for example), where the fast and maneuverable live. Not that this is bad, it just means there's a pretty strong learning curve.\n\nThe Ugly: Again, Reloaded got the short end of the stick when they got the game from Adhesive, so there's a host of bugs and balances that need to be worked out. There's stuff in the works to be sure, but it may be a while before we actually see any of that happen. The learning curve and grind have also been known to scare people off.\n\nTL;DR Big machines, big explosions, big fun. Reloaded is stuck in the mud for the time being, but the game is still super fun. Also, check out the forums at https://community.playhawken.com/ These guys are super cool.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScottJFox/recommended/271290/","ScottJFox","་[PrB]   fÆth ✝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScottJFox/","704 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHAWKEN is another example of F2P done right.\nHAWKEN is a Free to Play in the same style as League of Legends, where you use in-game currency to purchase different Champions Mechs who have different advantages, abilities, utilities, playstyles, as well as disadvantages. You can equip different Runes Internals which give different advantages, alternate weapons to your Mechs, & even bring along different items in order to balance out different strategies & playstyles— making your Mech more unique in how you play it. The game is easy to pick up & play, all while leaving room for mastering advanced strategies or gameplay mechanics.\n\nThere is NOTHING you can purchase with real-money (MC) that you can't get with in-game currency (HC) which gives you a gameplay advantage; this game is certainly NOT "Pay to Win". You can buy Mechs, Internals, Weapons, & Items with the "real-money currency" but it's nothing you can't obtain with the in-game currency. The only things you cannot purchase with in-game currency are cosmetics; different paints for your Mechs, different coloured thrusters, or even swappable visual parts which do nothing aside for personal aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe game is surprisingly balanced, with each Mech (including the starting Assault you get for free) being no more overpowered or underpowered than any other. The Assault is a good balance of up-close or at a distance, being between niches while it isn't the best at anything either; a jack-of-all-trades if you will. The Rocketeer is good for harassment, zoning discouragement, or finishing off those low-health rivals trying to run away. The Reaper is good for sniping the enemy Mechs while maintaining a high amount of mobility. The Infiltrator is good for, well, infiltrating the enemy base or coming out of stealth to deal a large amount of burst-damage. Even the 'cheapest' Mechs have their place & are quite usable in battle which is pleasant to know.\n\nFor game modes; There is the traditional Team DeathMatch, a Missile Assault (keep control of 3 points), a Siege (bit harder to summarise) but there is also a CO-OP TDM where you face against bots (who get stronger the more people are in your party), or a CO-OP "Bot Destruction" mode which is akin to destroying waves of weaker enemies while you fight for your life alongside strangers or friends. There are plenty of servers, & for those who wish you are able to browse & join specific servers as well-- so you're not simply a slave to the matchmaker system. However, the game will prevent you (or anyone with a really high match-making-rank) from joining low-rank servers; this is to prevent the 'elite' from simply obliterating low-ranking players as that really isn't fun for anybody.\n\nThe controls are solid. There is a quickturn mechanic which can be a little obnoxious at first (instead of "boosting" (akin to sprinting) backwards, you do a 180-quickturn which you'll likely do accidentally more than a few times) but once you get used to that the controls are flawless. You're able to re-map every key or function, including on an XBOX controller, & the radar, chat, & kill-messages are all able to be moved to the corner of your preference. The visual indicators for things such as when your secondary-fire is ready again, or when your ability is cooled down are clearly visible & understandable being able to be checked with a glance at most.\n\nIt's a gorgeous game built on the Unreal Engine with some NVIDIA-exclusive graphic options, however even on a non-NVIDIA card cranking the game up to 'Ultra' is very satisfying. I've never been extremely picky on graphics as until this beast-of-a-laptop I've never been able to run games on full so I am probably not the best person to make a comment on them other than that.\n\n____\n\nI wasn't expecting much when I first downloaded HAWKEN, but even if I was I feel HAWKEN would have met those high expectations. The game has been purchased by a new developer recently who has been fixing bugs, adding a few new features, & slowly but surely working on creating new content for a game with a huge potential. It has been said that HAWKEN could very easily become the next Halo with a push in the right direction.\n\n____\n\nSETTINGS I WOULD RECOMMEND:  Boost/Dodge Mode: By default, the boost/dodge/quickturn is set to doubletapping left/right/forward/back. This is known to be slightly unreliable & is recommended to toggle the option. Toggling makes it so (when using default wsad) pressing [Shift]+[W] will boost you forward, [Shift]+[A/D] dodges sideways, & [Shift]+[S] 180-quickturns. If you are already pressing [A] or [D], pressing Shift will make you dodge immediately rather than having to release the [A] or [D] & press it again. This will save your life more than once! Additionally, (most) games will have you press [Shift] for sprinting rather than doubletapping [W] but this could also be personal preference. Unfortunately, you are unable to have both options at once.\n\nChat/Radar: Move the chat to the bottom-left, where it should be by default. The in-game voice chat is currently broken, so at times important information or team-strategies will be posted in chat & when the chat is up at the top people are less likely to read/notice it. This also has the happy-side effect of placing the radar in the top left/right, where it will probably feel more natural (most MMORPGs or other games in general have their radar/map in a top corner).\n\nProfanity Filter: This is obviously optional, but there IS an option to disable it. If you go into the [Game Settings] & scroll down to the bottom, there is a profanity filter you're able to un-check.\n\n__\n\nBONUS:EDSF over WSAD: This isn't related to HAWKEN specifically, but any WSAD controlled game in general. Thanks to a good friend of mine who converted me, I now try to inform anybody else on using EDSF over WSAD as it comes with MANY advantages with only one disadvantage.\nYour fingers stay on 'home-row position'. In games like HAKWEN, L4D2, Minecraft, or any other game where you may end up typing at all you no longer have to move your hand right & left for typing. You're able to type a quick message, send it, then continue controlling the game without moving your hand potentially in the wrong spot leading to death, accidental item usage, or anything else. Your fingers can now stay planted on ASDF for typing & gaming!\nMOAR KEYS! With traditional WSAD, your pinky has control over: [Ctrl], [Shift], [Tab] kind of, aaaaaand … nope that's it. Two maybe 3 keys. With ESDF, your pinky can still easily reach [Shift] & [Tab] (less so [Ctrl] but it's doable if you need it (& it was 'less so [Tab] for WSAD anyway)), but now your pinky gets to use [~] [1] [Q] [A] [Z] & [Alt] in addition!\nThat's a 'profit' of 6 extra keys, or 3 if your fingers are too small to include the [~]/[1]/[Alt] as a pinky-key presses (& I press [Alt] with my thumb, anyway). That's 3-6 extra buttons for abilities, macros, items, toggles, or whatever else without sacrificing any keys (keep in mind the pinky still has [Ctrl](ish) [Shift] & [Tab] just like before) for any other fingers since they all simply shift one key to the right. Instead of pressing [E] for 'Use' it's [R], & instead of [R] for 'Reload' where applicable it's [T], instead of 'Flashlight' being [F] it'd be [G], etcetera etcetera. The letter on the key is different, but the muscle-memory movement is still the same so there's no having to readjust or re-learn the key presses you've known for years.\nThe ONLY disadvantage of EDSF … is having to remap keys. By default games have a WSAD-based control scheme so before playing you'll typically need to move every key one key to the right so it's based around EDSF, but that's a one-time deal per game.

Pairing up for a match only to see 1 mech on the other team trash your whole team solo is not uncommon as are game end scores of 40 to 0. Another fun thing have you found some one cheating in game?

I loaded up the game and I was unaware they reset everything but I assumed it should be expected when a game enters a different testing phase.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chainj/recommended/271290/","chainj","FistOfPuberty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chainj/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor me, HAWKEN has been the most fun I've ever had in a video game. It's fast-paced, it's challenging, and it's badass. Today, however, the game has its fair share of flaws. (Please note: I have not tried every mech out, and therefore I don't have comprehensive experience of weapons and mechs.)\n\nThe good:\nThe game is incredibly challenging. Often times, victory depends on both teamwork and on personal skill. Sticking with your teammates often results in victory.\nHAWKEN offers a unique combat system, where your turn speed is locked at a certain level to make combat more interesting.\nThe default starter mech, the CR-T Recruit, is well-balanced and very powerful in the right hands. (EDIT 4/3/2015 The mech for new players is now officially the Assault mech, and the plans for the CR-T are unknown. Devs say it will be able to be bought seperately soon.)\nEvery* mech's special ability is very useful, and can be utilized in numerous situations. *Note that some mechs share the same ability (CR-T and the Assault mech).\nAll mechs have the ability to dodge left or right to avoid enemy fire. In addition, all mechs can fly for a short period of time.\nWeapons feel well-rounded and powerful against most enemies.\nThe game offers Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Missile Assault, Siege, Co-op Team Deathmatch, and Co-op Bot Destruction. There's plenty of variation in the gamemodes, but the same basic concept rings true: shoot the other mechs.\nMech customization / cosmetics (note that most cosmetics (excluding different crosshairs/reticles) can only be bought with Meteor credits, which cost real money)\nEach map, in detail and in gameplay, feels very different. The amount of detail put into maps is also commendable.\nThe game doesn't feel as though you can pay your way to glory. At least, not for very cheap.\n\nThe bad:\nThere's been a disturbing lack of new content in HAWKEN lately, and the reason for that (though the topic is hotly debated) is that the company (companies) that made HAWKEN have become unresponsive, and seem to be no longer servicing the game or its playerbase. Servers are still running, but developer forums and helpdesk have been shut down. (EDIT 4/3/2015: New developers have been introduced to Hawken. Hopefully, we'll see new content and bug fixes as time goes on.)\nTo gain enough HC (in-game, non-paid currency) to buy new mechs or parts for already-owned mechs, an intense amount of grinding is required. Despite the 250-HC bonus you can recieve (up to 6 times a day) for winning a match in any of the six gamemodes, there is still a lot of playtime required to buy the things you want.\nThe game doesn't really have a set storyline that's explained to players (...that I know of. feel free to correct me on this.). Looking for some kind of backstory on the nanovirus that has taken over the planet? Want to know more about Prosk or Sentium? You're outta luck.\nHacking is a notorious issue in HAWKEN, though I personally haven't found any hackers for certain in my time playing the game.\nThe playerbase is awfully small, with a little over 300 people playing at any given time. You'll start to recognize usernames pretty quickly. (EDIT 4/3/2015 As of today at 8:28 U.S. Central time, there are about 650 people playing HAWKEN. With enough time, the game might be able to build up a more sufficient playerbase.)\n\nVerdict:\nThough HAWKEN has its glaring flaws, I've had plenty of fun playing it. I reccomend this game to anybody looking for something new.","March 4, 2015","true","62.4"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","32","38","2","1"

Not so with Hawken, sure your encouraged to upgrade and improve but in general you can go pretty far with the default Mech.  You can play and earn your way to the next level of mech if you so choose to. You also get a chance to test drive or try before you buy the paid mechs.  I have been looking for a replacement for Mech Warrior the old Microsoft game and here we go.  No real story but far much better game play.  This is all multiplay all the time and does it very well. I also stay away from early access as well but this game has had few if any problems.  The changes have come in balance and other areas not in game crashing bugs. Great game great fun and as you can see I have wasted a small portion of my life on it.","December 24, 2014","true","231.8"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","0"

It's really a shame that all the people only playing it now never got to experience Hawken before the last few patches, because the developers have been content to run the game directly into the ground. The latest (and massive) changes to game's flow and pacing, the removal of mech performance customization in favor of a palty handful of pilot emblems and the flattening out of item levels have turned Hawken from a pretty enjoyable mech game to just another grindfest F2P shooter with a mech gimmick slapped on.

There are times when the game is a glorious battle for supremacy and gives great satisfaction on winning an encounter, and others where it will frustrate you to the point wanting to break your computer in half. It will reward you if played with strategic thought, and punish your mistakes in a brutal gladiatorial spectacle of wreckage.\n\nWhile one can quickly get a handle on the general mechanics of piloting the different mechs, it may take a bit of time to begin to master them all, and the learning curve at higher levels can be steep. The design over the last year of the beta phase has had many shifts and bumps on its road towards completion, but for the most part it has been fun playing, testing, and watching its growth.\n\nOverall I like the game, but I feel that it needs more time for polish than it is going to get before release, and could use a bit more content in the form of different game modes and maps. More content is on the way, according to the developer, but I find myself impatient in expectation of expanded play options. At present though, I believe a majority of those who join us on the Hawken battlefield in the next few months will like what they see and will have a mostly positive experience.\n\nSee you in battle.","March 22, 2014","true","6.8"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","34","45","0","5"

Stick to Co-op VS AI rounds till you understand the speed of the game and how each mech works. Also the veterans of this game are good! Do not under estimate your enemy and make sure you are aware of your team at all times. It is very common for one enemy to destroy your entire team as well as one new player as a team mate to lose you the match.\n\nIt is a challenge so keep with it and you will find one of the best mech shooters out there.

I get to stomp around in a giant battlesuit called a mech. It can boost into the air and fly. It can stomp. It has two legs to charge (or run away) and it has two arms which are guns! Koo koo cachoo baby! A masterpiece in graphics, sound and especially gameplay and 'feel'.\n\nI join a squadron of other mechs and go forth to conquer territory, capture missile silos and struggle to down enemy warships or hold a vital installation. Sometimes it's the straighford business of victory by body count. Sometimes it's  about line breaking, sometimes it's about standing your ground and sometimes it's just about surviving. Plays like a classic Unreal Engine shooter. PVP monster with with the feel of the epic and it boasts a respectable PVE co-op element.\n\nFree to play, but NOT pay to win. All mech upgrades can be bought with credits from match money - no boring grind out of proportion to gameplay here. The only things that *require* micropayments are cosmetic, or bundles you can make up one item of a time with your match money (received for every game played).\n\nIn addition to the quality of gameplay and feeling the phrenetic pandamonium as giant things smash each other to bits, this shooter looks like a graphically intense sim and has loads of development potential.

I play few FPS games, but those I do play I want several things from:\n\n* rely on teamwork (not key mashing, not hacking, not memorizing glitches in maps, not require popping speed)\n\n* atmosphere (I don't want to just pretend like I'm a war.  There's enough real war. Zombies? Cool.  Cyberpunk? Cool.)\n\n* competitive while still allowing for a life (not pay 2 win, not a ridiculous learning curve, no grinding)\n\n* decent graphics\n\nHawken delivers on all of these things.  After somewhere around a hundred hours of game play I spent $10 on decorative stuff in game as a thank you to the developers and encouragement to keep up the support.  I didn't need to spend a cent, and I chose not to spend any more in the next few hundred hours of game play.\n\nCombat moves fast for a giant robot game.  You're not zipping around on hovercraft or fighter jets and that's fine by me, nor are people teleporting beside you and vaporizing you.  I've gotten good enough to play in the top tier games, though I'm generally a little out-classed there.  I have plenty of fun with that challenge, and when I play lower-level games it's a easy blast that still manages to challenge because of the game's reliance on teamwork.\n\nAt the price tag (free!) this game has got to be one of my favorite games.  The only games that I've played to death like this are L4D2, Fallout 3, Witcher 3, Skyrim, and Secret World. Almost all of those games have hefty price tags and open worlds.  That says something about Hawken that it can keep my attention as well as those games.\n\nMy only complaints:\n* they could definitely stand to increase the number of maps\n* they could easily add more decorative options and make them a little cheaper.

The game released free from steam recently was a beta version, and new developers since have taken over trying to capitalize on the games potential. From the start new ownership has been able to clean up the stability issues due to the neglect of the game over time, and have come up with some good progressive strategies to allow the game to gain a following with the hopes of becoming a competitive game in the 'team fps' genre in the future. The problem here is in their attempt of trying to gain new players by offering advantages to start up, they have inadvertently opened the door for past players to start new accounts thereby exploiting the advantages crushing any true new comer. More measures need to be implemented to keep the game completely fair. Without the guarantees you would get with say DOTA that the game is cheat proof, the chances of serious competitive play are slim, and even worse you would see an exit of the core players that have kept the game alive to begin with.","May 14, 2015","true","349.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Crisp fast paced game play is just the core on a game like this. Any light as to why anyone who played this game wouldn't wish for it to brought back would just be unfitting in all cases. You'd have to hate FPS games with a passion not to become hooked on the may +pros this game carries. Much of the -cons include little matchmaking flaws on rare ocassions and much of a gring to get the mech you wish for. The pay to win comes in only when you can utilize certain weapons and/or internals to trump other mechs of the same class. If not then it mostly, if not fully, is skill based combat.\n\nThe pros can easily out weight the cons in my eyes still. That being said, it feels as if this is a crime to let such a gem sit here and be left uncut and unpolished.

Slower, more tactical aiming, careful maneuvering and possibly long and intense fights. However, Hawken delivers on none of these things.\n\nLooking at a game like cod, it has its strengths, and weaknesses. The strengths mostly lie in the gamemodes and killstreaks which change how you play the game in order to counter other players. Its weaknesses sometimes include poor mapping, repetitive gameplay, and either no challenge or an impossible one. But it still has its strengths which keep the game a float.\n\nIn Hawken, they tried new gamemodes, most notably being siege, but all that you're left with is either a long and tedious grudge match or a bulldozer that crushes you instantly, all because your team sucks. As for something like killstreaks, you're given items which you can only use so many times per life. But they're so painfully useless you wonder why you even bothered to use them in the first place. The maps aren't very good either and often have invisible walls where you wouldn't expect.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing more than point, shoot, and dodge as well as run away when neccessary. There is no strategy involved in aiming. You can't cripple legs or arms or get "headshots" for instance. The only time aiming at a specific point comes into play is when you're fighting Rocketeers in tank mode. Other than that, you can shoot a mech anywhere and do the same amount of damage.\n\nThis is just one of those games that seemed interested and fresh when it was announced, but is nothing more than a plane shooter similar to something like Combat Arms but with mechs. It also doesn't help that I haven't encountered a single player who could compete against me in some meaningful way, whereas in cod there's almost always one person you find every few matches that fits into that category.\n\nHawken isn't awful, but it isn't good either. It's something you play just to see what it's like and then realize there's nothing under the surface to keep you coming back.","February 16, 2014","false","4.4"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","32","47","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReEvolve/recommended/271290/","ReEvolve","ReEvolve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReEvolve/","113 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst of all: Yes, it'll be free2play soon. No, it's not pay2win (more about that later on).\n\nHawken isn't a twitch shooter but it can be very fast paced depending on what mech type (A, B, C) you use. Lots of people like to compare the game's pace to Quake when they play one of the light and fast A classes. Playing with slower and sturdier B s definitely slower and might be compared to the pace of BF2142 mechs. C classes are very slow and I'm not sure which game is best suited for a comparison. The game is definitely not similar to WoT. Some people like to compare it to CoD but the gameplay is totally different[community.playhawken.com]. It's hard for me to find the right comparison since Hawken's combination of gameplay mechanics make it pretty damn unique. It's also quite different from Titanfall.\n\nHawken is a class-based shooter. Each class is played differently due to the different stats (Health, heatsinks, turn cap, speed on the ground and in the air, hover height, radar range, amount of fuel, overheat cooldownetc.), it's unique special ability and the limited weapon selection (short/medium/long range weapons).\n\nA Hawken mech has two weapons and can use both at the same time. These weapons have unlimited ammo but they can overheat. Weapons cooling down after an overheat are equivalent to reloading in CoD but the player has a different choice: fire less/slower and you don't ever have to "reload". Most secondary weapons in Hawken have either a secondary firing mode (for example: a grenade launcher and a shogun in one single weapon[www.playhawken.com], dumb fire missles without lock on, heat seeking missles with lock on[www.playhawken.com]) or the ability to detonate a projectile mid air (for example: TOW rocket[www.playhawken.com], Grenade launcher[www.playhawken.com]). Since it's not possible to shoot through cover, AOE weapons that hit enemies "around the corner" are very useful in that situation.\n\nHawken has no crouching like other FPSs but instead it adds hovering, boosting, dodging (on the ground and in the air), and a 180 spin move (on the ground and in the air). Hawken has a turn cap and therfore a slight sluggish feeling. Due to the advanced movement sets Hawken players can use the verticality of the different maps and position themselves on roofs an ledges. Batttles are fought on the ground, in the air and across buildings. Since the latest patch removed the consumption of fuel the movements feels a lot faster now (more fuel to boost, more dodging in general).\n\nEach mech has up to 3 slots for different offensive and defensive items[www.playhawken.com]. There are different item types that determine how often you can use an item before you (there's a limited amount of items that resets on death). You can have up to 6 different internals which give you either a passive ability (faster health collection from orbs) or entirely new movement sets (air dodging). Take a look at this upgrading info page[www.playhawken.com].\n\nHawken has no self healing like other FPSs so you either have to repair yourself and be defenseless or you sacrifice your internal slots to get a similar self healing ability. You can also spot enemies and ask for help by pressing a key.\n\nNow, let's talk about pay2win. Hawken is not pay2win but it's "pay not to grind". There is a big difference there. Weapons that have to be unlocked aren't better by definition. They just play differently. It's all about finding the weapon that suits your playstyle the best. Try looking at it from this perspective: The grinding gives you time to train with the stuff you have. A player who bought all kinds of stuff will still be worse than a player who earned his stuff. Yes, having more equipment gives the enemy a small advantage but it's nothing that can't be overcome by skill.\n\nAll game influencing items/weapons/internals/mechs etc. can be bought with the ingame currency that you get for playing (Hawken Credits = HC). The only items that have to be purchased with real money (Meteor Credits = MC) are completely cosmetic and don't impact the gameplay.\n\nAbout the grinding: You usually 130-170 HC per TDM match (one match = 10 minutes). There's also a "daily win" bonus that gives you 250 HC each day in every game mode (so you can get 1000 each day). If you play for one hour each day you'll be able to buy the most expensive mech (12000 HC) in the game after about one and a half weeks. Anyway, most mechs only cost 4000-7500 HC. So you can buy 1-2 mechs each week. I don't think that the grind is that bad.\n\nWell, there's information about the gameplay on the Steam store page. If you want to see some gameplay, I'd recommenend taking a look at these:\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/mrxacius/profile\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/shanedebruge/videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIBnr2y0CzVtVufYbPLteWQhPpIdltgdx\n\nI like the game a lot since it plays very differently compared to generic FPSs like CoD and BF. It's fast paced and rewards planning ahead, working in a team and actual skill more than twitch reflexes and having a high level. The gap between veterans and newbies was steadily decreased over the last few patches to make this game a lot more competitive (for example the removal of customization options that favored pilots with a high level more than pilots with a low level).\n\nAnyway, you can also check out the official game guide[www.playhawken.com] to get an overview about what Hawken has to offer.","February 15, 2014","true","157.5"," 59 of 96 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","59","96","0","0"

Weapons are not balanced at all. Many are far superior than others which makes the game feel like you are pushed into a specific position. 3. You can end up queued for a match that is practically over, and then, as if that wasn't enough, you get to go through the score screen which wastes even more of your time. 4. None of the mechs feel anymore unique than any other. To top it all off, I'd say most of my time is being spent looking at loading screens, which isn't exactly why I play video games. Overall, I think these need to be addressed before anyone continues to play this game, let alone purchase it.

(I couldn't play titanfall because it kept making me want to play this game)\n\nYes this game is F2P which normally means it's Pay 2 Win. But honestly I was amazed at how little (or none) advantage you get from the upgrades. The only thing that's worth paying for is different mechs as they use different weapons, and if you want to use a different type of weapon, you'll need to fork out to get a different mech, or play the game a stupid amount of hours to earn enough ingame money. (If you want different mechs, or want every thing this game can possibly offer not including skins, buy a bundle, you'll pay once like any other game and have all you want, except skins...)\n\nThe default mech you recieve for free is perfectly balanced with the other 'medium sized' mechs, there is 3 sizes, light medium and large, all play together and all are supposed to be 'equal' they mostely are but it really depends on how you use them. There is a higher learning curve on the smaller mechs as you have to really make full use of your small agility boost or you'll die in 2 hits, larger mechs allow beginners to be a bit more lazy, especially if you find someone to repair you.\n\nIf you're a first time player, or not in a light mech make sure you always hang around your team mates! :) or prepare to be frustrated :(","July 18, 2014","true","39.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

A comparasion I could use is CSGO as that's only got a few gamemodes and is repetetive yet the gameplay makes up for it.\nThe mechs are diverse and fun to use coming with unique playstyles and a real element of teamwork  and dynamic between them when in action. There is also a good range of weapons  specific to certain mechs that are unlocked at each stage of the players progression on that mech.\nThe gamemodes are also few but interesting and engaging: some objective based and some deathmatch based. Siege is like the CSGO competetive of the game in the sense that it's the biggest gamemode (And its ♥♥♥♥ing awesome). Personally I think the gameplay is a lot less repetetive than CSGO but just as unique.\nGraphics and effects are fantasic yet not at all demanding and the audio is immersive coming with a chest pumping soundtrack.\nHowever the gameplay might not be for some people- the movement system takes hours of practice and perfection even though the tutorial covers most of it. Plays have to learn how the movement system applies to their mech specifically and get a feel for the whole thing. There is a real feeling that the mechs have weight and are not super nimble and agile although this can be overcome with lighter mechs and practice. The game puts new players in a good all rounder mech that gives them a good chance when starting out though. You will still get mowed down by seasoned players though so don't give up.\nAnother thing I should mention is that the game has had hardly any development for ages since the game got new publishers. Everything is quite shady and it seems a little lifeless when it comes to development news and intimacy between devs and players. This is because the devs are currently working on fixing the coding due to some problems they ran into. After this they say they will work on 'polishing the performance' of the game more. They then say they will add new content after this and enter- and I quote- "launch season- that wonderful time of year when a game gets to show if how much its been training in the off-season". All the tutorials and reviews are at least 2-3 years old now. I wouldn't say the game is dead at all; I would just say it's dormant. There is a huge decline in players though- across all servers. I would say on average I only see 40 players on at a time. The only gamemodes with people on are TDM and siege- and siege is if you're lucky (people do play other gamemodes but on rare occasions).\nSpeaking of players and player interaction there is a distinct lack of mechanics in the game that encourage it. Push to talk is broken and the only social part of the game is a friends list and a 6 v 6 party match gamemode (nobody ever plays that gamemode though).","March 26","true","104.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

You can get every mech in the game without spending a dime. All Mechs and weapons can be bought using the Hawken equivalent of IP, and customizations can be purchased with the Hawken RP.\n\nSecond, I'd like to say that I am an oldschool gamer and a die-hard fan of the Mechwarrior series. I first turned to Mechwarrior Online, but that game was a bitter dissapointment. You would only get one life per match, and the matchmaking was terrible. Once you died, you were out for the 20 minute plus snail race of a match. I had given up on Mechs for a long while, but then I saw HAWKEN.\n\nI honestly love this game so much I don't know how to begin.\nThis game is fast paced. Unlike Mechwarrior Online, you respawn within ten seconds of your death, and the matches are always a brisk ten minutes in duration. Where as MechWO was needlessly complicated with no tutorial, This game is very easy to learn. At the same time, it is difficult to master, so don't think you won't be challenged. Everything is about skill, with perhaps a bit of luck thrown in as well. Team battles are tactical, yet don't panic if you get a bad team because a few skilled players can sometimes carry an entire team.\nEach mech has a different unique ability, and a playstyle that maches. You can spend countless hours learning, mastering, and perfecting each one. My personal favorite is the Predator, who can remain indefinitely invisible, but firing turns of the cloak for a few seconds, and getting shot gives you about a 15 second cooldown. Each mech has default weapons, and then a few alternative weapons that you can unlock using the currency you gain from completing missions.  Mechs are very fairly balanced, and every month or so a new patch is added to balance things further and add new content.\nThere are multiple game types to play, including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Siege (a king of the hill-esque game mode), and a co-op vs AI mode that actually is extremely difficult and entertaining. Do NOT neglect these matches because they are awesome.\n\nTL; DR\nBest Mech game out there.\nThis game is wicked sick with high-speed mech battles, explosions, and epic chases. If you aren't careful you will never stop playing. Great game to play with friends or by yourself :)\nI'd tell you to buy it right now, BUT IT'S FREE!!!!","October 15, 2014","true","84.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

It has big potential to grow into something big after the Early Access.\n\nSo, basically this is a FPS game. You are inside a mech and you have to destroy your enemies. There are several game modes, such as deathmatch and capture-the-base style. You can check the discription of the game for more details.\nThere are 3 types of mechs: Light (high mobility and less health) Medium (Everything medium) and Heavy (high health and less mobility). Every mech is balanced and it's really fun to play with everyone of them. You can customize your mech in almost every aspect. There are points you gain after every match and you can spend them for buying new mechs and to upgrade their weapons. But here is one thing - you can pay for other points if you want better visuals, or to unlock an upgrade early (it will unlock anyway, but at level 3,5,10 and ect.) which is your decision to make, if you have money and want to support the developers. It's not one of the pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts out there.\nThe graphics are good. The sound is good. I don't know anything negative about this game at all.

I've been playing this game since Beta and it's absolutely gorgeous. Fast and fluid. Intense and gritty. If you're looking for a fast paced mech' combat fps, this tops the genre. It allows you to play fast, furious, and twitch without suspending the disbelief that you are piloting a massive combat robot. So many things add to the flavor. Different mechs have different abilities, different classes of mech provide differences in speed, health, and weaponry. It's a little more polished and refined than it was when it was still the independant indie game that hadn't yet been picked up by Steam. There are things I dislike, such as getting rid of the skill trees, but it truly is better off in the long run. It's also free to play! There are in game purchases, but if you put a little time in you can buy your own mechs with the in game currency quick enough. You just have to know what game mode to play. I suggest Seige. Collect and return all the EU you can to get mad money. Game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Missle Command, and Seige. Deathmatch I does not need an explaination. In missle command, you have to capture nav points basically, which are essentially giant missle turrets that shoot at your enemies mother ship. In seige, you collect energy units, or EU, and return it to base in order to launch your teams mothership. Once launched, your team has to defend the only anti-air turret on the map so your mothership can go and pummel the enemies base, whilst your enemy is trying to do the same to you.

It's a complete bug house. And a backslide from its 2012 status. Don't buy the hype from the video all those awards were won by a completely different game.\n- Maps are "sticky" you will get hung up on pebbles and grass.\n- Ping spikes for no reason or sits at 200+ even in regional server.\n- VOIP is still broken after being "a priority" for 8 months now.\n- Balance is pretty mediocre compared to how it used to be, AKA no real progress.\n- Money model v grind factor is pretty bad.\n- You might get a new mech about 10 hours of gameplay in if you don't buy any internals or items for your starter mech.\n- Game claims to be all about aim but has lock on rockets that rarely miss even when the didge is timed properly. Doesn't matter though most teams stack 3-4 of these mechs and a "medic" class and the game becomes a boring peekaboo fest. Hard to die when an enemy can't dodge your main damage weapon unless they're facehugging you.\n- The old HUD is gone and has been replaced by a BF4/COD clone.\n- The new reticle is just this side of invisible.\nEDIT:\n- VOIP is still broken after a year of being "a priority" for them to fix.\n- Clan system is still non-existant after 2 years of empty promises.\n- Friends list wipes randomly every few weeks. And has since, forever.\n- They fired their competitive side guys so it's unlikely we'll see the promise competitive style Hawken that has been boasted all along.\n- They havent released a single new skin since the first closed Beta.\n\nHonestly all of this games issues boil down to laziness or incompetence. I prefer to say incompetence because if people are too lazy to fix the thing that's going to be making them money. Well then damn that's just sad on an epic level. I really think someone else did the initial development, they stole it or bought it or something and have completely driven it into the ground since 2012. I'll say it again, There's a reason it won all those awards way back then and isn't even a blip on the radar now.\n\nAll in all after 2 years of development this is a let down and that's extremely sad. The game has stagnated from its high hype debut in 2012. The dev team has no clue which way it wants to go with anything and the overall feel is one of incompetence. Just let this title slide right by you I loved this game so long ago and tried to force myself to love it again.

I have played all types of computer games and I have followed the Mech Warrior franchise as well. There simply is no comparing any other game (including mechs) to Hawken. It is simply one of a kind and has its own genuine feel like Team fortress 2, Don't Starve, or Jedi Knights II Jedi Outcast. I strongly recommend downloading it and playing it for the experience alone if nothing else.\n\nI played Hawken during the first 3 months of open beta and took a break until January this year and have been playing ever since. From my 3 months of experience with the old game developers, Adhesive Games and Meteor Entertainment were incredibly slow to respond to the community.\n\nRight now, the new developers are completely different. Developers from Reloaded Games have jumped on teamspeak and have had several Q&A sessions with both long time devoted members of the community and more casual players like me. You can find these sessions on youtube and twitch. The forums have been restored, mayhem and fight club servers are running and I have definitely noticed a rise in the population. The new developers have been very active in listening to the community.\n\n"The developers say what they do and do what they say."\n\nThe new developers ask for the community's input to make important decisions. They explain their current line of thought, outline preliminary expectations and options and set reasonable deadlines for community feedback usually around 3 days to a week depending on the issue. They follow up. The developers say what they do and do what they say. They act based on our feedback and their expertise. I am very optimistic about what the next 3 months will bring as the developers work their way through the code.\n\nThe game has relatively low complexity but amazing depth once you figure out the basics(dodging, detonating projectiles, using cover). You are given the CRT starter mech that is essentially the strongest mech in the game. I have only mastered this type of mech (CRT/Assault) but I have been actively trying other mechs. Each class of mech feels completely different from one another in terms of strategy but the basics are still the same.\n\nGame modes include the typical deathmatch and team deathmatch but also include missile assault (capture and hold) and siege mode where you collect energy to launch a ship that deals damage to and ultimately destroys an enemy base while you fight for control for an anti-air turret that brings these ships down just as quickly as they launched.\n\nSeriously download the game (for free) and try it out. Hawken is an amazing gem that deserves at least a try.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you found this review helpful,\nbluebaron201","March 30, 2015","true","208.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I think that I should give this game some credit - as a game, it's superb. The design and style of the mechs, the maps, and the GUI make for a very immersive feel, as they all slot together so well; the depiction of the HUD as the inside of the mech also really puts you in the shoes of who you're playing as. Fights are very, very intense, with often entire teams full of mechs saturating a single capture point: flying over one another, swiftly dodging attacks, etc. - there's so much to take in, all at once, and it's brilliant!\n\nThe mechs are cleverly designed in aesthetics and otherwise, being appropriately balanced, and also, having an entire arsenal of unlocks to compliment the strengths of your mechs. The classes a varied and defined, and this game can cater for all playing styles that we typically see in a modern FPS. Furthermore, there is a good sense of personalisation for your mechs, because you can choose which retrofits, (or interior mechanisms), you'd like to install on your mechs to aid you in battle, and also, changing the appearance of your mechs is also easy, for a small price. The customisation options are very broad, from simply changing colours, to completely replacing your thrusters and hull!\n\nHAWKEN has a series of interesting game modes that it has to offer, from simple deathmatches, to attacks on bases that can last up to half an hour - sometimes more, and each game mode can have varying pace and intensity of combat. While I personally feel that HAWKEN could offer more in terms of game modes, I can appreciate the situation that the current developers are in, (it's quite a sticky one), and can also enjoy the excellent modes that we already have.\n\nSo, for an Early Access game, this one is fantastic. It really is. It feels so nice to play, everything is smooth and well-oiled, and the design and customisation elements of the game are superb. HAWKEN has to have one of the most well-continued and expressed art styles, (resembling something dystopian) that is consistent throughout all areas of aesthetic design, that I have ever seen, and as an FPS, well: it's fun, it's fast, and there's a heap of classes that you can choose from and kit out to your heart's content! While the developers are having a difficult time at present, and the game is indeed lacking in some areas, it's kept me coming back, and so many others too. For an F2P EA shooter, this is astoundingly good, and great fun to play!\n\nI'd give it a good 8/10, for now. I'm sure that, given time, that score will increase! Good luck HAWKEN, and good luck to those of you who start playing! You won't regret joining!","February 21","true","71.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Haven't experienced any lag or discontent while playing. There's a varity of mechs, techs and equipment one can equip to suit there needs and it's fairly good concept. My personal preference was a mech that took less damage on boost or dodge along with the utility that let me dodge in midair. (Felt like GunZ1 sometimes)\n\nMost of my deaths are purely getting outnumbered or not understanding the type of mech I've fighting against, meaning that there wasn't anything broken or overpowered that I'd rage against.

This game has nothing to do with mechs, it is simply a cash grab by the developers to get possible mech fans to play their game as it stands now it has more in common with twitch shooters then any mech game.  There is minimal effort to make this game stand out positively against all the other successful and well known mech games.  There is minimal to zero customization for your so called "mechs" which are also few and far between, the customizations range from moderately cheap to beyond overpriced for a cosmetic addition/change.\n\nThe "mechs" handle like garbage and the developers has seen fit to make the actual collision box much larger then the actual model because you will knock into/drag against/get trapped by the poorly made and jagged edges of the maps all of the time even though you are clearly smaller or more thin.  You will also constantly get stuck or trapped by the clumsy mech handling, apparently in this poorly thought of future these war machines can become stuck or stopped by a simple PIPE.  The dodge mechanic is honestly not very well done comparing it to other games that use the same feature.  To add to the poor handling the developers have purposefully put in negative mouse acceleration, meaning that any quick movements will immediately be met with an invisible wall that will slow your turning to a crawl.  Why did they add this?  Well the excuse was to “simulate what a mech would actually do” which is not the case as if you move your mouse slowly you actually turn quicker then if you just tried to spin around, again nothing but a poor excuse for bad design.\n\nThe actual weapons are boring and over used on almost all of the "mechs" and if you want a different weapon you'll need to buy one with either real money or grind for 24 hours in order to find a "mech" that has Some kind of different weapon, they also have almost zero impact behind them and all feel very flaccid when firing any kind of weapon.  Others are downright over powered and are only on a few "mech" configurations which again cost large sums of money.  Others still are overpowered simply because of the high time to kill that was just introduced which turns these "mechs" into paper.\n\nThe coop is a joke which is simply a tacked on feature so they can add “COOP” to the game description.  The waves are ridiculous, the friendly AI is just awful and does not progress AT ALL unlike the enemy AI which is so “smart” that it knows where you are.  Of course by “smart” I mean that the developers are so bad at what they do that they rely on padding the difficulty by giving the enemy AI hyper accuracy, damage, armor, the ability to see and hit any player on the map no matter how much stuff is in the way or if a single pixel is showing AND they follow you throughout the entire map.  So help you if you get into a match and just one of your 4 team mates drops or rage quits, the replacement AI is just the worst I have ever seen in a modern PC game, if it gradually increased in ability and intelligence like the opponent AI seems to then it would actually be half decent but instead you get the weakest partner ever and GOD help you if more then 1 person drops from the room.  The boss waves are just awful simply giving a basic “mech” unbelievable amounts of armor, speed, movement speed, damage, accuracy and on top of all of that later boss matches you will fighting 2 then 3.  The difficulty of the enemy bots also does not gradually increase it skyrockets past 4 or 5 and continues to increase without giving the players effective ways of countering.  Floating bots also prove to be problematic as the developers again have found the only way to add fake difficulty is to spam cheap units, units like floating bombs have a pixel sized hitbox, are able to take way too many hits and once they have started their run they are outright impossible to kill with basic weapons.  There is nothing like being hit one after another by flying bombs, unable to do a single thing because they are mixed EMP (which already lasts far too long) and explosives and the way the game is made you will be brought down quickly simply because the developers made it impossible to realistically deal with this threat on top of everything else that is trying to kill you.\n\nThe maps are very small and claustrophobic, again very reminiscent of many twitch shooters on top of all of that there are very few maps to play on and even less if you favor a particular game mode.  The in game team balancer is awful and will almost always pit low ranking players against top rank 30s who have months worth of hours under their belt making almost every match very on sided.  All of this on top of a very grindy progression system that does not reward any style of play other then hours and days, that is unless you wish to pay real money then by all means pay, regardless of how well or poorly you do, winning or loosing team you will get close to the same low amount of in game money and experience points that you always get thus making game painful to play and makes every purchase that you make possibly bankrupting if you buy the wrong over price item/”mech”/cosmetic item.\n\nI honestly had very high hopes for this game, missing the mech scene I saw promise in an independent developer making a mech game that was a bit more action based rather then simulation.  However what they did was hype up their product far too early and was not able to deliver even close to what they promised or hyped the game to be.  This should be a clue that the game is not very successful or playable the game has been Beta form for around 2 plus years.  I signed up for the closed beta the first chance that I got however I never got around to playing it simply because I was unsure of the game style.  The community that makes up this game follows the very typical rabid unquestioning groups much like the generations of players who play any of the recent COD:MW games, any one who dares to question the balance/gameplay/controls/handling ect will be ruthlessly stifled and pushed aside, even to the extent of the developers and mod staff on Hawken’s own website.\n\nThe developers at Hawken moved to Steam just recently only to gain more public interest and possibly sucker in more players seeing mechs and flashy graphics; that is the only reason why they moved to Steam.  The game is empty almost half of the time and half of the available servers are either full or are basic game modes that quickly turn into one sided fights.  This again should make any possible person who could be interested in this game realize that this game has almost no staying power, even with this new move to Steam the likelihood of the game getting a wider audience is unlikely or people will play it for a month and get tired of it because of how tedious, boring and far from enjoyable it is.\n\nHowever luckily it is free to play (not anymore) and partially pay to win when you look at the other weapons on the more expensive “mechs” which actually have effective weapons, so if you wish to try it out go ahead but be warned anyone looking for mech game should stay far away from these types of games, including MW:O.\n\n**edit** With their move to Steam the development team has decided to tell any new players to PAY for this Free to play game, $30, now if that doesn't scream scam or heavy handed I don't know what does.  Just like a lot of recent beta or early access games that have come out in the past few months charging full price for a product that is not even Close to finished it disgusts me that development teams would charge people for the privilege of playing a beta and testing the game before it is released.","February 12, 2014","false","106.3"," 42 of 71 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","42","71","0","2"

I have little experience with games like this, apart from 2 hours playing CoD Black Ops at a friend's house. This is a really fun game, with the best soundtrack ever. I still barely understand how the garage works, and am still getting used to most of the manuvers. Also, the chat settings has a profanity filter (thank god) and most of the time the people you play with are nice anyway. I only own one mech (I think...), but you can take others out for test runs. But the thing is, if your computer is slow, you will have lag like you won't believe. My computer is probably below average when it comes to speed, and sometimes it runs really smooth, no problems, and sometimes it lags to unplayable, even with the lowest video settings.\n\nOverall, definitely get it unless your computer is slow, because I get the feeling someday it will be a paid game, it's that good.\n\nOh, and P.S.  You need a Meteor account to play. It's easy to sign up and they don't email you constantly with updates, like Skype does. (ugh). You need to log in every time you play.\n\nP.P.S. As it needs to sync your account and stats before you can start playing, it takes a few minutes to set up if your computer is as slow as mine, but it is well worth it.","June 6, 2015","true","5.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

I could play this game all night. Also, what is cool is that you cant just go out blazing. The mechs are class based.

There are not many people on any servers except the north american one, so that forces me to play with a high ping (I live in Australia). Playing with a high ping is difficult in this game because of its fast-paced nature, but I did spend a reasonable amount of hours doing so. Also, the matchmaking sucks, but it does give you the option to pick a server for yourself which I find very handy. You can't play offline, and to finish that off you will need a reasonably good graphics card to run this game 1080p 60fps, especially on the map 'LAST ECO'.\n\nNow for the good things about this game. There are a variety of game modes, and I enjoy them all. Team deathmatch, Deathmatch, Seige, Missile assault, Co-op bot destruction, Co-op team deathmatch etc.\nThe graphics quality is awesome. It looks amazing.\nThe community may be small, but it is good. The players are often courteous and active, and people who idle are kicked automatically. Some people say that the mechs are unbalanced. Well it's not the dev's fault you're just s**t, is it?\nThe devs have made the game in a way that all mechs are equally balanced, and they also all cost the same amount. People are just good at different types of mechs.\nI personally love the reaper mech because it is fast, accurate and it causes a reasonable amount of damage. But if 3 or 4 rockets hit you you are done for. To compensate for this you can boost in all directions to confuse your enemy. Or you can put up a tactical shield or put down a turret. But in a way all mechs are like this. They have their pros and cons. I've seen every type of mech own the field.\n\nOverall this is one of the best games that i've played. The game mechanics as well as the wide variety of classes just seal the deal.\nNothing beats strolling around in a giant humanoid tank.","January 12","true","92.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","1"

The main issue was that the countermeasure system used to be a PvP thing instead of strictly PvE items, which caused a lot of pay-to-win controversy. And honestly, it was. A person who payed money could then funnel all their leftover XP into countermeasures for a noticeable advantage. They eventually learned and finally removed the system from competitive PvP play, but it was too late. The damage had already been done.\n\nThe game has now unfortunately faded into another one of those obscure F2P titles that only has a couple hundred people playing at any given time. The game now stands as yet another example of how F2P with bad business models can ruin their reputation forever, regardless whether or not the problems are later fixed.\n\nThat being said, the game is still a lot of fun and filled with life. Graphics are well done, gameplay is extremely well designed, there are plenty of customization options for your mechs, and the business model is no longer pay2win. It's worth a try. Just don't expect any major competitive scene or tournaments with cash prizes on the line.","May 11, 2015","true","19.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Seriously, everything is life based.  Hitting someone in the arm, leg or body all has the same damage effect.\nLimited customization.  Check the website, everything you see there is exactly how it is.  Every mech gets 2 guns, one of which is swappable with a limited number of options (1-2 alternates).\nUsing micro-transactions, you can make any mech look like a different model mech.  This makes battlefield identification pointless.\nVisual distinction is kind of funny.  You can unlock one alternate model and one camo for each mech.  Everything else must be purchased.  The funny part is that you cannot use the camo on the alternate models.\n\nThis is not a mech game.  It's a standard fps with jetpacks where your player model happens to be shaped sort of like a mech.\n\nHawken is not a bad game.  I spent $10 to buy into the early entry and played it up to 14 hours a day during a week waiting for a different game to release a new content patch.  I don't feel like I want a refund, but I also don't feel like it's worth much more than $10 or more than a casual play style.\n\nOverall: extremely underwhelming","February 25, 2014","false","46.4"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","33","56","0","5"

What could be better than riding a badass robot and start shooting stuffs to each other? The answer is—you guessed it—this game: HAWKEN.\n\nNot only cool, this game is also well-balanced and really fun to play. There are several mechanics and quirks that need some reading to know how it works, but essentially they're simple enough to learn.\n\nThe tutorial is also very helpful. It gives you some essential stuffs and make sure you've got a hang on your ride before you hit the roads, like how to detonate the Assault-class rockets in mid-air or doing a 180 spin, which is now being my main tactic of maneuver after getting used on it. Maybe it sounds like any other tutorials in any games, but where else you'll be guided through the tutorial by a chick? (lol)\n\nI have a tradition of trying every available classes in any games, but as I write this review I don't have trying the heavy-class mechs (and from this point I'll call the robots as 'mechs') yet. So far I stick my butt on a Reaper-class light sniper and everything's just right; the speed, the maneuver, the weight, the effects, everything. Switch into Predator-class stealth-ambush raider and see when you acitvate its ability. Very neat.\n\nThe developer would say they're polishing this game, but as far as I've seen, every of the aspects in the game are well done. The graphics are breath-taking although I have to get used with the terrains and stuffs to spot enemies ahead.\n\nTalking about the mechs, all I can say is "dayum these are the rides I'm looking for!" However, there are still lack of custom frames and other customizations especially in mech designs and weaponry, although the developer has given some options to choose. Just my opinion, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\ntl;dr\nPros:\n- Versatile gameplay: you can be what you want, but you have to get used with it first.\n- Easy-to-adapt quirks\n- Breath-taking graphics\n- Has myriad of possible tactics applied\n- Neat sounds: you'll love the thump-thump sound of cannon slugs hit your foe's mech\n- Laila :D (lol jk, but seriously the tutorials are helpful for newcomers)\n\nCons:\n- Lacks of players. Really, sometimes I be like "where's everyone?!"\n- Lacks of available custom parts especially those purchasable with HC\n\nMore pros than cons. 8/10","December 9, 2015","true","11.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","12","17","3","1"

So, if you are a gamer that likes to switch classes, you are going to spend time grinding until you unlock enough HC (earned credits) or outright buy MC (purchased credits).  All the upgrades are cool, but they are definitely trying to entice you to skip the grind and paying cash for the game.  Screw that.  I bought into the Nemesis pack thinking that I'd unlock everything like some other games (*cough* Tribes *cough)... essentially paying for a full game to help the devs.  This is NOT the case.  You get a partial game.\n\nExample: sucks seeing other players air dodge but you can't because you haven't purchased that particular unlock.  Screw.  That.  Noise.  If I wanted to switch to a different mech, well, pretty much everything I've "bought" / earned in-game does not transfer to that mech.\n\nPass.  Done playing.

It was probably the only game I was excited of lvling up and getting better guns and honing my skills. The game mechanics were wonderful which included dodging, shooting flying, overheating, and blowing up; the community was decent. The cockpit view was so immersive; I actually felt like I was putting my life on the line fighting in a scrubby mech-but doing fairly well (I only used the godly Toaster, I love that thing). I don't know what happened. I heard that their game design/ management didn't go well. Gdammit. I loved this game. What a gdam shame. If they revive the game, and the player base comes back up, I'm sure to get back into the game.... I'm just depressed how Hawken shatterd like glass. I strongly reccomend to try it out though.  Its a whole new experience.\nEdit: May 2, 2015\n\nActually I am now back in the game!!! The last developers drove the game to the ground, but new developers have picked it up!!! They are coming up with game some game improvements and more content. Keep in mind though, that the new devs will need some time to bring the game back into full action. They are in the process of fixing bugs and other problems from the last devs.  Go play it!!

They stay true to this basic concept, and because the art style is based on improvised robots, they made all of the weaponry/armor/speed seem like it was all just thrown togeether with duct tape. That, is a true testament on how well thought out this game is.\n\nOn the down side, the early access on Steam feature made it not Free to play for new players. This is because Meteor Entertainment, a small, indie game company, needs to expand it's servers to accomidate the sudden tsunami of new players coming from Steam. Thus, they made it not free for new players. It was free, however, if you signed up and played in the closed beta. Sad times for new players.\n\n:C\n\nAnyways, overall this game is awesome for a guy who was raised around Quake Arena and/or Unreal Tournament, for it is fast-paced and intense. The good news is that there are next to no campers, since the 'camping' prospect is only reserved for those who are in Sharpshooter and/or Reaper mechs. Outside of that, you cannot destroy other mechs by yourself. You have to work as a team to secure your victory, since the other team is doing the same. If you don't work together accurately, the other team (who is usually accutate and coordinated,) will reach the max kill limit of 40 before the 10-minute timer is up.\n\nIf you can, and if you are impatient, then I would definetly reccomend this game before and anfter it's official launch.\n\nHappy fighting!","February 11, 2014","true","35.9"," 115 of 213 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","115","213","0","10"

This is a game i love to hate . After several thousand hours of game play on 2 different accounts I believe it's time to let it go . This journey all started for me back in 1995 after i purchased a black with blue trim IBM PC . I also played a mech game that I just loved to play . Years went by and I searched from time to time for a game like the one i remembered from the past and MWO just didn't fill the bill for me. Finally there was hope and I got an invite to be a alpha tester in a game that looked all too promising , Hawken is the game I had been searching for all these years. Beautiful graphics , stunning physX effects and some really great guys and gals to play with online , to all of you it's been my pleasure to play online with you all and all of you have taught me something so thanks for the best GG's ever.\n\nUnfortunately for me this game has the biggest balance problems I have ever seen . I have litterally watched it unbalance it's self 3 to 4 times in the same game setting. Most games are one sided and you either win big or loose big . I agree it has gotten somewhat better but balance has a long way to go .\n\nI played this game with 2 - 770's 4gb in sli and frame rate drops are crazy , I would go from 121 fps to 60 even 50 fps for no reason and on my monitor there was a definite difference in game play. Optimization sucks for my hardware and no I don't have this problem on other games I play , it is Hawken Optimization .\n\nConclusion : This a great eye candy game with a wonderful community and neat experiance but now I must do my job as a tester and say I can't recommend this game due to the balance issues and optimization that i was hoping for to be repaired by now , since 2012 when i first signed up.\n\nYou guys may still see me from time to time but for now I need a break from all the issues this game has . I don't think i'll see it as my go to game anymore rather something to do when I'm board or just a reminder of a game I wish it could of been.  I will truely miss you great players.\n\nThanks for your time\nLittlebuck0211 / Ol' MechDonald","May 16, 2015","false","701.2"," 35 of 62 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","35","62","5","3"

I tried RoboCraft and grinded that for about a few months (Was fun until tier 6). Then my brother made me buy Strike Vector which is enjoyable in those very rare moments when there are people playing it and NOT constantly dominating you with dual rocket launchers. I've also played the Sniper Elite V2's multiplayer but that's funny for about a half hour up to an hour. Two hours if I listen to music at the same time. Sadly, I was getting bored...\n\nBut then I discovered HAWKEN. A game about mechs fighting each other with guns on their arms. You might have heard of Mechwarrior Online and you might be more interested in that rather than HAWKEN. But HAWKEN is like Mechwarrior's less realistic brother/sister, however, that doesn't mean HAWKEN is less fun. In fact, I really enjoyed HAWKEN because of its in-detail tutorial that explains mech movements that you can develop and master over time. Also I found it really easy to get into, but difficult to be really good at. That's pretty much my vision of TF2. "Easy to do, hard to master".\n\nBut the only sad thing about HAWKEN is that, like all the other free-to-play games, you have to grind it to get the more fancier stuff. But as long as you're having fun shooting at your mechanized opponents, you're going to enjoy this game very much.\n\nI rate it 9/10.\n\nAlso, if you're new to HAWKEN, then I would like to inform you that every new player gets 500 Meteor Credits (The currency that consists of REAL WORLD money) for free. I'd just like to say that you should always think twice before spending it. Here's a tip: Get yourself a repair drone and a pair of thrusters. DO NOT buy cockpits, emoticons or weapons.

I am pretty much addicted to playing Hawken and find myself hard pressed to find another game to play that is as fun. I have been playing pretty much every day since Open Beta came out and I love it. The game has evolved and changed so much and yet still stays true. There is nothing like the speed and thrill of running around in an scout (the fastest, least armored mech in the game but hits like a sledge hammer). You can move and fight in ways I have never been able to ever do in any game before.\n\nOn top of that, the community is amazing. They are all by far the best of any game I have seen. Everyone is willing to help and jump in. Most of the players are kind and have great sportsmanship. There is nothing like getting a GF (Good Fight) after a hard fought battle with someone.\n\nIf you want lots of action, skill, fast paced, crazy trill FPS game, then Hawken is for you. However, you have been warned. This game takes some skill to be good. Don't expect to jump and play like COD. You will die a lot if you don't basically throw what you know about an FPS out the window and start over.","March 8, 2014","true","921.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

You barelly get insulted by other players and this game represents teamwork as a big word. Basically walking around alone and not helping your team mates wont make you get kills, only deaths.\nAlso this game gives you something I really missed in most shooters i ever played, it's the XP when getting kills or assists, but this game divides XP not by that, but for the % percentage you deal damage to the enemy. so at the end, it becomes balanced. Killing an opponent by dealing 3% of damage will give you far less points than assisting by 20%.\n\nALSO, TO PEOPLE WHO KEEP SAYING THIS IS A TITANFALL FAKE. IF YOU CHECK THE RELEASE DATE, YOU WILL NOTICE THAT YOU WERE WRONG. THIS GAME'S ALPHA VERSION WAS RELEASED IN 2012.\n\nSo at the end this game is great awesome, and requieres more players and fans!","April 26, 2014","true","28.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I only tried it because it was free and I'm glad I did. I ended up playing for like 3 hours after it downloaded lol. It's fast paced, it's team-centric (you can lone wolf to a degree, but it's difficult unless you're really good). The fun part about it is that you don't go down right away, so there's a good degree of strategy in it as well as good old fashion FPS reflex based action.\n\nThe movement in it is pretty fun, still slightly glitchy at times around certain terrain, but that's negligible and nothing too bothersome. You can jet pack to "sprint" so to speak, and there are mechanics to do a 180 quickly as well as dash to the left and right to dodge, so if you're fast and coordinated, you can really have fun trying to out manuver your opponents.\n\nAlso, so far all the people I've seen on there are friendly and it has a seemingly cool community. Haven't encountered any 12 year old COD ♥♥♥♥ talk so far. Normally I get frustrated in games if I'm losing, but this is one of thsoe games where I'm having fun so I don't seem to mind losing as much, so maybe that's why nobody is talking ♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou should definitely give it a ♥♥♥♥ at least, especially since it's free. Oh and it's not pay to win. THere are some things you can buy like decorations for your mechs with real money, but so far all the mechs and weapons and mech parts ive come across can be bought with in-game credits.","April 19, 2015","true","13.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","4"

Its very fun, very very skill oriented, you need to dodge, shoot, run, jump, hide and aim with precision to actually survive in this game. Another plus i can give for this game is that this game is NOT a pay to win game. In fact, you can pretty much become an MVP with just your starter mech, and only after 10 match, i'm able to buy another mech, so you don't need to grind day after day just to get another mech. And all the mech has its ups and down, no mech is perfect. Soo you will not get killed easy by a player with an expensive mech. Just try it. Its free, relaxing, fun, and it doesn't take 90% of your time just to get to the good part.

The controls take some getting used to: turns are slow, and the repair mechanic takes some getting used to. This is definitely not a mindless pick up and play like Team Fortress 2. The game is gritty as heck, and unless you work together, you don't live long. This is not a game for heroes.\n\nThe community is actualy a good selling point. HAWKEN has such a small userbase, it's really chill, and 'gg' is really common in the after-game chat. Even though there is a cash shop, the game is not really PTW, as everything can be earned through normal play, and quite honestly, if you pay to get the best mech without leveling up, you'll get crushed really fast.\n\n12/10 will keep playing.","August 10, 2015","true","72.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Now, it is a shadow of what it was with little to no active players.\n\nIt was funny to say 'its Call of Duty but mechs', but with the latest actual updates it was turned very literally into "Call of Duty: Mechs". All machines are flimsy and fall apart at the slightest provocation, making every match spawn-run-die, instead of having some method to the madness.\n\nObjective problems with certain weapons were not addressed for months before sweeping changes were made to the entire game, leaving out several glaring problems.\n\nAnd then the entirety of progression was changed again, stripping out all customization and unique playstyles. Balance was thrown out the window in favour of making everything vulnerable to everything. The game stopped being played, and promptly became a dead Early Access title.\n\nThis is no longer a fun, supported game.

I have been with Hawken for a long time and have seen it grown to become closer to what the player wants from a great game like Hawken. HOWEVER, the original developers have LEFT; the game has NO administration or community to contact for help; Steam only serves the game but does nothing to ensure it's perfection for players. The game has a few exploits that players do take advantage of. The overall gameplay is phenomonal, but some mechs if well played can be a real pain and might need to be turned down a little. I love this game. I left this game and came right back when I could because it is really well done. This is THE Mech Warrior COLOSSEUM game and MUST be well maintained and preserved because a game like this could be GOING PLACES.\n\nI pray that people pay more attention to this game.

While it's cool that these tank-like mechs are all powerful and filled with weaponry, the combat tends to be fairly boring and slow paced compared to regular FPS shooters. With HAWKEN (silly name for this game, imo), the devs have designed some much faster mechs with more agility. Even the slow heavy mechs are fast by normal mech warrior standards. And unlike in traditional mech warrior, the little fast mechs can dish out a ton of damage, and don't have misguided weight class restrictions to prevent a heavy weapons loadout on a fast mech. The lack of armor and survivability is handicap enough.\n\nSo while the HAWKEN guys have done a good job at giving the game an FPS feel, the game still has the traditional control problems and vision limitations of your typical mech. While some people will be delighted to hear this, I personally would just like to see some kind of GUNDAM anime style mech combat where you can share the instant response controls and high visibility as you would in a normal FPS. As it is, you must rely on your radar to be aware of the battlefield, and depend on your team to cover your blind spots. Great for pre-made squads who intend to play this game competitively, no doubt, but not ideal for solo players running into a team of pre-mades.\n\nSo in conclusion, HAWKEN takes a mech warrior game to an almost-FPS level, but still keeps some mech handicap traditions alive to make the game still feel like a mech game. Does it succeed at being a good FPS? In my opinion, not really. And does it succeed at being a good mech game? I'd say yes, but mostly because I feel every other mech multiplayer game out there has failed at what it set out to do.\n\nHAWKEN gets a 7 on 10 from me, which is a great score for a mech game.","March 2, 2014","true","67.0"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

I've been enjoying it more and more the longer time goes on.\n\nHAWKEN's long TTK and heavy handling (read: there is a turn rate maximum), positioning and teamwork become even more important than they are in other offerings.  The mechs feel like mechs without feeling incredibly clunky, the weapons feel punchy and satisfying, and there are very few things in the game which are just better than other things.  It's rare for me to find a game wherein I have so much trouble choosing a favorite class/weapon/etc.\n\nThis game is great.  Play it.  Give it to other people.  It takes a long time to unlock things for free, but they're making its F2P shop better every day, and both mech fans and shooter players will absolutely get their money's worth out of one of the mech-unlocking bundle packs.\n\nThe newbie mech that you get for free?  I still pilot mine and top charts in it.  The CRT Recruit is loaded with weapons that are easy to pick up and remain potent in the right hands without getting ridiculously overpowered; it's sturdy, relatively quick, and has one of the most potent sustained firefight abilities in the game as well as literally the most flexible main weapon.\n\nPlay this game.

The gameplay is more akin to one of my favourite games from a long time ago, Unreal Tournament 2004. Teamwork is essential, if you go out on your own and meet an opposing team are dead, before you can blink.\n\nI would recommend anyone that likes an online shooter to give it a go, it is free after all.

This game is a real gem injecting a novel dose of atmosphere, innovation and nuance to a fairly stale genre.\n\nThere is simply no reason why any Steam user should not have this game in their library. It's free to play, painless to register/log in to and really delivers some epic skill based and team orientated gameplay.\n\nThe microtransaction model is used strictly for cosmetic items only. Everything else can be acquired using the currency earned from playing the game (albeit this is rather obnoxiously slow as expected).\n\nIt's hard to believe this game is still in beta as it could be released on shelf tomorrow as is for $39:95 and it'd still be worth it.\n\nAbout the only thing lacking right now (aside from perhaps some minor balance issues) are user controlled dedicated servers and a hardcore S&D style gamemode (Team vs Team, 1 life only, no respawns, with the vanquished spectating the survivors). Currently the only modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Missile Assault and Siege which though all well realised play in an arcadish kill/die/respawn/repeat type manner.\n\nThe maps, though truly individually awesome, are rather few in number and HAWKEN could certainly benefit from a good deal more of them.\n\nThese two quibbles aside though, HAWKEN is a visceral and refreshing FPS with some really slick production values. These mechs don't lumber around awkwardly laying waste to cities on the horizon, they're more like athletic exoskeletons which lend themselves wonderfully to traditional twitch style LOS competative FPS gameplay with some genuinely interesting mechanics and (intended) limitations.\n\nInstall now.","April 26, 2014","true","113.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

In mech games you are supposed to use tactics to kill your opponent. In HAWKEN the highest damage comes from fast mechs with SMGs. Instead of tactics, you have people corner peeking then running in and walking in a circle while holding their left and right mouse buttons down.\n\nI'd really like this game if one mech and one play style wasn't better than everything else, but sadly it is.\n\nIt also doesn't help that this game has a healing system where you run away, press C and heal up. Those SAME mechs that can slaughter almost all other types are the same ones that can easily run off and heal. They also had the genius idea of making killed mechs drop a cube that heals you, so the same mechs that can slaughter pretty much all other mechs can literally fight non-stop.\n\n\nAs of writing this the game has 141 players. The game is dying, and it isn't because it isn't known. It just sucks.","December 9, 2015","false","4.9"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","20","35","3","1"

It's free-to-play, with gorgeous graphics and visuals, immersive sounds, and fast-paced mech warfare.\n\nThere is nothing cooler than battling in a giant war machine with guns. The gameplay is smooth and fast, but you really feel like you're inside of a hulking mass of metal and death. There are plenty of mechs that you can accumulate and pilot, each very distinct from eachother.\n\nBeing free-to-play, you can choose to spend real money on paintjobs, alternate body pieces, different repair drones, and faster mech and weapon unlocks. That's it. You can't buy yourself a victory; it's all in the pilot. Everything besides purely cosmetic items can be unlocked through playing the game.

The mech combat feels great, the game looks awesome, and it feels a lot less 'grindy' than a lot of other games, even non-f2p games like BF3, which is sad when you think about it. I have unlocked 4 mechs since it has come to Steam, with about 10 hours of playing. The starter mech is grand, and there are also mechs available to 'test drive' so you can try before you buy.\nI am happy enough to just play and use the in-game currency to unlock mechs for now. I haven't spent any real money yet. Though I could see myself spending a bit of real money on this as it is a genuinely good, polished and well optimized game.\n\nI am really not a fan of grinding, so I wouldn't recommend it if I felt it wasn't worth your time. I got into the 'early access' for free because I already had an pre-steam account with them that I transferred over. If you hadn't played the game before, looks like you will have to wait a bit while they transition onto Steam unless you want to pay for 'early access'.\n\nYou could have played the game at any time before now for free and transferred your account over too, so not much point in complaining about that now.

However, Hawken stays pretty true to mecha roots. You pilot a mech in first person and do battle against other players or bots. Using strategy and firepower, you can easily gain the upperhand in any match.\n\nThere are dozens of customization options per mech. Dozens of machine guns, cannons, and rockets will help you find the best way to nuke your enemy. And with multiple mechas to choose from, all with their own abilities and customizations, you can amass and army of mechanical monsters to wreck other players.\n\nDesign wise, I like the game's futuristic junky feeling. As a fan of Gundam, I'm a little tired of seeing glitzy, shining mobile suits. These mechs look like thye were scraped together to fight in overgrown factories and bombed out cities in the wastelands. It makes you immersed with environment that justly suits your chocie of mecha.\n\nAll in all, its a really great game.

Check it out if you're broke. The steady stream of unlocks should keep you entertained for a while.

The bad part about this game is the large community of seemingly terrible players who can't even seem to figure out how to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/271290/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHAWKEN is a first-person shooter where you control a variety of different mechs to battle other mechs. This may not be a very original idea, but the game itself is very well done.\n\nLike all F2P games, it features a ton of unlocks - however, it is quite fair in this regard. Cosmetics can only be bought for real money, which isn't too big of an issue, and while you still have to unlock everything besides the starter mech, the amount of time it takes is reasonable and can be done quite quickly. The game features a variety of different mechs, items, internals, all to customize your gameplay style.\n\nI would say this game's learning curve is pretty steep, actually, especially for people who are used to standard FPS games. The mechs handle like big hunks of metal, since, well, they are big hunks of metal. There is a cap on how fast you can turn, and they are quite big, and their movement speed is quite limited. While they can still use their thrusters to do some fancy moves, getting used to stiff controls takes a bit of time. Also, the game is very team-focused, so you're going to fail very easily without some general teamwork.\n\nThe graphics have post-apocalyptic feel to it - which is completely in-universe, considering you're basically fighting for one of two corporations struggling to get valuable resources on an already doomed planet. They fit in with the style of the game, which is what I value the most about graphics in any game.\n\nHAWKEN, despite being still in beta, is very polished and presents almost no bugs.\nOverall, this game is a very good experience. I recommend it to FPS players and mech lovers alike.","November 21, 2014","true","35.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

How about a game where the skill level is so high that most new players will constantly be on the losing team and die a lot untill they get 50-100 hours of game time in before they start getting the hang of things to be able to compete in mid-tier games?  Look no futher than Hawken.\n\nI used to recommend this mostly team-based game to anyone, but now it's riddled with players who do not try to do objectives or help their teammates out. This isn't a game where a player can be an all-star and save the day. Teams win by teamwork and lose horribly when they do not. It is really a shame because this game can be awesome when people are trying to be team players.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the game doesn't reward teamwork enough. A prime example would be the lack of points awarded to players for assists. right now killstealing rewards players more points than doing most of the damaging but only getting an assist.\n\nWhen you are lucky enough get in a match where both teams are trying to do the objectives, it is very fun regardless of who wins. However, most games end up being complete landslides because 1 team is working together and trying to do the objectives and the other team (save 1 or 2 players) are avoiding doing any team-related actions such as capturing and holding points, collecting and returning energy units to home base to launch our ships, or even helping each other in firefights.\n\nPlayers not trying to help their team or trying to complete objectives makes no sense. Playing with such stupidity is absolutely zero fun. I hope the new development team can tweak/balance Hawken to encourage and reward teamwork.\n\nI would also like to add that cheating is and has been a problem since around the time Hawken arrived on Steam. Mostly wallhackers but I've seen blatant use of aimbots as well. You can easily find recent videos of hackers on You Tube and Google searches. When Adhesive was doing well, they were active with banning cheaters. Now it goes unchecked. Although, Reloaded just got rights to the game and has been making significant improvements. Time will only tell.\n\nFrankly, after sticking with this game for so long (since just after alpha)  I am at the point of giving up on it. It's more hate than love now. There are valid reasons that Hawken just can't retain its player base nor capture and keep the interest of new players with the big learning curve and poor teamwork that runs rampant now. Time is better put into other games that reward players of all skills levels which are much more relaxing and less punishing. It's truely a shame as the potential for a AAA game is definately there.","May 17, 2015","false","256.3"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","21","38","0","0"

Basically, if you are into FPS mech shooters, then this game is the the best F2P mech shooter out there. One of the best features that I have noticed is that there are no "game breaking" mechs, as in mechs that are overpowered and can take your entire team in one life. This I feel, is a strong point, because I hate playing games where theres that one guy who has the OP gun and wrecks your team instantly, and there are so many games where that unfortunate element is present.\n\n8.5/10","October 6, 2014","true","14.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

HAWKEN !!!\n\nHawken is a brilliant game. The sense of weight and scale is apparent. Many people have simply labeled this game as "Pay To Win" but that is SO FAR from the truth. Every item in game and be purchased with both Real World money and HC (In-Game Money) You gain HC quickly enough to be able to freely acquire internal and offensive devices for your mech and ALL of the additional mech can be bought with HC, as well as the tons of cosmetic options (some can only be bought with real money, but there items are ONLY cosmetic)\n\nThe combat, once you get the hang of it, is extremely fast based and reactionary. You can quickly dodge incoming missiles by sliding either right or left at the perfect moment, you can hover up into the air, and quickly turn your mech 180 degrees if someone catches your unprotected backside. The biggest mechanic that a lot of reviewers seem to be missing is the Dodging / Boosting system. You have to be quick to dodge using your boosters. Read your opponents moves and play strategically while still maintaining twitch reflex shooting. Its very, very intense. Don't treat it like your average FPS, you aren't a humanoid, you are a mech, you have separate advantages and disadvantages, get used to them. Verticality plays a huge role in the gameplay as well. The mechs are agile in a whole different way. But if you try to run and gun like an average FPS, you're toast.\n\nThere really isn't any other game like Hawken out right now. Its a Mech Sim FPS with an arcade game feel. There are tons of mechs to choose from And each with their distinct advantages and abilities. The game also features a very robust item/ mech upgrade system, much time will be spend configuring the build that suits you best.\n\nAs far as the F2P model, its rather well designed, if you play smart and play well, procuring ingame credits is a breeze (as is leveling up). If you lack the patience or time, real world currency can be used for unlocks.\n\nDid I mention the game looks incredibly stunning? No other game imo right now touts as much polish and detail visually, its remarkable that its F2P.\n\n- XeroSyphon","June 14, 2014","true","43.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Massive variety of different Mechs to try out; yes, you have to "grind" a bit to get access to them - this is the nature of multiplayer games - even more so since this is  free-to-play.\nThis free-to-play aspect is clearly visible - personally I don't really mind but I would like to see everything in game available both for real cash and in-game one. At the moment, the visual customisation of the machines is real-cash only.\nSince this is still early access / beta game it's being updated every so often. My only wish is that at some point it does become properly released game.\nSurprisingly the game is not that crowded - there are times when you can find a match very quickly and it will be full lobby. But at other times it takes few minutes to get into a match.\nFrom technical side - so far I haven't encountered any major problems.\nOverall, if the games does come out of beta and reduces it's focus on in-game purchases it will be a solid position on the market.","May 17, 2014","true","39.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

I've gotten dozens of hours of game play since beta and not been forced to paid a dime. If you like it, give em some money because they deserve it, and to look a little more badass.\n\nTLDR: If Mechwarrior and Counter-Strike made sweet love this game would be their awesome robobaby.

MECHS. These are not your average walking battletanks. These weapons of war have tighter controls, quicker movement, and devastating weaponry. The combat is fast paced and heart racing. The customization options not only change how your mech operates in battle, but also make each mech your own. And you can have many mechs in your garage. I've been playing since alpha (over 300 hours logged) and have seen Hawken in all of it's iterations - and every single one has been a blast to play. HIGHLY recommended.

Not much to run this game, even though they give you tons of options but ultimately make no difference I seen.. Max graphics super smooth!\n\nAudio: Big mechs walking around, shooting futurist weapons, shields, oozing and so much more in this game. Really makes too feel like it's all there.\n\nControls: Actually make you feel like it's an FPS game, seriously easy to use and play.\n\nGame: It is a multiplayer mech fighting game... Not so much fast paced as such but there is some fast moving at times.  Otherwise it's kinda mixed slow and fast, actually depends on your play style. It is quicker than Mech Warrior and in some ways better.  I enjoyed the original mech warrior multiplayer but the new online just was not as good as I thought.\nHawken offers something things mech warrior does not and that for me is a winner.\n\nThere is a lot to unlock, customise and so much more to do.  The game packs a punch for content and is free to play so it's a huge steal.\n\nThe overal gameplay of this game is good, you will have lots of fun playing this game alone against people, and you will have just as much fun with a friend.\n\nThe game modes are nice and there are new ones coming now and then.\n\nThere are purchases which sound like micro transactions but the way the game is handled, trust me it's not because you can destroy mechs with the worst gun while they have the best gun.\n\nThis game is about thinking while attacking.

There are times when the game is a glorious battle for supremacy and gives great satisfaction on winning an encounter, and others where it will frustrate you to the point wanting to break your computer in half. It will reward you if played with strategic thought, and punish your mistakes in a brutal gladiatorial spectacle of wreckage.\n\nWhile one can quickly get a handle on the general mechanics of piloting the different mechs, it may take a bit of time to begin to master them all, and the learning curve at higher levels can be steep. The design over the last year of the beta phase has had many shifts and bumps on its road towards completion, but for the most part it has been fun playing, testing, and watching its growth.\n\nOverall I like the game, but I feel that it needs more time for polish than it is going to get before release, and could use a bit more content in the form of different game modes and maps. More content is on the way, according to the developer, but I find myself impatient in expectation of expanded play options. At present though, I believe a majority of those who join us on the Hawken battlefield in the next few months will like what they see and will have a mostly positive experience.\n\nSee you in battle,\n\nRipperT\n","February 15, 2014","true","397.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Here's an in-depth video review with my reasons.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/TvzBWwPvF38\n\nIn summary, here's some of the pros and cons.\n\n+Fun gameplay. You really feel the weight of the mech you're in and all of the feedback.\n+Large variety of interesting mechs to help you find your playstyle.\n+Weapons and mechs are mostly balanced. Everything has a strength and weakness attached to it without one being flat-out better than another.\n+Nothing quite like it anywhere else. It's different from other FPS's because of you being in a mech rather than a person. Lots of interesting situations arise that make the game feel unique and stand out from the rest.\n\n-Very grindy. It takes about 8 hours of non-stop gameplay to purchase the most expensive mechs with in-game currency. There are some that are cheaper, but a lot of them come at a high price.\n-Slightly PTW. You can use real money to buy internals and items that give you an edge in battle. You even can unlock them early only by using real money, as opposed to spending 8-30 hours of playing to unlock the best stuff in the game.\n-If you are FTP, you ONLY start with one mech. While it isn't any better or worse than the others, it only offers a limited playstyle that may not suit your needs.\n-No true way to test drive a mech to see if you like it. You're stuck with that mech if you bought and can't get a refund. While there is a feature that grants you unlimited test drives of 1-2 mechs weekly, you're unable to customize it the way you want and are locked with only that. Gambling 8 hours worth of work is too much of a risk to find out if you actually do like the mech you're gonna get.\n-You feel locked into one particular mech. You accumulate experience with that mech and unlock different loadouts with only that particular one. All the internals and consumables you buy for hefty prices are also locked onto that much only. It feels like it's punishing you for choosing any other mech because you have to start from scratch.\n-No way to fully customize your mech. One thing that really irks me is that your secondary weapon will always be locked.\n\n\nOverall, I think the game is still worth a play, but I highly recommend you buy the nemesis bundle if you truly want to best experience. Otherwise it's too harsh on FTP'ers.","February 18, 2014","true","13.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The reason this game caught my eye was actually (for any of you old school gamers out there from back in the 90's when PC was starting to make itself a name in gaming for once) because it reminded me of the original Mech Warriors. I have still yet to be able to find a game that compares to it, but this one comes close in a few ways.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe first thing I notice right out of the gate is the graphics. I'm one of those people that if I have the capability at playing on Ultra (which having a GTX770 it isn't a problem), I do. This game seems to have a pretty nice flow if you have a chance to take the time to look at your surroundings in between trying to kill or be killed. I certainly know there are better visuals out there, but for an online game, they didn't have to dumb it down into the "toon" like visuals similar to WoW (sorry to have to mention this game, but it's the best explanation for my comparison). Usually game developers go easy on the graphics when there is multiplayer involved for performance. Hawken stands out to make itself an exception. The game developers seem to have done their best to make it seem as life like as possible. You can really get yourself to believe you're in the cockpit manning that mega war machine. (Provided you have the right rig set up)\n\nOnce you have played enough and reached a certain quantity of currency (forgive me I have only played for 3 hours and forget what they call the point system) you have the option of buying new Mechs or customize the one you are currently running with. This adds more playtime to find out what you love running with as your set up and can dominate the best with. It's always best to have options over limitation.\n\nPlaying multiplayer is really fun. Who would only want to reap destruction by themselves? Matchmaking seems to populate as expected; slightly slow at first but not too long you could finish a book. Being a Free to Play, this is pretty typical as far as I can tell because not as many people take up the opportunity as they should to experience new things.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe absolute thing that I believe first to be on the list is that this game does not seem to have a campaign. (Game developers I apologize in advance if I have missed something, but I just can't seem to find it if it does exist.) Multiplayer is fun and all, but I love games that have a story too. Something to give the game more of that background some of us look for and place the relationship of the game world and multiplayer together.\n\nThis is not a complaint on my part, but I list this simply because I try and keep others in mind for their experience in play, but I am going to mention the menu when it seems you're back in the "Bay". There are certainly a lot of things to cycle through and it can potentially seem a little overwhelming for thos whom wish to jump right in. Not to say you are unable to, however if you kept up with this mentality you would surely meet your demise and lose interest in the game as everyone is upgrading and you are not. Also checking out your stats as well as others. The game certainly goes in depth for those of us checking profiles, but too much info for the casual player will steer them clear if they don't know what they are looking for.\n\nBack to customization, I personally wish there was more. It seems that a lot of the upgrades you get are linear for the level of the Mech as you play through, i.e. legs, body and weapons. Again, I have only played for roughly 3 hours and may not have achieved something that I am unaware of but for the time being it seems to only have one path. Most of the custom comes from the additional consumable items or slight "boosts" for your Mech in battle. I probably grade too harshly as mentioned before I compare this to the original Mech Warriors, but in Hawken you only seem to have two weapons. One long range, and one short. I really would like to see some additions made where you could have up to potentially 4 or more to diversify battle a little more. Adding that would make it more enjoyable in my opinion.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAs mentioned, short and to the point. Overall, I do enjoy this game and certainly hope they have further output in future updates to bring further hours of enjoyment. I give Hawken 3/4 stars.\n\n\nLet me know what you guys think? Agree or disagree to anything I mentioned? I'm curious to know what other players think.","May 19, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Combining Call-of-Duty-esque gameplay mechanics and awesome concept, this game has hooked many and retained even more. Playing as a pilot inside a giant "mech", players run around, shoot, and generally try to blow each other's heads off. While the upgrade path is leaning towards pay-to-play, it is not impossible to unlock everything with just game time, but expect to put a load of hours in. All-in-all, an amazing game for it's price (haha) but with a slightly unfair upgrade system, this is a game you should not go past.

After putting in over 4 hours straight in this game, I'm very pleased. Great graphics, excellent gameplay, friendly development team and community. Yes, there is some grinding involved to earn credits to buy or unlock items- but you can purchase credits to expedite the process. However, the game is balanced so well that even the medium "starter" mech will more than hold its own against the purchased mechs. Lots of upgrades and customization available too.\n\nThis is a mech game where "maul and brawl" don't work as in other mech games- so you have to re-learn/adapt to using agility, cover, spoofs, movement and team coordination to survive.\n\nHighly recommend HAWKEN- one of the best games I've installed off Steam in a long time.","March 18, 2014","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Or do you prefer western mech games, where the mechs are lumbering machines where strategically hurling rounds is the best way for you to avoid an explosive death? Hawken is an odd blend of both and you should give Hawken a try.\n\nDo note that Hawken is NOT a mech simulation game but a very arcade-style first person shooter, and a darn good one at that. If you’re expecting sluggish machines overloaded with weapons in slow-paced combat then look elsewhere, you won’t find it in Hawken. The mechs in Hawken looks like they’re made of scraps and (in the current patch) falls apart like one, forcing players to play smart. Prepare to get toasted if you try to run and gun. Strategically approaching a target will ensure you don’t get scraped before dealing some serious damage. Once the players get close, prepare for some really brutal combat. Reading your opponent’s moves to dodge shots using your thrusters while landing skilful shots will ensure you emerge the victor.\n\nThe mechs in Hawken fall under three classes: light, medium and heavy. Light mechs are fast and agile, but has armour made of Kleenex. They can stay in the air the longest and dance around in combat to toy with the larger mechs, but drops down within a few shots. The heavies are well-armed and has the ability to soak the most damage out of the three classes. The mediums are between both classes, being the jack of all trades in the classes. All mechs have their distinct strengths and weakness, where they can be all deadly under the right hands.\n\nIn terms of the weapons, all mechs in Hawken carries two weapons into battle. Each mech has three primary weapons to choose from and a secondary. Each mech start with one primary when purchased and other two unlocked based on the rank of the mech.  Despite the solid mechanics of the shooting, the unfortunate case is that most of the weapons are boring but practical to use.The latest mechs however carries new and strangely fun guns, hence I believe we can expect more interesting weapons and variety as the game development progresses.\n\nRegarding the F2P model, I find that the developers have done very well in that department. All mechs and parts can be purchased with both in-game credits and micro-transaction, so you won’t be locked out if you don’t pay. The grind for credits is also quite short as compared to other F2P games. The only things locked out for non-paying customers are cosmetics, which offers no advantages except for the mech chassis. Some players use micro-transactions to turn their mechs to look like a completely different mech which tend to cause a lot of confusion in battle. Thankfully, these players are really few and can be dealt with appropriately once you know about it. The other minor complain is the odd pricing of some skins, where apparently giving your mech a coat of solid black cost more than getting two new guns. Other than these two minor complains, the micro-transaction model of Hawken is fine, and absolutely not pay to win.\n\nTo sum up, Hawken has its up and downs. Looking back to the fifty plus hours I’ve spent in the game, my experience have been all pleasant. The game is certainly not what I expected it was, but still excellent and fun to play.

I soon after met up with fellow Digirev members Gatnic3 and GuGz. in my time in alpha I have tested many mech variations. In all of alpha testing, one mech load-out seemed to reign supreme! it was the then named Assault load-out with the Mobi chassis type. it stood its ground over and over, time and time again. it was the predominate favorite for most pilots in the alpha test. That very same ultimate load-out is now the Fred CRT-Recruit starting mech. this means that the most well balanced and well rounded mech for most situations is the starting mech.  you may ask yourself, why is any of this relevant? Well Edubs is here to tell you why! You see in the Latest Major Patch, amongst other things, the Hawken team decided to remove tuning points from the game entirely! So we are now the closest we have been to the Alpha build of the game since we began Closed and Open beta. Its just Raw stats and skill now with no more variables. the only thing we can change are Weapons, Internals, and Item load-outs.\n\nThis is great news for the new player in Hawken! it means that you have a fair chance of winning once you master the familiar controls. Hawken’s controls do not vary from standard FPS placements. you see the common WASD movement and standard SHIFT key Sprint/Speed Modifier. Ctrl for VoIP, E to Interact, Q to Spot. Space to Jump/Jet Jump, F for Ability, Z to Call for Assistance, and C to Repair. In fact these controls are very similar to the controls of another popular F2P game on steam, Planetside 2.\n\nIt is also really easy to level up and unlock additional mechs in Hawken. After 3-4 matches you should have a few more to choose from.Hawken is primarily a PvP game, but If players don’t want to jump into the PVP combat right away or you are looking for a place to catch a break from the action, you can join a Co-Op Bot Destruction match. Co-Op Bot Destruction is a great place to practice your shooting and teamwork skills as well as a place to meet other players in a more social setting. Just a warning though, Co-Op Bot Destruction does get pretty intense, so don’t let it fool you! Of course you can purchase consumables to help you beat the waves but its optional and not necessary and in my opinion makes it less fun.\n\nIf you liked this review please visit the website I write articles for www.digirev.net","February 16, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it holds some nostalgia, it also takes some great elements from modern shooters without eliminating skill-based gameplay. This game is like taking Tribes 2 and marrying it with Quake 3 Arena while holding some class diversity seen in games like Team Fortress.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Mech-based combat.\n+ Class-based units to choose from.\n+ Customizable loadout and gear.\n+ Thoughtfully designed maps.\n+ Skill-based and fast paced.\n+ Coop mode included for wave after wave type fighting.\n+ Enjoyable competitive field.\n\nCons:\n\n- Has some F2P elements such as a market.\n- Doesn't have surround or eyefinity support. (This is controversial).\n- Has the potential to have a overwhelmingly amount of gear variation; giving some people the inability to make tactile decisions.\n-Has the potential to get rollercoaster balancing based off COD whineboys.\n\nWith that said, I really enjoy this final beta; I hope this game has a bright future; but with it I hope the developers AND publishers observe and study some of the critical mistakes that other AAA companies made such as Planetside 2 from SOE or Tribes Ascend from Hi-Rez. The key to a long-lasting and superb competitive game like this is to carefully make the decisions.","February 16, 2014","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigDumbAmerican/recommended/271290/","BigDumbAmerican","BDA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigDumbAmerican/","271 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHAWKEN is a very fun, arcadey robot shoot-em-up. There are a surprising number of interesting game modes (though not as many maps as I'd like to see, at this point in development), and a fair number of neat robots, weaponry, and abilities. Gameplay is simple arena-style for the most part, with plenty of explosions and bullets whizzing about, and with the unique abilities of different mechs adding a bit of variety for different playstyles. Overall, it's fun and engaging, if a bit simple.\n\nI do have some pretty noteable criticisms, though. The grind is extreme, if you haven't bought the starter bundle (which is a pretty fair value, all in all). Unlocking new weapons and robots takes a very long time, and cosmetics are cash-only. There's also not much in the way of non-cosmetic customization. Each mech has one special ability, one non-unique secondary weapon that can't be changed, and a choice of three non-unique primary weapons (that need to be unlocked through grinding or real-money). This feels a bit arbitrary. It makes me wonder why they didn't actually let you BUILD your mech, by choosing from a wide variety of parts, abilities, and weaponry. The only customization to speak of is choosing which of your selected robot's three primary weapons you'd like to roll out with, after grinding to unlock one of a rather uninspired collection of cookie-cutter prebuilds.\n\nI'd recommend the game, because it really is fun. The core gameplay is there! But it's not a very high recommendation, because of the huge amount of missed potential with the gimpy customization system. I'd give Hawken a 3/5 in its current state, but changing simply changing the customization system to one that let you actually assemble your very own mech would make me reconsider that rating in a big way.","February 17, 2014","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Or do you prefer western mech games, where the mechs are lumbering machines where strategically hurling rounds is the best way for you to avoid an explosive death? Hawken is an odd blend of both and you should give Hawken a try.\n\nDo note that Hawken is NOT a mech simulation game but a very arcade-style first person shooter, and a darn good one at that. If you’re expecting sluggish machines overloaded with weapons in slow-paced combat then look elsewhere, you won’t find it in Hawken. The mechs in Hawken looks like they’re made of scraps and (in the current patch) falls apart like one, forcing players to play smart. Prepare to get toasted if you try to run and gun. Strategically approaching a target will ensure you don’t get scraped before dealing some serious damage. Once the players get close, prepare for some really brutal combat. Reading your opponent’s moves to dodge shots using your thrusters while landing skilful shots will ensure you emerge the victor.\n\nThe mechs in Hawken fall under three classes: light, medium and heavy. Light mechs are fast and agile, but has armour made of Kleenex. They can stay in the air the longest and dance around in combat to toy with the larger mechs, but drops down within a few shots. The heavies are well-armed and has the ability to soak the most damage out of the three classes. The mediums are between both classes, being the jack of all trades in the classes. All mechs have their distinct strengths and weakness, where they can be all deadly under the right hands.\n\nIn terms of the weapons, all mechs in Hawken carries two weapons into battle. Each mech has three primary weapons to choose from and a secondary. Each mech start with one primary when purchased and other two unlocked based on the rank of the mech.  Despite the solid mechanics of the shooting, the unfortunate case is that most of the weapons are boring but practical to use.The latest mechs however carries new and strangely fun guns, hence I believe we can expect more interesting weapons and variety as the game development progresses.\n\nRegarding the F2P model, I find that the developers have done very well in that department. All mechs and parts can be purchased with both in-game credits and micro-transaction, so you won’t be locked out if you don’t pay. The grind for credits is also quite short as compared to other F2P games. The only things locked out for non-paying customers are cosmetics, which offers no advantages except for the mech chassis. Some players use micro-transactions to turn their mechs to look like a completely different mech which tend to cause a lot of confusion in battle. Thankfully, these players are really few and can be dealt with appropriately once you know about it. The other minor complain is the odd pricing of some skins, where apparently giving your mech a coat of solid black cost more than getting two new guns. Other than these two minor complains, the micro-transaction model of Hawken is fine, and absolutely not pay to win.\n\nTo sum up, Hawken has its up and downs. Looking back to the fifty plus hours I’ve spent in the game, my experience have been all pleasant. The game is certainly not what I expected it was, but still excellent and fun to play. I would totally recommend to give this game a try.\n","February 12, 2014","true","27.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fast-paced mech game with a good amount of variety among the different classes, beautiful graphics, a neat backstory and old-school shooter gameplay.\n\nAn important note to make from the start is that it isn't P2W; the stuff you can buy with only Meteor Points (the RMT currency) are cosmetic items or XP/ingame currency boosts. All mechs, weapons, internals and items can be unlocked by playing the game. The starter mech is very competitive and it's not uncommon to see newbro's placing high on the leaderboard at the end of a match, having levelled up several times over!\n\nHawken places an emphasis on player skill rather than what gear you're using. If you know the playstyle of your mech well and can work with your teammates you'll go far. People who expect to be able to drop some real cash to unlock mechs and own everyone will be left with a bitter taste in their mouths.\n\nI've been playing Hawken on-and-off since January 2013 and I always keep coming back to it. The universe is great (I heartily recommend the "prequel" comics as they're a great read) and the mech designs and environment visuals are beautiful. The  Hawken community are also mostly awesome - having lurked on the official forums for some time there are multitude of player-written guides and helpful folk around. Even ingame you usually get friendly and polite players chatting between rounds/deaths though if this will change with the advent of the Steam transition I can't say.\n\nOverall, Hawken is a fun game that puts the onus on player skill to win, rather than the gear you're using. It's extremely fast-paced  and because it's free you should definitely give it a shot!","February 13, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I soon after met up with fellow Digirev members Gatnic3 and GuGz. in my time in alpha I have tested many mech variations. In all of alpha testing, one mech load-out seemed to reign supreme! it was the then named Assault load-out with the Mobi chassis type. it stood its ground over and over, time and time again. it was the predominate favorite for most pilots in the alpha test. That very same ultimate load-out is now the Fred CRT-Recruit starting mech. this means that the most well balanced and well rounded mech for most situations is the starting mech.  you may ask yourself, why is any of this relevant? Well Edubs is here to tell you why! You see in the Latest Major Patch, amongst other things, the Hawken team decided to remove tuning points from the game entirely! So we are now the closest we have been to the Alpha build of the game since we began Closed and Open beta. Its just Raw stats and skill now with no more variables. the only thing we can change are Weapons, Internals, and Item load-outs.\n\nThis is great news for the new player in Hawken! it means that you have a fair chance of winning once you master the familiar controls. Hawken’s controls do not vary from standard FPS placements. you see the common WASD movement and standard SHIFT key Sprint/Speed Modifier. Ctrl for VoIP, E to Interact, Q to Spot. Space to Jump/Jet Jump, F for Ability, Z to Call for Assistance, and C to Repair. In fact these controls are very similar to the controls of another popular F2P game on steam, Planetside 2.\n\nIt is also really easy to level up and unlock additional mechs in Hawken. After 3-4 matches you should have a few more to choose from.Hawken is primarily a PvP game, but If players don’t want to jump into the PVP combat right away or you are looking for a place to catch a break from the action, you can join a Co-Op Bot Destruction match. Co-Op Bot Destruction is a great place to practice your shooting and teamwork skills as well as a place to meet other players in a more social setting. Just a warning though, Co-Op Bot Destruction does get pretty intense, so don’t let it fool you! Of course you can purchase consumables to help you beat the waves but its optional and not necessary and in my opinion makes it less fun.\n\nIf you liked this review please visit the website I write articles for www.digirev.net","February 16, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it holds some nostalgia, it also takes some great elements from modern shooters without eliminating skill-based gameplay. This game is like taking Tribes 2 and marrying it with Quake 3 Arena while holding some class diversity seen in games like Team Fortress.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Mech-based combat.\n+ Class-based units to choose from.\n+ Customizable loadout and gear.\n+ Thoughtfully designed maps.\n+ Skill-based and fast paced.\n+ Coop mode included for wave after wave type fighting.\n+ Enjoyable competitive field.\n\nCons:\n\n- Has some F2P elements such as a market.\n- Doesn't have surround or eyefinity support.

There are a surprising number of interesting game modes (though not as many maps as I'd like to see, at this point in development), and a fair number of neat robots, weaponry, and abilities. Gameplay is simple arena-style for the most part, with plenty of explosions and bullets whizzing about, and with the unique abilities of different mechs adding a bit of variety for different playstyles. Overall, it's fun and engaging, if a bit simple.\n\nI do have some pretty noteable criticisms, though. The grind is extreme, if you haven't bought the starter bundle (which is a pretty fair value, all in all). Unlocking new weapons and robots takes a very long time, and cosmetics are cash-only. There's also not much in the way of non-cosmetic customization. Each mech has one special ability, one non-unique secondary weapon that can't be changed, and a choice of three non-unique primary weapons (that need to be unlocked through grinding or real-money). This feels a bit arbitrary. It makes me wonder why they didn't actually let you BUILD your mech, by choosing from a wide variety of parts, abilities, and weaponry. The only customization to speak of is choosing which of your selected robot's three primary weapons you'd like to roll out with, after grinding to unlock one of a rather uninspired collection of cookie-cutter prebuilds.\n\nI'd recommend the game, because it really is fun. The core gameplay is there! But it's not a very high recommendation, because of the huge amount of missed potential with the gimpy customization system. I'd give Hawken a 3/5 in its current state, but changing simply changing the customization system to one that let you actually assemble your very own mech would make me reconsider that rating in a big way.","February 17, 2014","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't trust the metacritic score of this because it is an awesome game! Great mech warfare, fast paced, and strategic!\n\nFor a free game, you can't get much better than this. There's 4 main multiplayer modes and a co-op "horde" mode. The 4 multiplayer modes are deathmatch, team deathmatch, missile assault (essentially king of the hill type style), and seige. Seige is the most unique. You gather energy and go back to your base to deposit it. There is a bar on the top of your team's score that shows how much energy is required to release a giant ship to attack the enemies HQ. Once this giant ship is released, you have to either shoot at it (takes forever) or fight for the anti-air platform somewhere on the map to dispose of it again. Then it starts all over again with energy gathering. Essentially, it's a race to see who returns the most energy and releases the giant spaceships the fastest. Very unique.\n\nThe mechs cost a lot, and the "currency" earning and XP is kind of slow, but I guess they have to make money off of this somehow since it is a free to play since they offer experience and currency boosts for some money. Each mech is unique in its own way, so I would research the mechs to see which ones are worth spending currency on (that way you don't pick a mech and waste all that hard earned currency on something that does not fit your play style.)","March 2, 2014","true","139.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have to say its alot more fun than Mechwarrior Online from my view. The gameplay reminds me alot of Star Conflict for some reason.\n\nHawken,\nIs more of an arcade Mech game, Focused on having fun, while keeping things simple and user friendly. As much as i hate COD, i have to say that the game play compares to a COD game, In regards to Its purly about having fun. This game uses Pre-Build mechs that you can customise: Weapons, Equipment, Passive Perks, Decals, Consumables. However all the Mech Parts such as legs, torso, Arms and so forth are all cosmetic and have no effects when changed.\n\nMech Warrior Online,\nToke a more realistic approach due there old day roots they had with the original Mech Warrior games. However i just fund it alot of hasttle and wasnt alot of fun for me. Mech Warrior Online has alot more customization though and you can build your own mechs from scratch to how you want it.\n\nThis being said both games are brilliant and unique Mech games and are both worth checking out.","March 3, 2014","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had to use a code they emailed me for playing before it came on steam anyway....HAWKEN being a free to play game will have its limitations like all free to play games, HAWKEN's being customizing your mech and no campain to speak of. Parts for your mech and paints jobs is where you will be spending your real money, unlocking mechs is actually not as bad as some free to play games.. yes its still a drag in HAWKEN but you can unlock all mechs in game without spending a cent, you do this by maxing out certen mechs levels and leveling up your player. It offers players in game cash for playing, getting challenges done and winning matchs... then you can take this in game cash and downright buy a mech. Most of the cooler better mechs are 12000ish credits, about 5-6 hours of game play worth to get. It is no where near as bad as trying to get credits in " Mech Warrior Online ".\n\nGameplay is VERY! fun.. it being a first person shooter and all mechs really nicely matched in strangth makes HAWKEN   one hell of a good time. It can get repeditive but luckly it has many differnt game modes to choose from to keep you playing. Maps are laking but it is still in BETA ( going on what 2 years now ) so new maps will being coming with time. All in all I have never had HAWKEN glitch or crash for me it is very stable game! I Recommend HAWKEN to everyone and anyone who like shooters or mech games. But with Titan Fall comming out I can kind of see it killing HAWKEN, But if you dont want to pay $60 for Titan Fall HAWKEN  is a good FREE replacement for it.","March 3, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is intense action all the way and it certainly gives you quite a few hours to occupy yourself. The graphics are great and there is hardly ever any lag. This game reminds me of some sort of Titanfall mini and I like it! Being only multiplayer although, I believe that it would be great if their were a singleplayer, or more maps... It definitely needs to be played moderately because in my opinion, it can get sort of boring if you play too long. Although, if you're someone looking to have some fun with some friends, it is a great game to pick up and it will certainly impress you for how good it is for a free game :).","July 8, 2014","true","21.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At the same time maps are somewhat small - remember this is a game based on smaller arenas rather than big open battlefields.\n\nBalance is (almost always) very good, quite a few mechs to choose from, and some good combinations of abilities and items. However this game is NOT about heavy customization. You are given a mech platform, some tools to play with and change, and then you go into combat. You find the best combo, and kick ♥♥♥.\n\nRewards well played gambits, skilled players, good decision making and clever trickery, albeit on small/medium maps.\n\nThe pay model is a wee bit expensive for certain customizations, but on the whole is a bit fairer than games like Loadout or Rift, but not as cheap as Star Conflict, World of Tanks or War Thunder. The pay model is pretty solid as far as "pay2win" goes, seeing as there are no premium mechs (at all) or special uber weapons available only to real money payers.\n\nConsidering the game is free, and takes about 5 minutes to get into, there is no reason not to try it.\n\n\nSolid 9/10","February 23, 2014","true","114.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it's cool that these tank-like mechs are all powerful and filled with weaponry, the combat tends to be fairly boring and slow paced compared to regular FPS shooters. With HAWKEN, the devs have designed some much faster mechs with more agility. Even the slow heavy mechs are fast by normal mech warrior standards. And unlike in traditional mech warrior, the little fast mechs can dish out a ton of damage, and don't have misguided weight class restrictions to prevent a heavy weapons loadout on a fast mech. The lack of armor and survivability is handicap enough.\n\nSo while the HAWKEN guys have done a good job at giving the game an FPS feel, the game still has the traditional control problems and vision limitations of your typical mech, which helps turn the game from a fps with large robots to a emrsive well poished mech vs mech experence. As it is, you must rely on your radar to be aware of the battlefield, and depend on your team to cover your blind spots. This is great becase it encoreges teamwork, to use everyone’s strength’s to your advantage and to minimise the enemy’s teams ability to prey on your weaknesse’s, with small meches scouting and locating enemy mecks, medium meches acting as mobile firing platforms supporting the rest of the team and bringing on the pain, and the heavy meches to both take and deal large amounts of firepower.\n\nSo in conclusion, HAWKEN takes a mech warrior game to an almost-FPS level, but still keeps some mech handicap traditions alive to make the game still feel like a mech game. does it succeed at being a good team based mech game? I'd say yes. :D\n","March 8, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Hawken is really, really fun. It's relatively fast-paced, has a satisfying long time-to-kill, and movement feels fantastic. Your giant robot suit feels heavy, mechanical, BIG, and yet fast enough to not feel plodding and clunky. Progression isn't the fastest, but you can be competitive even with the stock CR-T Recruit mech it gives you; exceedingly so once you upgrade it just a little bit.  The microtransaction stuff is fairly implemented and while I feel that disqualifies it from being categorized as "early access", that certainly is not a knock against the game\n\nFom low to high settings, Hawken looks really damn good. Fidelity may not be the highest, but the game's aesthetic, which is far more important than graphics, really really shines. It strikes a balance between gritty and grungy and polished and futuristic. It works, and it works well even on a lower-end system.\n\nPlay this game. Seriously. It's fun as heck. The learning curve is steep right at the very start, but once you get a handle on the core mechanics after a few rounds, it'll all click and you'll have a great time! And hell, it's free!

However, it does have some flaws, and at times it becomes a bit tedious to collect the in-game currency. Despite this, it is definitely worth the download, and as it is free, can be played for a couple of hours and then forgotten about.\n\nPros-\n\n-It's a pretty good looking game. Textures are nice, and the mech designs are cool.\n-It's not too difficult to learn how to play. However, it takes some time to learn the nuances of each mech.\n-Each mech feels like a completely different play experience (If you like that sort of thing.)\n-There are a decent amount of maps to play on.\n-There are 5 different game modes, and there is co-op play.\n-IT'S FREE!!!!\n\nCons-\n-It's unbalanced at times. If you aren't used to playing the game, certain mechs become a pain to deal with.\n-It's pay-to-win. Sure, you can get everything in the game (save for a few cosmetic things) with the earnable currency,          but it's going to take you a lifetime, and the guys who are willing to pay, will win out most of the time.\n-The maps get really old. Although there are a decent amount of them, they get pretty boring at times. (This is my opinion, your mileage may vary.)\n-The match making is TERRIBLE. I've played at least a dozen games where I've been on a team of level 3-4 guys, and the opposing team is composed of maxed level pilots.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the game. It's a fun, free experience, and if you can't afford a AAA title, this is a decent substitute.","December 22, 2014","true","29.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Good combat system and a relatively active community make this great for casual gaming or competitive, though the match making system can be brain dead at times. I could be wrong, but it doesn't appear as though the game takes into consideration level or preferred mech when matching players up which can lead to some very unbalanced matches. The system also doesn't take into consideration the size of a map, so a game with only four players can get one of the largest maps. One more gripe is the developers haven't put too many updates since release so you get that sinking feeling that you're playing an incomplete game. If you're willing to overlook these shortcomings, Hawken is a great game that is underrated both by the gaming community but more importantly the developers.","November 1, 2014","true","89.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I was pretty sceptic at first when it launched about a year ago, and I was wrong. If you crave for a solid fast paced mech warfare, this is the game you need. The balance between generic FPS and Mech sim, achieved really well. It is not CoD brainless, and also it is not as slow as say MechWarrior Online( which is also a good game). As I played many Gundam and Macross  games on PSP, I feel like this may be it. Sure robot design is pretty unique, and first thing I ever said when I first saw this game  "gundam, but with mech built from trashcans". But if you look more closelly, those mech really represent current day tech. You will see communication antenas, cameras, flashlights and other stuff, which is more of a this day tech, than some space tech used in Gundam or MechWarrior. So now I am not complaining about it :)\n\nVisuals are a treat for the eyes, even if it is Unreal engine. Also Nvidia owners will experience full quality with PhysX effects on.  Sounds are well recreated, but I wish game would have surround audio. Also controls are tight, and you will feel at home after  few mins in-game.\n\nSo, should I recommend this game? Hell yeah. Even if Titanfall is behind the corner, this game is not in competition with it. Two different games. Titanfall is still CoD, although a good one, even a a really good one if they keep this up, but it is still CoD, and it will have all the lame CoD community stuff too, like screaming 12 year olds for example. And Hawken is still more of a sim, with atleast slightly mature community.","February 22, 2014","true","126.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

I was pretty sceptic at first when it launched about a year ago, and I was wrong. If you crave for a solid fast paced mech warfare, this is the game you need. The balance between generic FPS and Mech sim, achieved really well. It is not CoD brainless, and also it is not as slow as say MechWarrior Online( which is also a good game). As I played many Gundam and Macross  games on PSP, I feel like this may be it. Sure robot design is pretty unique, and first thing I ever said when I first saw this game  "gundam, but with mech built from trashcans". But if you look more closelly, those mech really represent current day tech. You will see communication antenas, cameras, flashlights and other stuff, which is more of a this day tech, than some space tech used in Gundam or MechWarrior. So now I am not complaining about it :)\n\nVisuals are a treat for the eyes, even if it is Unreal engine. Also Nvidia owners will experience full quality with PhysX effects on.  Sounds are well recreated, but I wish game would have surround audio. Also controls are tight, and you will feel at home after  few mins in-game.\n\nSo, should I recommend this game? Hell yeah. Even if Titanfall is behind the corner, this game is not in competition with it. Two different games. Titanfall is still CoD, although a good one, even a a really good one if they keep this up, but it is still CoD, and it will have all the lame CoD community stuff too, like screaming 12 year olds for example. And Hawken is still more of a sim, with atleast slightly mature community.","February 22, 2014","true","126.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

I'm a long time mechwarrior, and had every interest in finding yet another way to scratch my mech itch.  But this, it was just pointless.\n\nEverything you will get out of the game, you will get in the first 20 minutes.  The skill ceiling is abysmally low, I topped the game every game I played, from the first to the last.  The gameplay mechanics are shallow and unmeaningful, with regenerable health and no module destruction.  heat buildup is a slight attempt to add depth to the game, but fails miserably, as it is neither severe enough in its consequences, nor oncoming quickly enough to be considerable.\n\nFurthermore, there are literally weapons that use built up heat as a powerful bomb that can be fired to eliminate large amounts of it instantly, therebye making unlimited, totally uninterrupted fire possible due to the unlimited ammunition available to all players.\n\nTo be blunt, it takes mechanics from call of duty, adds a jetpack, and THEN simplifies them even further.  There is simply no meat or reward for extended play in this game.  You're far better off playing Mechwarrior, where skill, customization, and gameplay mechanics are brought full to bear to bring you an experience that actually separates itself from the norm.\n\nAlso, this may be just a pet peeve, but the mechs are just plain ugly.  They look cobbled together, unprofessional, small and weak, and sometimes ridiculously reminiscent of CRT monitors, 50's television sets, and old-style washing machines propped up on legs and given a machine gun.  Hardly compelling, to say the least.","April 24, 2014","false","0.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

I wish I could recommend it, but I can't...here's why:\n(Keep in mind I did not spend any money on the game)\n\nAfter eight hours of play I had unlocked my first mech (aside from the starter of course) and was really enjoying the game. I had finally put in enough time and skill for my mech (the Raider) to rank up - which unlocks stuff for that mech. I went to use the new weapon I had unlocked to discover that I still had to pay the in game currency (HC which is separate to experience) to unlock said weapon. I had, in essence, "unlocked" the ability to unlock the weapon using in game currency. All the while the process could have been sidetracked in an instant by using real money.\n\nThe developers have designed it to take as long as possible for you to get any reward for playing the game. There are four different values - MC (bought credits) HC (in-game earnt primarily by time NOT skill) Pilot XP and Mech XP. Even in-game items like shields, grenades etc are consumable - if you use too many before you rank up you'll have to buy more.\n\nIn essence the game is great, but the progression model is broken - you either have instant access by paying (which ruins the sense of progression) or grind (in which the progression feels negligable). Whether you pay money or not you will get sick of this game; there is no way to feel like you are not being cheated.\n\nI did some calculations and worked out it would take 197 hours or so of gameplay to unlock every mech. There is currently very little 'try before you buy', so your investment of time/money is always cold. That estimate is if you spend nothing on items or weapons which affect gameplay tremendously.\n\nIf you wish to take the other route, and pay, this game may cost you upwards of $2000. No joke, search around. That's prety much everything (except cosmetics) but still...\n\nEven if you like this game so much that all of the above does not dissuade you...remember, this is a multiplayer game. Already on Oceania it is impossible to find games in all the gametypes. People (rightfully so) are not going to put up with this, so you will have to be content playing in a very uncompetitive environment.\n\nTLDR: $2000 money to unlock everything or 300+ hours and you need everyone else to WANT to do that as well to have people to play against...do something else with your life...","March 13, 2014","false","8.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The maps looked grittier and mechs felt pretty heavy. The time to kill was much longer than it is now which is the first thing I will talk about, the current TTK is really short so very few if any mistakes can be made which isn't very appealing to newbie pilots. The old TTK allowed for more mistakes and made you feel as if you were in a mech and using stratagy to claim kills, now it hardly takes much to kill anything save for the Vanguard in turret mode.\n\nSecondly, the cockpit. The cockpit showed your mech HP, fuel, items and such on monitors inside the cockpit which added a lot of immersion into the game. It made it feel as if you were piloting a mech and had to check your mech's vitals while being aware of your surrounding. Currently they have changed that and your health and fuel is displayed on a 'Holographic HUD" ,which I might add doesn't seem holographic without oculus because it never moves, making it simple for some but ruins the immersion for most which I dislike.\n\nItems, there are a few items mostly items just go up in MRK I, II, III which doesn't do anything really but allow you to have more uses in a single life. These are pretty balanced so no problem there.\n\nInternals, these offer some stat changes such as damage reduction while dashing, no fall damage, air dashing, etc. They dont do too much and higher tiers use more space but give better stats. You can get them with HC (The in game currency) once you get the rank to unlock them or use MC (Cash) to unlock them regardless.\n\nMechs, this game has mechs (You don't say!?) Each has a unique play style and the starting mech is pretty decent even though it looks kinda silly. Every Mech can be unlocked using HC, G2 mechs require you to master the original mech before you can buy the G2 with HC. However, with MC you can buy any mech anytime.\n\nHC, lets talk about the in-game currency for a second. Its true you can buy just about anything save for a few cosmetics with HC. However, the big problem is you will have to grind like hell to get what you want which extends the time you will be playing the game but may not neccessarly enjoy it. I hope they change that soon because I know not a whole lot of people like grinding so long to get one item/mech.\n\nTo sum it up all I will say is the game before Steam had much more immersion and was newb friendly with the longer TTK and had more features like countermeasures. It wasn't that long of a grind to get items and such from what I remember at least and I enjoyed every minute of it. But it just feels like the game lost everything I enjoyed about HAWKEN: Room for errors, immersion and the way it looked overall. Also, West coast servers feel really empty especially in Co-Op.","June 13, 2014","false","32.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The limited matchmaking, the tiny assortment of mechs and weapons, the utter lack of interesting customization. I just came back, after the Steam release, and sadly, none of these problems have been resolved.\n\nSure, visually it's a spectacle, and the game plays fine, for what it is, but don't be fooled: it's not really a mech game. It's an action deathmatch game that you happen to play with mechs. It has a lot more in common with TRIBES than with Battletech. If you're a fan of classic arena shooters like Unreal Tournament, then, give it a try, but you'll probably be frustrated with the mech-wannabe mechanics (heat and fuel, primarily, not to mention the artificially-limited maximum mousespeed.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacegiko/recommended/271290/","spacegiko","Lucas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacegiko/","232 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGotta recommend this game. Skip below for a TL;DR.\n\nHAWKEN is one of the best F2P games out there right now, it's even better than a lot of games that you need to purchase to play.\n\nSome "free to play" games are "pay to win", but luckily HAWKEN isn't one of them. Here's a big, long informative paragraph to explain how real money is used in HAWKEN.\n\nAll of the gameplay related in-game items may be purchased with the in-game currency. To have enough in-game currency to unlock the most expensive mechs in HAWKEN would require you play for only a few hours, and several locked mechs are on rotation for the player to use even if they haven't bought them. Each mech comes with a different deployable item, and alternate/additional deployable items and gear can be bought with in-game currency or real money. The stock deployables that come on newly acquired mechs offer one use per life, and specialized versions of these deployables would allow two or three uses per life, while taking two or three times the amount of inventory space, preventing you from using other deployables. These specialized versions need a lot of grinding to unlock, and can be unlocked early by using real money. This makes it so a person who just got the game could have three different deployables, while a person who paid for deployables or did a lot of grinding could have three of the same deployable. Initially I was bothered by this, but I realized there's a 7 second cooldown after using items, so three items can't be deployed immediately to offer any sort of advantage (additionally, only one of one type of deployable turret may be used by a single player at the same time, so there's no way to  pay to win and have three turrets out while the other guy only has one). Other than unlocking mechs and items quickly, real money may be used to buy cosmetics. Gaining lots of experience in a single mech earns you free cosmetics for that mech, but besides those, all cosmetic changes to your mech require real money.\n\nF2P discussion aside, HAWKEN's gameplay is unique and interesting. Compared to other first person shooters, the time it takes to kill enemies is much higher in HAWKEN. This makes it so sneaking up on somebody might give you an advantage if he's alone, but if his team is with him they'll simply turn around and out-DPS you. HAWKEN is technically a first person shooter, and it has a lot of the same gamemodes as popular first person shooters do (team deathmatch, deathmatch, control points). They might seem boring in concept, but the higher time to kill in HAWKEN transforms them into a completely different experience. In TDM, entire teams stick together in tight groups, gaining or losing ground on the map while teams try to catch stragglers alone or take and hold a tactically advantageous area. It's pretty big contrast to mindlessly sprinting around a map and finding people to gun down!\n\nHAWKEN has a super cool unique gamemode called "Siege", which I've never seen before in any game. Two teams start out on opposing sides of the map. On the map, there is an anti-air missile silo, and two energy nodes that give energy units (your mech may store and transport EU, and will drop EU on death). The first team objective is to transport enough EU from the two sites on the map to your base to launch a flying battleship, preferably before the enemy team launches their own battleship. When at least one battleship is launched, the energy nodes shut off, fixing the amount of energy on the map until the sky is clear of battleships. The second objective is to take and hold the single anti-air silo on the map. The team in control  of the silo will quickly destroy any enemy battleships, and prevent their own battleship from being shot down by said silo. While the battleship is in the air, it will constantly deal damage to the enemy base; the longer the ship is in the air, and the closer it gets to the enemy base, the more damage it will do. Occasionally, both teams will launch their battleship, even after the energy nodes have been locked. When both battleships are in the sky, they'll fire on each other, but the battleship with the support of the anti-air silo will win the fight. Additionally, mechs on the ground can turn their own weapons to the sky to fire on the battleship as a last resort, if capturing the anti-air silo is too difficult. The team whose base is still standing after the battleship bombings wins. All in all, it's a pretty hectic gamemode, and I'd say HAWKEN is worth playing just for that gamemode alone.\n\nAlso, HAWKEN now has a cute co-op mode for 4 players. It's nothing amazing, but it's good for getting some experience and in-game currency, as well as passing the time with your friends. Right now there's two co-op maps, each with 25 waves. Every 5th wave is a boss wave, with powerful enemy mechs to fight. The two maps have different boss waves, which offers some nice variety. Co-op is sufficiently difficult without being too hard, and teaches players that sticking together is best for survival (which is true in PvP as well).\n\nTL;DR: HAWKEN is a surprisingly good game. It's got a lot of unique and interesting features. It's dumbed down and faster paced compared to a more strategy-centric mech game like Mechwarrior, but it definitely sets itself apart from other first person shooters with its suspensefully slower pace and emphasis on tactics. I'm glad it has come to Steam, and you should give it a shot when it's released for free to the public in Q1 of 2014.","February 15, 2014","true","222.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"

After that I found all my matches to be incredibly one sided due to the higher level players that have spent money on the game. True, you can unlock all the mechs, guns, and items by playing but all of these things are absurdly expensive in terms of the in-game earnable currency (hawken credits). For example, unlocking a low end mech will run you around 3800-8000 HC and opening new guns on these mechs will cost you around 6400 HC. You then have to buy items for each mech individually and these will cost you 640-5200 HC depending on the level of the item. You earn maybe 100-200 HC per game, not counting the 250 HC daily bonus for each game type. Thus, you can reach the end game levels without having more than 2 or 3 mechs unlocked and most likely won't have more than a couple alternate weapons and items unlocked either.

After playing for a few hours, it gets repetative and stale. The matchmaking system is broken and new players often get matched against veteran players that paid money for the better mechs, and better internals.\nThe game may be free to play, but it's pay to not grind.\nBasically, you start off with the "Fred" mech, which isn't to bad by itself. Then to get useables and internals (upgrades and sidegrades) and better weapons, you have to grind for hours and hours and hours.\nEach match gets you only a few hundred credits (in game money), and that's only if you were on the winning team, were at the top of the scoreboard and got the most kills. If you were on the losing team, you could earn less than 80 credits per match.\nAlso, the weapons and internals and useables are at least 6000+ credits a peice. So be prepared to grind for everything. Oh, and did I mention that the good mechs are 12,000+ credits a peice.\nFinally, during matches you earn experience that levels up you're mech, the higher the level, the better the internals and useables you can equip. The game also says that at a certain level, you will unlock alternate, often better, weapons for your mech, what the game doesn't tell you is that after grinding for hours to earn the exp. needed to unlock the weapon, you still have to pay 6000+ credits to actually unlock the weapon. The exp. grinding "unlocks" the ability to purchase the weapon.\nOnly play if you have absolutely nothing else to do and want to devote your time to one game. Because if you don't spend hundreds of hours playing, you will never earn enough credits to get the stuff you want.","August 5, 2014","false","29.9"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

There's also no singleplayer.\nIt does, however, have a co-op mode so you can tear down bots and bosses with your friends if you don't feel like competing against other players.\n\nThe game will be free-to-play once it comes out.\nIs it pay-to-win ?

The Mechs have a very good felling, you do not have the feeling to be in a heavy mech, you just feel like a normal guy. The Mechs are all pretty balnced which means that the Mech with the heaviest armor (Brawler) is the slowest, while some with not that much armor are faster and harder to hit.\nThe Gameplay itself is very fast, and quite well done. All the Multiplayer parts are very balanced, the only problem you may get are teammates that are used the the Gameplay of Call of Duty, which means that they run everywhere wiithout looking, which gets me to the next point:\nTactics. Tactics are and essenction point of every mech shooter, due to the fact that you are a freaking mech meaning that you are basically a tank on legs, meaning that you should not run into battle without thinking (many people do that by the way). You do not really need that in Hawken, which i think is kinda bad. Tactics are not needed, because you have infinite respawns, meaning everything is more like Call of Duty.\n\nYou can reache very weapon wihtout investing real life money, even if it takes some time. Some cosmetics can only be reached by playing, others only by paying. That means that everything is awesome, even though that you may feel a little bit demotivated because the players that invested a lot of money are "better" than you because their gattling-gun kills you faster than any other weapon on your mech, meaning that it can be unfair.\n\nTo summarise it, Hawken has a good concept, and it is nice to play occasionally in the evening.\nI can recommend it, because it is free, and you can not loose any money. There are a lot of noobs in the game, so you can get a KD of 3 pretty easy, depending on what mech you play and on your team.\n\nDOWNLOAD IT!

Seriously though fast paced mech shooter action, dashing properly (yea if you can do it right good for you because it seems like no one can and it's the key to everything) and thats a testiment to how important movement is in this game. Battles evolve completely minute upon minute and there's a good variety of mechs so you're going to get a different style of teamwork everygame. There's different mech rotations for trialing things you think would be cool and its free so why are you still reading this go download it already.\n\nI was playing back a while ago and though some people hate the changes they've made I personally love them. They've moved the game closer to the fun but intense tactical arcade that it's meant to be than the everyman for himself mech-sim that it was becoming and I for one find that refreshing.\n\nOh and it's actually not pay to win. Though you can advance quicker with meteor credits or whatever the only things you can buy with them that you cant get with the normal currency are cozmetics. So no problems there.\n\nAnyway just an all around fun and fast paced shooter which people actually do engage in teamwork in that you should all atleast give a try. I would totally recommend this, to anyone who likes mechs, and/or guns in general. :)","February 18, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But that does not mean it is trying to copy it. It has a whole different direction in its path. But anyways, it is a full on mech war zone. There are diffent types of mechs of course, theres the smaller mechs who deal less power but are majorly faster. the medium who deals conciderable power and considerable speed and the turtle. like it's name it is slow but but does anlot of damage, and one neat feture it that is can accually put a sheild infront of it, move even slower, cant fire but can have more armor. you can allso jump thanks to nitros whenever you jump tiny rockets come from your butt and propell you upwards. but becarfull for two things, it has a durability and if your too high you take fall damage. you can allso run a bit when you press your run key, it proppels you straight forword for a second so its more of a boost then a run. Next, the gamemodes. there are Team deathmatch i think free for all and this weird teamwork robot match witch is cool. and this other defense/offense game were youcollect this green gas and launch it into a container thing to launch a ship to help kill the enamy, and if you controll the center part of the map. you allso have this artillery thing that help with takeing down enemy aircrafts. but your main guns can allso take it down if you fire long enough.\nPowerups: in the store (yes this game has a virtuall economy) you can buy upgrades and power ups for your mechs. well, let me rephrase, not power ups persay, more like gadgets. you buy the gadget and you can toggle them to a key, one of the starter ones is you press a button, and it throws down this sheils that takes no damage from outer damge like orckets, but it has a durabillity and if an enemy gets in it you can be hurt from the inside.

I was immediately playing very well, which surprised me, because although I've played console FPS's well for years, I was mediocre in the brief earlier attempts I'd made at playing FPS titles with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nSome will say that HAWKEN is lacking in game modes, which is sort of true, but I don't mind it, because all the game modes present are solid and fun. It's not like certain other FPS titles that have two or three times the game modes with most of the extra ones just feeling gimmicky and/or pointless. There isn't a whole lot of diversity in weapons or modifications with a lot of overlap across mechs, but I don't mind this either, because each mech still has it's own unique feel, and the overlap in equipment allows you to transition to new mechs more easily.\n\nI recommend this game 100% to anyone with an interest in FPS's. The starting mech is plenty capable for combat, and in my opinion, the grind to get enough in-game credit to purchase new mechs is not bad at all. Adhesive Games should be applauded for the free-to-play structure of this game. I'm good enough and play enough that I didn't really need to spend more than a few real dollars on the game for cosmetic items; but I love the game so much I purchased both the Mercenary and Prosk packs just to support the developer!\n\n","July 9, 2014","true","61.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cockles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solsroyce/","116 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNot sure where the mech trend is coming from. As a person that's played through all Mechwarrior games by Microsoft I can say this game is fairly fun and a bump up futuristic realisation of the same genre and concept, although incorporated in present day features.\n\nPros:\n- Mechwarrior shooter.\n- Gameplay feels solid.\n- Balanced stats.\n- Action-packed fights.\n- Broad customization and gear boosts.\n- Nice graphics, but not very demanding.\n\nCons:\n- Pay to win.\n- Gets repetitive.\n\nI played Mechwarrior in the past and was a small fan. The games were great and it's surprising to see so many new multiplayer games popping up with a similar genre.\n\nThe gameplay on first notice felt solid. The tutorial was alright to explain me the ins and outs of the game from menu and stats to gearing and battle. And I was quickly able to jump into the game. The graphics were nice yet at the same time not very demanding. I noticed how textures would load overtime; how camouflage was first very digital-ish cloudy and then gained more detailed gradually. Texture processing was thus flawless.\n\nThe stats felt balanced. Tried all classes and didn't really feel like one class was underpowered in comparison to another or so. I had equal odds even as a beginner. All classes ofcourse had their ups and downs and it took a while to get a hang of the gameplay but that's about it.\n\nThe battles were very intense and the maps were great. One point you're running around in a pack of mechs, another moment you arrive in a fight split-second and see bullets buzzing by your cockpit and run to avoid explosions, constant metal clanking and people shooting through the skies in leaps using their jetpacks.\n\nThe customization was nice. A lot of different items to boost different stats and adapt your mech to your personalized gameplay. There's an alright level of freedom as to how you play the game and this allows for different combos in classes. - One thing I didn't like was the store though. From the moment you get on you're just bombed with commercial ads about buying things using real money, and it's just really easy to get a hold of these items and people with money just gain a significant advantage purchasing exclusives, so you're basically going to end up being forced to pay regardless. If not you're just stressed out with ads so much you'll buy at one point anyway.\n\nI feel the gameplay is just going to get repetitive. I closed the game after about an hour, but then again I'm not much of an online FPS player. I think the game can satisfy a very broad audience and might moreso be a little underrated for its quality, in comparison to games such as Titanfall.","March 11, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The still mechs "feel" heavy but can still be suprisingly reactive and nimble in the right hands.\n\nUpgrades are incremental, leveling without paying will eventually yield upgrades, but don't expect a newly-aquired toy to be a complete game-changer.\n\nI found that the outcome of every engagement is determined by pilot skill, number of nearby team-mates and luck.\n\nFans of the Mechwarrior games will find a comparitivley watered-down piloting experience, with very little in the way of system management, but much more engaging, faster-paced combat.\n\nGreat graphics and sound.

Gritty fast and raw battles, amazing visuals, and a combat system that is much more dependant on skill than your wallet.\n\nIf you loved the old Mechwarrior I and II games, fire this up.\n\nThe only big negative with Hawken so far is that it wants to "double-dip" players on the standard Bonus Exp , Bonus Credits monthly modifiers.  Unlike most (MW, World of Tanks, etc)  Hawken wants you to buy both exp and credit bonuses seperately. There is no "monthly" gold membership type option.  If you want EXP and Credit bonuses for a month get ready to pay 30 or 40 bucks for it.\n\nYou can still play it F2P but the speed at which you get exp and money in this game is insanely slow, much worse than most f2p games. Also, Items and Internals are not interchangable; if you spend a week griding to buy a droppable machine gun turret for your sniper mech your going to have to spend another week grinding to get the same turret for your brawler. This REALLY puts the pressure on you to dish out $$$$$$.\n\nSo, overall, great game but the F2P setup puts the screws to players a little too aggressively imho.  At least make it so we can get monthly bonuses for a reasonable 15$ a month or something. $30+ just for the bonuses is pretty damn greedy.","March 10, 2014","true","52.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a really fast paced game with small maps. I think this game is similar to Titanfall but there's no infantry in Hawken. Now it is still in beta but I haven't seen a single bug yet. The dev team is continuously adding new content to the game, and now we even have a co-op game mode. The level of customization in this game is insane... The graphics are extremely nice too (although I'm playing on medium settings).\n\nAnd the best thing about this game is that it is not pay to win! You only have to pay for things that does not change the gamplay. For example camo paints and other cosmetic things. Everything else is unlockable by Hawken Credits (in-game money).\n\nRight now I'm a level 15 pilot with a rank 4 Brawler (Type-C heavy). I have played a lot with this game beafore it was released on steam, so I think I have  earned that mech with about 20 hours of gaming so it's not that time consuming, but there's plenty of stuff to unlock.\n\nThanks for reading","March 8, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do think it would be good if there was some sort of singleplayer campaign; with a good writer you could have a huge expansive universe that would make an awesome experience. I also think that there needs to be some balancing so people who haven't spent a weeks salary on in-game gear can play other people like that. It would probably be better if there was some form of co-op play so you can just play through with some buddies against AI who're trying to destroy a convoy or something.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stormsoflife/recommended/271290/","stormsoflife","Stormy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stormsoflife/","204 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI came into HAWKEN as a player who has enjoyed many other mech shooters: Mech Warrior, ChromeHounds and Armored Core to name a few. At first, I was somewhat unimpressed with the tutorial, thinking the game would be rather straightforward and have a low skill cap. In my third match online, I quickly realized that not everything was as it seemed. No matter how much or little firepower or how high or low your armor amount, you could win fights against all odds if you possessed skill and forethought. The dodging and boosting is executed in such a way that even heavy mechs /can/ dodge effectively. Obviously not as well as lightweights, but that's why you have double the armor.\n\nMy first impression was entirely wrong. Stepping into the various gamemodes, I realized quickly that the modes appeal to a wide audience. For casual gamers who dislike competition, there is a coop mode where you can fight waves of bots and still earn the same currency and experience earned in other game types like Team Deathmatch, if not slower. Team Deathmatch is great because a few great players can curb a few players who are struggling. Then there is matches such as Seige, where it requires immense teamwork and has little room for error.\n\nAs to what I enjoy in the game, it's simple. The players are so diverse and the mechs are so flexible as to allow a great variety of playstyles. There's a stealth mech that can easily run into a firefight and disappear just as quickly for hit and run tactics, or there's a way to set up traps with your stealth mech and take down multiple targets by luring them. Even the large powerhouses have styles, where they can stand back and lob explosives across the map or get up close and attempt to beat others into submission with greater accuracy and firepower. What truly makes this shine is that the balance is so well done. Overall, at least, I still hate Scouts and think they need some balancing.\n\nMy literal only complaint is that the currency is slow to earn. I understand this is a gimmick to make one want to spend their real life cash to get what they want faster, but it seems slow even for that. I often have to play 10-20 matches to afford accessories for my mechs, and a good 30-40 for an entirely new mech, which will be entirely vanilla when I get it. But that's a great cash-grab, as it's the first free to play I've paid for in a long time.\n\nOverall, I give it a 9/10, not that my opinion means much. It's a wonderful game and there's a lot to learn and explore (In terms of in-game tactics, this is certainly a MOBA-esque game). I'll be playing a lot more of this.","July 18, 2014","true","83.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cockles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solsroyce/","116 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNot sure where the mech trend is coming from. As a person that's played through all Mechwarrior games by Microsoft I can say this game is fairly fun and a bump up futuristic realisation of the same genre and concept, although incorporated in present day features.\n\nPros:\n- Mechwarrior shooter.\n- Gameplay feels solid.\n- Balanced stats.\n- Action-packed fights.\n- Broad customization and gear boosts.\n- Nice graphics, but not very demanding.\n\nCons:\n- Pay to win.\n- Gets repetitive.\n\nI played Mechwarrior in the past and was a small fan. The games were great and it's surprising to see so many new multiplayer games popping up with a similar genre.\n\nThe gameplay on first notice felt solid. The tutorial was alright to explain me the ins and outs of the game from menu and stats to gearing and battle. And I was quickly able to jump into the game. The graphics were nice yet at the same time not very demanding. I noticed how textures would load overtime; how camouflage was first very digital-ish cloudy and then gained more detailed gradually. Texture processing was thus flawless.\n\nThe stats felt balanced. Tried all classes and didn't really feel like one class was underpowered in comparison to another or so. I had equal odds even as a beginner. All classes ofcourse had their ups and downs and it took a while to get a hang of the gameplay but that's about it.\n\nThe battles were very intense and the maps were great. One point you're running around in a pack of mechs, another moment you arrive in a fight split-second and see bullets buzzing by your cockpit and run to avoid explosions, constant metal clanking and people shooting through the skies in leaps using their jetpacks.\n\nThe customization was nice. A lot of different items to boost different stats and adapt your mech to your personalized gameplay. There's an alright level of freedom as to how you play the game and this allows for different combos in classes. - One thing I didn't like was the store though. From the moment you get on you're just bombed with commercial ads about buying things using real money, and it's just really easy to get a hold of these items and people with money just gain a significant advantage purchasing exclusives, so you're basically going to end up being forced to pay regardless. If not you're just stressed out with ads so much you'll buy at one point anyway.\n\nI feel the gameplay is just going to get repetitive. I closed the game after about an hour, but then again I'm not much of an online FPS player. I think the game can satisfy a very broad audience and might moreso be a little underrated for its quality, in comparison to games such as Titanfall.","March 11, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It reminds me of an old mech game on Sega Dreamcast that I played as a teenager. The game itself has great players who tend to be friendly and helpful if asked for assistance which can make all the difference for a newbie. The in-game tutorial is also rather fantastic because it works with whatever settings you made for your movement keys, rather than forcing you to work with the default key settings. The game also is excellent in the fact you can completely customize the mech's looks, as well as having plenty of different mechs to experiment with to fit your gameplay style.\n\nThe negative side of things are it can be difficult to change things in the garage in-between death matches with maybe only a minute before the next match starts. You have to go all the way back out to the garage to do any heavy modifications to your mech. That means unless you mark people you're playing with as friends, then you can't go back to the same game you left. Also, it can be hard to earn credits to pay for new mechs early on in the game. Especially if you don't have the right mech to play in or if you don't have a good run of luck with more experienced players. I will definitely be adding more to my review as I play more.\n\nCurrently, I'd give this game a 8.8/10 or a 9/10. I really don't have a lot to complain about, and I do greatly enjoy the game when I do get the chance to play.","July 8, 2014","true","26.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are plenty of pros and cons in this game--and they, while in my opinion wash out evenly, might make or break the experience for some players.\n\nWhat's great:\n-Solid Control Feel: You can really grasp the titanic weight of the mechs as they move...trembling the ground as they trod and wrecking scenery objects like toys...really giving a realistic sense of the scope of the machine you are piloting. There area wide variety of activatable tools and abilities, which take some time (and a proper mouse with lots of mappable buttons) to learn and use instictively, but all add to the feel of self-extension that mechs are meant to convey.\n\n-Intuitive Cockpit UI: The most recent version of the game's interface is a big improvement on the old versions; gagues for Heat, Fuel, Health, and Weaponry are integrated in such a way that they tell you what they are supposed to without being distracting...or hard to find. Most everything is centered around the targeting reticle, allowing you maximum information without taking essential attention away from the fight.\n\n-Mech Class Balance: Mechs are broken up into weight class; Light A, Medium B, and Heavy C. Each have thier specialty, be it superior movement, defensive power, offensive power, or a mix of the three. For every strength, there is an equal and opposite weakness, and that makes for a well-balanced, and fair selection of equipment.\n\n-Free To Play, but not Pay-To-Win: This is invariably the Free to Play catch; players with deep pockets can arm themselves to the teeth with real money, while free players are left with lackluster table scraps. Meteor has seemingly gone to great lengths to make sure that using real currency to upgrade your equipment only buys you time, not power. Everything (yes, everything) except cosmetics can eventually be bought with in-game credits, making it truly free to play...and free to win; with enough skill.\n\n-Graphics: Built on the Unreal Engine, the game boasts the tried-and-true Unreal mix of grittiness and polish. Dynamic shadows and volumetric lighting cast in contrast beautifully across the torn and mechanized landscape, with huge, immersive skyboxes. The weapons and mechs are an intricate spiderweb of metal and wiring, moving and operating with an acute attention to mechanical intricacy and detail; while giving a clear impression of the high technological advancement, yet low budget of Illial's inhabitants. Both are held together with steel straps, makeshift parts, and shoddy patchwork, all adding to dynamic of the post-apocalyptic backstory. The game also has support for PhysX particles, and true stereoscopic Oculus 3D; almost unheard of for a beta.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's not so great:\n-Matchmaking Is Poorly Organized: While the game offers a fair lineup of mechs, the matchmaking queue does not sort out players by pilot rank or mech level. This ends up in very unfair matches, pitting more experienced players with better equipment against new initiates. On either side of the table, one might find themselves bored to tears from lack of challenge, or frustrated to no end from losing every match and getting cheated out of any significant amount of credits, thanks to this major problem.\n\n-Lack of Map Variety: All gamemodes share the same 8 maps, and they get old, quick. Old arena shooters often sported 15-20 maps for each game mode...and while these maps are spectacular, and are no doubt difficult to build in volume, more are going to have to be introduced to keep players interested.\n\n-Currency Aquisition: While the unfair Pay-To-Win aspect has respectably omitted from this title, in game credits are hard to come by without a significant investment of time. A winning match yields close to 450$, each lasting 10 minutes. Mechs are 7-12,700$, weapons are 2-6000$, and items are 800-5000$. The math stacks in favor of microtransactions, and that may turn off players already frustrated with previous FTP experience.\n\nAll in all, Hawken is a solid game, and will be even more so, given some improvement. I definitely reccomend it, and you have nothing to lose by trying it. If you like FPS's give it a shot!\n","July 8, 2014","true","108.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But that does not mean it is trying to copy it. It has a whole different direction in its path. But anyways, it is a full on mech war zone. There are diffent types of mechs of course, theres the smaller mechs who deal less power but are majorly faster. the medium who deals conciderable power and considerable speed and the turtle. like it's name it is slow but but does anlot of damage, and one neat feture it that is can accually put a sheild infront of it, move even slower, cant fire but can have more armor. you can allso jump thanks to nitros whenever you jump tiny rockets come from your butt and propell you upwards. but becarfull for two things, it has a durability and if your too high you take fall damage. you can allso run a bit when you press your run key, it proppels you straight forword for a second so its more of a boost then a run. Next, the gamemodes. there are Team deathmatch i think free for all and this weird teamwork robot match witch is cool. and this other defense/offense game were youcollect this green gas and launch it into a container thing to launch a ship to help kill the enamy, and if you controll the center part of the map. you allso have this artillery thing that help with takeing down enemy aircrafts. but your main guns can allso take it down if you fire long enough.\nPowerups: in the store (yes this game has a virtuall economy) you can buy upgrades and power ups for your mechs. well, let me rephrase, not power ups persay, more like gadgets. you buy the gadget and you can toggle them to a key, one of the starter ones is you press a button, and it throws down this sheils that takes no damage from outer damge like orckets, but it has a durabillity and if an enemy gets in it you can be hurt from the inside.

The direction the devs are taking the game may alarm some who were expecting something similar to Mechassault or Mechwarriors online but to best describe the genre I would say it is a mix between traditional "mechs", the realistic hunking mass of iron and bullets, and "mechas" , the fancier and faster fighting robots traditionally seen in anime and television.\n\nThe unlock system is fast and rewarding, with the ability to unlock a new Max price robot in a week or less with the daily win bonuses. Which is much faster than more popular games like league of legends or Planetside 2. Mechs go on "Test Drive" with fully equiped loadouts weekly so you may try before you buy.\n\nGame modes vary from traditional Deathmatch and free for all where the only objective is to obliterate the enemies, to "Siege", a capture the flag/point control hybrid game that requires intense teamwork and skill to succeed. A CO-OP mode against ai is also a nice touch for those who would rather test their endurance.\n\nIf you enjoy skill based arena gameplay and GIANT ROBOTS THAT BLOW UP OTHER ROBOTS would strongy reccomend","March 24, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is not your typical Mech game,\nIt's not a slow moving game like MW is. I found it very easy to hop into the game and with the\ntutorials provided and not feel beat on. Now the game does have ingame voice and it works well. The problem lies in that you hardly hear any one using it. I will say the rare accasion that I have had 3 or 4 players talking we kicked ♥♥♥.\nWith all the changes through the bata and the new stuff here on Steam the game has seemed to take on a new life for me. First the Free aspect hit home, you know the FREE word. Now the part where you can use money to get things was a worry for me but it was mostly skins and body parts.\n\nThis game is alot of fun and I am glad it found its way to Steam.\n\nThere are 5 diffrent types of game play,\nDeathmatch- This is pretty much a given. Shoot every thing that moves.\n\nTeam Deathmatch- Ok so you have team mates now. This could be a really good thing but don't hold your breath.\nUnless you have a team of people you know and play games with you will be in a hell of a mess. Public servers are\na pain in the ♥♥♥.. But there is a slim chance you can come together as a team and win.\n\nMissle Assault- Capture and hold the silo's until the enemy base is destroyed.\n\nSeige- You have to gather energy and then return to feed the bomb. the team that does it first wins.\n\nCo-op- Now this is a 4 person slugfest. 25 rounds and man after 10 rounds you had better have your poop in a group. The mech AI gets smart and retreat and hide and heal.

Succesfully piloting your mech will take a lot of skill- preventing yourself from overheating, dodging and taking evasive action, and knowing the strengths and weaknesses of both your and your opponent's mechs are all key to victory. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is visceral and oh-so rewarding, the audio really makes you feel like bullets are pinging off your hull as you stomp towards your enemy, minigun spinning up and rocket launcher flinging its payload at said opponent.\n\nYes, microtransactions ARE part of the game, but, barring cosmetic items, there is almost nothing you can buy with real money that can't be earned in the game, and the starting mech (though unimpressive in appearence) is remarkably well-rounded and balanced. The mechs are varied and useful only for certain situations- spending money to instantly buy the biggest mech in the game and unlock all its weapons immediately won't help you win. Knowing the strengths of your mech and its weapons, and how to use them against the enemy, is what will make you do well in HAWKEN.\n\nI do spend money on this game, but what money you put in will be well-spent. Mechs (in the in-game currency to buy them outright) are roughly $10, and another $5-$10 will take you far in terms of customization. You can also buy some of the various bundles here, which will serve you well as a place to start off from.","March 28, 2014","true","99.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/recommended/271290/","ameriken","Ken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/","511 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHawken may just be one of my favourite multiplayer first person shooters ever, and I'm not just saying that because I'm actually pretty decent at it.\n\nThe premise is fairly simple. You're a mech pilot. There's another bunch of pilots working for a shady mega corporation or something, and you gotta blow them up, ideally before they blow you up. Got all that? Okay, you're good to go. Don't expect Steel Battalion level of complexity here. You aim with the mouse, boost with shift, and have a couple extra buttons for items (grenades, turrets and the like) and that's pretty much it. Surviving gun fights is about keeping your sights trained on your enemy whilst remaining mobile and keeping an eye on your fuel and heat gauges. Keeping a cool head and balancing all of this is integral to winning fights, moreso than twitch reactionary timing.\n\nThere are several mechs to select, each with different weapons (with a couple of alternatives) and a special class ability to give them the edge in battle. Aside from that, you have a few aesthetic customisation options, but you're extremely limited unless you're willing to shell out some real life dough to make your ideal death machine stand out in a crowd. The positive side of this is that all of those aesthetic options are pretty much the only things unavailable to non-playing players. Of course, paying customers can buy their way ahead of the competition, but they won't get anything that a normal player can unlock over time.\n\nCustomising the loadout of your mech is a fun process. There's no right answer to how you should configure your machine, so it's entirely up to your playstyle. One of my mechs, a Berserker, is extremely light and agile, but hits hard, at the cost of defence. It's tailored to win fights with guerilla tactics through the use of internals that give me the ability to dash and quick turn in air. For long-term survival, it's outfitted with a turret and an auto-heal that slowly repairs my mech over time outside of combat. This is just one of many combinations, one that's perfect for me, but sub-optimal for a different kind of player. Finding what works best for you and creating mechs that fit that style of play is a big part of the fun in Hawken.\n\nThe combat feels balanced for the most part, whether you're playing conservatively as a member of an organised (or disorganised, from most of my personal experiences) team or an opportunistic lone wolf in team deathmatches and free for all games. Knowledge of the different classes, quick-thinking and clever tactics are what separate scrap from salvagers in this game, and I rarely felt cheated. It's rare to find a multiplayer game that isn't a twitchy, Mountain Dew-fuelled, rage inducing blur, but this is one of those games. That isn't, I mean. It's a blast to play, and I sincerely wish it had a bigger player base.\n\nSo it's like Titanfall, if you spent all your time in the mechs. Sorta.","September 22, 2014","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also think that there needs to be some balancing so people who haven't spent a weeks salary on in-game gear can play other people like that. It would probably be better if there was some form of co-op play so you can just play through with some buddies against AI who're trying to destroy a convoy or something.

First of all, there are very few shooters that I can think of that are like it: a first-person, fast paced mech shooter.  The concept is very interesting, the mech designs are unique and thought out, and the weapons are (for the most part) balanced.  The sound design is fantastic, with missiles whooshing, bullets pinging and ringing, Thumping explosions are very satisfying, the feet of your mech thumping methodically on the ground, ad the ambience of the environment surrounding you during rare moments of silence.  The graphics are steller, and even though im only running it on a mix of medium/high settings, it still looks gorgeous, considering it is several years old already.\n\nI would talk about how the devs have abandoned the game (they did), but that doesn't matter now, as a new studio has purchased the I.P., and from the recent posts on the HAWKEN Facebook page, it seems like the new devs have their heads screwed on straight about the destiny of HAWKEN. Having been playing HAWKEN on and off since Alpha 2, I have rekindled hope for this game to become something great again. I just hope they nerf the Incinerator and Scout :)\n\nThe game has several game modes, inculding the classic Team Deathmatch as well as free-for-all Deathmatch.  It has a special co-op mode for fighting waves of A.I. drones with 3 of your friends, and a mode called Siege (don't play this mode, it is either super easy or a pitiful smackdown for you), that involves collecting energy to lauch a 'battleship' which then attacked the enemy's base; the first team to have their base destroyed loses.\n\nThe small community of driven players have kept this game alive, and the new devs say they are going to use us to help shape HAWKEN's future, so who know what happens next?\n\n8.5/10","April 21, 2014","true","252.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is everything I want out of a mech fighter. It feels authentic, tough and dirty, and every fight is explosive and grueling.\nThere's a VERY wide variety of mechs available (about 20 unique types) with customizable weapons, items, attachments, and cosmetics.\n\nAs for the free to play model, it follows it pretty well. New mechs and items can be purchased with in game points that take a decent time to build up or you can buy with real points while different mechs rotate free to play (a similar model to league of legends.)\nCosmetics mostly are only available for real cash, though some can be gained with leveling up.\n\nMy one complaint is that this game is not incredibly optimized and my laptop which runs valve games on highest settings at 120fps and most others at 60fps, this one is only 30-40. It does not impede my enjoyment and the gravel, debris, dirt flying in the air slightly lowering the fps is worth it for the effect (but if your computer isn't as powerful you might need to lower certain settings.)","April 13, 2014","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Take all the customization of a shooter like Call of Duty (First game that came to mind) has and multiply it by 10 and make it available for everyone for free?? That is truely astonishing to me. Great graphics, runs very smooth, lots of players, very VERY team based. If you try and lone wolf it in Team Deathmatch you're gonna get f_cked. No doubt. Also, mechs that have gone out and attached better equipment through purchasing Meteor points don't necessarily get the advantage. Very evenly distributed skill/equipment advantages. Very much enjoy that. Quite excited to see what else comes in. Hoping for a few more game modes, but hope they don't over saturate it with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones.\n\nOnly thing that annoys me is the 180 degree flip when holding shift. Always habitually hit it expecting to propel backwards (I know it won't do it, I just can't stop hitting it and having to remember to let off the modifier button. xD;) Go idea, I just can't get a hang of it, but that doesn't hinder the overall value of the game obviously.\n\nAlso, need to have at least a bit more stuff that can be purchased through Hawken points. I understand the need to make some sort of money off a FTP, but at least a couple things in every category. Even if its just basic stuff. Hard to choose what to buy with the free 500 Meteor points for playing for an hour. :P But thats me also being a cheap-♥♥♥. xD Although I have purchased a few just to make my mech a little bit more unique. lol\n\n\nOverall - 9/10\n\nIf you are into any type of mech games, MMO's, and massive customization.

Some have a lot of space, some tunnels, other with a mix and jump pads.\nFew different game modes, and customization of bots.\n\nYou can play fine as F2P but it does mean waiting to gain mech xp which is tied to the specific weapon upgrades/variations you can take on that specific shell.\n\nEDIT. Also costs you a lot to get basic internals (passive perks) after initially buying a mech so beware when grabbign the shiny new one that you won't have a lot of the things the trial mechs have equipped.\n\nMy analogy is based off the fact that there is no hardpoints, or localized damage model. Only 2 guns in hand and you can regen ingame when out of combat. There is "heat" but this is just a limiter on firepower as there is no ammo: again more unreal than Mechwarrior imo\n\nCustomization comes down to limited percentile perks (slight reductions or additions in set areas)\nAppesrance customization is just that.\nThis makes balance nice, and you know what to expect by the look of the mechs.","March 18, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It WILL take sometime to try out each mech thoroughly and pick between those you work with best. (My personal line-up is the Technician, the Rocketeer, and the Predator). Once you finally figure out which mechs you are compatible with, try using them in different ways. Whether its being a lonewolf, hopping on the team wagon, or simply sticking with a specific team member- im sure you'll find some good results in the aftermath of the battle. The game consists of very few bugs so far, and constant tweeks are being made to increase in-game balancing and performance. Also, new mechs are added to the game every few updates are on constant watch to get their fair-share of tweeks and battle adjustments so no mech seems overpowered. Sometimes though, you may get a player or two who think you fight a little TOO well and may call you a hacker. As far as i've noticed. these "Hackers" are really just experienced players who found thier perfect match with a very specific mech and knows when and when not to fight. Tips for those who get this game: Try your best to stay on the ground; Never stand still in a fight; Never run from a battle when close to death or it'll be easier for the enemy to shoot you in the back and finish you off.

The direction the devs are taking the game may alarm some who were expecting something similar to Mechassault or Mechwarriors online but to best describe the genre I would say it is a mix between traditional "mechs", the realistic hunking mass of iron and bullets, and "mechas" , the fancier and faster fighting robots traditionally seen in anime and television.\n\nThe unlock system is fast and rewarding, with the ability to unlock a new Max price robot in a week or less with the daily win bonuses. Which is much faster than more popular games like league of legends or Planetside 2. Mechs go on "Test Drive" with fully equiped loadouts weekly so you may try before you buy.\n\nGame modes vary from traditional Deathmatch and free for all where the only objective is to obliterate the enemies, to "Siege", a capture the flag/point control hybrid game that requires intense teamwork and skill to succeed. A CO-OP mode against ai is also a nice touch for those who would rather test their endurance.\n\nIf you enjoy skill based arena gameplay and GIANT ROBOTS THAT BLOW UP OTHER ROBOTS would strongy reccomend","March 24, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is not your typical Mech game,\nIt's not a slow moving game like MW is. I found it very easy to hop into the game and with the\ntutorials provided and not feel beat on. Now the game does have ingame voice and it works well. The problem lies in that you hardly hear any one using it. I will say the rare accasion that I have had 3 or 4 players talking we kicked ♥♥♥.\nWith all the changes through the bata and the new stuff here on Steam the game has seemed to take on a new life for me. First the Free aspect hit home, you know the FREE word. Now the part where you can use money to get things was a worry for me but it was mostly skins and body parts.\n\nThis game is alot of fun and I am glad it found its way to Steam.\n\nThere are 5 diffrent types of game play,\nDeathmatch- This is pretty much a given. Shoot every thing that moves.\n\nTeam Deathmatch- Ok so you have team mates now. This could be a really good thing but don't hold your breath.\nUnless you have a team of people you know and play games with you will be in a hell of a mess. Public servers are\na pain in the ♥♥♥.. But there is a slim chance you can come together as a team and win.\n\nMissle Assault- Capture and hold the silo's until the enemy base is destroyed.\n\nSeige- You have to gather energy and then return to feed the bomb. the team that does it first wins.\n\nCo-op- Now this is a 4 person slugfest. 25 rounds and man after 10 rounds you had better have your poop in a group. The mech AI gets smart and retreat and hide and heal. Oh they also seem to use teamwork...\n\nAs for the Mechs there are guides out there that cover it better then I ever could.","March 25, 2014","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Succesfully piloting your mech will take a lot of skill- preventing yourself from overheating, dodging and taking evasive action, and knowing the strengths and weaknesses of both your and your opponent's mechs are all key to victory. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is visceral and oh-so rewarding, the audio really makes you feel like bullets are pinging off your hull as you stomp towards your enemy, minigun spinning up and rocket launcher flinging its payload at said opponent.\n\nYes, microtransactions ARE part of the game, but, barring cosmetic items, there is almost nothing you can buy with real money that can't be earned in the game, and the starting mech (though unimpressive in appearence) is remarkably well-rounded and balanced. The mechs are varied and useful only for certain situations- spending money to instantly buy the biggest mech in the game and unlock all its weapons immediately won't help you win. Knowing the strengths of your mech and its weapons, and how to use them against the enemy, is what will make you do well in HAWKEN.\n\nI do spend money on this game, but what money you put in will be well-spent. Mechs (in the in-game currency to buy them outright) are roughly $10, and another $5-$10 will take you far in terms of customization. You can also buy some of the various bundles here, which will serve you well as a place to start off from.","March 28, 2014","true","99.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Two things that make this game great.  First, you can get all the useful items by just playing, which is quite addictive and fun.  It reminds me of Quake Deathmatch, rocket launching and jump pads!  Second, the community is one of the best that I have experienced online.  After 10+ hours of gameplay, I have only encountered ONE individual who was distastful in chat or voice.  It is FTP, so if you like fast paced shooters inside of a mech that you can customize to your play style and be able to purchase new ones just by playing then I urge you to check this game out.

I've been following this game since Team Hawken formed and showed off their first working prototype, and they've received a lot of help and support to make this game the absolute best it can be.\nThis game takes a very unique approach to blending Mechs and FPS shooters, and puts you in the pilot seat, where you will feel VERY comfortable. Movement, physics, and the way your mech reacts to your commands feels amazing. Boosting and dodging and flying through the air is exhilerating!\nOverall art design for this project is top-notch with MUCH attention to detail. Sound design is great, explosive effects and catchy menu music feel perfect; while the insane graphics options allow you to appropriately melt your eyeballs while simultaneously save your hardware from melting (Vsync is your friend, make sure it's enabled).\nAs far as betas go, let alone F2P, this game is absolutely worth anyone's time and I highly recommend it.\nI've had my time with countless shooters, totalling countless hours, from CS 1.5 to Source and CSGO, Halo 2 multiplayer, CoD MW2 and so forth; I've spent too much time in the online arena yet Hawken feels fresh and exciting to me.

I was a little iffy about trying this game out for the fact I thought it was just going to be explosion after explosion with not much to offer with gameplay. Well I was happily surprised by what I found. This game delivers a rush of energy many have failed to give. Keeping still in this game is the one thing you never want to do and it is hard to adjust from other FPS I have played in the past. The community in this game is pretty chill from what I have seen so far and I have not found a single person that has be rude to me. The thing I like is the fact that there is Co-op modes, which I would like to see more for there are only two, and the AI is not dumb, I have been in lots of matches where the bots win. Another thing I was worried about was I thought this was going to be a PTW game. This brings me to the one problem with the game, progression in this game takes TIME. Before you can get a new mech you need a LOT of HC (Hawken Credits). If you don't like slow progression, then this game might not be for you, but I have the standard mech and it has been doing just fine for my needs, even if it looks derpy I don't care, I don't see it unless I die. In regards to the progression I can't complain though, they need money and if you want to progress faster you can pay. I would pay for this game, so I plan on putting in $60 and pretending that it was a normal game that I had to purchase. To most gamers I would definitely recommend this game to all. It is free to play so there is no harm in trying it out :)","June 26, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think about CS and Mechwarrior rolled into one package.\n\nPros:\n1.Great visuals.\n2.Clear HUD which fits very well into the game.\n3. Quick to get into. Tutorials teach you everything you need to get started and leave no guessing.\n4. Sound is great.\n5. Quite intuitive and easy to grasp controls.\n\nCons:\n1. Microtransactions are always a bit iffy for me. Thankfully with Hawken these are used mainly for cosmetic changes though, and if you're wanting to access mechs or weapons earlier. So really all in all this is just a preferential taste.\n2. Open beta means certain features or balance issues might be flawed or missing but the developers seem to be releasing constant updates which is a very appreciated plus.\n\nSo would I recommend this? Absolutely. Get it and start blowing your friends to bits already.\n\n","March 1, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's F2P which means it has F2P's trappings, but it doesn't have any of those horrifying diminishing-return mechanics that, say, World of Tanks does, and the power level differences between levelled mechs and unleveled mechs are reasonably sober. As someone who loves mech games and hardcore shooters (ie: super hard stuff like Quake and Tribes), I somehow manage to love it as a semi-casual mech game.","March 8, 2014","true","68.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahbitch/recommended/271290/","mahbitch","Garog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahbitch/","302 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHAWKEN is a quick action close quarters combat FPS game with many interesting game mechanics. It is by no means a Mechwarrior clone nor does it have the same strategic gameplay though It is safe to say the developers of HAWKEN were inspired by the Mechwarrior series. HAWKEN also has support for the Oculus Rift, I haven't tried it myself but apparently it works extremely well and is a very nice proof of concept title. As for controls and combat, pretty full proof from what I can see. The gameplay with the mechs feels pretty logical in the way the mech feels when you move and the fast combat is also pretty fluid once you are familiar with the controls, the overall gameplay feels.... Realistic? If mechs were real it would be.\n\nLike the vast majority of Free to Play titles, this game does include a lot of microtransactions though I can safely say they are not as bad as some games *cough* APB: Reloaded *cough* since they do not push the consumer to purchase in-game points. You can buy almost any item using microtransactions, including weapons and mechs, which is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it is still very enjoyable and entertaining to play none the less.\nAnother thing that will put many players off is the grinding involved, there is tons and the only way around it is to, of course, use the microtransaction system. I personally am fine with grinding as long as it is satisfying and actually gets me somewhere, which it does so I'm all smiles.\n\nI do have some personal issues that I would like to say, apparently there is a feature to 'Test drive' mechs before purchase but most mech types are not eligible for tests and so it feels like your trying to buy groceries with a blind fold on. Also there has been a significant change since the alpha stage, it almost feels like the games atmosphere has changed dramatically since then. Whether this is a good thing or bad is still to be answered, some of you alpha buddies may notice once the game is released to the public.\nOne last thing, if you ever play this game and you're going to buy a mech, please, PLEASE make sure you are buying the right mech. I made one mistake of spending 12,000 points on a mech by mistake and finding out it was the worst mech in the game. If you compare the price to how much you make in a single match (150 average) then you can understand it's a huge dent in the resources I saved up.\n\nAll in all, I think it's a pretty good game. It's free, it's relatively small and it'll be out soon so go try it out!","March 10, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beatuifully designed and realized, the world of HAWKEN almost demands a story, which sadly you don't really recieve.  However, the game still drags you in with a simplistic immersiveness that lives up to (and surpasses) many other shooters and mech games.  The HUD has gone through some mechanics and design changes over the months, but the core gameplay remains the same: lean, fast, and brutal.","February 19, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all, there are very few shooters that I can think of that are like it: a first-person, fast paced mech shooter.  The concept is very interesting, the mech designs are unique and thought out, and the weapons are (for the most part) balanced.  The sound design is fantastic, with missiles whooshing, bullets pinging and ringing, Thumping explosions are very satisfying, the feet of your mech thumping methodically on the ground, ad the ambience of the environment surrounding you during rare moments of silence.  The graphics are steller, and even though im only running it on a mix of medium/high settings, it still looks gorgeous, considering it is several years old already.\n\nI would talk about how the devs have abandoned the game (they did), but that doesn't matter now, as a new studio has purchased the I.P., and from the recent posts on the HAWKEN Facebook page, it seems like the new devs have their heads screwed on straight about the destiny of HAWKEN. Having been playing HAWKEN on and off since Alpha 2, I have rekindled hope for this game to become something great again. I just hope they nerf the Incinerator and Scout :)\n\nThe game has several game modes, inculding the classic Team Deathmatch as well as free-for-all Deathmatch.  It has a special co-op mode for fighting waves of A.I. drones with 3 of your friends, and a mode called Siege (don't play this mode, it is either super easy or a pitiful smackdown for you), that involves collecting energy to lauch a 'battleship' which then attacked the enemy's base; the first team to have their base destroyed loses.\n\nThe small community of driven players have kept this game alive, and the new devs say they are going to use us to help shape HAWKEN's future, so who know what happens next?\n\n8.5/10","April 21, 2014","true","252.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not an ounce of p2w in the title as you can buy any upgrade in the game with in game currency.  I played many many hours of this game before it was released as an early access on steam. Unfortunately the player base has shrunk significantly it seems since the devs somewhat abandoned the title.\n\nHoping we get an announcement or some kind of update soon otherwise this game is dead. SILENCE IS SUICIDE FOR DEVS.\n\nTo anyone not recommending this title because of the lack of updates, that's a sure fire way to kill the game faster.

Maps are pretty big, mulitleveled, and well laid out. One down-side I have with this game currently is that there is no filter for the matchmaking, meaning you can and will go up against people that are the max level and have played much more than yourself. Now this isn't that big of a down side since you could level the playing field by spending some cash to buy better mechs, or my preffered option which is play the game and get better. I haven't ran into a mech that was too 'OP' and overused as of yet so the game is pretty well balanced. With the right level of skill, the beginner mechs (the ones you acquire/start with first) can easily beat out the more expensive ones.

The mechanics allow for an impossibly high skill ceiling, and the complex movement ensures that hackers aren't even that big of a deal.
