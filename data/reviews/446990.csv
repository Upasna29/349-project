This one was free but the remaining 4 episodes are $5 each; which I am seriously considering since I really dig this game! You are Elisabeth a girl who must leave the farm and embark on an epic and perilous journey to find her brothers.\n\nThis visual novel blends perfectly with card/turn based combat and RPG elements; I’ve never been into card based games but this may have changed my mind. The graphics and story are both well done and I can't seem to get enough of this game! I wish the first episode was longer! I love the use of the map; it's interactive and serves as your hub for travel, quests and character items and gear.\n\nWorth $5; this first episode is free. I'm hoping the remaining 4 prove as fruitful! Update soon\n\n(EDIT): Just completed the Fifth episode and I was equally if not more impressed. The length was about 2 hours which I was pleased with for about $4! This game still has me hooked; if you enjoyed the first grab this on sale! Total length of all 5 episodes was 9 hours and some change\n\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

I find the artstyle quite amazing. The aesthetics got me interested in this game and did not disappoint.\n\nAs for the rest - Huntsman: Winter's Curse is a visual novel with turn based battles. While you are quite often presented with a choice, it doesn't matter at all. There is always a "right" answer and the "wrong" answer. If you pick the "wrong" one, you'll just get to read 1-2 extra paragraphs steering you immediately on the right track. The consequences are always the same.\nStory is fairly straightforward and predictable. Some of the characters are likeable, but barely fleshed out. Narration seems to be quite shallow.\n\nThat's why the addition of combat is really welcome. It's turn based with initiative bar and cards as skills (variations of attacks, heals, aoes, status effects). There is also a character screen where you can allocate points into basic passive traits and equip your group with gear (each equipment piece has its own set of cards = abilities provided). It's not complicated at all, but relatively enjoyable and makes the game less one-dimensional.\n\nI'm on fence with this one. It's not that bad. Just short and simplistic. I would like to see more of the game's art, but I'm not really inclined to buy the remaining books. Perhaps at a significant discount. The free chapter is worth checking out though :)","April 27","true","1.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

The mix of watercolors and inked-outlines for the characters gives it a very distinct look. However, the gameplay appears to be kind of shallow and I would have guessed it was a mobile game at first glance. As for the story (in short),players take on the role of Elizabeth as she fulfills the wish of her dying father to locate and reunite the family and obviously we are having various obstacles on our way. Despite everything I gave this game a shot, mostly due to free first episode, not expecting anything special I have received really charming and addictive gameplay. Personally I am looking forward to purchase further episodes.","May 2","true","1.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I bought the season pass after playing the first episode, and so far have played three episodes in total. The plot as well as the characters are all interesting, if not slightly cliche. But that doesn't really bother me as I don't mind hearing a familiar story again as long as it's told well. Also, something I really like is the fact that you can change the story based on your choices. I don't actually think your choices affect the main story, but it's nice to have the illusion of choice, I guess!\n\nI am a huge fan of turn-based combat systems, and this game happens to have turn-based combat. During battle, you choose skill cards which you get by equipping items you pick up through the story. I liked this system, since it allowed you to mix things up whenever you wanted. I found it quite difficult to find a good skill card combination, and a lot of the time while in battle I was stuck with cards that I didn't want to use. I don't think this game is too difficult - I played it on the default difficulty setting and managed to get through the game without dying. You can switch the difficulty however, if you want more or less of a challenge, although I am not sure what that would be like.\n\nFinally, there were one or two things that annoyed me. When allocating ability points on the character page, I couldn't see the descriptions as the fonts were too small. A lot of things on that page were basically kind of glitchy. Besides that, you can't save your game. It automatically saves, and once you do something it is done forever. A few times, I wanted to see if choosing a different choice would change the outcome but I couldn't. While that sort of save system makes sense for some games, I don't really think it's neccessary here.","May 18","true","7.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The first book is free to play : a perfect way to make your own opinion about it. And since this is a fairytale, your steam wallet will magically decrease in order to purchase the season pass. Remember : magic always comes with a price.\n\nI am not fond of narrative games, but this one is so much more than that, I just fell in love with its unique type. The story is about Elisabeth, a stubborn girl who used to live in a farm with her father and decides to leave her village to start her own adventure. Her brothers left home years ago and it's time for her to look for them and know what happened to them. During her journey, she will meet many good or evil characters / monsters. Many dangers await but sometimes, fear and inner self are the worst enemies.\n\nBut this isn't only a narrative and interactive game : it has several RPG principles. The game is linear, with a few side quests and choices to make (actions and dialogues). Your characters will get experience from the fights and quests and you'll have to manage their ability trees and inventory. The turn-based combat system is quite special and interesting : every character has skill cards depending on their equipment. Up to you to find the most effective combinations to get rid of your opponents. However, the combats aren't too challenging, except the final boss.\n\nOne does not review The Huntsman : Winter's Curse without mentioning its beautiful and elaborate art style : unique, refreshing, a personal and authentic touch. The soundtrack is also particularly pleasant ; wouldn't mind to pay for a soundtrack edition.\n\nThis game is simply mesmerizing, captivating and worth playing. I sincerely hope that Desert Owl Games, LLC will come back with other gems.","May 31","true","12.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","5","5","3","0"

Like a tutorial. If books 2 and 3 are as long as the first book, then paying 5$ for each seems waaaaay too expensive. Maybe if you buy the season pack you do get your value for money, though, but it is hard to tell if they'll put these intersting mechanics to good use in the next chapters or not. Really, it is quite difficult to judge how good the game will be after just playing a tutorial.\n\nIn my opinion, it would have been more honest to make the first book a longer, satisfying experience, even if it is for free. Satisfied gamers might buy the next books. But if you leave them with an empty feeling, they might go and spend their dollars in something safer. My case is the later, but if you play the first book and do not mind taking risk, you could rake a risk, go for the season pass and see how does it plays out.","April 24","false","1.2"," 32 of 60 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","32","60","0","0"

It takes little under an hour to complete - and its free! So download it while you read this.\n\nThe Huntsman: Winter's Curse is a visual novel with turn-based RPG battles akin to Child Of Light. The graphics are all drawn in a unique and consistant style. Though the story is linear ( at least apparant in Book 1 ), there are some sidequests and optional dialogues.\n\nOh, and in case you didn't realize: this is a bit of a tie-in to The Huntsman movies. Expect their to be minor spoilers and heavy references!\n\nBook 1\nPro:\n- A good introduction to both the story and combat\n- Combat is strategic\n- Characters have a good amount of customization based upon equipment\n- Multiple dificulty levels ensure a frustrating experiance\n\nCon:\n- Intro... H.idden O.bject G.ames called, they want it back\n- Ending... as if a raven isn't already an idication of misfortune, now you give us ( plot )?\n- Length... once the chapter ends, the only thing left to click on is an ad to buy the other Books. I would have at least expected a few more sidequests or even a true battle against Eric! Maybe even something akin to an arena. This short length has me worried about the content of the other books.\n\nI absolutely recommend playing through Book 1 - it is a great experiance on its own. Not to mention free! However, I would unfortunately hold off on buying the other Books until they prove to have worthy content. So, either hunt down other reviews or wait until the developer / publisher directly state it.","April 24","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I burned through it very quick, but it was highly enjoyable.\nThe visual style, the music, the atmosphere, the dialogue reminds me a lot of "The Banner Saga" (which I consider a big plus). The dialogue does seem to allow you to take multiple choice and your decisions seem to influence the overall outcome of the game, though I haven't explored all options to see how deep the ramifications of your decisions go ( did just 1 type of playthrough).\nThe story seems pretty intriguing and well written, Im quite curious to see how the whole affair will end.\nThe character development section is pretty solid and the combat system is very very interesting, the mechanics are quite fun, based on the gear you have equipped  you receive certain action cards that you use in combat to perform various actions ( attack, heal, buff, debuff and mixes in between). The combat is turn based and does not require you to move, turn order is based on intiative which shown on a bar in the top corner and it can be increased/decreased thus allowing you opportunities to take multiple turns in 1 round or to make your enemies take a turn once every 2 rounds.\nSo per short, a lot of combat options and play styles.Overall the combat is pretty balanced.\nThe only potential downside is the length of the game(almost 1 hour for the first book and I did all the optional quests), though I hope the other books will be a bit longer since the game is quite nice and I would like to see more of this.\nSo in conclusion I warmly recommend the game to both movie fans and people that did not bother to see the films. If you enjoyed banner saga and/or are a fan of tactical strategies with a bit of RPG management in the them I strongly recommended the game, especially since the 1st episode is free and it allows you to make your own impression of the game.\nI for one will buy the season pass as soon as possible.","May 10","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me it's strongest part of the game.\nEvery turn you get cards that you use to attack/stun/debuf enemies or heal/buff yourself or ally.\nYou can buff yourself to attack two times in a row.\nYou get cards by equipping items, like in Card Hunter and you get items from almost every battle, so it's pretty fun.\nI suggest setting difficulty to hard, so that it would matter more what are you doing.\n\nStory? I didn't find it very interesting, it's avarage at best.\n\nI enjoyed the game and I might buy other books in future.","April 25","true","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laesha/recommended/446990/","Laesha","Lae.?","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laesha/","33 products in account","A very nice game, with a what seems to be an interesting story. Wonderful soundtrack, very cinematic-like.\n\nThe fighting phase is really nice for a card game but still it limits your potential to using items that provide you the cards. Allowing the player to manimulate turns based on the character's speed is interesting though.\n\nQuests are divided to story and side quests, typical, however almost all quests follow the same pattern: a small dialogue, a choice which usually doesn't matter too much and a 10-minute long fight. Also the purpose of side quests is mainly to acquire items and levels, than learn more about the story which is a little annoying as I'd like the game to be more emersive. I have to note that in Book 1 there is only a single quest that is focused on the story and not fighting for items/experience points.\n\nIn addition, most of the dialogue is pointless with only a quarter of it affecting your choices or the story.\n\nAnd lastly I have to note the game's greatest downside. The game is not complete. The game itself is about half an hour of gameplay and the rest is DLC (downloadable content) that is meant to add the next "chapters" of the story to your game. Doing this is really annoying in my opinion. This is a game I would like to play but not spend money on DLCs. It would be best if the game was complete on its own.\n\nThe only reason I recommend it is because the game is nice, and the way you play it is enjoyable. The way the developers want you to play though is not as they sell you bits and pieces each time.\n\nOverall a 6/10","April 27","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has side quests and you move by dragging on a map then you have the encounters for the battles, dialogues, etc. You attack using a deck of cards depending on your equipment, you win loot, exp and one more cool thing is that you can choose between two different dialogue options, it's not much but better than nothing.\n\nScore: 6/10","May 15","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I acknowledge its existence but wouldn't give it a second look passing by.\n\nI understand that the general artstyle is appealing to the eye but in itself very limiting but oh boy every conversation is a straight up staredown with swaying characters like a drunk seaman on shoreleave after a 6 month journey.\nAt the very least the characters deserved more poses or expressions to underline their mood or thoughts on the current event especially during conversations. Otherwise it's just text which happens to have a picture on top. How about idle animations or animations based on current buffs debuffs that are not only displayed as an additional layer of graphics but a pose. A crippled person stands different than a non crippled one. Just saying.\n\nI also understand that you do not want to write the juicy part of the story in the very first book, however I feel no motivation to purchase the other chapters to find out if there is a juicy part to begin with; the first book leaves no impression for any grandeur to come.\n\nThe SFX and music is rather pleasing however during battle you can tell that between turns of the characters there is a "void of life" in sound. Everyone takes their turn to do battle and make a sound unless affected by another party. The combat music is rather soothing than thrilling. Might just be me. Or the battlesystem itself.\n\nThe game part is most likely the more interesting but ... cards, man... cards are everywhere nowadays... Is there an oversaturation or burnout from seeing cards in every game that comes out? Whatever the case, cards cards cards. The perfect stand in for items equipments or an UI. Cards.\nTurnbased combat, not the most thrilling but it works. What not works is that everyting else isn't thrilling or engaging as well. I clicked away with a "WHEN DOES IT END, ERMERGERD!"-attitude just to get to the next cutscene or text based non interactive cluster of "story".\n\nAll in all it doesn't hurt to take a look at the game for the ~40 minutes to "beat" the first book.\n\nIf you happen to be interested in a challenging turn based fantasy rpg with a great story to boot then I can give you this one crucial hint : The games name starts with "B"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand ends with "anner Saga".\nSo long suckers!","April 26","false","0.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Wolves don't attack people, it's people that attack wolves... even though this is probably refering to the tale of Red Riding Hood, but still, enough with the ignorance and making wolves the bad guys, we're the ones killing them.\n\nDid I mention this is extremely short? I mean 1h for 20$ for the basic game... I can get my hands on games that can last 40 hours ++ on steam and are much more original than this and some are not even 20$, they'rel ike 10$.\n\nDon't buy, it is not worth the money. I play games on Kongregate that are much longer than this, are in the same genre and are totally FREE! Not to mention you need to buy additional chapter for even more money only to add another hour of play... COME ON! Don't get ripped off by these guys. Their game is very overpriced.","April 23","false","0.8"," 1 of 20 people (5%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","5","1","20","0","0"

Then it's $4.99 for the next two books, presumably to encounter the two other bosses.  Not sure how long these DLC are -- hopefully longer.\n\nHas a very thorough tutorial but combat, even on hard, is very easy.  You can swap equipment on the main character which changes the 3 cards you are able to choose from in combat.  You can also choose 1 and later 2 abilities from your skill tree that do things like:  give you an extra choice in combat (4 or 5 instead of 3), speed up the occurrence of your turn, give more damage, shield more damage, give more damage against certain creatures.  These skills can be changed after every combat.\n\nVery text heavy and about 10 encounters in the free version.  Eventually you get one other character that has a lot fewer equipment choices, at least as far as I played.\n\nVery similar to Final Fantasy in feel, a game I played up to the 2 hour limit before I quit -- not really my type of game.\n\nSometimes it's nice to play a game just long enough to get a feel for what the creator was trying to do, and since this is free, it might be a fun for half an hour or so, from this perspective.  Mechanics worked fine.  No bugs.","April 24","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has the feel of a game that was in development and a lot of time and energy was put in. The equipment changes the types of attacks and actions you can do in combat and the art style is very consistent.
