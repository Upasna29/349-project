The game consists of 5 fairly lengthy chapters, although the last chapter was very short compared to the others. The Steam page says the game has about 20 hours of gameplay, but it only took me about 11 hours.\n\nThe graphics are pre-rendered in 16:10 aspect ratio, which means that on other aspect ratios there will be black bars on the sides. I have a 16:9 monitor so there were a bit over 1 cm wide black bars on each side of the screen. Aside from that minor issue the graphics are good and the environment looks very detailed.\n\nThe story is good, although it's a pretty standard fantasy story. You must find a powerful artifact and not let the evil forces get it. The somewhat silly world and the charming characters make the story a lot better. For example there are 2 NPCs playing a fantasy RPG, in which they must fill tax forms and do other mundane real life tasks. The dialogue is also pretty funny and contains several nods to other games like the Monkey Island series.\n\nI found the puzzles to be easy and simple. I never really had to look for any items as you could get almost all of them on the first time you entered that area. The interactable hotspots disappeared once you no longer needed them or if you had interacted with them for a couple of times. You also had to interact with everything once before you could pick it up, which I learned pretty quickly. That basically meant that all the hotspots remaining after going through them all would be used in a puzzle. The inventory system made everything even simpler as the game showed a text when you could combine two items.\n\nThe game is fully voice acted and I thought the voice acting was pretty good. The music wasn't that great, but it was often barely noticeable. There are subtitles available in the game, but they don't show during the few cutscenes the game has.\n\nI thought the game was good and recommend playing it, if you like point-and-click games.","November 27, 2013","true","11.1"," 66 of 68 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","66","68","0","2"

As the story unfolds from a simple quest in finding and retrieving a secret powerful artefact before the forces of evil in the vein of The Lord of The Rings, its strong and well-written narrative creates this deep and intriguing light-hearted story that always makes you wonder what is going to happen just around the corner. Not only that, but as the story progresses in its artistically breathtaking environments, it genuinely gets better and better throughout its impressively 17+ hours long story. While admittedly it is not the most original story on the surface and some of the animations can break the immersion at times, its rock-solid narration easily makes up for them.\n\nTo my surprise, the game features some of the best memorable and likeable casts I have seen in a very long time, with plenty of exceptionally written witty humour which mocks (and pays tribute to) almost every single fantasy and video game trope out there, enough for a  handful of genuine laugh-out-loud moments. Whether it is J.R.R. Tolkien’s novels or World of Warcraft, you name it -- the game most likely covers it somewhere. Imposingly, the cast also features excellent voice acting accompanied by a fitting soundtrack when, well, when it feels like playing a soundtrack.\n\nWhat has kept this generation from embracing P&C nowadays could be partially blamed at the inconsistent difficulty-curve caused by illogical and lack of inspiring puzzles in similar games, but The Book of Unwritten Tales fixes almost all of that. The puzzles here are logical and generally easy to solve throughout the game since it encourages you to explore all the hotspots without the game holding your hand along the way. Apart from the second last chapter in particular, the puzzles here should be solved by literally anyone who is willing to explore every single detail out there, and this game has an abundance of small, yet rich, details in places. Plus, there are plenty of interesting (and humorous) dialogues and the hotspots are indeed descriptive. More importantly, there is a constant flow of momentum when solving the puzzles, something I have not seen in many games like this in years, and that is brilliant. There is never that fear of being punished and getting stuck for long periods of time for a poorly implemented puzzle. To my enjoyment, a few of the puzzles were rather genially designed thanks to a character-selection mechanic which allows the player to pick which character they want to perform certain tasks. While most of it comes down ultimately to a specific character being able to perform the certain task, it is a satisfying experience to see everyone working as a group to solve a puzzle, although I strongly feel like this is where the game missed an opportunity to expand on this mechanic.\n\nJust when the game seems to hit the nail on the head in every single aspect of a classic P&C adventure game (and beyond?), it drops the ball really heavily just at the end in one of the most abrupt endings I have seen since Dreamfall, without any sense of climactic fulfilment. It is clear that the ending was left open for a sequel, yet it was poorly executed -- causing more questions than answers. The last five minutes, including the final cutscene, felt more like the developers ran out of time and had to release the game as soon as possible, with little time spent on writing a conclusive and plausible ending. It painfully feels like the story ends halfway through the chapter, subconsciously knowing there has to be more. It is rather sad because everything up to this point was meticulously and well executed. You would honestly be surprised by how such ending can instantly change you from an enthralling mood to a pokerface the moment you see the credits rolling. That was very, I repeat, vey underwhelming.\n\nConclusively, The Book of Unwritten Tales is the closest thing to a Monkey Island experience in my book. While it does not blatantly rely on nostalgia and references from past classics to suck you in, in fact, it does have its own charming personality. It basically takes almost everything that worked in the past and improves it, or more fittingly modernising the formula, while still keeping that old-school feel of the golden-era of LucasArts/Sierra games and at least trying to break the status quo set by those classics. I can easily say that this is one the best accomplished modern adventure games I have ever played in a very long time and can also say that it will stand the test of time as far as P&C games are concerned. It just falls slightly short from a masterpiece status thanks to its unjustified ending, but The Book of Unwritten Tales is a prime example of how P&C should be tackled for new and old audiences in times like these where military shooters and other saturated AAA-titles seem to take the spotlight in the media. There is more passion and product value in this than in many titles out there and I am glad I actually got to play this, eventually. What an unforgettable and delightful experience all around.\n\nLike I said earlier, what the hell was I doing in 2012? I shall not repeat the same mistake in 2015 when the sequel will be released.","June 15, 2014","true","17.7"," 66 of 69 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","66","69","2","10"

It put this adventure games-developer firmly on the map, and has been praised for adding a unique feel to the classic point-and-click adventure genre.\n\nFor me it has been a long time since I last played a game like this. Actually, it was only since the adventure games by Telltale Games that I was redrawn into the genre, having played several of the classics many, many years ago (think 90's stuff). While the Telltale concept of adventure games focuses on a new kind of storytelling in combination with some action scenes, King Art completely stays within the boundaries of the classic adventure genre. Literally the only thing that needs to be done to complete this game, is pointing and clicking - the keyboard nor any other action is necessary, apart from pressing "spacebar" in order to see which objects are interactable with.\n\nWhile this may feel like a somewhat all too classic an approach for a game in the 2010's, it actually still works pretty well. Of course, just like any moint and click adventure game, The Book of Unwriten Tales has a lot of puzzles, but these don't feel like being tucked onto the game in order to provide a challenge or prolong playtime. The puzzles in this game form an organical part of it: they arise out of the situation, and most (if not all) of them can be solved by just thinking, not by gratuitously pointing and clicking all over the place (so it could as well be called a point and think game).\n\nThat a classic adventure game like this still works nowadays, is mainly due to the interesting storyline, which drew me into the game pretty quick, helped by the amazingly original and beautiful artwork. The soundtrack too is top-notch and strikes the perfect balance between providing some background music and yet helps in painting each scene. The music even drew me into the game in an emotional way: it helped me to identify with the characters. Even more helpful in this respect is this gorgeous voice-acting, which draws the playable and non-playable characters out as men, women and monsters of flesh and blood (or of bones or anything else).\n\nPlaying for a large part as the young Welsh gnome Wilbur Weathervane (www - just one of the many small puns) made me identify with this smart an witty character very soon, even more so since young Wilbur looks at life in a refreshing, sometimes naive way. Later in the game other characters come into play as well, providing some welcome contrasts, but it always felt like coming home whenever Wilbur was the one I was in charge of. The game does tend to "let go" on this strong point near the end, when Wilbur disappears more or less into the background.\n\nWhile all these qualities help to make a game of good to very good quality, the one element that differentiates The Book of Unwritten Tales from lots of other games, is the humour and even the irony with which the game looks at itself and at the entire world of games. Describing individual scenes from this game is difficult without resorting to spoilers, but when at a point quite early in the game I had to shut down a "server" for a "rpg machine" in order to rid two side-characters from their "game-addiction", I laughed out loud. The entire game is full of these sidekicks at the gaming industry, complete with wondrous quotes and one-liners. When a very depressed Death himself at a certain points says "This is an adventure game, nobody is supposed to actually die here", you know you're in for a treat.\n\nBesides the poking at different games and genres, The Book of Unwritten Tales also makes fun or rather poses some questions about the entire fantasy-concept. It does so by obvious references to The Lord of the Rings, but also by turning some conventions from the fantasy-genre upside down or inside-out. All in all, this is a game into a lot of thinking has been put, without interfering with the actual fun of playing it. I can only recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone even remotedly interested in adventure games. And for all of you who have forgotten how a classic point-and-click game should look and play like, don't look any further. They don't come any better than this one for the time being.\n\nOverall score: 9/10","April 20, 2015","true","22.1"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","7"

So no useless clicking each item with one another only to get a "That can't be done" message.\n\nPressing 'space' shows you all active points on the screen (when it works, and it does in 99% cases). Plus, when you exhaust everything about a hotspot it ceases to be clickable so that it doesn't get in your way anymore.\n\nThe story is really nothing special, just a generic fantasy adventure one that serves to put you into interesting places and sets up jokes. There are plenty of popculture references in it, including Lord of the Rings and even Star Wars. That can be a pro or a con, depending on your taste.\n\nGraphically the game is really stunning. Character models are high quality and backgrounds are truly beautiful. Animations may sometimes be a little wonky though, and the pre-rendered cutscenes are very compressed and look almost abysmal when you compare them with the in-game visuals.\n\nEnglish dubbing is very good, in some cases (Wilbur) I'd say excellent. The game is fully voiced.\n\nThroughout the game you'll be controlling various characters, sometimes you'll have up to three of them to switch between so solve a puzzle. Here are my thoughts on those playable characters:\n\nWilbur Weathervane - Great VA only makes this already great character even better. A sheltered gnome thrust into an epic adventure, his naive and good-natured demeanor made him my favorite instantly.\nIvo - A generic 'hot female elf'. I'm neutral towards this character, there just wasn't anything standing out. Associates with an annoying character of the bird Tschiep-tschiep.\nNate - Shifty cheater and liar, but deep down a good guy. I liked him better than Ivo, but he doesn't really compare to Wilbur.\nCritter - One character I really disliked. Doesn't speak, instead he (she? it?) makes noises and speaks in a nonsensical language. Would be cute once or twice, but got on my nerves soon after that.\n\nThe game is decently long, took me something over 10 hours to finish.\n\n-----\nFew negatives I've noticed:\n\nThe function of showing all active interactable places malfunctions few times. I noticed one occasion of the marker being in the wrong place and one case of it missing. Neither is a serious problem, because those items are not hard to see at all.\n\nCutscenes are of a really low quality compared to the actual game.\n\nThere's a stealth section that felt a little wrong in an adventure game. When you get caught you get escorted outside in an unskippable cutscene, however your progress in that section is saved which makes it bearable.\n\nAnimations may sometimes be not as good as the rest of the game, and are unskippable which can get annoying if you're re-doing something multiple times.\n\n\n-----\nOfficial rating of the Sloth Academy:\n3 golden sloths\n","October 17, 2015","true","11.0"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","26","27","2","0"

Quite good writing, the scenario is interesting and surprising, the music is nice but you wouldn't notice it most of the time and its main pro is the humor and references during all the game. Regarding the references, it's kind of "which one you have found, I could tell you how old you are" as there are plenty from old to new games (adventure, MMORPG...), films etc.\n\nAlso, while you play, you will have to manage different characters which make the game more interesting. But the game itself is not very hard to go through. Most of the puzzle are quite logical, just to be careful to check if you have interact with all you can see in each area and talk to every actors of the game. A hint, if you couldn't go further, try to speak to everyone you can again.\n\nAll in all, it is a very nice game I really enjoy to play with and I recommend it to those you like adventure game. The one thing I missed (but finally not so much) is that there is no French option... but the English version is very well made.\n\nUpdate: finally, there is a French version, well not the voice but at least the subtitles which is a good start ;o)\n\n---------------------------\n\nVersion française :\n\nComme la plupart des commentaires en ont fait part, c'est un jeu d'aventure vraiment sympa dans la même veine que ceux de la grande époque Lucasart.\nL'écriture est bonne, le scénario intéressant et surprenant même, la musique assez sympa même si vous ne la remarquerez pas une partie du temps, et sa principale qualité à ce jeu se trouve au niveau de l'humour et des nombreuses références que l'on peut y trouver. Au niveau de ces derniers cela va des jeux vidéo aussi bien anciens que nouveaux jeux (de type MMORPG, aventure...), films etc.\n\nAussi, sachez qu'un autre intérêt à ce jeu c'est lorsque vous jouer, vous allez diriger plusieurs personnages. Cela dit les casse-têtes ne sont pas très difficiles et assez logiques, il faut juste avoir bien vérifié chaque tableau pour voir si on a rien oublié et aussi ne pas hésiter à parler avec les différents personnages. Un petit truc, si vous êtes coincés, n'hésitez pas à retourner parler à tous les personnages qui vous entourent.\n\nEn conclusion, c'est vraiment un jeu auquel j'ai pris un grand plaisir à jouer et je le recommande chaudement à ceux qui aiment les jeux d'aventure. La seule petite chose qui me manquait (et encore) c'était la version française. Mais cela est maintenant du passé car il y a les sous-titres en français. Cependant la version anglaise n'est pas très difficile à suivre et peut être un bon exercice pour ceux qui désirent s'améliorer avec la langue de Shakespeare.","February 4, 2014","true","15.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

It's a fairly standard fantasy point-and-click adventure, where there's a big bad guy trying to get a powerful magic item, but it has a number of features that make it more entertaining than what you'd expect from such a generic situation.\n\nOne of the best innovations I've seen in a while is that hotspots will disappear after you've done everything possible with them. That really helps eliminate wasteful backtracking and double-checking of red herrings. You also switch around between three characters, all with totally different personalities and abilities. It's a bit reminiscent of older LucasArts games like Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken. These two features help keep the game moving.\n\nThe other thing that sets this game apart is its excellent sense of humor. The game walks a fine line between meta-humor and camp while playing with genre tropes and expectations from RPGs and graphical adventure games. Fantasy geeks will appreciate all the jokes referencing other games, books, and movies. The voice acting is also very good, which helps with the delivery of a lot of the humorous lines.\n\nThe 3D graphics are mostly good, although there is some clipping and other weirdness here and there, and the cutscenes are only fair. Scenes are shown from widely varying angles to allow access to everything you need, which is appreciated.\n\nIt took me twelve hours to complete, and I feel like I went at a fairly steady pace, so I'd expect 10-15 hours for almost anyone to finish it. Overall, any experienced adventurers will enjoy the game quite a bit, and it's easy to recommend for such folks.","July 16, 2015","true","12.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Of course all the parody lines from classic movies like Platoon, Stars Wars, and Lord of the Rings, plus the whole MMORPG and RPG buffing parodies, a bit of 4th wall breaking and a few omages like Discworld's Death (Terry Pratchett), Raiders of the Lost Ark and Planet of the Apes (the original Charleston Heston version) make this game's blatant to subtle parody humor all that much better.  The game, itself, is even better then its humor.\n\nStoryline: Wilbur Weathervane, gnome, wannabe wizard, adventure day-dreamer, sometimes tinkerer, and full time employee at a dwarf bar gets the chance of his lifetime when Mortimer MacGuffin's (gremlim, archaeologist and chronicler) prison cage literally nearly drops on his head and hands him the ONE RING, before "quest" tasking him with delivering the ONE RING to the Arch-Mage Allister in Seastone before the Arch-Witch can get it.  Mortimer, the gremlin, who had been "freed" by the wood elf, Ivo (incognito Princess and wannabe adventurer) is recaptured and taken to the Arch-Witch, who of course is the cause of the endless war since she wants to rule the world.  Meanwhile, Ivo has also been given a "quest" task by Mortimer while she was freeing his cage from the cargo dragon.  Ivo is to find and retrieve a book, which has directions to the amulet of ultimate power, from the gremlin's secret cellar and take it to the Arch-Mage Allister in Seastone.  While all this is happening Munkus, the Arch-Witch's son is hot on the trail of finding the amulet of ultimate power so he can over-throw his mother and be in control of the world instead.\n\nGameplay: Point and Click adventure with a build and use inventory of items.  The gameplay is easy to follow and the tasks/obstacles are very logical given the circumstances (and people involved).  There are a few objects that are "well hidden" but if the gamer thinks for a bit, the object needed is easy to locate. (Careful searching will also accomplish the same task.)  Any encountered character gives clues about the task at hand and the main character will basically tell the the gamer what needs to be done and often times what is needed to accomplish the task.\n\nThe gamer will eventually play as four different characters, all with their own perspective, personality and knowledge that each character would possess due to their background.  In one area the gamer even has a choice of one of three characters to play, and each character solves the task at hand differently using their natural abilities.\n\nThere are 5 chapters total.  During any chapter the gamer might play as a completely different character doing a completely separate task, once another character has finished their objective. There are also places when two (in one place three) characters are available to play at the same time by switching between them.  In these areas one character is capable of performing certain tasks the other character is not.  Also the knowledge each character possesses is clearly seen/heard.  The characters must work as a team to complete the task, and often times need to talk with each other to share knowledge and to trade inventory items.\n\nOverall, wonderful game, superb witty humor and and excellent story of unlikely heroes.  Well worth full price.\n\nNote: This is the first of two games and there are DLCs available.","January 29","true","24.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

At times, it almost feels like the Discworld books meets Day of the Tentacle, and that's the highest praise I can offer. I was constantly amused and even laughing out loud during much of the game.\n\nLike any game in this genre though, there are some minor rough spots involving items that are difficult to notice/find. Thankfully, this only happened a couple of times during the story, and was far less of an issue than many other games of this type. There was also one puzzle that has you setting waypoints on a map that was extremely obtuse and annoying. Also, be warned that the game does make fun of many fantasy tropes, but it always feels like a sly wink and a nod rather than being cynical or mean-spirited.\n\nDespite the minor rough spots, the game was truly a joy to play and highly recommended if you're a fan of the point and click adventure genre, or simply a fan of fantasy comedy like the Discworld series.\n\n","December 27, 2013","true","17.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

There are touches of The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Sam and Max, Terry Pratchett's "Death" character and even a rendering of the tree from a version of 3D Mark.\n\nLong review short, you play a gnome who rejoices in the name of Wilbur Weathervane, but unlike other gnomes you have little interest in mechanical inventions. You would much prefer to become a Mage, and study all things magical. You start the game as a kitchen "assistant" in a once-popular Dwarven Inn... that was before The War descended upon the population and all of the Dwarves enlisted to go to the battle front... apart from the barman.\n\nA deadly artifact has been uncovered in some texts by archaeologist Mortimer McGuffin, an aged Gremlin, which threatens the entire existence of the known world should it ever be found, but before he can warn the Arch Mage in the town, he is kidnapped and held hostage under threat of torture to reveal the location of the artifact.\n\nThe game starts with Mortimer's rescue, which indirectly introduces Wilbur into the story as well as a gorgeous female elf by the name of Ivodora Eleonora Clarissa, Princess of the Silver Forest Realm. The fate of the world lies upon your, and her, shoulders... and a couple of companions you happen to pick up along the way.\n\nFrom the very beginning, this game portrays a sense of humor that traverses so many levels and borrows from some well respected sources. The one that sticks in my mind is a scene where you meet Death, immediately identified with the well respected Terry Pratchett character when Wilbur asks why he isn't speaking in capital letters... and in case anybody missed it, Death is actually wearing "fluffy bunny slippers" which are actually modelled on Max from Sam and Max,\n\nThere are also not-so-subtle references to Star Wars when Mortimer appears in a hologram to the Arch Mage and tells him that "he is their only hope". This game is full of wonderful tongue-in-cheek humor borrowed from some well respected classic sources which fit well with the characters and are delivered perfectly throughout.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are not difficult... obscure sometimes but not difficult. You just need to stop for a minute, count to ten and re-think a situation, and the answer will come easily to mind. The only thing to mention here is that is is _essential_ to re-visit locations _AND_ to re-click on items you have already looked at previously. Sometimes an object will only reveal a vital clue after you have progressed a plot-line further, even if you have examined it previously, you _will_ need to examine it again later to solve a puzzle somewhere.\n\nIt is this constant re-visiting of locations which is both a blessing and a curse, however the scenes are beautifully rendered so re-visiting is actually a pleasure, and visits are not too repetitive. Also, thankfully, several forms of "quick-travel" have been implemented which really helps as you progress through a chapter.\n\nThe developers have done a good job of programming the navigation in this game, it is quite polished and is primarily mouse-driven with a minimum of keys required to play, which makes for some fairly quick gameplay when it is needed.\n\nOverall I would rate and recommend this game highly, it was a pleasure to play (for me at least) and it had a light air to it which I found refreshing in a steampunk style graphics game. The characters were light and friendly for the most part, even the "evil" characters were given a light humorous feel to them.\n\nThe game rendered just fine for me in 1920x1080 and the sound was really quite pleasant, although the music had to be cranked down a bit to stop it over-riding the speech. Not that the music is unpleasant, the score is quite classical and provides a very pleasant background to the game.\n\nThere were a couple of in-game sound effects that were not normalised but only a couple, the voices themselves are very well balanced and the variety of accents are actually genuine, being portrayed by genuine voice actors, not impersonators.\n\nI would end this review by saying give it a try, you will be pleasantly surprised at how easily 8 hours of your life will just sail by without you realising it. This is quite an immersive game despite the simple plot, and if you are new to point-and-click then I would suggest you give this a serious go.","September 7, 2014","true","10.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It has good story, sophisticated humor, awesome characters, beautiful soundtrack, etc.\n\nThe plot is hardly unwritten but it surely is very well told. The evil creature 'Mother' lurks in her heinous tower and tries to get her hands on a special relic with which she could take over the world. Game's 4 main characters get involved to events - whether they want it or not. Becoming from different parts of the world and having diffrent values their paths cross and will eventually become friends. Unlike in some other games of the genre - every playable character of The book of Unwritten Tales' is interesting and I always kept thinking that how they end up. Toast for the talented voice actors!\n\nThe puzzles are typical point&click. While writing this review no particularly annoying puzzle is reaching my mind - there was however one itchy stealth event at the midway which did not fit in the game so well, but provided some variation perhaps. Some people have claimed that the game is even too easy when pointing the places of interest for player, for example. On the other hand I can quarantee that this is still much more challenging than some of modern adventure games of Telltale.\n\nThe Book of Unwritten Tales has already proved its potential and the sequel has already been released!

More so, she was a dragon whom had become lost in a world of mindless carrying work and was now looking to take on the stereotypical image of the viscious, male dragon. Although now that I think upon it, she did seem like something similar to twilight (a vampire who's not a vampire; a dragon who's not a dragon; do you get the picture, eh?), but her character was certainly amusing enough to ignore this increasingly occuring character aspect in now modern culture.\n\nMy favourite characters were Nate and Wilbur, I have to say. Nate appealed to me at first because of his rouge appearance and Wibur...well, who isn't intrigued by cute little gnomes with grandpa's. The graphics were simply amazing (from characters' outfits to cutscenes), and I can't fault that one bit. Guillivar's character was particularly entertaining, I found.\n\nHonestly, I entirely loved the game - minotaurs are not often represented enough today in culture and, as expressed, although there are some cliches (weeping women, dragon's not being dragons, etc), it was truly a breath of fresh air to play. The ending was perhaps a tad abrupt and could have been made longer, but it was clearly done to leave an opening for a sequel.\n\nSo, in any case, after playing as Guybrush Threepwood for many, many years, I was looking to experience a new point-and-click, adventure game and I believe I found it :) I can only hope that the sequel that's being planned comes out soon. After all, I want Wilbur's family and that dwarf bartender to see his new outfit ;)","July 16, 2014","true","20.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You are a fan of point and click adventure games, but long gone are the days of Guybrush Threepwood, Roger Wilco, and purple tentacles. So, naturally, you've left games like that to the past, and whenever anyone tries to make a new one, it's all focused on graphics, never on story, never on humor, and certainly never the old 'combine these things to make this new thing to solve this puzzle'.\n\nWell, I can say that if that is what you are looking for, The Book of Unwritten Tales is for you. The humor is a good blend of clever, self-aware, and just plain groan-worthy. The puzzles are not too simple and not too complicated. Well...ok, maybe a BIT too simple. Most of them were actually pretty basic, though a few stood out as clever.\n\nMy only complaints about this addition to the genre were fairly minor. One of the more classic moments in these types of games was in The Secret of Monkey Island where there was a whole string of events that happens outside of your control and everything occurs off screen with you just sitting there reading the text and listening to the sound effects. A direct homage to that happens in this game, but then a couple more times things similar to it happen....once was funny and a nice tribute, but multiple times sort of makes it feel like lazy writing or a way to advance the story when there's no logical way to tie two events together.\n\nThe other issue I had with this was one of...I don't know...dialogue trees? Programming? I am unsure what it would fall under but on multiple occaisons I would find an item and go 'Oh...I wonder if person X would like this items...' and so I go to check and they respond with 'Oh, hey, thanks for getting me that thing I asked for, here is the item I promised in return.' Except that none of that dialogue happened. It skips it entirely. It's not really a PROBLEM, but it certainly breaks the scene a bit and makes you kind of annoyed that you missed what might have been some funny moments.\n\nThose gripes are minor, however, and I recommend this game a lot, even if you've never really played point and click adventures before as there isn't quite as many gaps in logic as you find in many others.\n\nP.S.

(IMO)\n\nAfter playing more than a fair share of (point & click) adventure games in my life from all the way back in the beginning (in the 80's) up to present time, I have to say that this goes right in amongst my all-time favorites. It is a fantastic blend of humor, lovable characters, amazing artwork, intriguing puzzles/tasks to solve and excellent writing. It pleasantly breaks the 4th wall and shower us with references to games and movies alike that especially speak to the ones of us that has grown up with these types of games. I had many many "Laugh Out Loud" moments playing through this game, and it felt proper lengthy as well.\n\nThe difficulty level was a bit up and down, and there was a handful of pixel hunts, plus quite a bit of running back and forth, but it didn't ruin the experience at all. There was so much fun going on when doing all those things that it didn't matter.\n\nThe voice acting had me a bit worried at first as it seemed a bit flat at the very beginning, but it quickly escalated and felt proper good. The Welsh English dialect seem to suit this setting very well, as it did in Ni No Kuni. The sound effects and/or animation was a bit off at times, but easy to look past that.\n\nI can easily recommend this game to anyone who's into adventure games, or I'd actually go as far as call this a must have for any adventure fan. It would also be a good choice for people not familiar with these types of game and want to try one out.

Despite the fact that the writers spend most of  their time crawling up Terry Pratchet's *** (read: honorable bottom), the writing is rather decent with a variety of references for all tastes and walks of life, distinctly articulated characters and some great chuckles in between. I also rather enjoyed the voice acting and generally found myself not skipping through the dialog. The art style is brilliant and the soundtrack is also great. The puzzles are for the most parts good, in a traditional point & click, Lucas Arts type of way.\n\nOn to the negatives: The early game is in every way superior to the later game, making me wonder whether they run out of time by the end of production. Specifically, in most of Nate's part there was less love in the details, the puzzles were worse (more unintuitive, more pixel hunting), and it all kinda dragged on without an apparent reason and without the great writing that made it all flow earlier. Problem number two was also mostly apparent in the second half: the lack of any type of hint system. If you want to get away without including one, you'd better give better clues, either with the art or with the writing, which the second half doesn't accomplish well. Lazy puzzles of the "put item x on spot y for no apparent reason" variety (and btw, good luck finding that "y" spot) are immensely annoying. It all becomes 10 time more exacerbating by unskippable cut scenes ("wuzza" anyone?) in two of those later puzzles. I don't appreciate alt-tabbing and having to look for walkthroughs - which I did because the "wuzza"s were ruining my enjoyment of the experience. Last but not least, I found the ending rather anticlimactic: basically an annoying cliffhanger-y type of thing that the game didn't deserve.\n\nNonetheless. It's for the most parts a good adventure game, beautiful to look at, great to listen to and with mostly interesting traditional point & click puzzles. Get it on a sale or a bundle instead of full price, and you can't go wrong.","August 23, 2014","true","15.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's one of those hidden gems no one knows about.\nPuzzles. Puzzles are logical in this game, unlike in some other adventure games where puzzles are made very hard and solutions are very illogical.\nThe difficulty is great too, you don't spend hours on one puzzle, but you don't solve them in 10 seconds too.\nThe story is very good and fun too, you want to read/listen all the dialogs. It has good humor, i laughed many times while listening to the conversations.

You'll notice more than enough references to Tolkien's Lord of the Ring, plus a bit of Terry Pratchett's Discworld, Harry Power, Indiana Jones, Doctor Who, and of course RPGs or other geekery in general.  I wouldn't say the references are all that humorous, nor are they even a decent attempt at humor.  The vast majority of the jokes are, "Hey players, look at how we are obviously referencing ______ here!"  The jokes fail to be funny on their own, so if you are not familiar with each and every reference, most of the dialogue will seem to be nothing more than idle chatter.   Even if you are familiar with the references, you probably won't find them funny.\n\nThe puzzles are not particularly challenging to figure out, especially since you're pretty much guaranteed to succeed so long as you interact with all available objects.  This becomes quite the chore in the larger areas as you have to sit there and listen to the dialogue for every single item on the screen.  You could of course skip the dialogue, but for an adventure game, if you're going to skip the dialogue you may as well not even play the game.  Chapter 4 becomes particularly tedious as you are required to trek back and forth across the map numerous times.  To make that even worse, two of the puzzles can only be solved with trail and error, so you may be making the same trek multiple times.  Pressing the space bar reveals all interaction points in your current area, so it is never a challenge to find everything.  Sadly the use of the space bar is almost a necessity because there is nothing to indicate what you can or can't interact with as you play.\n\nThis all combines for a game that is okay enough to play in short spurts but not something I'd really want to play for long periods of time.  For a 15+ hour game, this is definitely not a good thing.  I often found myself quickly reading the subtitles so I could click through the dialogue, really doing anything I could to speed the game along.  The game starts off well enough, but by the end I found myself wondering why I even bothered to finish.  Chapter 2 has the best characters and best script.  Chapter 3 is by far the best chapter in the game in terms of puzzles.  After that, though, the game really takes a nose dive on the enjoyment scale.\n\nI do not recommend this.","February 28","false","13.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","2"

He manages to give a ring to Wilbur, a Gnome who wishes for a greater purpose in life, between being freed and immediately recaptured by a dragon. Cue the adventures of Wilbur the Gnome and Ivo the Wood Elf as they attempt to save the land from the Arch-Witch Mortroga.\n\nThis game is OK. From the beginning it has a clear idea of what it wants to do which is poke fun at multiple fantasy tropes with World of Warcraft seeming to be made the most fun of (Wilbur's first area looks incredibly like Dun Moragh for example) but still tries to keep up with its story. Later it seems to get rather cofused and some parts and character descisions make little sense such as Nate (a selfish scoundral interested in his own wealth) suddenly decides to want to save the land instead of ensuring his own safety and wealth. It is a rather odd character descision that comes out of nowhere much like other certain plot devices.\n\nThe worst part is pretty much the end. Which decides to solve the worlds troubles with a convuluted plot and then ends rather abruptly with no real explanation of what just happened.\n\nIt's not a bad game. The story does get rather sporadic and non-sensical towards the end although it may just be that the game feels more compelled to tell jokes rather than a story.

If you ever have been put off by some obscure adventure game in the past and decided to avoid the genre all together, give this a try. I think you will change your mind.\n\nWhat's so awesome about this game?\n\nThe script and writing are simpy terrific! Fantastic sense of humour, hilarious ideas and really nice 4th wall breaking. I've lost count how many times I laughed and chuckled. Yes, the story involves you saving the world again, but there are couple twists along the way and it's not easy to predict what will happen next (especially taking into account adventure game logic ;). Characters are likeable and have strong personality. Their adventures usually involve finding themselves in absurd situations, facing ridiculous obstacles and solving problems in most unusual way. So adventure gaming in its best classic comedic edition.\n\nDuring the course of the game you control different characters and there are times when you can switch between them on demand. The puzzles are fun and with subtle hints from conversations and item descriptions you always know what you need to do. You find and combine some items, execute actions in right order or say right things to right people. One of the highlights is preparing a magic potion, where you need to follow closely a recipe and add ingredients in correct amount, order and at right moment. There were times I missed an object (I only found out later that you can press 'space' to see all interactive objects on the screen) and walked around a bit, but in the end I found a solution by myself.\n\nVoice acting is top-notch. I went through every possible dialogue option and clicked on every item to hear every single sentence. As is expected from adventure games, the game is pretty to look at. It's 3d graphics with locked camera, but it does have handdrawn vibe and charm.\n\nIt all comes together perfectly. Great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirasenou/recommended/215160/","kirasenou","Kira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirasenou/","120 products in account","The Book of Unwritten Tales\nI personally had never heard of this little gem until I watched Jesse Cox's Fan Fr-aturday where he played The Book of Unwritten Tales 2, watch it here.  During that gameplay, I found that the game's quirky comments, characters, music, and look was really entertaining.  Of course, it was clear that there was some story involved, and having never heard of the series, I decided to play it from the beginning.\n\nThe game itself is a point-&-click puzzle rpg.  Meaning, movement, interactions, even crafting, all just simply requires your mouse.  It is set in a medieval fantasy-esque world where there are mages, dragons, gnomes, elves, bounty hunters... The world is very colorful indeed.\n\nVisuals:  This game was released in 2009, and the graphics are pretty evident of that.  It is by no means an ugly game, it is very colorful and the characters all are very unique.  The animated scenes are nothing to boast about, but it could be worse.  Overall, compared to games that are out today, the visuals are in short, dated, and the characters look quite... odd.  Especially the wood elf, Ivo.  That being said, I still enjoyed the look of the game keeping it's age in mind.\n\nSound:  The music is lovely, though, there isn't a huge variety of tracks.  Still, the music fits the various scenes you are in, and, doesn't get annoying after listening to it over and over, especially if you get stuck in an area.  The character voices are charming, and fit each of the characters.  Sounds of the various items in the world and creatures, all good.  No complains on sound at all.\n\nControls:  As I said, this is a point and click game.  So, you can pretty much toss your keyboard to the side and just sit back with a cup of tea in one hand, mouse in the other and have at it.  There are some areas where the positioning of the various items you interact with are close to your "items" toolbar, which sometimes calls for maneuvering of the character's positioning, if possible.  The item's tool bar goes into auto hide until you hover your mouse down over the area, then it pops right up like toast from a toaster.  The cursor often changes to a orangey-red color when you are hovering over an item you can interact with, so if you get stuck, scanning around for intractable items is a good way to try to figure out how to move forward.  Overall, I had no issues with the controls.\n\nStory:  The story was... well, broken up into four chapters.  Each chapter taking you into a different area.  There is no epic background story of the world and various characters like you would find in some rpgs.  In fact, there's a war going on between an evil witch queen and her creatures verses the arch mage and the humans, dwarves, and so on.  The mission is to prevent the evil queen from obtaining something that can shift the balance of the war, yet, it really felt the war was just a simple backdrop and most of the game was the characters bumbling about.  The interactions between the characters are preciously adorable at times, and over all, it is entertaining.\n\nPuzzles:  For the most part, the puzzles were not too difficult.  Some, easier than others.  My problem was that I would already have figured out how to solve the puzzle, but, would be ten steps ahead of what the game itself has lined up.  So instead of doing steps 1-5 in consecutive order, I would do step one, and see already how to complete step 5.  Of course, that would leave me running around trying to figure out where the hell do I go for steps 2-4.  The game is pretty forgiving, dialog options allow you to redo them if you selected the incorrect choice, and most puzzles just reset if you made a mistake.\n\nEnding:  The ending did feel a bit abrupt, and, while I felt that great sensation of completing a game, I felt that the ending was a bit rushed.\n\nTL:DR\nThe Book of Unwritten Tales is a fun and witty puzzle rpg, of the point-&-click kind.  The puzzles vary in difficulty, but to the perceptive and detailed oriented player, they should be no problem.  Story is a bit short and unengaging, but it doesn't really matter for the game play.  Characters are fun and unique enough, providing entertaining dialogues.  Over all I'd recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the genre and isn't picky about the dated look.","March 29, 2015","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Animations are smooth and fluid and the whole game is just looks very pleasing to the eye. The cutscenes could use some improvements however, as they are lower resolution pre-rendered videos with no option for subtitles even though the game itself supports it.\n\nMusic is also very orchestral and professional sounding, with nice little jingles accompanied with sweeping epic symphonies. Voice acting is really very good and each of the voices add alot of substance to the characters.\n\nThe story itself is about 14 hours long and is an interesting and light-hearted tale that pokes fun at itself and pays homage to alot of fantasy and RPG stereotypes.\nAlthough there are no in-game hint system, the puzzles are not very difficult and feels just right. There are however some puzzle minigames that may require a little dexterity (Eg: a rhythm based music game)\n\nFor younger gamers who have not played the classic old Lucasarts adventure games however, they may not get some of the jokes. For the most part though, the overall plot is easy to understand, entertaining and a clever plot mechanic near the end certainly surprised me. The ending was a little abrupt however, and while the game does end in a cliffhanger, it is still quite satisfying.\n\nDownside, there was a potential game stopping bug relatively early in the game and I was lucky to have had a savegame beforehand. (Protip: Do not press ESC when you are doing the Wheel of Fortune, because if you do, the character animations will just loop and you will not be able to progress further)\n\nOther minor annoyances include not being able to make the character walk faster, and the typical "mouse-over everything on the screen until something is clickable" type of situations. (2nd Protip: Pressing Spacebar will allow you to see ALL the clickable locations on the screen. Be forwarned however that this might make the game a little too easy.) There are also no bonus features to unlock once you've beaten the main game thus lowering the replayability value.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.0 / 10\nOld-school adventure gamers will enjoy this game and appreciate some of the jokes which would bring back some nostalgic memories. It is not a very difficult game, and you don't have to think out of the box. For newer gamers who have never played an adventure game, this is an excellent introduction for you. Definitely well worth a look. Don't miss it.","May 25, 2013","true","17.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgbeal/recommended/215160/","sgbeal","sgbeal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgbeal/","66 products in account","Summary: a fantastic story hindered considerably by sub-par controls.\n\nThere are already over a thousand reviews, mostly positive, so i'll just recap a few points (some of which are specific to Linux):\n\n- notable video resolution detection/restoration problems on linux. Workaround: set up the game to run in the same resolution as your desktop does. Anything else is likely to Cause Grief.\n\n- the controls are annoying at times, e.g., you can't select any inventory items while you're waiting on a current speaker or animation to finish (and it's not always clear when animations are finished). There are many superfluously long animations. A good half of the clickables in any given scene have no game effect, they just drag out the story.\n\n- though the space bar can be used to show activatable/investigatable zones, this is horribly unconfortable for a game which is otherwise playable with a single hand. It "would be nice" to have a toggle option which turns (and leaves) this display on/off.\n\n- activatable/investigatable zones sometimes overlap with the inventory activation zone (bottom of the screen), making them nearly impossible to activate (one has to fight for a while against the inventory list, which pops up automatically when the mouse hits the botton of the screen). That's is, i dare say, an epic failure.\n\n- whether or not an item/zone can be activated cannot be determined via mouse-over while an animation/speaker is ongoing. You've got to wait until they're done before checking. Clicking bypasses a speaker, but you then risk missing important information. Which reminds me...\n\n- the inability to pause it during speaking sequences (in particular, the early-game ones can be effing long) is problematic when the telephone rings or the neighbor decides to mow his lawn right outside your window, interrupting your game (with no way to repeat what you just missed). Another major usability fail.\n\n- a "hint" button would be a big help. Apparently there is no way to bypass being stuck without reading a walkthrough, but....\n\n- the game only runs in full-screen and alt-tabbing out of it sometimes corrupts its awareness of the mouse, making it impossible to click on anything when returning to the game. In such cases, only Alt-F4 (close window) helps.\n\n- having to click some activation zones multiple times to get to the point is tremendously annoying. e.g. the first click might just tell you what it is. The second click might tell you more about it. The third click might actually let you do something with it. This causes a lot of repeat clicking on items which do _not_ require multiple clicks, as we are forced to click multiple times in order to determine whether multiple clicks are needed for that specific item. Aaarrrggg.\n\n\nIf the story wasn't so entertaining, i'd have stopped playing by now because the quirks of the controls are so frustrating.","April 30","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game will bring you hours of fun even if you are not extremely interested in point & click adventure games. It has a wonderful graphics, not too complicated puzzles and wonderfully atmospheric background music. You really want to hear all the dialogues, because they make fun of everything and everyone, especially some groups of people... ;)\n\nWhat surprised me the most was that you could play as more characters at the same time and control them by switching between them. It was really a good experience for me when there were two of them, but at some point you get to play three characters and at this point the switching gets really annoying because most of the time it's about waiting when they return to their previous positions. One of them even got stuck once. Thankfully, they didn't go for it more than once for a short while, because this was really the only negative thing I could think of after finishing the game.\n\n23 hours of gameplay done so I am leaving you my beloved game!

It takes place in a world where classic D&D fantasy is mixed with the modern laws of capitalism. This paradox, along with the constant fourth wall breaking, is one of the main sources of humour, a strong suit of the game, and very reminiscent of the classic LucasArts titles.\n\nThanks to the Ogre rendering engine all scenes are lush and highly detailed, but the animation is prone to a lot of clipping and there are no facial expressions. These are compensated by the very slow character movement and an excellent British voice cast (who, I must admit, give a lot of class to the game).\n\nThe story is fun and engaging, but it would be hard not to notice that it suffers from deadline syndrome, where the first half is much more detailed in design and in execution than the second one. The main sore point is the ending: the plot, which ran a slow and steady pace, suddenly makes several seven-league leaps, only to tie up everything in less than a minute and roll the credits. Thankfully there is a prequel and a sequel to remedy this mistake.\n\nAs for the puzzles, they are fun and varied, and they have one wonderful feature: every time you move an object over another object or scene element that it can interact with, the cursor changes. It doesn’t mean the game holds your hand, only that it completely eliminates the frustrating part of the try-everything-with-everything scenarios, making it even more perfect and fun to play.","November 26, 2014","true","15.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The setting and game is chock full of humor. The fantasy genre, MMOs, Fiction and all manner of things get deliciously skewered in the story. Unlike other such games however, This game reards the observant. All the puzzles and interactions aren't too hard to figure out for the most part, But looking at things around you or in your inventory or talking to a person near you always reveals even a subtle hint as to what to do next, And if truly stuck one can hold SPACE at any time to see what interactive spots are near you at any time. For an indie offring, This is a game both beautiful and functional.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/215160/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","This is, like, the prime example of why I'd want a "meh" button. The game isn't awful. Far from it. The graphics are passable, the voice acting is mostly decent, the music is alright, and the puzzles themselves make enough sense in-universe. The game's got a pretty decent length (maybe too long) and a good amount of humor.\n\nBut it's just... boring.\n\nI will sum up the problem in one single image:\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CHhDACHW8AE47M_.png:large\n\nDo you see this? At the start of the fourth chapter, the current protagonist says this. And this is exactly what happens.\n\nYou cannot. Be. The. Thing. You. Are. Trying. To. Parody. It just does not work. You have failed as parody if you are doing the exact thing you are mocking.\n\nA lot of the game devolves into tedious fetch quests. The story is nothing special. It's a basic "save the world" vaguely plot. Fantasy/RPG setting. That's fine. The point is the comedy.\n\nAnd it does succeed there, in some regards. The first chapter is a bit light on it, but the second chapter is just jam-packed with humor and had me playing practically straight through. It kinda comes to a halt when the story intervenes though, but for those two or three hours I had tons of fun with the game. The mage diploma, the real-world MMO, the "magic" tricks, the lampshading of death in adventure games... it's all good comedy. It's an interesting world.\n\nAnd then... chapter 3 hits. Where you go through a temple in search of the plot device. No subversions. No real comedy. It's a stretch of the game where nothing really happens except more puzzles. The plot moves forward, sure, but the game has already established at this point that the plot does not matter. Why should I care about the plot. Why should I care about these characters. Wilbur is the only character that's really interesting in any way, and is why the second chapter works so well. Ivo is boring and without any personality whatsoever. Nate is an unlikeable jerk and cements his status as such at the end of the third chapter. Sure, the game calls him out for it too, but. He can be unlikeable to other characters without making him unlikeable to the audience as well.\n\nAnd the real nail in the coffin. After Nate does "the bad thing" that makes him so unlikeable... he is the primary controllable character for the rest of the game. You play as Wilbur for two short scenes and Ivo/Critter for one relatively small scene. The rest is him.\n\nI do not want to play as the unsympathetic jerk. I actually put the game down for a week at the start of Chapter 4 because I was dreading having to play as Nate. Sure, he spends the rest of the game trying to make up for his mistake, but I don't believe it. I don't feel compelled by it. I don't like him and that's not going to change.\n\nIt doesn't help that the humor revolving around him isn't as good, nor are the characters he has to interact with. The dead lovers are kinda amusing. The paladin character and especially Nate's attitude towards him are an UTTER TRAVESTY, absolutely disgusting. The buffalo is boring. The Orc brothers are a very basic smart/stupid. The dragon is about the best character met in this chapter, but she comes in only near the end and doesn't do much, we don't see her much. Plus, her animation is pretty horrible and brings down that short section a lot.\n\nAnd then... you get to replay the last section of the fourth chapter from a different perspective, hearing basically no new dialogue, visiting no new locations, and doing very few new puzzles. And then the game... ends. It doesn't even make sense how it ends, either.\n\nSPOILER ALERT because I need to have this bit in my review.\nWhy did they need to bring the Earth Pixies to the tower? Why did the other three need to be there alongside Ivo? At that point, all that needed to be done was for Ivo to leave the tower. The artifact wasn't in the chest, so the villains wouldn't have it. There was an easy way for Ivo to leave the tower unnoticed and unharmed. There was no reason for the entire out-of-the-blue pixie invasion and dragon reappearance with the other, except to force that cliche fly-off-into-the-distance ending. And wasn't it established that the monstrous villain lady (who we NEVER see) is really powerful? She could slaughter those pixies - heck, probably did off-screen. And Ivo intentionally drew her attention. For what purpose? Who knows. God. Everything about the ending is completely nonsensical, even aside from the fact that it just... happens. Very abruptly. The last puzzle in the game... is shrinking an orc in a completely different location from the climax.\n\nAll-in-all... the game's a bit tedious, light on the comedy for most of the game, and overall just not a worthwhile investment of your time. It's alright, but not great. It has many, many problems. I'd say, pass.","August 23, 2015","false","16.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

(my only criticism - it could have been clearer on the controls - I spent half the game wishing space showed hotspots before figuring out it did lmao - if i had realised i would have taken less time and not needed help lol).

Not surprising if you ask me, since this has been ported by Nordic Games GmbH, the very same company that brought us Deadfall Adventures. My review of Deadfall Adventures speakes for itself (feel free to read it), and I swore to myself to never ever buy anything that has been published, ported or remotly touched by Nordic Games again. But I guess the sales wh*re in me couldn't resist Steam's €4.99 special sale lol.\n\nThe game was release in 2012 for Linux, where multiple users reported countless bugs and even some of them game breaking, they still have not been fixed by Nordic Games until today. In fact, I had to replace library files, edit a bash scrip to even get the ingame settings menu to run properly. Not to mention the black bars on the right and left hand-side of the screen, although the game resultion is set to 1920X1080 - 16:9. This is totally unexceptable and mere laziness of the publisher/developer, considering that 3 years have passed  since the game was initially released for Linux. As I have alrady previously stated  in my Deadfall Adventures review, Nordic Games should consult Feral Interactive or Aspyr on how to properly port games over to Linux. From now on, no matter how cheap their games are, even if they throw them at me, I won't buy/play them!!!\n\nNow that we have the technical issues sorted out and you know what you can expect when you buy and install the game on Linux. How good is the game itself?\n\nIf you want to feel like you're on a quest as Frodo Baggins was in Lord of the Rings, or be reminded of Yoda from Star Wars when a little gremlin appears in the palm of your hand, or just enjoy being in a magical world like Harry Potter, you will look forward to sitting down and opening The Book of Unwritten Tales. You will be going on an adventure with four characters but I like Wilbur Weathervane. I'm routing for you little guy, by the way he's a gnome. The controls are very easy to learn - just point and click. Press the spacebar if you get befuddled but use it sparingly.\n\nThe creative author weaved a unique tale of good vs. evil. With a swish and flick of their paint brush, the imaginative graphic artists will whisk you off to an enchanted world. The voice actors with their wee bit of a Scottish accent have the best voices to tell a story, and hearing the sounds of birds singing, bees buzzing, potions exploding, wind blowing while you're atop a dragon, helps to immerse you into the story.\n\nSo all in all the game is superb, if it wasn't only for that poorly executed Linux port by Nordic Games.

On your journey you cross paths with the wood elf princess Ivo, the treasure hunter Nate and his furry critter pet, who join you and help you on your important mission.\n\nBeing a point and click adventure, there's not much to say about the controls. You point at things and then, surprise, click them. Apart from one puzzle, the game can entirely be played with the mouse only, so it's perfect to lay back in your chair and relax.\n\nSince the point and click genre usually doesn't leave much space for weird gameplay experiments, the presentation of the story, the level design and characters are what keep the boat floating, all of which are things that The Book of Unwritten Tales does exceedingly well.\n\nBeautifully designed levels, extremely likeable characters, great voice acting, fitting music, the hilarious dialogues and all the, more or less subtle, side blows at the RPG and fantasy genre make TBoUT clearly stand out from the masses of point and click adventure games.\n\nPuzzle-wise, TBoUT seems to be more aimed at novice and casual point and click players, so the puzzle elements are rather easy and not a huge challenge for experienced P'n'C fans. Personally, I don't mind it at all because it keeps the whole game on a constant feel-good level without ever getting frustrating to the point where you NEED to google for a walkthrough.\n\nFrom the technical side, the only thing to complain about is the lack of FullHD-support, so you end up with black bars at the left and right of your screen. However, once you've sunken into the game, you hardly ever notice them.\n\nThe playthrough took me pretty much exactly 13 hours with quite a bit of trial-and-error, backtracking and so on. The game could probably be beaten in less time, but then again... point and click adventures are made to sit back and relax and not rush through them as fast as possible, right?\n\nIf you're new to the point and click genre, The Book of Unwritten Tales is a prime example of what the P'n'C genre is capable of, so it's the perfect game to start with. If you're a P'n'C veteran, you probably already have played the game... and if not, then what are you waiting for?","April 9, 2013","true","13.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is about the classic fantasy cliche about an ancient and powerful artifact, and the mission to recover it and save the world. You'll guide 4 main characters, sometimes together, sometimes alone.\nThe puzzles, all mainly based around collected objects, are not difficult at all, and the ending is a bit rushed out, but all the rest represents a great tribute to classic adventure games of the past, from Monkey Island to Legend of Kyrandia, from Day of the Tentacle to King's Quest.\n\nGraphics and art are really beautiful, locations come to life and are very well characterized. There's a subtle but well played soundtrack and voice recording just nailed perfectly each character. Humor comes out from every single line of text, there are also a lot of fun quotes from mainstream games and movies, like The Lord of The Rings and Mission Impossible.\n\nIt's thanks to small but passionate developers like King Art, but I also think to Daedalic and Wadjet Eye, that we're still able to play adventure games like this one nowadays. Playing TBoUT was like returning back to mid '90s, and I surely hope to see more adventure developers to take the risk and the challenge to reinvent and innovate the genre, keeping the good from the past.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm looking forward to try this game's prequel, The Critter Chronicles, but even more its true sequel, the just released second chapter, which from what I read is going to be even more good!","March 7, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I don't know why. When I do play them I usually enjoy the story and hate the gameplay (loathe it), so maybe I'm just impatient. It doesn't have the MOST convoluted, highly unlikely plot in a game, but who cares, this game is really funny and I just loved it. The graphic style really plays in with the fairly lack of seriousness. The sound ... uhm ... was nice ... I guess. Voice acting was good. Anyway, this game really made me want to figure stuff out on my own and some things were fairly logical to figure out, but I did have to refer to a guide a number of times as I also generally suck at these games and can almost never do something exactly how it needs to go.

The last chapter of the game was a real neat twist and I thought it was very well done. The humor is very good at times, but completely and utterly fails at others. The characters are ok, the voice acting isn't anything special. The graphics were nicely done.

You get this nifty game, where the right combination of self-referential humor, 4th wall breaking, and beautiful set design manifested in a thoroughly pleasant game.\nI had no idea I have had this game in my steam library, and I have no idea what it is, or how it become one of the 600+ titles. But if I obviously paid money at one point to get it, and that was perhaps the best financial decision i've made this year(this being a particularly bankrupt year in terms of positive monetary decisions for me, but I digress).\n\nThe Logic:\nFirst of all, when you play an PaC Adventure game, you have to have a very eccentric sense of logic. You can't just simply find a ladder to get a cat down a tree, but you have to cobble together a solution that involves a rubber mouse that you find on the surface of uranus, a piece of string woven from the nosehair of a troll you put asleep with the duck's tears potion from the dungeons, and finally a makeshift fishing rod from a wand you found while rummaging through a witches knicker drawer. This game is fully aware of that, and in its awareness, makes the logic to be a perfect balance of adventure game logic and simple item association. Sure I got stuck a few times, but It was mostly due to me missing an key item among the clutter of the scenery. Of course, this is partially due to a particular gameplay flaw that I will touch on later.\n\nGameplay:\nPaC games are generally very easy. You hover your mouse cursor over everything in the scene, until it changes into either a grabby cursor or a magnifying glass, and you keep doing so until you have found every item and every interactables in the scene. The items are in an inventory in the bottom row, and you start mashing them together until you get what you need to solve the puzzle at hand. This method of brute force have served me well for many logically redundant PaC games, and I have applied this method a few times in this game as well... that is, until I discovered the SPACE BAR! The space bar button highlights every item and every interactables in the scene. Such a batvision upgrade seems to made the game easier, and would of course benefit many times where I had mouse scanned everything in a scene for a missing item. Such an control input would serve well to be explained in game at the beginning, instead of being accidentally discovered 2/3 through my playthrough. But overall, I found that the game seems to composite all the important elements in obvious places, and the UI is pretty intuitive for all the interaction of a PaC game.\n\nArtwork and Animation and Sound:\nI put these category together because… Well mostly because I’m lazy, but also the combination of all 3 together creates immersion for the game, and this immersion stool will immediately topple if one of the three legs is taken out.\nI've have my hand hovered over the screenshot hotkey for majority of the game. The scenery are beautifully rendered, the characters are very well characterized, and most of the dialog match with the animations. A few sound seems to be out of sync with the animation, but the dialog are so expertly written and enacted that I’ve been willing to let a few negs go. Animation seems to be the weakest leg of the stool, many animations seems slow and unresponsive, especially when you have to repeat an action multiple times, it seems almost unbearably mechanic. These are times when I teeter precariously on this stool of immersion, but the rest of the gameplay is engaging and the dialogs are humors enough to compensate for my sore bum.\n\nConclusion:\nI was really tempted to end this review on the word “bum”, but I have to be considerate of all those who skipped ahead of my long-winded rants to ask:\nSHOULD I BUY THIS GAME?\n…\nHELL YES.","December 25, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Really sucks if you're interrupted.","December 13, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Good mix of references and homages to geek culture and old generation adventure games.\n\nThe female protagonist is needlessly sexualised, which was a bit patronising given that most of the people who will get the references are probably in their late twenties by now. :o/   In fact, gender portrayals were somewhat worse than the old Monkey Island and Indiana Jones adventure films, which is rather odd. :o/\n\n[It's been pointed out to me that using the spacebar will reveal interactable items, which removes the furstrating 'hidden object' experienece that I had]","August 28, 2012","false","14.4"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","3"

We are just constantly reminded of it. The characters you play as are rather bland and one-dimentional and only serve to add get item and give item mechanic at certain points in plot.

Most puzzles are logical enough, though sometimes they're hamstrung by the problem of knowing what to do to solve them, but you need to talk to a NPC first to actually start solving them.  There's also a terrible stealth section in this game.  Why would you do this in an adventure game?  The playable characters are fun enough save for Nate, who is just boorish and annoying.  Most NPC's are fun to interact with.\n\nGame is around 12-14 hours long, though I thought it started to drag in the last couple of hours and I was ready for it be over by the time it wrapped up.  One other thing, some people react in abject horror when games break the 4th wall or use humor that references other games, movies, fiction, etc.  If you are one of these people, stay away, this game pokes fun at this sort of thing quite often.

Star wars among others.\nThe voice acting and characters is well-put-together and the jokes, even though they are cheesy at some times are decent and funny.\n\nHowever, after completing the game - only using around 10 hours, I find myself fairly entertained, but in no way or format challenged. The in-game puzzles were way too easy, and despite of that the implementation of the "space-bar-helper" basically makes this game playable for 3-year olds, which is not in the spirit of Adventure games.\nThey are supposed to be challenging, with puzzles that makes you scratch your head for hours.. Not only press the spacebar and get it over with.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? If you're looking for a nostalgia-trip down memory lane, combined with 10-12 hours of fairly decent fun and not too hard puzzles, this is your game.\nIf you however, like me, enjoys to get challenged with proper puzzles/riddles - there are better and more challenging games out there.","September 15, 2014","false","12.4"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

There are some references for the mature public too, but it just sounded odd to me due to the rest of the atmosphere. The characters move very slowly too, and that can be annoying sometimes. The voice acting is great though.\n\nThe game is  either far too easy, or just makes no sense:\nTo distract a monkey, I rarely think "Eureka, all I need is a jar and a bunch of bettles!"\nLuckly you don't have too many possibilities to try on, so this is not a showstopper. I've encountered a few glitches (Linux here) but they went away by themselves, so it didn't bother me too much.\n\nIf you REALLY want this game, I'd recommend waiting for a sale. Its not all that fantastic.\n\nPS: There are some references to MMO RPGs in this game that got me a little bit uncomfortable, as I am a big fan of the genre. Devs seem to imply that they are repetitive, meaningless, and alienating, the main character commenting "...that's the silliest game I've ever heard of". The critiques go on in the trailer of the sequel of this game too. I don't know if they wanted to criticise a specific MMO or the whole genre, but the later sounds like an utterly equivocated idea.

Voice acting is excellent. The character movements are cool (except when switching characters.) Despite Ivo's ridiculous scantily clad girl-elf armor, she's a pretty interesting character, and the brains of the party. Wilbur is reasonably clever too. Many secondary characters are interesting, like the little rat warrior. Storyline is highly engaging, and the puzzles, while sometimes tedious or frustrating in the usual point-and-click manner, are mostly interesting and fun.\n\nFurther into the game - chapter 4 - you're stuck being Captain Nate. Captain Nate is a jerk. He is such a jerk that I'm having a hard time progressing in the game now that I'm forced to interact through him.\n\nCaptain Nate objectifies all the women he interacts with. They're just sex objects to him, so I'm a bit bewildered by the "girl power" tag associated with this game. He cuts down everyone around him like an insecure school boy. He goes on and on about what it means to be "a man" in this archaic, tedious litany of outdated stereotypes ... I'm just so sick of the culture remnants of shaming people who don't fit some stupid cultural concept of "normal." This guy is desperate to be "normal" where normal is some kind of ignorant, chauvinstic male pig and proving it at every turn. I think it might have been intended as humor? If so, it failed. Badly.\n\nThere's a character in Captain Nate's sequence who's a pink-clad paladin with high heels on his pink banner. I'm all for flipping paladins ♥♥♥♥ as a timeworn gamer tradition, but this was deeply inappropriate. Liking pink doesn't make you weak. Wearing heels doesn't make you weak. Besides the obvious misogyny and sexism of demeaning femme-stereotyped gender stuff, it's also a train wreck of genderqueer shaming and pacificist shaming. I'm so done with this kind of thing in our culture. Teenagers kill themselves over "humor" like this. Leelah Alcorn didn't have a chance because of attitudes like this. Stop it. It's shaming and bullying and it's time for us to be better people. I keep trying to get through these scenes with Nate and the pink paladin, hoping that there will be some kind of redemption, but it just keeps not happening, and I'm running out of patience.","December 18, 2015","false","11.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

You won't buld too large of an inventory, like most modern games (i miss the massive inventories with tons of possibilities!), and most of the puzzles include talking. A lot of talking.\nYou talk, you look around, you use some items, then you talk some more, look around, then realize the only way to move forward is to talk yet again.  This is a common mechanic in most p&c games, but this game uses it far too often. The voice acting is fine, but unlike, say, a Walking Dead, where the expressions and gesticulations of the characters can actually bring you to tears, these characters are quite stale in their emotes. You will watch a back & forth convo carry on for minutes, with no more animation than a slight swaying or breathing; nothing indicating the feeling of what they are saying. The game really suffers under the weight of this, and I find it hard to move forward knowing that too much of the time I will be listening and not "doing."  Dialogue is mostly skippable, but at the same time I hate to skip through and miss things.\nSome of the dialogue is really funny, with lots of WoW style outside references to pop culture-ish RPG staples (and the in-game mmo is hilarious).\nAside from being to reliant on lengthy dialogue, the puzzles are good stuff, except some are a bit too obvious when they give you hints with each item that might be applicable, and when you actually do get stuck, there is no help to be found within the game. Also, I'm not sure I like the fact that most environment items can only be examined once, after that they aren't clickable. So they are too easily excluded, and also, if you miss hearing what they said about them, that's it, you won't hear it again.\nBit odd that in 16/9 there are black lines on the screen, even though cursor moves over them. but in 1680/1050 it just looks like fullscreen. is this true resolution support? no big, but odd. Otherwise, interface, saves and other elements are all good.\nAll in all, a good game, that gets bogged down in it's heavy reliance on dialogue and it's inexplicable lack of luster in that area.\nI might redo this reco because I havent finished the game and kind of wrote this spur of the moment but i just fetl like it :p","June 11, 2013","false","7.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","4"

Being a game that can last up to 20 hours the majority of my time was offline.\n\nHark back to the days of adventure, by clicking on random pixels, picking up items, and combining items in random or "logical" ways in hopes of finding your way through the adventure. This game is a throwback. A "Point and Click" adventure game. While there have been many since the days of Monkey Island, and even in recent years, this is probably one of the best since Monkey Island.\n\nYou take the role of a young gnome named Wilbur who yearns for adventure and hopes to remove himself from his menial life, the beautiful elf Ivo who just so happened to be in the right place at the right time, and a wise-cracking cocky human with a peculiar past named Nate. Nate on the run from a bounty hunter has a furry sidekick called "Critter" whom speaks nothing but nonesense (familiar?).\n\nSpoilers:  The adventure begins with a ring...among the backdrop of a war between the Alliance (gnome, dwarf, human...) and an army of orcs.\n\nI'll stop my spoilers there. It should sound familiar to you. This game is humurous, using obvious references to help out its humor, but it doesn't over do it. A wonderously funny game in its own right, It doesn't bash nor does it even spoof what it references. It's good natured ribbing over the typical Toklien-esque fantasy world, and certain games and films we've all come to know through the years, but again it doesn't over do it.  It brings up some good points about gaming in general though, mainly directed at the MMORPG when Wilbur asks "Why would people feel the need to leave their real-life to play a fictitious life...." That's not a direct quote, but it was along the same lines. Most likely done in jest,  to me it still brings up a good question about our hobby.\n\nThe art style is superb. Bright colors and details abound, and I caught myself wishing there was a 3D space to it, to be able to explore more deeply than you're able in the game. The dialogue is also detailed. Click on certain items on-screen, and you'll get a simple explanation of it, but enough that it may give you a nice background and history of the world. Even minor points of interest, and minor characters have some history and background to them. In summary, this is just a nice game with lots of spirit. Beautiful artwork, clever dialogue, and never a time of frustration, it deserves your attention. I've been gaming since I was a kid,  this is one of my favorites.\n\nP.S. Soapbox time: As for Wilbur's question, we all have our reasons to "game." I've been lucky enough to travel and have real life adventures in this world. I SEEK it out. What motivated me to do all that? Playing games as a child. The fantasy and the worlds I got sucked into, it motivated me to find it in real life.

Not worth real money, not even on sale, but it might be okay in a Humble Bundle.  I regret paying $5.  Could have bought a sandwich instead.\n\nThe writing and voice acting are okay, nothing special.  Sometimes bad, but not quite as bad as the ♥♥♥♥ Daedalic deems acceptable.  Dialog can be overlong, jokes tend to hit you over the head.  Kids will probably like it.\n\nGameplay is weak.  You have to click on interactive objects several times before they become usable.  This makes solving puzzles unintuitive as you think you have the solution, you try it, it doesn't work, so you dismiss the possibility.  Turns out you didn't click enough times to get through all the uninteresting things your character has to say about the object in question.\n\nCharacter movement is really slow and there's no way to speed it up.  A run key (or run on double click) would be nice.\n\nThe hitbox (or whatever you call it) for interactive objects can be too small, so you mouse over an object, see that the cursor didn't change, and assume it's non-interactive.\n\nAudio in FMV can be out of sync, and there are no FMV subtitles.\n\nOn the upside, it's a fairly pretty game, and at least the player characters have something to say about their surroundings (unlike Syberia's generic response to every examined object).  Facial expressions are good and varied.  No other upsides to speak of.  Don't waste your time and money (unless you're a kid and have no experience with the genre, then you might like it).","January 30, 2014","false","0.8"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","13","30","0","0"

Pick up everything you see, rub it on everything else you see, eventually progress -- the gameplay mechanic is as old as computing itself.  Typically what really keeps a player interested in an adventure game is the plot, diaglogue, and humor.  Unfortunately the writing in this game is pretty awful.  Just one fourth-wall-breaking self-referential joke after another.  There is absolutely nothing remarkable about this game except perhaps how incredibly unremarkable it is.

I naturally started waiting when the humor starts really kicking in and that was my first worry about the game; the jokes never quite landed. The game kept that semi-humorous tone the whole 12 hours and there was only one joke that really made me smile. Besides that it felt forced and cliched.\n\nPuzzles on the other hand were quite logical and nothing brain-straining but started growing tedious towards the end. Not tedious like in old monkey islands where you simply don't know what to do and the answer is something like "beam the banana to space and then eat it in the future" but tedious in a sense of "visit this another room, go to next one, go back, back again, to the next one, talk to this guy, go to the last room and talk to this random other fellow that never said anything useful before."\n\nMy absolutely biggest gripe was the fact that you can visit areas where you find an item that only appears there after the story activates it there. This way you can't momorize what you have seen in rooms since the items appear only when everything's set for it.\n\nCharacters lack character (lol) and since I can't remember the music it wasn't anything interesting.\n\nOverral TBOUT is a pretty point&click game with a very hollow intestines.","January 25, 2015","false","12.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

One in particular involves a series of rhythm-game like arrow-key-combination presses which a certain segment of the game's audience would likely find quite frustrating.\nSome of the background animations have a visibly low number of frames which I found a little distracting.\nSome people will probably find it a bit short - I got about 10 hours out of it, and I tend to on the slow side.\n","June 8, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, it was a pretty fun game.  It was standard point and click adventure activities, with an easy way to tell what you had available to interact with.  The puzzles were fairly straightforward and the humor was present as well.  The biggest downside to this game is that dialogue can disappear - after examining some objects, they lose the ability to be examined again, so if you get distracted and miss a throwaway line about a random piece of scenery that isn't needed for progression, you may not have the ability to hear/read that line again.","December 30, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is more than I expected it to be. I really liked the characters and story, the world, the atmosphere, the style, the soundtrack and the system. Much love was put into the game, more than in TellTales games, I'd say. It is a worthy addition to the genre.\n\nThat being said, let's talk about the negative stuff. There really isn't much negative going on here, though.\n\n1. The game is way too easy. Most riddles are no-brainers, you often realize a solution to the riddles before you even have to solve it. Many things are already clear by simply looking at the scene. Only in rare cases you need to stop for a bit and to think the riddle over.\n\n2. The game is way too short. The end came a bit... surprisingly abrupt. I expected another 4 or so chapters at least.\n\nNonetheless, in the end I felt sad that my adventure is already over. And that is what counts the most.\nThe game felt right, so I can only recommend it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/growlitheappears/recommended/215160/","growlitheappears","GrowlitheAppears","http://steamcommunity.com/id/growlitheappears/","102 products in account","The Book of Unwritten Tales - a very amusing and beautiful game, especially if the gamer loves roleplay games and movies.\n\nIn the beginning the player gets to know all important characters and is able to get to know some background stories of them. It's not important for the storyline but for me it's a fact that shows that the developers had fun creating the game and really thought about the whole story - not only the key-elements. Moreover the characters really show some personality and mostly are really likeable it's funny to see how they react in different situations. Besides the game is able to appear beautiful and very well constructed, it does not take itself serios. There are a lot of, to my mind, really funny jokes - about roleplay games, movies and even about the game itself. These jokes are able to remind the player that he's just playing a game by refering to real life situations. Furthermore the game criticises the whole fantasy world by showing off that the people inside the game try to flee from it but by giving that detail the criticism of the fantasy world turns out to be a criticism of our world or how we try to escape from it. The developers did not care for hiding references, they pointed them out shamelessly and obviously, what for me turned out to be even funnier - you might find some Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars and even Mission Impossible in it. By being that honest about how made up the world is the player does not even care about the lack of logic in that world. It's easy to accept that everything can be explained with magic, what makes the whole game chilly so that the player is able to fully enjoy that world. In conclusion the game is able to transfer some valueable lessons, while it does not take itself serious and gives a whole lot of funny jokes.\n\nThe graphics of the game, also are really beautiful. It's a smoothe and colorful style and the world is designed really amazing and rich on details. During the journey the player can see a whole lot of different regions, like ice regions or elvenforests and all of them are designed in the same lovely way. Despite that really nice graphics the game still contains some difficulties - for example the walking animations sometimes mess up and let the characters float above the ground and the cutscenes look a bit trashy and very pixely (maybe that was because my settings but I think I had them at highest). I played the german version because I did not know how to switch languages and it turned out that for the german version the synchronisation is not well made. But these facts don't make the game less amazing.\n\nSome people complained that the riddles do not make any sense and force the player to do stupid things but in my opinion that's not true. If you play point and click adventures you'll always have some creative riddles, therefore you just have to be a little bit creative. Most of the riddles in that game are easy and not weird at all and the ones that are, are apologized by the game itself. Right from the beginning it points out that it won't make much sense. And even if the player has a lack of creativity it's still possible to solve that riddles by try and error or pushing the space button to see if there's something more. I know point and click adventures (e.g. The Whispered World) who are much more challenging and give riddles which really let you make stupid things. The Book of Unwritten Tales is one of the easier point and click adventures and follows a strict line, thus it's hard to really get stuck.\n\nAll in all The Book of Unwritten Tales is a very beautiful and funny game, which is able to show you a world full of magic and magical creatures and after all it is not far from our own world. It gives you really nice characters and a story so full of cliché that it's hilarious. The animations and synchro are not great at all but that does not necessarily do any harm to the game. It took me about 2 hours less than promised but I think it's worth using 18 hours of lifetime to be amused by the game.\n\n","September 15, 2014","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot of game/movie references as well, I've not even finished it, probably not even a quarter of the way through and I'm enjoying how much this has made me think about what to do and how to"get that item to get that item I need to progress in this puzzle to get an item that unlocks this item and progress through the story".\n\nAll in all, it's an enjoyable game, which I'd rate as a 9.5/10, the -0.5 because it can be quite frustrating as well since it doesnt give you much direction, which can (as I've said) be frustrating.

Below I will list some pros and cons to the game as well as my final score out of 10. so lets get started\n\nPROS\n\n1. The graphics- for a small adventure game I thought the graphics were outstanding especailly the backgrounds, there are also certain characters who look great, such as the minotaur in chapter 4.\n\n2. the voice acting- the va work in the game is for the most part amazing espcially wilbur, for the most part all the voice actors get into their roles and you can tell are having a blast playing these zany characters.\n\n3. Length- I was actually shocked this game was so long my play time says 15 hrs but is actually longer bc I played the demo first to see if I liked the game. So when I purchased the full game I sped through the demo parts that I had already beaten.\n\n4 Dialogue- the Dialogue is pretty great, I would say a good 80 percent of the jokes land, and there were more than a few times I laughed out loud.\n\n5. Difficulty- as adventure games go this one is good for beginners, there a few brain teasers but for the most part the game is pretty easy, especially if you use the spacebar (the spacebar highlights all interactive hotspots on the screen). I reccomend using the spacebar bc I hate pixel hunting, I play adventure games for the story, characters, and puzzles not to pixel hunt\n\nCONS\n\n1. Story- while the characters and dialogue are great and worth a play through, the actual story is pretty dull and boring and like most I found the ending to be a let down\n\n2. chapter 4- the game is broken up into 5 chapters and while I dont hate chapter 4, I felt like it dragged and the game lost some steam here, bc for the most part you only play as nate, and he was my least favorite character, he grew on me but I never felt attached to him like I did to Ivo and Wilbur.\n\n3. Pixel Hunting- if you dont want to use the spacebar than pixel hunting is real bad, bc a lot of the objects blend into the background and they are hard to see.\n\n4. MINI GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- this is an adventure game yet the devs decided to include two mandatory mini games that just plain suck, especailly the dancing one, in you guessed it chapter 4 lol.\n\nCLOSING COMMENTS AND SCORE\n\nOverall I loved this game, it has fun characters, a decent story, and can be laugh out loud funny. It is a long game if you take ya time and explore the different dialogue options, I got it on sale on steam for 5 dollars, I cant wait to play the new one now I highly reccomend this game to adventure game fans or for gamers who are interested in the adventure game genre, bc its good for beginners. final score is\n\n8.5/10","March 26, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've never been much for point and click adventure games but I decided to give this one a try and I'm glad I did.

Which isn't fun really. But that only happened a couple times.\n-Not really anything else.\n\nOverall I loved BOUT and would recommend it to anyone looking for a point and click adventure game","March 27, 2015","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This traditional point-and-click adventure originally released in Europe in 2009 harks back to the days when Sierra and LucasArts ruled the world with legendary franchises like King's Quest and Monkey Island. German developer King Art has crafted a lighthearted fantasy grounded in an earthy sense of humor and grown-up story themes and has avoided the impossible, illogical puzzles well known to plague other games in the genre. In short, this is a great achievement in both story and design that should be played by anyone who appreciates an old-school adventure.\n© By Brett Todd","May 31, 2013","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are pretty decent, about on par with Syberia II or TLJ:Dreamfall. Since the emphasis is on comedy, you need a sense of humor to enjoy this game. For me it was very funny, there were a lot of laugh out lout moments. It has a lot of references to nerd culture like DOD, WOW, LOR, etc. All of the puzzles are inventory based, and not very difficult. My nine-year-old was able to solve about half of the puzzles without any help from me. The game has a lot of lengthy conversations that include a lot of jokes. You will need to go of back and forth to fetch this item or that item, so the game took me a good 17 hours to finish. If you are looking for a lighthearted diversion that will occupy you for a long time, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a hard core puzzle game, look elsewhere.","January 12, 2014","true","69.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jetfred/recommended/215160/","jetfred","JetFred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jetfred/","4543 products in account","There are plenty of things wrong with The Book of Unwritten Tales.  It uses cheap referential humor as an excuse for rehashing every fantasy cliché in the book. It uses self-deprecating criticism of the adventure genre to cover some of the worst contrivances and pixel hunts ever executed in a point-and-click game.  It has twitchy 3D animation on top of what is otherwise beautiful 2D artwork that is so busy that you have to sweep everything with the cursor over and over to figure out what 10% of the screen can be clicked.  It pads out its already reasonable playtime with slow repetitive dialog, slow animations, and backtracking, but still manages to end suddenly. And its areas are so complex that the player can think of a dozen logical ways to solve every problem before the particular required solution is stumbled upon.  Let’s say you need water.  There are at least four places in the environment with obvious water, not counting the various wet things in your inventory, but those aren’t the water sources you can use.  You know how these things go.\n\nBut it doesn’t matter.\n\nTo point out all of those things is exactly like saying Lord of the Rings is dumb because the eagles could have taken the ring to Mordor, or that the movies were cash grabs because they changed plot items and pacing to appeal to a broader audience and added multiple video releases in case you only went to the theater six times.  It’s like saying NASCAR is just going fast and turning left and that pro wrestling is fake.  You’re a troll.  You aren’t smart for noticing.  No one is impressed on “teh internets” that they didn’t fool you.\n\nThe game is amazing.  There are no gimmicks.  The Book of Unwritten Tales takes every classic adventure game feature and does them all well.  The scenes are so detailed, the humor so genuine, the difficulty so finely tuned, the characters so comfortable that you have to love it and want more.  The worst I can say is that I tried playing it at a time when I was finishing only 3-hour games, and so it felt like it was dragging a bit.  I don’t think I’d have gotten that impression if I played it all on a long vacation weekend.  There are inventory puzzles, environmental puzzles, dialog puzzles, and few if any of the cheap everything-can-be-forced-into-a-traditional-sliding-puzzle puzzles.  There are a couple of fail-and-restart situations, but nothing too frustrating.\n\nReally this game deserves whatever praise you’ve already read.  If you think (like me) that Monkey Island 3 and The Longest Journey are the archetypal point-and-click games, play this.","January 4, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Almost all of the puzzles are logical, and rarely require trying things at random.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilrathilord/recommended/215160/","kilrathilord","Kilrathi lord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilrathilord/","17 products in account","Just finished this wonderful gem of a game, it has a few problems but overall was one of the funniest adventure games I have played in ages, it is very self aware and pokes fun at adventure game tropes as well as rpg tropes. Below I will list some pros and cons to the game as well as my final score out of 10. so lets get started\n\nPROS\n\n1. The graphics- for a small adventure game I thought the graphics were outstanding especailly the backgrounds, there are also certain characters who look great, such as the minotaur in chapter 4.\n\n2. the voice acting- the va work in the game is for the most part amazing espcially wilbur, for the most part all the voice actors get into their roles and you can tell are having a blast playing these zany characters.\n\n3. Length- I was actually shocked this game was so long my play time says 15 hrs but is actually longer bc I played the demo first to see if I liked the game. So when I purchased the full game I sped through the demo parts that I had already beaten.\n\n4 Dialogue- the Dialogue is pretty great, I would say a good 80 percent of the jokes land, and there were more than a few times I laughed out loud.\n\n5. Difficulty- as adventure games go this one is good for beginners, there a few brain teasers but for the most part the game is pretty easy, especially if you use the spacebar (the spacebar highlights all interactive hotspots on the screen). I reccomend using the spacebar bc I hate pixel hunting, I play adventure games for the story, characters, and puzzles not to pixel hunt\n\nCONS\n\n1. Story- while the characters and dialogue are great and worth a play through, the actual story is pretty dull and boring and like most I found the ending to be a let down\n\n2. chapter 4- the game is broken up into 5 chapters and while I dont hate chapter 4, I felt like it dragged and the game lost some steam here, bc for the most part you only play as nate, and he was my least favorite character, he grew on me but I never felt attached to him like I did to Ivo and Wilbur.\n\n3. Pixel Hunting- if you dont want to use the spacebar than pixel hunting is real bad, bc a lot of the objects blend into the background and they are hard to see.\n\n4. MINI GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- this is an adventure game yet the devs decided to include two mandatory mini games that just plain suck, especailly the dancing one, in you guessed it chapter 4 lol.\n\nCLOSING COMMENTS AND SCORE\n\nOverall I loved this game, it has fun characters, a decent story, and can be laugh out loud funny. It is a long game if you take ya time and explore the different dialogue options, I got it on sale on steam for 5 dollars, I cant wait to play the new one now I highly reccomend this game to adventure game fans or for gamers who are interested in the adventure game genre, bc its good for beginners. final score is\n\n8.5/10","March 26, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is more than I expected it to be. I really liked the characters and story, the world, the atmosphere, the style, the soundtrack and the system. Much love was put into the game, more than in TellTales games, I'd say. It is a worthy addition to the genre.\n\nThat being said, let's talk about the negative stuff. There really isn't much negative going on here, though.\n\n1. The game is way too easy. Most riddles are no-brainers, you often realize a solution to the riddles before you even have to solve it. Many things are already clear by simply looking at the scene. Only in rare cases you need to stop for a bit and to think the riddle over.\n\n2. The game is way too short. The end came a bit... surprisingly abrupt. I expected another 4 or so chapters at least.\n\nNonetheless, in the end I felt sad that my adventure is already over. And that is what counts the most.\nThe game felt right, so I can only recommend it. Just don't expect anything challenging.\n\nYours sincerely,\na pointy and clicky demonsword.","September 28, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is cute and well done, and the sound track does a fine job of setting the tone.  If the sequels are up to the same per this would mske a fine collection in anyones library.","November 10, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was horribly disappointed by the animations of the Monkey Island HD editions and the unintuitive controls or inability to skip narrated dialog. I was very frustarted at the lunacy of Deponia - puzzles so bizarre that solving them was a game of exhaustive trial and error (or basically dependent upon using a guide).\n\nUnwritten Tales sits somewhere between the two. It's not perfect, but it is good enough to enjoy. The voice acting is good, the scenes look good and the puzzles are fairly logical. There's good features like double clicking an exit to skip the walking to it - so there is not much time spent waiting for characters to traverse scenes (and generally there's not absurdly long routes in any particular scene or area unlike Deponia). You can show all the hotspots by pressing the space bar, which is needed because a few of the things you need are pretty small or obscured. It plays well overall.\n\nIt does have issues. I've run into a few glitches already. Some of the models look either dated or amateur - especially when animated. A lot of the animations are a bit off, but nothing so bad that it ruins the experience (unlike the Monkey Island HD games). Depsite these, I'm enjoying it so far.","June 25, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers deicided to present you only with the items and interactions which are relevant at the point of story. Which helps a lot. You still need to search the screen like in many other of these games, though. Removing interactions after done or viewed (mostly twice) was also a very good choice from the developer.\n\nThe story is okay and plays with many fantasy clichês mixed up with trinkets/ideas from our reality. If you don't like fantasy, you probably shouldn't play it. In the end of the story I even liked all of the characters, despite some of them make it really hard at first.\nThe end (final confrontation) of the game is a bit too short for my taste. It seemed rushed to me. I am not sure if the money ran out or the writing was not fleshed out, but it doesn't make it necessarily a bad game.\nOverall the game is not too long, so you can easily play it through in multiple sessions. Like in most of the adventure games there is also no replay value.\n\nOne technical issues I had: I played the game in a very high resolution (3440x1440), so for some puzzles (like the map and the dance puzzle) I couldn't see the part I needed to see. As workaround I set the resolution to a lower value in these instances.","May 10, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you give up and cruise the internet for clues faster than I did, and/or utilize the spacebar, it would probably take you less than 8 hours to beat.

That should tell you something about the quality of this game. I'm only at the second chapter so far, but already know I like this game a lot. It reminds me of point and click adventure games I played many years ago, though the controls appear much simpler.\n\nThe only downside is that I can't access the settings page at all. It's probably due to my dual-head setup on Linux, but this game is good enough that I enjoy playing it on the secondary monitor without being able to move it.\n\nUpdate: I still think the game is good, but I have basically stopped playing it because I found a few flaws too annoying. For example, talking to people can unlock things you can do with items (which makes absolutely no sense to me and only lead to frustration because I had tried those things earlier). Sometimes it's also hard to find usable objects, so you spend a lot of time hovering over everything visible just to see if it's something you can interact with.","September 12, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must admit it's a bit difficult at points, especially if you missed an item, but otherwise the story is so engaging that those things are kind of a hit-and-miss for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/215160/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","A lovely adventure game somewhat betrayed by its simplicity.\n\nThroughout the course of the game you gain control of 3 characters (you can maybe count it as 4 even), playing some sections exclusively as one character, or sometimes getting the option of switching to another. All three are fun to play and have their own distinct personalities which also translate into their observations of the world, which you can directly see by inspecting the same items with different characters. Although the last one you are introduced to does take a little while to like, since at the beginning he's quite obnoxious.\n\nThe story is one of the most important parts in an adventure game, and here it certainly does not disappoint. It is a lighthearted save the world plot spanning through a diverse set of areas with a real feeling of adventure. However the ending did feel rushed, and compared to the rest of the game the're just the feeling that not as much thought went into designing it.\n\nThe biggest problem the game has is that there is only one usable button, you do absolutely everything with only the left mouse click. This means that even if you get stuck somewhere, it is not too difficult to brute force your way through, because there is a much more limited number of possibilities than in traditional adventure games.\n\nBut perhaps there is some sort of an upshot to this as well. The game flow is rarely interrupted and you're not going to get frustrated over some random puzzle, although there is one particularly annoying area in a mine which for some reason uses a top down camera instead of the traditional sidescrolling one.\n\nThe Book of Unwritten Tales is certainly lengthy enough without the need for convoluted puzzles, it took me 13 hours to finish it, but I didn't spend much of that time trying to figure out what to do next.\n\n7 / 10","July 26, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For positives, it's got a good story, good graphics, good humor, and an easy-to-use interface.  Unfortunately, the negatives come very close to outweighing those positives.  First, some minor gripes:  first, there's a puzzle about half way through the game that involves having to change the state of various objects in a scene.  But, the ways to do that are entirely arbitrary and non-obvious.  Second, theres a dancing puzzle in the game.  Don't ask me why there's a muscle twitch challenge in a point-and-click adventure.  But, it's irritating.\n\nNext, the medium-level negative:  except for the two puzzles noted above, every other challenge in the game is bone-obvious.  There's no real challenge here:  walk around in a scene or two, pick up everything, talk to everyone, and do the obvious.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd, finally, the big one:  the game is just plain tiresome.  Almost boring.  The trivial challenges are one thing.  But, then you've got those beautiful animations that just slow the pace down to snails in molasses in January.  Yes.  You can left-click again to skip most of the animated and spoken dialogs once you've read the lines.  Ditto for many (but not all) of those animations of walking around.  But, still, the game just drags.  It's a darn shame.  I finished the whole game and thought it was worthwhile (gorgeous work).  But, it's a close thing.  Still, overall, it's OK.","February 5, 2014","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a point and click, it's not especially difficult (that's not a criticism, really, but don't expect to be on the edge of your seat while playing.) Some solutions are a little hard to figure out, the ending feels somewhat lacking in impact, and I'm pretty sure a few unedited lines of dialogue got put in by mistake.\n\nBut the characters are easily likeable, plus the interactions are always interesting and usually genuinely funny. By this point, pop culture references, fourth-wall jokes, and calling attention to the nonsense of your own world is a very hit-or-miss style of comedy. KING art definitely knew what they were doing. They had a plan, stuck to it, and delivered what I already know will one day be a comforting piece of nostalgia for anyone fortunate enough to be able to enjoy it for what it is.\n\nAll things considered, I can honesly say that I genuinely enjoyed every minute I spent in this game.

The visuals are pretty decent, about on par with Syberia II or TLJ:Dreamfall. Since the emphasis is on comedy, you need a sense of humor to enjoy this game. For me it was very funny, there were a lot of laugh out lout moments. It has a lot of references to nerd culture like DOD, WOW, LOR, etc. All of the puzzles are inventory based, and not very difficult. My nine-year-old was able to solve about half of the puzzles without any help from me. The game has a lot of lengthy conversations that include a lot of jokes. You will need to go of back and forth to fetch this item or that item, so the game took me a good 17 hours to finish.

As a point and click, it's not especially difficult (that's not a criticism, really, but don't expect to be on the edge of your seat while playing.) Some solutions are a little hard to figure out, the ending feels somewhat lacking in impact, and I'm pretty sure a few unedited lines of dialogue got put in by mistake.\n\nBut the characters are easily likeable, plus the interactions are always interesting and usually genuinely funny. By this point, pop culture references, fourth-wall jokes, and calling attention to the nonsense of your own world is a very hit-or-miss style of comedy. KING art definitely knew what they were doing. They had a plan, stuck to it, and delivered what I already know will one day be a comforting piece of nostalgia for anyone fortunate enough to be able to enjoy it for what it is.\n\nAll things considered, I can honesly say that I genuinely enjoyed every minute I spent in this game. I'd call it a must-try for any fan of visual novels. And if it happens to be on sale, as it is now for the release of the sequel, definitely snag it up.

Along the way they have to become artillery, mages, tomb raiders, a level 98 blacksmith and more all the while not taking themselves to seriously and referencing again and again (to just name a few) Tolkien, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Psycho, Mission Impossible and commenting on specific adventures and adventures in general.\n\nThere is nothing the game really excels in and it has a few irritating aspects. Still it is mostly fun and I'd recommend playing this adventure over a number of others. For example, by nature of a light fantasy setting versus a thriller setting this game has a a story less deep than Cognition but is more fun and I dare say the better experience.\n\n+ Good voice acting and music\n+ Good story with a nice conclusion\n+ Atmospheric items\n0 Believable, yet sometimes irritating character traits\n- A few minor bugs\n- One tedious sort of riddle\n- One riddle I consider broken\n\nImportant hints:\nThe spacebar is your friend. It will highlight all the hotspots on the screen and helped me find a few important hotspots I might have otherwise overlooked for quite some time.\nThe disk puzzle is broken for me. Be aware, the shaft through the disks becomes a button once all disks are stacked.\nTo the best of my knowledge: The puzzle is supposed to work like Mastermind showing colour-coded evaluations of the current "centre column" on the stacked-up disks - red for wrong symbol, yellow for wrong disk but right symbol, green for right disk and right symbol. I don't know whether the position of colours has meaning. The evaluation is executed whenever the button (former shaft) is activated (or you leave and reenter the puzzle screen). The button must also be pressed in order to finally solve the puzzle and make the machine work.\nNow, I spent something between one and three hours trying different approaches and characters and looking around for clues because not every evaluation with four green spinners is a solution that makes the machine work. I still do not know how to solve the puzzle. My last approach was to get all green spinners, then have as few spinners as possible spin on evaluation.\nThe "tedious sort of riddle" involved running around branching paths in the earth pixie mine and being thrown back to the start again and again which started to get annoying after about the fourth time. I'm guessing the throw-backs can be avoided but when you come up to them it's not directly clear how.\n\nI liked the atmospheric items, i.e. hotspots in new rooms that the character comments on once or twice - thus adding to the scenery - and which are then deactivated as hotspots thus not cluttering up the screen.\nThe voice acting is good and together with nice music helps tell a story that half colours a fantasy world and half mocks adventure culture in a nice way, be it games or movies or books. The last part of the story offered a not quite unexpected twist where my only question was "will I play that or will that be played for me" as the game had simply told me about the happening of an episode twice before. Anyway, with that twist the game comes to an, and let me state here I value that highly, agreeable conclusion.\n\nI had a few minor graphical bugs not really worth explaining. I had one state bug where the character was moved from A to B within a sequence but returned to A after which was clearly not the intention and almost a problem. Nate swims up to the ladder in the sunken temple when the chamber fills with water. After the sequence he was back in the chamber - standing, not swimming, in the water. Walking around a bit with another character helped.\n\nI can easily recommend The Book of Unwritten Tales and I'm looking forward to the second game which I'm about to start right now.","February 13, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers deicided to present you only with the items and interactions which are relevant at the point of story. Which helps a lot. You still need to search the screen like in many other of these games, though. Removing interactions after done or viewed (mostly twice) was also a very good choice from the developer.\n\nThe story is okay and plays with many fantasy clichês mixed up with trinkets/ideas from our reality. If you don't like fantasy, you probably shouldn't play it. In the end of the story I even liked all of the characters, despite some of them make it really hard at first.\nThe end (final confrontation) of the game is a bit too short for my taste. It seemed rushed to me. I am not sure if the money ran out or the writing was not fleshed out, but it doesn't make it necessarily a bad game.\nOverall the game is not too long, so you can easily play it through in multiple sessions. Like in most of the adventure games there is also no replay value.\n\nOne technical issues I had: I played the game in a very high resolution (3440x1440), so for some puzzles (like the map and the dance puzzle) I couldn't see the part I needed to see. As workaround I set the resolution to a lower value in these instances.","May 10, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Imagine a mix of T.Pratchett, Tolkien and.... World of Warcrft. Thats what it felt like to me.\n\n\nThis is "must have" even if you're not adventure game junkie....\n... and if you are - this game is your wet dream.\n\nFull\nI still remember good old LucasArts and Sierra classics. They defined meaning of 'good adventure game' in my vocabulary, and by these terms i find  "The Book of Unwritten Tales" one of best adventure game i've played in years (if not for Deponia i'd say "the best").\n\nOne important to begin with: the puzzle level is quite easy and that makes game pretty short."The Book of Unwritten Tales" is really not about solving various puzzles by randomly picking 20 items and chaotically using them on everything. It is about crafting a story with very logical and somewhat easy challanges. Yes - logical. You dont  build a flamethrower only to light a candle. In "The Book of Unwritten Tales"  all you need to do is to get maches.This makes game very casual and i really loved that.\n\nThe game is packed with funny situations and lots of references to other games and fantasy: like WoW, LotR and T.Pratchett Discworld. It makes this game really joyfull to play with (and this comes from 30+ y old horse).\n\nLastly audio and visuals are top notch! The scenography is truly beautiful, landscape and characters are very well crafted, all that with exellent choice of music and voice acting makes this game a masterpiece.","April 28, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilrathilord/recommended/215160/","kilrathilord","Kilrathi lord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilrathilord/","17 products in account","Just finished this wonderful gem of a game, it has a few problems but overall was one of the funniest adventure games I have played in ages, it is very self aware and pokes fun at adventure game tropes as well as rpg tropes. Below I will list some pros and cons to the game as well as my final score out of 10. so lets get started\n\nPROS\n\n1. The graphics- for a small adventure game I thought the graphics were outstanding especailly the backgrounds, there are also certain characters who look great, such as the minotaur in chapter 4.\n\n2. the voice acting- the va work in the game is for the most part amazing espcially wilbur, for the most part all the voice actors get into their roles and you can tell are having a blast playing these zany characters.\n\n3. Length- I was actually shocked this game was so long my play time says 15 hrs but is actually longer bc I played the demo first to see if I liked the game. So when I purchased the full game I sped through the demo parts that I had already beaten.\n\n4 Dialogue- the Dialogue is pretty great, I would say a good 80 percent of the jokes land, and there were more than a few times I laughed out loud.\n\n5. Difficulty- as adventure games go this one is good for beginners, there a few brain teasers but for the most part the game is pretty easy, especially if you use the spacebar (the spacebar highlights all interactive hotspots on the screen). I reccomend using the spacebar bc I hate pixel hunting, I play adventure games for the story, characters, and puzzles not to pixel hunt\n\nCONS\n\n1. Story- while the characters and dialogue are great and worth a play through, the actual story is pretty dull and boring and like most I found the ending to be a let down\n\n2. chapter 4- the game is broken up into 5 chapters and while I dont hate chapter 4, I felt like it dragged and the game lost some steam here, bc for the most part you only play as nate, and he was my least favorite character, he grew on me but I never felt attached to him like I did to Ivo and Wilbur.\n\n3. Pixel Hunting- if you dont want to use the spacebar than pixel hunting is real bad, bc a lot of the objects blend into the background and they are hard to see.\n\n4. MINI GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- this is an adventure game yet the devs decided to include two mandatory mini games that just plain suck, especailly the dancing one, in you guessed it chapter 4 lol.\n\nCLOSING COMMENTS AND SCORE\n\nOverall I loved this game, it has fun characters, a decent story, and can be laugh out loud funny. It is a long game if you take ya time and explore the different dialogue options, I got it on sale on steam for 5 dollars, I cant wait to play the new one now I highly reccomend this game to adventure game fans or for gamers who are interested in the adventure game genre, bc its good for beginners. final score is\n\n8.5/10","March 26, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would not pay over 15$ for this game alone (as a maximal price only; otherwise find a bundle or wait for a sale).\n\nI suggest playing the Prequel first.

Old adventure games had me poking around for quite some time; "Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis" was practically a formative experience for me growing up. In this game, there was little mystery. There was always a bit of dialogue to tell you what the next puzzle was and to suggest where to go look for the thing you were missing. Chapters 4 and 5 (the last two chapters) were stronger in this aspect, while the earlier chapters were trying too hard with genre-referential humor in the dialogue. There were also several times where, after you had completed one puzzle, the game "took over" with a cutscene or scripted dialogue where the character obviously went and solved a puzzle by themselves and just brought back some useful whatsit as a result. In such cases, it felt like a scene was cut for time or funding or something, rather than story progress. If there were, say, two more chapters on the level of difficulty of Chapters 4 and 5, it would have been a much more satisfying game.\n\nTL;DR: If you're a fan of the genre, pick it up on sale. It's a fun diversion, but sadly lacking depth and challenge.","January 22, 2014","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was horribly disappointed by the animations of the Monkey Island HD editions and the unintuitive controls or inability to skip narrated dialog. I was very frustarted at the lunacy of Deponia - puzzles so bizarre that solving them was a game of exhaustive trial and error (or basically dependent upon using a guide).\n\nUnwritten Tales sits somewhere between the two. It's not perfect, but it is good enough to enjoy. The voice acting is good, the scenes look good and the puzzles are fairly logical. There's good features like double clicking an exit to skip the walking to it - so there is not much time spent waiting for characters to traverse scenes (and generally there's not absurdly long routes in any particular scene or area unlike Deponia). You can show all the hotspots by pressing the space bar, which is needed because a few of the things you need are pretty small or obscured. It plays well overall.\n\nIt does have issues. I've run into a few glitches already. Some of the models look either dated or amateur - especially when animated. A lot of the animations are a bit off, but nothing so bad that it ruins the experience (unlike the Monkey Island HD games).

Only the combinations that make sense (for the game) are available, and the items in the background are no longer "visible" once they are used or their funny description has been said.\n- A LITTLE PIXEL (or object) HUNTING: Just a couple of obscure items almost ruined it for me (hint: both are in the crypt) (UPDATE: After reading other reviews I just found out that holding the space bar highlight all items, which may be nice, but may ruin the experience)\n- UNNECESSARY FLESH: Speaking as a heterosexual male, the elf (Ivo) is unnecessarily sexualized (barely any clothes on), and it doesn´t do a great job at it either.\n\n\nRating: 8/10\nNot the greatest in terms of the gameplay part, but the dialogs and characters make up for all of the above","May 31, 2015","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the humor and references that make a hilarious good experience. It's rare to find an adventure game of this caliber theese days! It took me right back to the good old days with monkey island and simon the sorecer and I could'nt stop playing it until I finnished it! It took me about 20 hours to comlete and it did'nt feel to short either. The story was great and interesting and I loved the characters. The graphic style was great and the enviroments looked gorgeous. The "puzzles" are interesting and humorus, not to frustrating and hard but still not to easy to get booring either. This was such a great experience I almost feel bad for buying it at a discount. I most certainly will buy the followup work in progress as soon as it's finnished! If you like point and click adventure games this is a rare gem! I recommend getting it asap! The best one I've played in years.","October 17, 2014","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a lot of enjoyable characters and situations in the game and i did enjoy that you got to play as multiple characters. The gnome in particular was really charming. There was also a bunch of references and jokes which i greatly enjoyed.\n\nThe story though is not really all that great and it has a bit of a pacing problem.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/215160/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","A lovely adventure game somewhat betrayed by its simplicity.\n\nThroughout the course of the game you gain control of 3 characters (you can maybe count it as 4 even), playing some sections exclusively as one character, or sometimes getting the option of switching to another. All three are fun to play and have their own distinct personalities which also translate into their observations of the world, which you can directly see by inspecting the same items with different characters. Although the last one you are introduced to does take a little while to like, since at the beginning he's quite obnoxious.\n\nThe story is one of the most important parts in an adventure game, and here it certainly does not disappoint. It is a lighthearted save the world plot spanning through a diverse set of areas with a real feeling of adventure. However the ending did feel rushed, and compared to the rest of the game the're just the feeling that not as much thought went into designing it.\n\nThe biggest problem the game has is that there is only one usable button, you do absolutely everything with only the left mouse click. This means that even if you get stuck somewhere, it is not too difficult to brute force your way through, because there is a much more limited number of possibilities than in traditional adventure games.\n\nBut perhaps there is some sort of an upshot to this as well. The game flow is rarely interrupted and you're not going to get frustrated over some random puzzle, although there is one particularly annoying area in a mine which for some reason uses a top down camera instead of the traditional sidescrolling one.\n\nThe Book of Unwritten Tales is certainly lengthy enough without the need for convoluted puzzles, it took me 13 hours to finish it, but I didn't spend much of that time trying to figure out what to do next.\n\n7 / 10","July 26, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot of funny references to popular fantasy and science fiction movies in there as well!\nThe game is not without a few bugs though. Some scenes suddenly slow down to a crawl - the only fix was restarting the game. Further the end scene and credits completely lost sound and music... might be a mac only problem, who knows?!\n\nAnywho... clear recommendation!","February 28","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only fleshed out character is Wilbur the magical gnome and he makes it all worth while. The other two I just couldn't care for. Nate is your typical snarky pirate type of guy and Ivo the half naked elf princess has the depth of a floppy disk (and a really annoying bird as companion). Luckily they both get proper character boosts in the sequel (unfortunately the annoying bird remains annoying).\n\nBut because their weak character in this game I only really enjoyed the sections where we get to play as Wilbur. Although it feels like we mostly get to play as Nate, but maybe that's because there's a certain chapter with him that feels twice as long as the others (if you played it you will know what I'm referring to).\n\nThe puzzles are rather easy if you compare it with other point & click games, especially if you compare it with classics. The story is.. well, it too is rather bland. The ending left me with more questions than I had during the whole game. It felt kind of rushed.\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is you should ignore this game and only get the sequel if you just want a thoroughly enjoyable p&c game.\n\nSo why recommend this game?!\nI don't really recommend it, but I don't dislike it. It's just meh. It has some good parts and lots of stupid humour. You know, the type of humour that makes you facepalm, sigh and roll your eyes? Yeah. These games live and breathe that.\nSo I recommend this game if you have a bad sense of humour and like adorable gnomes.\n\n3/5 get the sequel instead.","March 3","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it took me about 20 hours and I had very few boring moments. The main character, the Gnome, is charming and fun to play. PARENTS: in my opinion, it is fine for 8 years or older; or 12 years old if you are very conservative (there is one adult-ish or teen joke, though a child might really not notice at all).\n\nPRICE matters: I bought BOUT I, II and the Critter Chronicles (Prequel) as a cheap bundle. I would not pay over 15$ for this game alone (as a maximal price only; otherwise find a bundle or wait for a sale).\n\nI suggest playing the Prequel first. BOUT I is better in terms of story and style in my opinion, but the Prequel will give Critter an interesting background when you play BOUT I (Critter has no background or known concept when you play BOUT I).","January 24","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All three are fun to play and have their own distinct personalities which also translate into their observations of the world, which you can directly see by inspecting the same items with different characters. Although the last one you are introduced to does take a little while to like, since at the beginning he's quite obnoxious.\n\nThe story is one of the most important parts in an adventure game, and here it certainly does not disappoint. It is a lighthearted save the world plot spanning through a diverse set of areas with a real feeling of adventure. However the ending did feel rushed, and compared to the rest of the game the're just the feeling that not as much thought went into designing it.\n\nThe biggest problem the game has is that there is only one usable button, you do absolutely everything with only the left mouse click. This means that even if you get stuck somewhere, it is not too difficult to brute force your way through, because there is a much more limited number of possibilities than in traditional adventure games.\n\nBut perhaps there is some sort of an upshot to this as well. The game flow is rarely interrupted and you're not going to get frustrated over some random puzzle, although there is one particularly annoying area in a mine which for some reason uses a top down camera instead of the traditional sidescrolling one.\n\nThe Book of Unwritten Tales is certainly lengthy enough without the need for convoluted puzzles, it took me 13 hours to finish it, but I didn't spend much of that time trying to figure out what to do next.\n\n7 / 10","July 26, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles aren't as crazily difficult like the Deponia series but are solvable by using simple intuition and the Spacebar. I enjoy solving the puzzles but they are more of a "If you can't do this, keep clicking on any other available spot"\n\nPROS\n1. Good Graphics\nThe 3D is a step up from the cartoonish drawings of the Deponia Series.\n\n2. Interesting World\nTransport Dragons, Mummies, Elves, Gnomes, Orcs, Mages and Death himself.\n\n3. Good Title\nBook of Unwritten Tales. Very catchy.\n\n4. Weird Ideas\nUsing a Telephone Booth (aka Tardis concept) to teleport? Interesting.\n\nCONS\n1. Linearity\nThere is really only 1 way to solve a puzzle and your choices don't really matter at all. You are just solving one puzzle to get to the next.\n\n2. Dead World\nYou can't interact with anything except what the developers want you to interact with. There is nothing that you can interact with for fun.\n\n3. Colour Issues\nWhen you make a potion, purple is not pink.\n\n4. Number of Stirs\nHow do you count 3 stirs clockwise? Why is not stirring considered a foul?\n\n5. Abrupt Ending\nThe ending was so easy and abrupt.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Removing the Linearity\nI would suggest referring to the Witcher series for examples on how to use multiple ways to solve one issue. Or the Osbourne kids' books.\n\n2.

There were no hidden object scenes and logic puzzles were very minimal.\n\nHowever, there are some hefty flaws.\n* As others have said, the characters move VERY slowly, so a lot of your time can just be sat watching them walk across the scene.\n* The puzzles are frequently in the form of "go to this place and get this thing then return to a previous place to get another thing and put them together, now go to a different place and give the thing to someone who will give you another thing and then..." which was wearing.

Very engaging story and great characters.  I loved the concept of being able to switch between them, though at times the process of switching was tedious (waiting for the character to get to the exact position the game requires just to trade an item real quick).  There were a few issues with subtitles mismatching and lines going through the screen where action would later take place, but they weren't distracting. There was also one or two times where I could click on something from a previous screen, which was... interesting. Again, that didn't distract from the story and just made me chuckle and move on.  There are some fantastic references that had me laughing and looking for others.\n\nI only remember being frustrated with a puzzle twice, and both of them were simply because the solution was too specific and illogical (they may be references?).  They didn't completely ruin the game, but they were the times where I had to consult a walkthrough which I do not like doing, but they frustrated me too much to find the real solution. Specifically  When trying to get red paint - there is red powder that obviously needs to get wet: I came across 2 sources of water, the paladins spit and a giant tub of water in the caves, and neither worked, I needed the tiny puddle of tears that I completely missed in the crypt.  Also, needed a gold coin for the  phone booth  teleporter.  Ran up to grab some from the giant piles by the throne room, but nope, I need to get into that specific locked chest - actually didn't need a walkthrough for this one - it just seemed like a silly solution .  In the grand scheme of the game, these are nothing, and like I said, may be references that I don't know/remember.

It references many IT and game related stuff (movies, too) and makes a great fun of it (I really love the part with hairy server deamon).\n\nThe graphics are beautifull, the voice acting is superb as is the soundtrack.\n\nRiddles are real riddles (not Skyrim-like would-be-riddles for everyone with IQ >= 80) but they're not so difficult that they yould make you stuck for too long. Also, every part of every riddle is only possible to solve once you have enough information to make that solution logical and reasonable. So you won't get anywhere by trying to just blindly put stuff together. You must gather data first or your character will only say something like "Why would I want to do that?" even though it might be the right solution.\n\nAnd even though the main plot itself isn't really original in any way, there is a lot of content around it.\n\nI also appreciate that devs took the effort and also made this game available for Linux users. And well enough, too. The single problem is that the first time the game starts, it doesn't get your desktop resolution but loads some weird default instead. If you want to change it, you must restart the game, but when you quit the game, the desktop resolution is that of the game. So you also have to restart you GUI.

A long game that is well worth your time. (Sequel is just as good)","May 30","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles aren't as crazily difficult like the Deponia series but are solvable by using simple intuition and the Spacebar. I enjoy solving the puzzles but they are more of a "If you can't do this, keep clicking on any other available spot"\n\nPROS\n1. Good Graphics\nThe 3D is a step up from the cartoonish drawings of the Deponia Series.\n\n2. Interesting World\nTransport Dragons, Mummies, Elves, Gnomes, Orcs, Mages and Death himself.\n\n3. Good Title\nBook of Unwritten Tales. Very catchy.\n\n4. Weird Ideas\nUsing a Telephone Booth (aka Tardis concept) to teleport? Interesting.\n\nCONS\n1. Linearity\nThere is really only 1 way to solve a puzzle and your choices don't really matter at all. You are just solving one puzzle to get to the next.\n\n2. Dead World\nYou can't interact with anything except what the developers want you to interact with. There is nothing that you can interact with for fun.\n\n3. Colour Issues\nWhen you make a potion, purple is not pink.\n\n4. Number of Stirs\nHow do you count 3 stirs clockwise? Why is not stirring considered a foul?\n\n5. Abrupt Ending\nThe ending was so easy and abrupt.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Removing the Linearity\nI would suggest referring to the Witcher series for examples on how to use multiple ways to solve one issue. Or the Osbourne kids' books.\n\n2. The Mighty Card Game\nIt would have been great to have a real Mighty card game within this game.","May 28","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animation can be a bit aged especially if playing on higher resolutions but BoUT's is still a fun game!\n\nMy only (-) is that character movement can be a little slow, but feel free to grab a cup of tea and sip while waiting","May 29","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of the few games that had me so hooked I ended up playing the entire thing in one sitting. The characters are lovable and the story is cute and entertaining. The dialog can be a little long at the beginning where you feel like there is not much going on other than speaking to everyone and everything. (which I personally didn't mind but my younger sister got bored in the first 3 minutes... because she wants everything now!) However, the dialog is amusing and has many little quips that are referring to some other movies, tv shows, ect that you will hear and maybe crack a smile because you will have that 'a hah! That's from *insert reference here*' The artwork is also very well done and is primarily cartoon like but not over the top.\n\nThe only bad things I can say about this game is that I wish it were longer! I hope this helps anyone who is considering playing this adorable game. :)","May 31","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It had me literally laughing out loud multiple times. The humor was right up my ally.\n\nThe puzzles were clear, and the prompts were helpful if you got stuck. I never felt a need to go to a walkthrough, and I never got stuck enough to get frustrated. I did, however heavily utilize the space bar (which reveals all the clickable points) which is a great feature for a game such as this.\n\nThe plot was really engaging and I was so thrilled to find that there was a part 2 once I finished it because I definitely wasn't done laughing with these characters.\n\n10/10 Please hit me really hard in the face so I can play it for the first time again.","June 5","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
