"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/recommended/462910/","thelonesoldier","Cyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/","188 products in account","PolyRunner is a basic endless-flyer game where you avoid obstacles as long as you can, scoring points based on how far you travel as well as pickups you collect. The game has three control modes, two of which are stupid and one which is good if you play standing up.\n\nThe first mode is "look", where you steer your ship by looking where you want it to go. This is the default, and is completely useless because turning your head to steer mean you can't see where you are going and will crash. The second mode is controlling with a gamepad (or the keyboard), which is boring.\n\nThe third mode is "Tilt", where you steer by tilting your head (as opposed to turning it). This one is boring if you play it sitting down, but for some reason it becomes exhilarating if you play it standing up. Although you only need to tilt your head, I like to tilt my whole body as if I was on a skateboard. This gives you a fanstic feeling like you are riding a hoverboard over the landscape at 70 miles per hour; although it's a little weird seeing your ship in front of you, I think it helps you maintain a point of reference and keep from getting motion sick.\n\nSince it's free, I definitely recommend giving it a go in "Tilt" mode while standing up.","April 21","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When starting the game, it immediately made me stare at an endless plane of ground moving AWAY from me.  In addition to nearly insta-barfing (just upon reaching the main menu), I had to turn around to see the actual menu.\n\n2.) There is no input except for TURNING YOUR HEAD.\n\nSo if you're looking for a simulator of being a giant disembodied omniscient head suspended behind a futuristic jet fighter where the only inputs you have are the rotation of your neck and the rising motion sickness in your throat, look no further.","May 11","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

Control seemed locked to my head movement. Which sucks. In VR, I want to look around with my head, not make it an extension of my controller. Also, the collision detection on levels seemed overly sensative. My jet would frequently explode on objects when it felt like there should be enough room to fly by. I'm a fan of Race The Sun. So I downloaded Poly Runner VR expecting something similar. While the levels look much nicer than RTS, the gameplay has turned me off to it. I'll keep an eye on this game though. If my gripes get fixed I'll change my review. I really want to like this game.","May 19","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite what other reviews say, you can control either by 1) looking in the direction, 2) tilting your head, or 3) gamepad/keyboard input. I'm not sure if these options have been included as a recent update however.\n\nI had problems with keyboard input getting stuck, so I use the Look option which is way more fun.\n\nAlso you can recenter your head position, but this is done in SteamVR settings, not the game itself.\n\nMotion sickness is obviously subjective. I get motion sick in many seated games but not this one. The reference point of the ship itself is probably the reason for my resistance in this case.\n\nIt's free so try!","May 21","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it was probably a mobie game or something cause the graphics are really simple and dont even have textures, but the 3D effect is good and it's a fast paced arcade game that keeps you engaged for several minutes.
