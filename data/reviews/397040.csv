I'll try to put my early impressions into words: The game has an heavily russian community (Thanks god I'm used to CSGO already) but anyways.\n\nThe graphics are outdated but not too bad with 8x AA. The combat is somewhat great it's comparable to TERA which is a great thing, but it's unresponsive.

Some pros are:\n- The Aforementioned action style combat rather than tab-targeting system\n- There is item enhancement and auction house (ala Archeage, WoW, etc)\n- The PVP aspect of the game (May be a problem for many people but that's why the PVE server was made)\n- There are quite a bit of classes to choose from (gender locked with certain races like demon gets top and bottom male and middle female, and humans get top and bottom female and middle male, so it sort of evens out.\n- Quite a good amount of people for a slightly new MMO\n- The skills are a bit less then most MMO's but they are easy to get as you can get most in about 3-5 hrs\n- Enemy's are fun to fight and the game is quite difficult (depending on the class you choose\n- You don't have to grind much unless your going for lvl 40 (good luck) really quickly\n- PVP is great due to the aforementioned action style combat\n- The download isn't so much so great to try out for a bit\nEven thought I say it's a good game, it's got quite a bit of cons\n- Graphics are not as good as most new MMO's (I don't care but some people do)\n- High lvls can spam kill newbies depending on their moral compass\n- The server is pretty stable but I ran into a few server glitches and some 10 second disconnects because of the server\n-  I ran into a few bugs ( one including when I started the game Fluffy got stuck inside the wood of a carriage) but not that many\n- Some spelling and grammatical errors\n- Many things you can buy but not "Pay2Win" (Mostly cosmetics and mounts but there are weapons.\nI like this game and I am still playing it, as long as my internet holds up :(. I seriously recommend you play this with a friend because you can team against bosses and dungeons, do quests, and you will run into many pvpers on your journey so having more than one person will usually grant you your win, or intimidate your opponent.

The graphics are dated, but it has pseudo-action combat for those curious, you target with a crosshair and use left and right mouse to use primary abilitys (that you set) and then the number keys as ability keys like MMO standard.\n\nTo go into a little more detail, character creation begins with race and class selections, there are 4 playable races to choose, dwarf, human, elf, and demon. Currently only humans and demons are selectable. I am not sure if elves and dwarves are locked because they are unfinished and unimplemented yet, or if they are some sort of bonus you get for something. Class wise there are 9 that I remember, the classes are gender locked. The 9 classes are Barbarian, paladin, warrior, ranger, monk, assassin, sorcerer, priest and necromancer.\n\nCurrently I am leveling an Assassin, so far throughout the demon starting zone my experience has been solid, dated, but definitely decent.  Overall I feel that Sphere 3: enchanted world does not do very much different from MMO's that were out 5- 10 years ago. It does however manage to keep what made many of those MMOs decent. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of classic MMO's","December 4, 2015","true","6.2"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","2"

It feels cumbersome to play.\n\nThings I like:\n- 9 classes to pick from. Several look interesting.\n- Graphics are fine.\n\nThings I dont like:\n- 2 of the 4 races are inavailable, with no explanation at all.\n- Cant choose gender.\n- Secveral keyboard keys cant be mapped, including shift and enter.\n- Jumping doesnt work very well. To jump over a fence you have to run towards it and then jump. Otherwise you'll just jump into the air at the same spot. Jumping over gaps or up cliffs is awful.\n- No run/walk control. Takes forever to get places.\n- No loot except quest items and a few coins.\n- Spell casting is awkward. The game doesnt detect whether you'll hit anything, so it doesnt tell you if the target is out of range or anything. Sometimes I don't understand why nothing happens when I cast at someone.\n- After killing something you have to wait for the loot to be interactable.\n- Map cant be zoomed in much, so it only works as a world overview.\n- There are no audial or visual effects that warn you that you are taking damage.","December 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If it were more like mortal with its combat hit boxes in the pvp realm then yes this game might actually be decent as an open world pvp game, The immersion isnt there except its graphics, things are automatically given over level progression instead of earned or researched.  All in all its another World of Warcraft trying to pretend to be an immersive "hardcore" pvp game.

If you're smart, you'll play for a good hour before realizing the poor potential. +.1 for trying at least\n\nWhat I think: Unresponsive (you'll see what i mean), extremely boring to get into, and poor mob design. Hell the game involves killing the same mob with a different name in a non unique area of more running. It lacks the base necessities to entertain real "hardcore players". Not even fun with friends and even when you both get mounts, the game feels 4/10 at most. A strong beginning is what gets people in, not a marathon.\n\nWhat Nerds think: I'm a casual MMO player who looks more towards an upside to counteract the downside. I also will dislike this because I'm either a troll or contain a poor taste in classic(ish) type of MMOs. Hell why would you not hate a game if you get stuck on a beanstalk for 1/4 of the game time because of invisible barriers while trying to run down?\n\nScore: 4.1/10","December 19, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Play it for free to experience massive battles, breathtaking castle sages, deep storyline and even more.\nhttps://youtu.be/PP83A1yXe9g\nCommentsClasses are gender locked. This is not really a big deal to me, but it may bother some who abhor not having a choice of gender for each class. There are several classes to choose from: Paladin, barbarian, Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Assassin, Sorcerer, Priest, and Necromancer. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nCharacter customization is limited by the gender lock feature, but several different hairstyles, colors, eyes, and tattoos are available. Races include Humans, Elves, Demons, and Dwarves. Humans and Demons are the only two available upon first entry into the game, the other two are locked for new players.\n\nStory: well thought out. If you like quests, this game has over 1000 of them! For those willing to put in the time, multitudes of content are readily available for your experience.\n\nQuests can be repetitive: kill “x amount of things” or collect “x amount of other things.” However, this is typical in almost all MMOs. Quests will vary.\n\nArt style looks old but has a surprising amount of detail put into the environment. Skill animations are simple and not too flashy, but get the job done.\n\nNo voice acting for NPCs, usually only 1 option for dialogue when talking to NPCs. If you like reading text more than listening to voices; this may be a welcome addition to you. However, if you hate reading text and prefer listening to voice acting, you may have a hard time with this game.\n\nCombat system is slow; attacks are delayed by 2-3 seconds. Definitely requires patience and persistence in order to be successful. Along with this, enemy AI is extremely buggy.\n\nThere are multitudes of skills to learn, each unique to their respective classes. Upgrade and enchant your weapons and armor, find legendary loot, fight epic monsters, and have a fun time traveling around the vast world.\n\nContent: hundreds of hours of it if you are willing to spend the time. Story is fully narrated. This game has an endless amount of quests and places to explore. There are Pve servers for more casual players and PvP servers for those who wish to be competitive.\n\nClient can be glitchy at times, closing with no warning or freezing. This has only happened to me a few times when on the loading screen, but not while in-game. I just thought I would point that out.\n\nCamera: 3rd person, but if you zoom in enough, you can transition to first person. Cursor automatically moves camera, you can press tab to use your cursor regularly. No problems here, the camera does it's job very well.\n\nFREE! The only thing you would potentially lose in this game if you ended up not liking it is time. The download and requirements are not that big either, so what's stopping you from trying this game out?\nFinal overviewThere are a few minor flaws associated with this game. This game has a potential for an amazing and immersive experience. Much has been put into this game, and I like what it has to offer; hours of questing (with some grinding), dungeons to conquer, and varieties of classes, skills, and equipment.\nDownload and try it out now!\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10\nReview done for Vantom Giveaways.\nRead the review on our {LINK REMOVED}website.","December 14, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

If you kill a monster or get items for a quest the area will refresh before you have finished or left. It would be nice if when you are in an area working on a quest that the monsters would not regenerate so fast, and that the area would be clear of items or monsters till you leave said area or are killed and have to go to a regeneration location.\nBe on the watch for monsters that are above your level they can kill you with no problem unlike monsters that are at  or below your level. Those you can kill easy. This game is great, I would stay on for hours if I did not have a job and family to take care of.

The main downside to this game is that you'll have to be an old-school MMORPG player to really appreciate the game (WoW Vanilla, EQ era). I think the game has potential, and the positives mostly outweigh the negatives. Outdated graphics don't bother me and the combat is pretty satisfying and you have plenty of skills to choose from. Questing is typical of an MMO which is something I've gotten used to. Art direction is great and there's some really nice looking areas. Hopefully they'll remove gender locked classes and polish animations and stuff like that in the future.\n\nI wouldn't listen to all the hate the game gets until you try it out for yourself, and you'll most likely enjoy this game if you're a hardcore MMO fan.","December 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","9","24","0","0"

Esta frase basicamente resume este jogo, abaixo segue minha impressão inicial:\n\n- Existem poucas opções de customizações do personagem e poucas raças liberadas.\n- O jogo não facilita nem um pouco a fechar as quests, te obrigando a andar até o local da quest e depois andar de volta para quem te deu a quest para termina-la, não fornecendo nenhum sistema para poupar seu tempo.\n- O gráfico é bem simples e as opções que o jogo oferece ao jogador de jogabilidade se limitam muito a de um mmoorpg básico.\n-O combate é bem parecido com TERA, aonde você pode lançar seus ataques/magias e eles percorrem uma distância pré-determinada.\n- As animações de ataque e do personagem são bem básicas também.\n\nPor fim não recomendo muito este jogo, considerando que vivemos um momento que existem tantos mmorpgs no mercado, além de vários que prometem sererem muito bons prestes a sair. Com isso este jogo não me chamou atenção com os elementos que observei ao joga-lo um pouco.","December 2, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

No performance issues even on my horrible pc.\nThere are some minor bugs I've encountered (Like there's been a text stuck on my screen for around 2 hours), I don't like the way they handled climbing up steep hills and the translation isn't perfect. Despite all this I'd recommend it, it can be quite fun if you don't hate grindy quests. But let's be real, if you did, why would you want to play an MMO?\n\nProtip: If you don't want to go mad turn off the music, every time you accidentally left/right-click you'll get in combat and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ music will start playing.","December 2, 2015","true","7.0"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","10","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/damonwall/recommended/397040/","damonwall","Neolog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/damonwall/","139 products in account","This game is truly something new and original. It brings much more to MMORPG genre, then most of the popular MMORPGs since WoW.\nThis game is not about core classic MMORPG mechanics - such as doing quests, grinding mobs and passing through dungeons. If it's what you like about MMOs - this is not the right game for you.\nThe most important thing about S3 - is PvP and metagame, connected with it! Grinding mobs? Suddenly demon attacks - and you're dead and lost some of your money to attacker. Trying to make it to teleport - and you're dead again. On a third try carefully, stealthly crawling to teleport through jungle. Demon saw you, but you were quicker - and you're in human city, asking for help against demon. Now you're back in area with some high-lvls helpers. They're killing demon a couple of times, getting all gold back. Then you're on revenge expedition to demon lands.\nIn this game you don't lvlup for nothing, you lvlup to survive. And when you kill your first demon/human in an honest PVP fight - this is an achievement to charish and remember.\n\nThis game - probably unintentionally - offers something, that no other MMO has - awesome metagame with hardcore PvP. This game is not about graphics or doing quests - it's about survival, friendship and rivalry.\n\nTotally recommend to mature hardcore games, who tired of standard wow-clone mmo experience, and wants some new and unique experience.","December 2, 2015","true","2.1"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","7","22","0","6"

This game is PvP oriented with alot of grind for exp. At lower lvls around till 20 there are alot of quest which are generic kill and loot stuf. Later quest will end and you will have to grind on mobs to level up and get around new 10-15 quest which give you 1/3 exp of your current lvl and than you grind again to next lvl. Every class have capability to solo AoE grind, some classes are better in that case. I think best way to level up is AoE grind after lvl 20 becouse later it takes you 30min to complete 1 quest which gives you 10k exp and you can get that much amount in 2min with AoE on mobs.\n\nPros:\nThere is solo pve arena where you have to defeat waves of mobs. Total 45 waves\nDungeons and World bosses\nGood optimized game runs on any toaster like 10 years old rig\nThere are castles where clan control it which gives good rewards for clan members\nNon target combat system\nPvP (with PK system) and PvE server\n\nCons:\nGender locked classes\nLow population atleast on pve server demon side\nServer lag\nGame feels unfinished alot basic things are missing and need improvement. For things like UI, chat, AH, no friendlist yet\nJumping is awkward\nBrainless grind on mobs to level up\nNO skill reset for gold, be carefull with your build if you mess up it can cost around 30$ to reset\n\nIs this game P2W? At current state i would say no but there is possible to upgrade your weapon and armor pieces +20 which IS impossible without spending ridiculious ammounts of money and i dont need your theory that if you have milions of gold and thousands of upgrade scrolls you may success. As free to play player you wont get above +10 on weapon or armor becouse even +7 is hard enought to enchant or upgrade. For future my suggesion would be make max upgrade +15 so gap between wallet warriors and freeloaders wont be so high.\n\nI recommend this game to players only which are expierenced with mmorpg and dont mind brainless grind and like pvp. This game wont hold your hand, you have to solo alot which can be tedious unless you start playing with few friends. Also if you die you lose exp and your gear lose durability which cost quite abit gold to repair\nIf you are casual or new to mmorpg genre i would suggest playing something else there are better alternatives\n\nIm still playing this game while i do see potential and with more people those castle sieges and dungeons could be fun\n\nI rate for now 6/10 will update later\n\nUPDATE 04.01.2016\n\nNot playing anymore reasons: game bugs, problems with server, random dc, game keeps crashing. Most important thing game is ghost town feels like playing a bad single player game where you spend 8 hours everyday killing same type of monster on same place for any unknown reason\n\nrate 4/10","December 23, 2015","false","229.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
