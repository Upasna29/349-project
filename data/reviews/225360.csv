It offers about 5 hours of gameplay, a mediocre story as well as some of the worst combat and stealth ever seen in a video game. If it drops from its $40 asking price, I would still recommend avoiding it.\n\nFor a more indepth review, here's a video I did for it:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158131178\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","November 26, 2013","false","12.0"," 1,302 of 1,492 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","302","1","0","18"

Not high as in, let's say, Skyrim high, but you know, for a budget game. Once again, this game turned out to be failure. Yes, the game is all about stealth, the trailer and screenshots showed me that much, but when you spam enemies and keep the guards alerted for minutes whenever they find a body is just insane. It becomes literally impossible to get through the level so you might as well restart or lower the difficulty. It's too damn unbalanced.\n\nOne thing the game does at least partially right is that it has a certain gothic feel to it and it looks alright, with the blur filter turned off.\nThe voice acting on the other hand is, unforuntately, mediocre.\n\nAlso, don't think of Dark as an RPG with stealth elements, but rather as an action-stealth game with RPG elements. There are quite a few powers you can unlock, but except for a few of these most of them are useless. You'll earn XP for taking down enemies, collecting messages or getting through an area undetected but leveling up is slow and you won't be able to unlock the powers you originally wanted near the end of the game. That's what happened to me, anyway.\n\nThere are a few sidequests, but these are linear and can be completed within a few minutes. They're often located near your primary objectives. They're not any fun to and they just require you to go to an area and press a button. Unchallenging and boring.\n\nThe story is ok, and the game is too long for its own good. Normally, for 'an RPG like this', I would consider 8 hours too short. But if it frustrates or annoys I can't finish it fast enough.\nI'm glad I finished it, even if I didn't have to, but I never want to see or play this game again. Games like this make me want a trade-in feature for Steam. Maybe someday...\n\n[Rating: 52/100]","July 7, 2013","false","10.1"," 691 of 799 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","691","799","0","3"

It doesn't help that the protagonist sounds like Shadow the Hedgehog after smoking six cartons of cigarettes. Eric Bane (the boring robot you play as) has amnesia, keeps getting random headaches that initiate a horrible cliche and unfinished "omg im so sick" animation cycle and you keep seeing some angel made out of light, that's all there is to Eric. He has no measurable personality whatsoever and he only exists to be bossed around by other bland and dislikeable NPCs. As evidenced by the scene where he learns he is a vampire, which pretty much goes like this: "Bro you're a vampire" "no I'm not" "yes you are" "oh okay".  Enemies in levels repeat the same two lines over and over, adding to the sensation that everyone in this game is an emotionless robot with unfinished programming.\nI haven't played very far into the game, but because it's so bad I'm never going to continue with it. Basically, you're a vampire and you're out to become a "full-fledged vampire" by finding and drinking the blood of the vampire who turned you into a vampire or some ridiculous rubbish like that. All the while that "angel" occasionally comes in and tries to give you words of encouragement, but basically she's another unfinished robot that bosses you around.\nThe gameplay is even worse. Enemies can spot you almost instantly as you try to move from cover to cover, making stealth near impossible at some points while at others they are completely clueless. The Shadow Leap, which is DARK's version of Dishonored's Blink, is uneffective, has a terribly long cooldown, a painfully short range, attracts nearby enemies and the indicator is impossible to control. The "vampiric powers" all suffer from this same design flaw, they're all unecessarily difficult to control and in the long run are completely useless as a majority of them create noise that attracts all the patrolling robot-men in the area.\nSo in summary, dissapointing comes nowhere near to describing DARK. It's a shameless and unfinished mess and there is no way that this heap of a game is worth $40.00. Do yourself a favor and play Dishonored if you want a good stealth game.","July 12, 2013","false","1.7"," 485 of 620 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","485","620","0","4"

Nevertheless, I enjoyed my playthrough of the campaign.  While there is nothing inherent in this game that will “wow” you, it certainly isn’t as bad as all the “Negative Nancy” types would have you believe.  In fact, it is actually pretty entertaining.\n\nSure the acting isn’t amazing, the AI isn’t hyper-intelligent, and the animations aren’t perfect; but I experienced no glitches or crashing, and the gameplay felt mostly fluid and proper to me.  All of the mechanics are borrowed from other games, but they all worked properly.  Basically, some of the supplemental mechanics and cosmetic details weren’t great, but I didn’t find any serious problems. Maybe I’m crazy, but I’ll take working mediocrity over polished dysfunction any day.\n\nMediocrity is the key.  The game is only mediocre, but it certainly isn’t bad.  If you don’t have much time to play games, you possibly shouldn’t invest time in this one.  There are many other games similar to this one that you should probably play instead.  But, if you play many games, enjoy stealth games, and just want something different to play: then this will offer a novel experience and story.  And as long as you don’t go into it wanting to hate it (because of what you may have heard), it actually can be pretty fun.\n\nThe story is cliché, but entertaining.  It tells a compact and interesting tale of a vampire protagonist with classic “heroes’ amnesia,” and is mildly reminiscent of other vampire stories, like: Blade, Underworld, and True Blood.  The gameplay is linear, and extremely stealth-based, where “going loud” is not really an option. There is a leveling system and various abilities/upgrades to cater to your playstyle.  The campaign will take about 8-10 hours to complete, on average; but it can also likely be done much faster if you avoid combat.\n\nDARK can be enjoyable. However, if you like action over story, don’t like stealth, or are new to stealth, this probably isn’t for you.  I recommend it to anyone who likes true stealth games and is looking to experience something different, perhaps having already played the classics.  It tells an interesting enough story, and should appeal to anyone who enjoys the narrative experience of games.  If you enjoy vampire fiction, it will probably serve as an added bonus.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","July 21, 2015","true","10.2"," 99 of 116 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","99","116","6","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneTrueVisi/recommended/225360/","TheOneTrueVisi","Visi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneTrueVisi/","396 products in account","I wanted to like this game. I wanted to recommend it. I really did... but I can't. I just can't. When I first heard about DARK, prior to it's release, I was extremely excited. It was a promising concept... a vampire game that focused more on stealth than outright combat, but alas, it was not meant to be.\n\nDARK is a short, clunky trek through 6 chapters of repetition. It took me about 12 hours to complete the game my first time through (which I did on Hard), but I took my time through the chapters trying to kill every enemy, and left the game sitting paused several times, so my real time was probably closer to 10 hours or so. Again, that's my first playthrough, and on Hard, so make of that what you will. The game is exclusively single-player, and there's really no incentive whatsoever to play through the game a second time as there are no branching paths or decisions, and the individual "challenges" accessible from the main menu are pointless unless you're interested in leaderboards.\n\nThe game features no real combat system. It's allllllllll stealth and stealth kills, unless you use your vampiric powers, but those are intended to be used from stealth as well. Speaking of powers, while they're fun to use for a while, they're largely irrelevant. You could make it through the game fairly easily without using any of them. When you do use them, they're incredibly powerful when maxed out (which can be done rather fast) despite having cooldowns, and make the game very easy. The AI is very, very simple and easy to out-maneuver throughout the entire game, and they all follow a set patrol pattern with no real variation.\n\nThe story is poorly written and honestly barely even there. You're a vampire, with classic hero amnesia, and you have to find the person who turned you (or a powerful elder vampire) in order to avoid a horrible fate. Between the opening and the ending, there's very little else. Almost no character development whatsoever, not even for the main character, and a forced sort of last minute romance between your character and only other person in the game you know more than 2 or 3 things about. It's an odd feeling to listen to these characters and know that they're voiced by talented people, but have the writing be so bad. The protagonist Eric is voiced by none other than Doug Cockle, who voiced Geralt in the Witcher games, but even he can't hide the terrible writing. It's all rushed, vague, short, and flat out generic. Not to mention there is a colossal plot hole at the end of the game. Huge. I won't say it here for obvious reasons, but it's such a huge plot hole it's astounding they didn't notice, or didn't care. The other sounds aren't anything too special, but nothing really stood out as bad to me, except for a couple character's voices. Music is very meh, and I can't remember a single bit of it except for the same song that plays on a loop in the pseudo-hub you enter in the beginning of the game. It also features probably the lamest, easiest, most pathetic final boss any game has ever had ever.\n\nThe graphics are stylized in a comic-book style, but are pretty bland outside of 3-4 fairly interesting areas. Outside of those limited sections, most of what you'll be going through are large rooms of offices or similar obstacles connected by small hallways or elevators. That is most of the game. The animations are absolutely atrocious. Your character's walking, crouching, running, etc animations aren't that bad, but everything else is. It all feels and looks clunky. Anytime you stealth kill a character it's there. If you feed on someone, every. single. time. you can see that Eric's lips aren't anywhere near the victims neck. It's just bad. Lip sync is also pretty off. With that said... I really liked the vampire vision. It's hard to describe, but the world is viewed in shades of white, purple, and black in this view, and you can see living things through walls and such as red silhouettes, and it kind of looks almost on fire, with everything moving and... well, it just looks cool. It also slows down time when you're using it, and there's no limit to it. It's probably the best thing about the game, but as cool as it is, that's kind of sad.\n\nLastly, I have to mention the save system. The game auto-saves at certain parts thoughout the game, but it also gives you the option of manually saving a limited number of times. Two times, actually. Seems like a strange number of saves, but hey, once you get the hang of the game it's not too hard to rely on the auto-saves. Granted, it can be annoying to redo sections of the map because you made one mistake, but it's not too hard and with only two manual saves, what can you do? Well... press F5, actually. Yeah. Despite you having a limit on how many times you can save through the pause menu, you have unlimited use of the F5 quicksave. The game never tells you about F5, and it isn't anywhere in the options. Why? Why are there two separate ways of saving the game manually? Why is one way obvious and limited, and the other completely hidden but unlimited? It's a mystifying decision on the part of the developers and just another indicator of a rushed, sloppy game.\n\nOverall, DARK is a very underwhelming experience, and very disappointing to me personally. It's not necessarily a bad game... but it's very, very sub-par, and not worth anywhere near what it's priced at. I did have fun at some parts, but it was almost in a trance like state, like I had been tricked into not being bored. It's hard to describe. I can say that I don't regret my purchase, as I do like stealth games and vampire lore quite a lot, but I can't recommend anyone purchase it unless the game is around $10.","November 11, 2014","false","16.1"," 94 of 110 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","94","110","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacoHead1982/recommended/225360/","TacoHead1982","Taco Head","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacoHead1982/","189 products in account","Let me just start out by saying that I have a very high tolerance for pain when it comes to bad entertainment. I enjoy bad B and Z movies like Slugs and anything on the SYFY channel. The very first computer games I owned were Phantasmagoria 1 & 2. I love it, no I live for it. I have bad taste and make no apologies for it. So when I saw that Dark was on sale for a little over 7 dollars I thought to myself "How bad can it be, it's only 7 dollars." How wrong I was. It would have been less of a waste of money if I went out and bought a Mc rib, and less ♥♥♥♥ too. I still can't believe that the makers of Tropico published this.\n\nEric Bane starts the game by doing what he does best, never shutting up. Going on and on in his Rorschach like repetitive inner monologue that can be boiled down to "I can't believe this, Is this really happening, Is this true?" He finds out that he is a vampire with supper Nightcrawler powers the are kind of neat once you learn how to use them. But wait he's not a real vampire he's a half vampire, because he was drained of blood and didn't get blood form the one that made him. Also if he doesn't get this blood he will become an animal and have to be killed, but if he drinks the blood of an ancient vampire he will be fine. So vampires are made when a human has all of their blood drained? Then how are the vampires a secret? There must be thousands of these ghouls as they call them running a round, because they can only drink human blood. Are you telling me that all these years no vampire slipped up and drained a human while feeding? It's ok, because Rose, who wears lights in her hair for awesome fashion taste, tells me that she knows of an ancient vampire that runs the museum. He is decades old. DECADES OLD! I'm decades old, my dad is decades old, my grandma I guess would be supper ancient because she is going to be 100 this year. We also find out that becoming a vampire conveniently erases all memories of you pass. How all vampires aren't drooling idiots is anyone's guess.\n\nEric then goes to talk to the other vampire whose name I have already forgotten, all I remember is that his accent was kind of like, sort of, maybe European, or Californian? I couldn't tell. It' bugged me. Mr. I don't know what kind of white person I want to be shows me how to use my powers by asking me to take care of a gang that is bothering the club members. This is a gang of old men bums. They stand around barrels with fire on them to keep warm with guns and mug people. So it was here that I learned how to use my powers and how to feed off of people, and that this is a stealth game and if I do not stealth really good I will get killed. Because everyone has guns in this world even the bums, I'm sorry GANG! It's really easy to miss or mess up a stealth kill and get everyone with in 5 miles to come kill you. I did kind of like the ideas of the  powers a bit, but from what I could see only 2 or 3 of them would really be useful in the end so no need for a replay to try out other powers. Not that I would ever what a replay. Yes the powers are kind of neat and I would have kept playing if not for the bad story and game play. Finding out how to drag a corpses was a pain. I guess Agent 47 is more of a vampire then Eric, because he can pick up bodies with ease, carry them, and put them in places where they can not be found. Eric on the other had has to be pushed form 3rd person view to 3rd person and drag the body to a place like behind a box. You can do this one of two ways facing to body to make sure that it doesn't get stuck on anything but risk getting stuck yourself, or with you back to the body so you can see where you are going risking having the body get stuck on something and spazzing out flopping around making nose that WILL alert anyone near by so they can come and shoot you.\n\nOne thing I really hated in the tutorial was that while I was sneaking about I would suddenly have control taken from me and put where they wanted me to get the tutorial moving with out any warning. This was really bad with the healing part. Not just in how it was done, but also in how it looked. I was sneaking about when I am suddenly pulled with my back to the wall so I can peaked around it. A gang bum sees me and starts to shoot at me. It looks like me misses not because I see his bullets miss but because Eric didn't react at all. Then Eric rolls to behind a box and I am told I am hurt and need to heal. So I guess that all those bullets did hit Eric but he was to busy with his inner monologue to notice that he had been shot.\n\nLike I said before I like bad games. I'm not one to really rag on things like graphics and what not. If the game play or story are good I'll let it slide. Too bad Dark didn't have any thing good in it to distract me from the fact that everyone talks like they have their teeth wired shut. Even with that the lip movement didn't come close to matching what was being said. The camera had a bad habit of cutting to a new angle after every new line of badly voiced and written dialog sometimes jerking about in such a way that I didn't know what was going on. It gave me a headache talking to people and I don't know if it was the bad writing, the cheesy voice acting, or the spazzy camera work. Nothing about anything people do in this game feels natural or smooth. People stand in unnatural poses talking to you with mouth movements like they had just gotten back form the dentist and had teeth pulled, while their lips flap around in a way that would suggest they want to kiss you but chicken out at the last minute. Eric stands there with his fingers clawed and walks around like a gorilla on two legs. I don't know if his forearm is too long or if his elbow is broken because when he bends it it stick out a little to far. THIS GAME WAS MADE IN 2012! I have games that are almost a decade old that look more natural!\n\nAfter what felt like forever I was suddenly warped to museum. The pacing in this game is schizophrenic. Too slow then too fast with no build up. Eric started to monolog and then he was talking on the radio to Rose. I could not tell where the monolog ended and the conversation started. I turned off the game, and thought about how I had wasted 7 dollars and what I could have bought that would have been better. After a bit of reflection I uninstalled the game and went to play Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines.","June 27, 2014","false","2.2"," 74 of 89 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","74","89","0","4"

In a more serious tone, I would like to add just this; This game is a huge combination of MULTIPLE things I like: Vamps, Stealth, Proggression, Doug Cockle (Voice Actor) and a few other things. It doesn't matter HOW low of standards you have, or how many things you think you can overlook in this game. I PROMISE that you WILL find something that makes you regret ANY amount of money you spent on this game. If you don't believe me, buy it and comment with your own review.\n\nI would have rather spent $2.39 on off brand Wal-Mart Strawberry Preserves, in the glass jar, (which is roughly 7 dollars less than I wasted on this game), cover it in Astroglide lubricant, and stick it in my ♥♥♥. Then I'd squeeze my cheeks until the glass shattered in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and caused internal hemorrhaging. As I lay there in pain, I'm 100% certain that I'd have enjoyed spending that money on an INFINITLEY better experience and product than I had/spent on this game.\n\nI wanted this game so badly, but could never afford it. Finally, I grabbed it on sale for 9.99. I'm an impulse buyer when it comes to Steam, and I've bought a crap ton of games that I've been less than pleased with.\n\nThis fuc*ing game though. THEY DIDN'T EVEN MAKE AN ANIMATION FOR YOU TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS WHEN YOU RUN. You think its not a big deal until you play. The first 10 minutes of the game takes you through a club, that has all types of graffiti and hipster soccer moms dancing in it. During this part of the sequence, I realized that the entire game is one giant runon sentence. Like, as soon as one sentence ends, the next character IMMEDIATELY starts talking. Its so damn annoying. Why even pay voice actors to voice it when you just ruin it.\n\nNext, (also in the club, since its the only part I could bring myself to waste my life on) I danced with a blonde girl in a black dress. I felt good about myself. THEN, I SAW THE SAME BLONDE GIRL'S MODEL RECYCLED 11 TIMES WITHIN 20 FEET OF EACHOTHER. THEY AREN'T EVEN FUC*ING ZOMBIES!!!!

Why is that? Because honestly, this is probably the sh*tiest game I have played since Herdy Gerdy, back on PS2. Actually, I would prefer to play through that game than suffer through another mission in this one.\n\nTo be fair though, lets take a look at the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+You're a vampire\n\nCons:\n-Every cutscene moves extremely fast; often there is no pause between speakers, so everyone talks very quickly, AND over each other. Very hard to follow, and extremely annoying.\n\n-No vertical movement--save for a few ledges you can teleport to.\n\n-Terrible AI: Seriously, I've played older indie games with better AI than this game. And seriously, the game BRAGS about how bad the AI is. There's  tool tip which reads along the lines of "We're too lazy to make stealth hard, so some AI don't actually move; they merely stare off into the distance until you kill them.\n\n-Stealth: It's forced, but broken. Your character feels bulky, slow, and extremely cumbersome.\n\n-Combat: Or not. You can only stealth kill people. And then it's a one-hit-kill. There is no combat to speak of, no fun to be had of it.\n\n-Balanced Progression: Or not. Seriously. You unlock powers and upgrades much too quickly.\n\n\nOverall, I write this because I don't want anyone to waste their time or money on this game. It had such potential, but alas, it's just an expensive piece of sh*t.","June 24, 2014","false","2.0"," 63 of 80 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","63","80","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/225360/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","What's the most important part of a stealth game? It's not the stealth, oddly enough. It's what happens when stealth fails. Great stealth games like Thief and Dishonored give you fun and creative tools to resort to when things go badly. Conversely, some of the most reviled sequences in gaming are stealth sections where getting caught is an instant game over. Imagine how horrible it would be to make an entire game like that, one that falls apart the moment you make a mistake. Now imagine why I'm bringing this up.\n\nDARK chronicles the third-person adventures of Eric Bane, a fresh vampire who is all too ready to murder a million hobos and security guards to get his memory back. He wakes up in a club so goth it still has its own LiveJournal and is immediately persuaded into breaking, entering, and exsanguinating a whole host of people he's never met. The dialogue is distractingly awkward, both in writing and delivery, and the intro sequence is very much long enough to thoroughly embarrass itself.\n\nOnce the missions start, you job is to stealth around the levels and execute as many guards as possible. I mean, you need experience to unlock new powers, and you only get experience from killing people and progressing, so total genocide is the order of the day. You also get 4x the experience for stealth killing people, which turns every room into a puzzle of how to extinguish every life present in a way that alerts none of them. But even if you hit upon a clever enough plan, there's no guarantee you can execute it. The hit detection is absolutely appalling, your powers may or may not decide to work when you need them, the sticky cover does more harm than good, and your teleport is basically the one from Dishonored except it gets stuck on walls and sometimes just doesn't feel like doing anything.\n\nAll of these issues mean you're going to get spotted, and when that happens you might as well give up. Guards stay on alert for whole minutes, with the timer refreshing if they notice anything suspicious. Some rooms have upwards of two dozen guards that must be picked off in specific sequence, and if you are caught and killed, enjoy doing that whole production over. You can still fight back against alert guards, but the garbage hit detection means every encounter might end up with you humping air while the guard two feet away replaces your brain matter with bullets.\n\nI don't think I've ever seen a game miss the mark as hard as DARK does. I can't even pretend to be even-handed about it, because this thing straight-up fails at everything it sets out to do. The stealth is unfairly demanding, the controls are crap, the powers are unreliable, the cutscenes are laughable, and the graphics are a mess.

I've always enjoyed the dark vampire mystique and setting a lot, and stealth games are one of my favorite genres.\n\nHowever the game has lots of repetition to it, and some very simple mechanics which don't add to it's overall variety.  My character has maxed out around 6 skill trees now, and still only has a single primary attack (outside of the basic melee attack).  You sneak around, try to get into position to either kill an enemy or drink their blood without alerting others, rinse, repeat..  ad infinitum.\n\nIt does have a story, passable enough to keep you in tune with what is going on.  And it has some really nice visuals - vampire vision is one of those.  On the whole however the sum of the parts doesn't quite make a whole that is enjoyable and engaging enough to keep you entertained.  You will either be bored of repetition, detatched while watching cutscenes, or frustrated due to the difficulty changing between levels.. often from overly easy to horribly hard.  And most objects in the game world aren't something you can interact with, which gives it all a very sterile and pale feeling.\n\nCombine those elements with a save system that (on normal difficulty) only gives you two saves per area, which can be maddening if you save too early and have to end up playing a large chunk over and over due to mistakes, without benefit of a save.\n\nIf you can get it on the cheap like I did in a bundle, it might be worth looking at.  Or if you're just a complete vampire nut and need one more thing to consume (pun intended).  Otherwise buy with caution - watch a few let's play videos first.  Chances are what you see in the first ten minutes will be what you see through to the end of the game.","January 20, 2015","false","14.3"," 53 of 69 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","53","69","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/225360/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Dark stars Eric Bane, a newly turned vampire who wakes up in a night club called Sanctuary. In the world of Dark, those that are turned into vampire have to then drink the blood of their sires in order to complete their transformation. If they fail to do so, they become mindless beasts. Unfortunately for Eric, he can’t remember anything and thus has to venture out to find out who turned him into a vampire. Until the last two levels, that’s as complicated as Dark’s plot gets, which is a good thing because the dialogue is terrible but in an incredibly odd and endearing way. It inadvertently makes the game less serious and a little goofy, which I found rather refreshing. Instead of getting bloated down with too many story details or an emphasis on the dark and gritty, Dark’s plot is really only there to give you a reason to go to different locals and murder people.The heart of Dark’s gameplay is stealth. Being such, it is not a good idea to try to play it like an action game. One of my pet peeves in modern stealth games that they enable characters too much; making it too easy to run-and-gun or bash you’re way through a scenario. Dark resists this trend but does so to its own detriment. While Eric Bane may be under-powered compared to his stealthy counter-parts, he’s not powerless by any means. His powers are simply all geared toward enabling him to dispatch foes stealthily and no other way. Eric can acquire or enhance a total of 16 abilities through the course of the game.Being a vampire, Eric uses blood to perform these feats and must get up close and personal in order to replenish that blood.While most of the powers in Dark require the use of said blood, Shadow Leap does not. Shadow Leap allows Eric to teleport short distances and climb ledges. Like other abilities it can be upgrade to reduce the sound made and decrease cool down time.While Dark actively rewards players for playing stealthily and staying hidden it also contains one of the sparsest check pointing systems in recent memory. In Dark checkpoints are generally only at the beginning of each room. Rooms often contain somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 enemies while some can contain as many 20. On top of that, once enemies are alerted, they stay alerted for a quite a while, making evasion or restarting from the last checkpoint the best options. Needless to say, it can get quite frustrating. Even with experience points and despite being billed as a “stealth action RPG”, Dark is a stealth game with a progression system. It is not an RPG. While it has some of the trappings of an RPG, none of it is very meaningful.Visually Dark is an interesting game. It is not terribly impressive technically or artistically. It employs an art-style that very reminiscent of the Crackdown games. For the most part everything is drawn as it normally would be except that everything has a black outline around it.In the end, Dark is an incredibly hard game to judge. While it may be rough around the edges, Dark is the kind of game that has heart. Yes, the animations, voice-acting and checkpoints could all use a massive overhaul but I found myself enjoying its brand of stealth.","January 28, 2015","true","71.9"," 47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","47","62","7","6"

And that's what it is. It's an mediocre stealth game.\n\nThe movement is a bit clunky, vertical movement is very limited, non-stealth combat is just stealth takedowns but with enemies shooting at you, enemy dead body physics are bad. The story is probably the worst part of the game (so if story is important for you stay as far away from this game as you can).\n\nBut when it came to actually playing the game all those things didn't get in the way of me enjoying sneaking through the shadows, peaking around corners and taking down guards one by one while their buddies don't suspect a single thing.\n\nThe only bit of the game that is above average is it's visuals (if we don't count the animations since those get real bad sometimes). The environments are nice and colorful and character designs aren't all that bad either.\n\nIn the end, DARK is not a good game. But it's also not a bad game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezzzman/recommended/225360/","rezzzman","rezzzman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezzzman/","121 products in account","I felt compelled to write a review for Dark mostly because I saw so many bad reviews. From what I can tell, there are primarily two types of people that hate this game: People who paid $50 for it and stealth game enthusiasts who were looking for another stealth game to play. While stealth is the primary combat tactic in Dark, Dark should be described as a vampire game that happens to use some stealth... rather than a stealth game where you happen to be a vampire. So if you are reading this review and you don't play a lot of stealth games, but you like Vampire games, then you will probably like Dark.  Overall, this is a solid game if you can get it for $10. I would say $20, but with a 7 to 9 hour campaign, it is really hard to justify $20. Especially when you can buy Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines for $20 and it will give you 140+ hours easy. Details:\n\nSound:\n\nThe protagonist is voiced by Doug Cockle, the same guy who did Geralt of The Witcher series. Personally, I think he makes a great vampire: dark and mostly devoid of emotion. However, people looking for an emotional vampire that sparkles are not going to be happy.\n\nOverall Voice audio and acting quality were fine. (English version of the game). The main issue with the voice acting came into play when you had dialogues between the Protagonist and NPCs.\n\nThe voice audio was recorded in sentences and when they played back those sentences during the game, they didn't put in any pause between them. Thus most conversations have the NPC responding way too quickly to sound natural. Like 1 gigantic run-on sentence spoken by two different people. This could probably be fixed with a patch.\n\nGraphics:\n\nTexture wise, Dark has a comic book like styling, with a thick black border around every object and NPC.  (Borderlands style). It gives the game a retro feel. Some people like it, some people don't.\n\nThe developers put a LOT of detail into the environments. Each map is also relatively unique: High tech sky rises, Gothic Churches, Ancient Crypts, Woods, Modern Museums, Castles... . This helps keep the game from getting old. NPC models and animations are one of the games main weakness. The models feel like they are low quality, though that may be a side effect of the texture styling.\n\nPlot:\n\nThe plot, at a cliff notes level, was actually better than most games I have played. I don't know if that means Dark has a good story or if most video games simply have horrible plots. Unfortunately the presentation of the plot was not done as well as it could have been. I already talked about the dialogue issues above. Plot also arrives in the form of intercepted PDAs and Emails during missions (Deus Ex style). But the game has no means of accessing the old messages. And then there are a number of Bink video that summarize  events I would have rather played through than seen in a video.\n\nGame play:\n\nDark is a linear, mission based game. You start off the game in a night-club called Sanctuary. Sanctuary becomes your "home base", and you return to it between missions throughout the game. Within Sanctuary you find 4 other friendly vampire NPC's who give you your missions. Then you teleport off to a mission map. When the mission is over, you get a Bink video showing you a comic book like rendering of events with the protagonists voice describing what happened and then you re-appear in Sanctuary. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe game takes about 9 hours to complete (12 if you reload a lot).\n\nFor people looking for a VTMB type game, know this: While Dark pays homage to VTMB through some of its environments and background music, it is not like VTMB at all. Dark is very linear. There is no city to wonder around in and find side-tasks. The dialogues are sparse and have no impact on the games events or ending.\n\nCombat:\n\nAt the end of each map, you get an XP bonus equivalent to killing about 30 NPCs if you manage to complete the map without setting off an alarm. If someone so much as consciously registers your presence, that sets off an alarm. So there is big incentive to play stealth (and reload when you get caught), though technically you don't HAVE to. I played stealth and really enjoyed the combat. Then again, I do not normally play stealth games.\n\nOther:\n\nGame natively supports various 3D rendering modes, many of which don't even require any special hardware. Even has an option for the old school Red/Blue movie glasses.  I suspect the game is much cooler when taking advantage of this feature.\n","January 5, 2014","true","26.6"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","26","36","0","0"

Unfortunately the game is marred by some very poor voice acting by several of the npc characters as well as having a narrative that seems to meander while presenting dubious motivations for the main character to continue onward.

Taking some cues from many other games in certain ways (such as Dishonored & Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines), DARK also tries to bring its own spin on things here with vampires; especially since this game is primarily a stealth-orientated game. In some ways (such as atmosphere + art direction), it succeeds. In other ways (such as stilted writing), it doesn't succeed. For every hit (such as Doug Cockle doing a lot of voice-acting), there's also a miss (such as almost everybody else's voice-acting).\n\nIn this game, the player is Eric Bane - who has amnesia, recently got turned into a half-vampire, and must find a vampire's blood to try to become a flood-blooded vampire. If he doesn't, things get much worse i.e. he could turn into a wild vampire and lose total control of himself. This certainly isn't even the half of the story, but I don't want to really spoil too much here.\n\nTwo things this game gets right is the atmosphere + art direction. Sure, the art is not the best-looking art, on the technical side of things. But the cel-shaded look & vibrant use of colors makes up for a lot of that. A lot of the areas do have a good amount of textures in the game-world & the direction of them look quite good. The game is absolutely loaded with atmosphere, as an easy to get lost into world.\n\nThe Sanctuary is one of the stand-outs of this game, as this is the nightclub Eric frequently visits, loaded with stuff happening: people on the dance floor (and yes, you can join in) and people are everywhere doing things (making-out, chatting, having dialogue, having drinks, etc etc). The club just oozes cool and it feels like you really are there. Even the music played there - and any other original music played throughout the game, for that matter - sounds great + fits this vampire-themed game.\n\nAnother thing this game gets right, it's having Doug Cockle on board here, who did the voice for Geralt in the Witcher series. Cockle does the voice-acting for Eric Bane and delivers. While most of the voice-acting is all over the place, Cockle is the glue that holds the game together - always making the player want to press forward, to see what he says next and what happens next. His voice, his delivery, and everything is the best part of the voice-acting in this game. Sure, while a few other characters do a decent job (i.e. the voice-actresses for Rose + The Angel) - that pretty much is the end of that. Most of the other voice-acting in the game is all over the place.\n\nThe writing often feels like its right out of the Spiders camp of games (i.e. think Mars: War Logs). The story, writing + dialogue one moment can be dead-on and surprise you, being actually quite good. At other times, it's completely stilted, odd, and just doesn't look + sound natural at all. At some times, the game actually delivers something that feels like it is its own and is quite good; yet at other times it feels like its out of The Book Of Predictable Plot Elements, Twists + Turns 101.\n\nIf you're going to play this game, it's going to be very stealthy. This is a full-on stealth game - or else, you will likely get slaughtered. Most of your attacks and moves, especially early-on, are going to be melee moves. Early on, you're going to be basically sneaking up behind enemies and knocking them out or feeding on them. Most attacks here are one-hit kills, by the way. You gain experience points (XP) in the game, which you can use to upgrade and unlock abilties of your choosing. Later on, you might learn a few distance stealth kills and other cool moves. You can do a teleport move, which feels like it was in Dishonored. You can feed on certain enemies, which can replish your abilities - which sounds right out of Vampire: Bloodlines. One cool move (Shadow Grip) is you can grab an enemy from a distance and then slam them to the ground.\n\nOne problem here is the save system + difficulty system, which pretty much go hand-in-hand. This game is not an easy game, by any means - especially early on, when you don't have many abilities. Players should know this: that even on Easy, the game's tough. On Easy, you also get extra XP per kill and for what you do in the game-world (finding data in the game-world, doing the very few side-quests in the game, getting kills without being noticed, etc etc). On Easy, you have an unlimited number of Saves. On Normal (which should've been labeled Hard), the game only gives you 2 Saves. At some points, though - you might generate back another Save, once when you reach a certain point. Though, auto-saves (which won't cost a Save on you) are spaced-out quite a bit. While I didn't touch Hard, it's said that you cannot manually save period.\n\nMany players will likely start on Normal (like you should, in most games). But in this game - especially for a first-time run through, you're better off going with Easy. It's unfortunate that the terms of this game when selecting difficulty are not explained up-front and out-right, unlike say other stealth games like Hitman: Absolution. Luckily, you can change the difficulty while in-game, if need be. I spent around 17 hours with game, but it probably should've been anywhere from 7-10 hours - since I began on Normal, yet somewhere in the middle of the game switched over to Easy because what was a hard game was getting insanely hard.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, DARK delivers an experience that is all over the place. Its execution isn't always the best at times, yet other times it's down-right great. Sometimes certain elements deliver, yet at other times that same element doesn't. DARK is a game that I wanted to utterly love because of its cool premise of a stealth-based game with vampires + its excellent atmosphere, but it would up as a disappointment because of other things (i.e. all over the place voice-acting; some stilted dialogue + writing; and some not-so-good voice-acting).\n\nIts consistently great art direction, atmosphere + music are worth experiencing alone, if you can find the game on sale dirt-cheap somewhere. But as it stands at its $40 MSRP currently on Steam, I can't recommend DARK at that price.\n\nFinal Grade = C-.","January 27, 2015","false","17.1"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","19","27","2","1"

This is a stealther game and its good for that. Yes, graphic isnt like in deus ex but its not bad at all. Those who wrote negative review only because of that, well, they should head to borderlands and write negative review aswell then.\n\nIn this game you need stealth and kill your enemies silently, loud mission not an option at all, because you dont have weapons, items or anything. The game is all about STEALTH. Yes, vampires should be able to beat humans in face to face aswell, but why is it issue that others think, that vampires could be very vulnerable aswell?\n\nThis game isnt easy, some areas crowded with enemies, you need be careful, you need to think and be patient.\n\nThe game isnt flawless, but definetly underrated and got too much hate. Dragging bodies sometimes very flawed. The game start to be easy, then in first chapter gets to be hard at siege map and in second chapter still very hard. After that, well, you should have unlocked many abilities by that time.... so its gets easier and faster. Still, if you, dear review reader, like games where you need hide and neutralize enemies without making any noise, then you should try this game. BUT! the game isnt that long, perhaps a good 8-12 hours or a bit more if you try on harder difficulties. I definetly recommend the game, but not for the price they want to sell for.

The product let you play a stealth game as a vampire. Interesting, that change a bit of the classic soldiers or spies.\nYou "wake up" in a night club without any memories, and you met peoples explain you you're a vampire. But the guy who turned you made the job wrong : you're half vampire and you have to catch your creator to become a real vampire or you'll turn into ghoul. Classic, you probably already seen or read something like that before. But why not after all. The problems are the game itself. You need few things to make a good stealth game : AI, level design and good balance in difficulty. All 3 are missed. You need to guess what the developers want you to make, in a perfect timing if you don't want to be spotted. It's funny because in the introduction you avoid bullets naturally, but in the game 3 of them will kill you. So, if you're spotted, you'll die. You better restart from the last checkpoint, faster.\nYou can unlock few powers, your new vampire skills. The problem is sometimes you need a specific power to pass. What about if you don't unlock that power ? You'll be spotted of course. Same for that stupid wallhack : you can view where your ennemies are, but can't know if there is a wall or something to hide. So often you go ahead and get in front of a gurad. Guess what ? Yeah, spotted, killed, restarting once again.\nI spend two hours of playing. I couldn't finish the first level.

Unfortunately those are the only positive remark I could give.\n\nThe voice acting, gameplay, soundtrack and story are terrible with an underused skill system. This game had so much potential but I think most of the budget went into graphics development. The game is so slow and repetitive I had to use cheat (YES! CHEAT) to speed things up.\n\nThis game is more like a puzzle genre game rather than stealth. You basically travel from one area to another trying to figure out how to proceed to the next (which is the easier way out) or up the ante by slaughtering everyone.\n\nPlot in this game was actually okay as I was motivated to complete the game just to see the ending, but the way the game presents the story with the bland and emotionless voice and acting with the frustrating repetitive gameplay slowly kills off my interest.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who really enjoys a challenging yet simplistic stealth game, this could really do you good. Being the kind of person that enjoys more diversified and options of gameplay with immersive story I cannot really recommend it.\n\nAnother thing that really grind my gears is the physics when you drag a body. Taking corners, moving up stairs and pulling bodies off balconies may sometimes causes the bodies to get stuck and expose them. When killing enemies beside corridors will automatically push them down and this will again easily expose them.","January 26","false","6.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","1"

Only get it if it is 50% or more off. It is very short and the story is sub-par. DARK's story suffers plot holes everywhere. (sort of spoiler) One example being that Eric was turned into vampire by having all the blood drain from him. Yet through the course of the game I probably drain 50+ enemies and they did not turn into vampires. As the gameplay element is entirely stealth.This is makes the game very challenging and the only reason I played through to the end. (spoilerish) The final boss fight is more like you just running around trying not to die before a big friendly button appears that you push and win. It is a very anticlimatic and terrible ending. The only two reasons I would recommend this game is if you have absolutely run out of games to play and there is a steam sale on; The second reason is the difficulty, clearing a room while remaining undetected is a very rewarding feeling. Mostly because of how many bloody time you have relaoded a save file.","December 18, 2013","false","19.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

AI that sometimes doesn't do what it's meant to (an objective is being watched, you fail if you are seen, and they won't walk away as designed consistently etc) I've also experienced numerous technical glitches like crashes and audio freezing entirely for no reason that simply requires additional restarts. The voice acting is unfortunately as bad as the actual written lines are. There are words that are misused entirely in fact... Makes listening to it difficult and worse paying attention to the characters and story difficult.\n\nThe other problem with the narrative is this game right off the bat relies on the "Sorry Mario, the Princess is in another castle," line that I was tired of by the 3rd game of that same series. At least Mario is endearing... This is just tough.\n\nOn the bright side, the powers are cool ideas and work relatively effectively when everything is going smoothly. The leveling system is basically what you find in Deus Ex: HR in so you earn experience to get points which are spent in a square grid tree of upgrades. There are 3 trees, but only 1 has more than 4 basic abilities in it. Each does have numerous upgrades though which aid in the ease of gameplay significantly. This is helpful because, this game is actually quite challenging. Early on you are offered little strengths against the massive waves of enemies you face, making it easy to be seen and get killed. Over time, overcoming the obstacles becomes much easier in general, however the game at times likes to strip away the strength you have gained in favor of rechallenging you.\n\nAll in all due to the series of bugs, poor dialogue and story, and gameplay that only works sometimes, I wouldn't really recommend DARK to anyone but the most intrepid of collectors of vampire based stealth/action genre.","December 14, 2013","false","5.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

To the point it borrows heavily in both premise and gameplay.\n\nBloodlines, while buggy and shipped too early, is arguably one of the greatest shooty RPGs ever, along with Deus Ex. It featured a deeply woven narrative, excellent writing, strong characters, intrigue and politics - all dark themes with just the right amount of black comedy.\nThere was a heavy emphasis on character customisation allowing for numerous solutions and pathways, from combat to stealth to social interaction.\n\nDARK is essentially the stealthy bits of VTM:B made into a full game - and it doesn't quite work.\nIt's a serviceable stealth game, many of the powers aid strongly with traversing and avoiding enemy line of site, and there's some "updates" to the mechanics of VTM:B that tailor it heavily in this fashion, eg the Auspex ability in DARK blows Bloodline's out of the water.\n\nThere's even a Dishonored-style teleport jump to close in on enemies and get around their line of site, and all attacks from stealth are a 1-hit-kill.\n\nBut without the "other options" of social, straight combat, etc that VTM:B had, there's a lot of redundancy in the playstyle and this is especially typified in the skill tree.\n\nAn example - for the same investment of experience points, you can have an ability that insta-kills an enemy and hides the body. Or that puts the enemy temporarily to sleep.\nUnlike VTM:B there's no in-game benefit for sparing lives, and greater experience rewards are earned from killing enemies, especially unalerted enemies. So why take the power that lets you sneak up on an enemy to kill them, when you can just kill them outright, stealthily, AND hide the body?\n\nLittle lack-of-thought moments like this are rife through the game and many of the stealth-sections are arduous guard-watching. Not a lot of thought or planning, just wait the seconds until the guard turns his back and snap his neck before continuing.\n\nThe voice acting's terrible, the plot is weak, the characters are one note and the general format is borrowed so heavily from VTM:B that it might as well not be its own game but a mod and collection of maps.\n\nOn the positive, the art-style's nice and overall the stylized toon-shader gives the whole thing a comic-book feeling, and when the stealth works, it really does work, it just so rarely works.\n\nReally, it isn't a bad game, it's just that there's better out there. Play through VTM:B as a Nosferatu instead and get a better game experience overall.","May 9, 2014","false","31.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Like many of what other reviewers said, this game fails on the stealth department. That's a shame because that is what this game is supposed to be (technically, it has some RPG elements, but it certainly is not an action game because you can't kick/punch/beat the living hell out of an opponent). The enemy AI is too smart; what I mean is that they seem to know where you are even after you hide in the shadows. Also, many of the AI simply stand next to the exit, so you have no choice but to take them out. Also, one of the characters says that they wouldn't be able to shoot anything from 10 feet away, yet every time the security guards shoot at me, they are 100% accurate. When 3 or more converge on you, you're pretty much done for. This makes the game more frustrating and is nothing more than a trial-and-error type of game. It should've taken more notes from a game like Splinter Cell if they wanted to get the stealth portion right.","February 6","false","2.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The opening scene was alright, and it started out really nice, but then the game quickly got out of hand and became this disaster of gameplay. In the very beginning, they tell you,\n\n"Your a vampire, you can do cool stuff."\n\nCool, and all the powers are neat, and the concept is interesting. But the story itself conters itself in everyway, they tell you that the human race does not know of the vampires and doesn't know anything about them! And they'd like to keep it that way they claim. But the second you start the first mission, and get into the combat, it's all single button one click one kill combat, and what's worse, when they discover a body, this is BEFORE any form of vampire activity. Or before witnessing the main character use any powers. Is that they immediately scream,\n\n"That blood-suckin' vampire is around here!"\n\nWait.. How did they know about vampires, and why would they fully believe it was a vampire..? They break the story-line completely and utterly. I could get over the poor graphics and semi decent comabt, but the story breaking itself over itself. That.. I cannot stand.

The "impressive" cel shaded graphics noted on the store page are not impressive at all, they're poor at best.  Borderlands 1 and 2 did them right (ish).

I bought it while it was on sale and I regret that. I wish I could get a refund for it. The game mechanics are awful, the dialogue is crap, the narration is even worse. The stealth aspect of it is so broken. I'm hunched next to a pillar that is shaped so I am clearly visible, but the guards don't notice me. Sometimes it's the other way around. I'm hidden, crouched, behind a desk out of sight, yet they still know exactly where I am. There's no jumping. The shadow leap is ♥♥♥♥. Can't use it over a stair ledge.

I was realy looking forward to play this game, but alas I was deeply disapointed. I liked the comic style grafics, but thats about the only thing I liked. I've played loads of stealth games, the whole Splinter Cell series, all parts of Thief, Dishonered, Vampire the Masquerade, Deus Ex (all), several Hitman, so I've got a bit of experience in the genre. Dark was the worst I've ever tried my hands on. Balancing is non existence. The character is so weak, that (at least on standard difficulty) to be spotted is to die. The Guards sometimes spot you even though you are nowhere near them and not moving at all. Worst of all you can't save but have to reach checkpoints for automatic saving. Especially the end parts of a level are extremly frusttrating. You evaded literally hordes of guards, then one spots you whithout cause, at once all know where you are and invariably you die. And you have to replay the last 30 to 45 minutes again. Do that 10 to 15 times and maybe you reach the next enfuriating level. So if your frustration threshhold is extremly high and you really want to sink your teeth into a game that keeps on frustrating you without reason, than I can really recommend the game. Otherwise I recommend any of the above mentioned titels.","September 7, 2014","false","3.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Its strongest point is probably something many players overlooked due to the steep learning curve:\n\nPros:\n+ The sense of achievement the player gains from beating tough areas and reaching a save point is amazing and the game's strongest point. This only comes into effect on hard difficulty and when playing the way the game wants you to play, namely as a pure stealth game.\n+ Feel truly like a very powerful vampire.\n+ Story with twists and turns.\n+ Aesthetics, environmental level design and atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n- Weak universe that is not particularly fleshed out or believably developed.\n- Very linear, hardly any sidequests.\n- Bugs, mainly relating to the AI, the ragdoll physics of the enemy bodies and the display of collectible PDAs.\n- Easy difficulty and openly fighting enemies makes the flaws in the AI very easily apparent and makes the game very easy.\n- Unfair learning curve.\n- Occasionally feel like a vampire with two left feet.\n\nIn general, DARK would have benefitted from larger hubs to flesh out the world and characters, making it more like Deus Ex and intensifying its atmosphere. The first level is also disproportionately hard, since you have very few tools at your disposal and there are too many enemies, reversing the learning curve in a rather painful way.","August 17, 2014","true","26.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I was picturing a "Vampire: Masquerede" kind of game with modern visuals and lots of features, but what I found instead is...\n\nA linear vampire-themed Deus-Ex-Like stealth game with clumsy animations, poor dialogs and dull main story. Yeah, there are couple of cool features in this game, but what is the point if you can't use any weapon at all besides your skills for silent takedowns only? No alternative routes on stages, just follow the bread-crumbs to get from point A to point B.\n\nOnce I got spotted by the stairs by a group of guards "Oh, snap! I am dead", I though... But, they obediently came 1 by 1 for a silent takedowns to me. "Oh snap, he just came out of cover and knocked out the guy we sent after him... My turn, I want to check the stairs". So... AI isn't quite a top-notch mastermind, which ruins the game as well.\n\nAnd the game itself is pretty short. So, I would not reccomend it to you, guys.

I AM playing these games, I love MineCraft, but do not say DARK has bad graphics, you have no idea what you are talking about, you stupid.\nThe graphics are NOT great, not even good. But they are so bad that you don't want to play the game. At least if you are interested in games because of the mechanisms, not just because of the screenshots.\n\n- whine: the Game is too short\nI needed 12 hours for a playthrough on easy with lots of save/loads. Of course I wanted to get through most rooms without alarms and I wanted to kill as many of the enemies as possible. That is not too short.\n\nThese were the things I saw in the forum I just think you guys who say these things are stupid. Sorry.\nAehm, no, not sorry.\n\nNow about the game:\n\nYou just became a vampire, you have no idea how. You have no idea about your lost life but the night club you "awake" in is full of friendly vampires which will try to help you. And they are good looking too.\n\nYou will be using your powers as a vampire all the time.\nThere three kinds of powers.\n- Abilities which you can use all the time with cooldowns, you can upgrade them, one ability gives you blood\n- Skills/Spells which use blood\n- passive abilities which are active all the time\n\nThe abilties are pretty cool by themselves, teleporting, vampiric view, blood drinking whatever.\nYou can just play a very large part of the game without spells if you wish to.\nI cleaned whole areas only with crouching, teleporting and killing silently.\nAvoid the guards, kill them, drag the bodies to the corners.\nIt is like the game Commandos sometimes.\nYou observe the pattern of the guards, then you start killing them.\n\nBut if you start using spells, then the game starts to get different.\nYou can go totally different ways.\nConfuse the target, go there and drink its blood?\nRemote kill a guard and vanish its body at the same time?\nTeleport behind an enemy and kill him with one spell?\nCreate a distraction somewhere so you can a new situation and can kill certain guards more easily? Or just slip through?\n\nThis game is fun if you play it as stealth character.\nI imagine, it is fun too, if you play it as fight character. But I did not really try that.\n\nThe story is ok enough, the sounds are ok enough, the graphics are ok enough and the killing is fun.\n\nIf you can get the game for a discount, you might love it.\nI regret to say, that 45 Euros (current price on 2014-11-01) is too much.\n\nThe game is good, but please get it for cheap. Otherwise you will be expecting too much from it.\nBut if you like stealth games (real stealth games, not like in Skyrim or the like) then this game is a must.\n\nThe rooms are kind of ... repeating, no idea why it seems that way to me. There are some different levels, but after a while I just thought: next copy-paste room, which is not correct, because the rooms are all different and nice to look at.\n\nIt is just... don't know, perhaps the game was too long for me?\n\nAgain: ok to good game, get it, but not for 45 Euros!\n\nShort: Clean the level from enemies or just get to the exit, it depends on the mission.

I did like the art style, but the models and their interactions didnt always mesh correctly. For example one of the bosses is cutting up a body with a bone saw, but rather than the saw actually touching the body, it was floating a good foot above it. However the game has a borderlands kind of feel to the art style and i found it quite fitting for the type of game it is.\n\nGameplay: This game was designed first and foremost as a stealth game, when you finish an area without being spotted you got a MASSIVE xp boost, which allowed me to finish out the skill tree before i finished the game. While that does take out some of the "gameplay path" structure of games like this, it didnt detract from the gameplay; merely gave you more stuff to work with as you played more. On the nore of gameplay, i saw a review that said that while the game was a stealth game that you could bruteforce your way through the game. While this is true for the first 1/3 of the game, newer units that are introduced into the game prevent you from doing that and require you to be stealthy about your approach. But remember, this game is FIRST and FOREMOST a stealth game, play it as one. This also rings true for those people who complained that there was no CQB for your character, Its a stealth game... many people have been too babied by games like assasins creed, which allow you to fight off 6+ people at the same time and come out without taking any damage.\n\nStory: Here i do have to say the story is kind of weak, it doesnt do a good job of fleshing out the intention of the story up until the very end. The motives for moving from area to area are flimsy "oh we found this guy" then "well maybe this guy???" However the story arc as a whole does come together quite nicely, though the final boss totally breaks the idea of a stealth game...\n\nTL;DR: IF and ONLY IF you actually enjoy a challenge where you ACTUALLY try and stealth the whole game, then this game is a must have (play it on hard!), because it breaks the tedium of the current market of stealth games being "stealth until you mess up then go beastmode on them instead"","February 5, 2015","true","29.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I picked it up on one of the sales for like 50% off or something, and I got my money's worth from it. It is on the short side, and if you play it well, you get enough skill points to have all the skills by the time you get to the last level or two, so you don't HAVE to pick and choose what to develop-- just the order in which you want to play with them.\n\nThat said, some of the animations were a bit weird, the story wasn't a blockbuster or award winner, the voice acting for many of the characters was fairly cheesy-- not the voice acting itself, but the way it felt when spliced together with the other characters, and the soundtrack was a bit repetetive. Those were the biggest detractors for me. The gameplay itself wasn't terrible, and I enjoyed playing it through even though it was fairly short.\n\nI'd say if it seems like an interesting game to you and you can pick it up for $20 or so, give it a try. I've played A LOT of worse games, and some of them had higher critic scores than this one too. I think this one had an overly harsh critical response. It's not that bad, and it was a pretty sweet game conceptually-- it was kind of like Mirror's Edge in terms of cool concepts that aren't quite perfectly executed. I don't feel like my money was wasted on it, and I may even play through it again just to try a few different strategies with it. If it were truly awful, I'd never feel that way.","December 7, 2013","true","28.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's the gentle stealth game, like those mini stealth runs in LoZ that require no challenge at all. Then there's Skyrim stealth, which is ludicrous and meh. Then there's Dishonored stealth, where enemies actually react and show off how a person reacts to stealth, and pay attention to things. And then there's DARK.\n\nThis game's stealth is INCREDIBLY difficult! And enjoyable. DARK is a challenging stealth game, putting you into the role of a vampire (you do not sparkle) trying to find his creator so he doesn't end up a mindless ghoul. The AI is well done; they follow good pathways and block exits normally, and during hostile moments they wander, and work well together. They cover each other. THEY GIVE COVER!\n\nOverall, worth the buy, but only if you enjoy stealth games.

Where do I start.\n\nunskippable, long, dialogue. Many, many lines of boring, cheesy text....\n\nforced to push through a hobblingly slow character, boring dialogue, run-here-run-there gopher nonsense that you don't care about, all without getting to see if you will like the stealth mechanics or not, for about 20 minutes.\n\nVery, very poorly optimized. I had to nerf the graphics settings into the ground in order for this sham to not melt my gpu. Granted my gpu is old and kind of sucky, but the level of graphics were no where NEAR good enough to justify the massive system resources being used. However, I can say that even at low settings, the graphics looked almost exactly the same as on high.\n\nThe voice acting is horrible... some of the worst...\n\nThe voice acting in this game seems like a Saturday Night Live sketch making fun of bad voice acting. It's more humorous than real. The sad part is it isnt charmingly bad, it's just bad. And the characters seem boring, unoriginal tropes, and unrealistic too. When have you ever known an owner of a club to be like 24 years old? Being a vampire game doesnt mean you have to make EVERYTHING outside of believeability. How about street bums, who all pack automatic handguns... who always keep them in their hands... who try to mug you by asking for spare change? wtf? This game feels like it was written by a 9 year old who thinks they know what the world is like, but is way off.\n\nHave these people ever been in a real night club? You don't talk in nightclubs; if you need to communicate you shout right into the persons ear, and usually have to repeat it 3 times. Thankfully in this game, the club music automatically goes to half volume when you talk. Lol. Yea how immersion breaking is that. And then they just tell you they dont have time to talk anyway.\n\nEverything in this game just wants to waste your time and not move forward. I'm sure things happen later but... I'm not going to stick around to see what they are.\n\n\nDESPITE ALL THIS, I waited to see how the stealth would be. And the first thing they tell you is "If you enter an opponent's field of vision, your vampiric powers will prevent him from noticing you immediately"\n..............this has to be the stupidest 'stealth' mechanic I ever heard of. So if they see you, they dont see you for a few seconds?   Again... a 9 year old wrote this game. And it shows.\n\nThe game has very bad presentation, and wishy-washy stealth mechanics that make you achieve no real stealth. It's just nothing. The characters suck, the optimization sucks, and there is so much boring text.\n\nI really think this is not worth anyone's time. I'm glad I got this in a bundle and didn't pay much for it.

ANYWAYS.\n\nI play Stealth given any opportunity when I can.  I love using Stealth in any game.  So, in case any of you are big steath fans, let me say, THIS IS NOT A STEALTH BASED GAME.  The focus is not actually on the Stealth elements, but rather on the powers you get as a Vampire.\n\nYou receive points to level up various passive and active powers.  I, loving to use stealth like I do, focused on all the powers that make you more stealthy, my reasoning being that it is a stealth game.  Don't do it.  The stealth mechanics are sloppy.\n\nPlease, allow me to cite some bad things about this game.  It's a bad PC port, which is something I'm personally getting tired of seeing.  You can't skip cinematics.  So for those of you who want to be Stealth purists, as I do, plan on seeing all the same cinematics a dozen times when it just sets you up to die.  Alerting anyone at all eliminates your stealth bonus at the end of a map - so if you wait around a corner to ambush someone (waiting for them to round a corner, popping out and making a new corpse), you screw yourself out of more experience.  They give you the option of hiding bodies, but it's usually not an issue, as they leave you with no good place to hide them unless you want to completely break up the game flow and drag them backwards for half an hour.  The list can go on, but this is a long paragraph already.\n\nI'm not saying this isn't a decent game, but don't buy it expecting awesome stealth game play.  It may be decent when you use a mix of straight combat and stealth (NOT WHAT IT ADVERTISES), but I don't know.  I got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off listening to Eric Bane (♥♥♥♥ your name) rip off the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Max Payne line about 15 times and promptly lit my house on fire to destroy my computer.\n\nIf you want good stealth game play I recommend Arkham City, Far Cry 3 (really) and Skyrim with or without mods.  Just don't waste 40 dollars on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Get a better game.\n\nOr 2 reasonably priced handjobs.","July 3, 2013","true","4.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baenlynn/recommended/225360/","baenlynn","Bænlynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baenlynn/","298 products in account","Dark, what can I say about Dark? Possibly the most annoying and enticing stealth gamplay I've played since Deus Ex. Make of that what you will. Dark is not polished, Dark is not deep, Dark aspires to one day have the writing quality of a b-grade 80's action movie, But Dark does actually manage to do stealth halfway decent in its own way. But that way is definitely not for everyone. . .\n\nI bought Dark on Steam because it was on sale, and THEN I heard what people were saying about it, oh WHY do I bother to listen? But the interesting thing about the reviews were the comparisons to Thief and Deus Ex, and how Dark falls short, being frustrating, boring and repetitive. I'm sorry? frustrating, boring and repetitive? That pretty much describes my experience of those two games, yet I somehow managed to finish them despite spending hours trying and failing to stay stealthy. Still, the comparisons are apt, I was five minutes into the game, and I found myself thinking: 'okay the story and voice acting are predictable as heck, but why do I feel like I'm playing Deus-Ex?' Granted, Dark will never be either of those shining jewels of adolescent nostalgia that many of us remember as 'Deus Ex' or 'Thief', but saying it falls short merely because it is difficult just reads like nostalgia bias to me.\n\nLet me digress for a moment by leaping sideways into a comparison... When Rise of the Triad recently got a reboot, what emerged from the rebooting process was a graphical update with all the misshapen heart, and twisted soul of the original: lame jokes, drug references and all. Yet what I was left with, was the sense that a perfect recreation of my schoolday afternoons in a modern graphical engine laid bare just how small and easily entertained my 10-year-old mind was. In much the same way, Dark's gameplay calls to mind the stealth FPS games of the late 90's and early 00's: Thief, Deus Ex, Hit Man, etc. but this time in a good way. Clearly I've lost 80% of the audience right off the bat with that one, but nostalgia is a funny thing...\n\nYou see. I've save scummed my way through the first two missions, carefully rationing out my two saves per area, stealth-killing my way through enemies, and resetting time and time again. I have rage quit at least two dozen times and taken seven hours of real time to get through four hours of gameplay. But at no point in all my failed attempts at silently taking down a couple-hundred armed mooks have I been able to honestly say: 'that one was the game's fault.' and that's what keeps me coming back, that's the thing that reminds me of Deus Ex (at least, how I played it). I'm not being coddled, in fact I'm being threatened with deadly weapons, but Dark neither blames me for failure nor rubs my face in it when it beats me again and again and again. Success in Dark is its own reward, and failure is a learning experience.\n\nIn this day and age of short attention spans and shorter patience, Dark IS frustrating and repetitive, because you will be frustrated at how often you're repeating the same sequence over and over and over. But that is the lot with any true Stealth game: if you screw up prepeare to reload. This is a major reason why any game that involves stealth as a mechanic these days refers to itself as having 'stealth elements' because it will give you a way to fight your way out of the pickles you'll get yourself into. But as soon as you give a stealth game a 'violence parachute' then stealth immediately takes a second seat to the alternative. Why? because it's easier.\n\nI honestly haven't had a problem racking up XP, nor have I had an issue with the controlls, but I think that Dark is made for a particular style of play, and a certain kind of player. That player is definitely me and the play style is 'creeping death': Slowly and painstakingly working your way from room to room picking off all the enemies one at a time. As a stealth action game Dark is also a puzzle room game probably MORE of a puzzle room game than a Stealth action game. Only all the puzzle elements are also ambulatory and packing automatic weapons and supernatural powers. When taken in this context and played in this manner, Dark is actually FUN. The goal of each little segment of level is not to simply get to the next one, the goal is to cut a hole into the web of mutual surveillence the guards are wrapped up in. Isolating and neutralising as you go until you can sneak on through, and it IS possible.\n\nI think however, that there is a better comparison to be made for Dark, the game I am reminded of is even older than Deus Ex, Older than Thief. That game is Robot Rooms. I don't know if obscure shareware games for win 3.1 needed rebooting, but there it is.\n\nIf you don't like puzzle games, or if your idea of stealth is more in the vein of Assassin's Creed or Dishonored, Dark is not for you. If you expect AAA voice acting and a complex, deep storyline, Dark is not for you. If however you're something of a completionist, if you're a patient and methodical hunter in FPS games, leaving nothing but corpses with surprised looks on their faces behind you, and if you enjoy a challenge, then you might just like Dark.","December 4, 2013","true","11.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

I finally bought it coming off my Castlevania: LoS high.  I should of not listened to myself on this one.  The faults in this game overexceeds the playablity unfortunately.  I got this game on a great xmas sale, but still feel like I shouldn't have paid over $5 for it.  First off, lets start with the graffics which appear out of date and poorly mocapped for a game that came out this year.  You add the extremely poor voice acting and this game just seems very 'cheap'.  And believe it or not, that's not the worst parts of the game!  The difficulty is unbalanced with the AI (even tho they are just humans) overpowering you very quickly and unfairly.  But get this, even though your a 'powerful' vampire, YOU CAN'T EVEN ATTACK THEM.  Once spotted you're pretty much dead and then you have to start the section of the level over again, killing the 15 humans you've worked so hard to kill OVER AGAIN.  Which makes it even worst is the controls for this game which are loose and clunky, some moves actually having no use at all.  If you spent your last once of money to buy this game and are stuck with it, then you've got to have the patience of a monk to play it.  I wanted to compare this game to Tenchu which I grew up loving as a stealth ninja series, but even in Tenchu you were able to attack once spotted and the AI wasn't so 'cheezy' and overwelming.  The only good things I can say about this game is that the power ups are very interesting and make the game 'slightly' fun, but it's definitely not enough to make it not 'suck'.  <---C'mon you knew that was coming lol.\n\nIf you want to play a 'newborn vampire' game, I would recommend Vampire Masquerade: Bloodlines instead of this.  Even though VM:B is much older it has a better story, character options, choices, adventures, playablity......let's just say that it's an all around better newborn vampire game than this mediocre attempt.","December 10, 2013","false","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It couldn't hit the ground running like a game should. There are nowhere near enough stealth/vampire games. There are so many stealth games now, but the vampire concept is so underplayed, and when mixed with stealth I figured how could it be bad? I loved Duke Nukem Forever and that had god awful reviews, sometimes games are just in bad hands. Right?\n\nWrong:\n\nWell, this game is garbage- for its price. I still regret buying it but just because I am not a huge fan of stealth (I like some games and figured to give it a shot), but let me tell you, it still is enjoyable. If you are willing to put up with:\n\n-Laughable cutscenes\n-Sad dialogue\n-Shaky controls (at certain times, not often)\n\nand you love:\n\n-The vampire concept\n-Stealth games\n\nYou really shouldn't be too dissapointed. I picked it up for 7.99 which I still feel was a little expensive for the game, but if it is on sale, and you're okay with what I listed above, it really isn't that half bad. It just falls short is all. That's it.\n\nThe story is played out well, the level design is nice, there are black outlines around the graphics (which for some reason I love like in Borderlands), and the AI isn't horrible. It doesn't feel like a bad indie title, but it doesn't feel like anything that should've been released so soon. It just feels unfinished. If someone could fix the game, that'd be amazing.\n\nLet me tell you though- if this game shows a sequel with everything improved, I can see it doing extremely well. And "DARK" almost hits that. Minor flaws, fun game.\n\nTL;DR: If you love stealth games, and want to try the underplayed vampire concept, pick this game up ON SALE. It's merely unfinished, but still fun.\n\n6/10 would bang.","August 16, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is extremely linear, except for the end, which is something I hate in a game. The story isn't that great either, and is pretty much a mix of everything I hate about modern fantasy. All you do is hunt down one vampire after another, fighting the same generic guards every time. The only other enemies are these zombie things which aren't much different. It is one of the most repetetive games I've ever played. Some of the maps are admittedly pretty cool and different, but still boring to play. The addition of an RPG-like system is nice, but not enough to redeem this game. 4.5/10\nJust get Half Life complete instead. If you already have that than get Skyrim.

Some of the levels are interesting and with some challenge to them.\n\nThe latest annoyance that made me actually bother to review this very average game is the latest mandatory "patch" which doesn't seem to actually fix any of the game's many bugs.   Instead, it just ads a splash screen ad for Tropico3 that requires me to click past it to play the game and asks me to register for their mailing list.    Seeing as I paid for this game already, I don't think I should have to deal with advertising, much less intrusive advertising (you have to take action to get past it, and it comes up every time the game fires up).   I had intended to come back and play it, but now I think I'll just uninstall it.

While the visual design is quite good and the sound handles it part for the atmosphere well, the overall graphic and animation quality is bad. The storytelling is slow and not really engaging. NPC's are very generic and the voice acting crew sound bored and uninspired most of the time. A lack of extra xp for avoiding enemies hurts and some more skill variety would have done the game good. Do not belive the trailer with its so called many options. The controls are unprecise as well. Some things like a force choke grab are fun for a while, but the game gets repetetive very quickly with it's really bad AI, tons of enemies you MUST kill and 1 sided approaches. Maybe, if your a vampire nut and can look past the iffy controls, technical difficulties and lack of options, you can enjoy the game. 5/10","July 5, 2013","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Final boss and tadaa. The End. The ingame counter says ~5 hours. I know I've spent ~3 more hours failing and trying again to get 100% objectives and XP.\n\nThe game was surprisingly hard in the beginning yet way too easy towards the end. I felt like level design and difficulty were pretty much the same during whole game which leads to a problem as you lack some vital skills and abilities to get through the first missions. By the end of the game you should have unlocked all the abilities but won't have had time to try them all which is a shame.\n\nThe non existant melee combat system makes "boss fights" simply ridiculous and also forces you into one single play style. I do enjoy the sneaky way. But I sometimes found myself willing to rush into the pack of soldiers and slice the heck out of em. Not possible (okay for the rushing part it "sort of" is). Such a short story brings along other issues as for example poor lead character personalities. You won't miss them at all and you'll also forget about the game pretty quickly.\n\nTo sum this up, IF you :\n- Are not fond of melee combat\n- Like the Vampire - Bloodlines kind of story and atmosphere\n- Have patience for sale, lots of it\n- YET don't want to spend too many hours on the game\n- Don't have high expectations\n\nThen you might wanna give it a try.\nBut then again, wait for Steam Sales.

You start of as Aiden we got turned in to a vampire and now needs to go on an "epic" quest to save his own life. Yeah I wonder where we've seen something like that before,... Anyway either he is the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the world or he just doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about his sudden transformation.\n\nWell the story is stupid and barely worth telling so let's focus on gameplay for a second. IT'S BROKEN!!! Stealth is hard as hell, becausse if just anyone knows your there they can summon what seems to be an endless flow of back up. Further if you want to take some one out it takes like half a second to lock on your target, but thet will shoot you as soon as they spot you. The biggest reason everything feels broken is when the enemy attacks you heads on. You got now long range weapons so, you will meet them at some point, aim with the cursor, wait ages before the target becomes purple and than execute wat must be the biggest ♥♥♥♥ up in the history of animation. You jump toward the target and either knock em down with one rediculous blow or teleport in front of them, do the slowest backflip ever and kick them while doing so.But make sure you killed everyone in the damn room, becausse otherwise you can start all over again after a couple of seconds.\n\nAnd that's not even everything, the game akes back from graphics like borderlands and team fortress, but you will never get the feeling that they do so because of an apparant reason. It just feels like they where not capable of delivering decent graphics ad textures, so everything will look pretty much the same. And the environments, while their is definetly a lot of work invested in them are barely axplorable. The movements are to stiff, you can't jump and you need to stay in cover so most of the time you will just be following the most apparent path.\n\nDARK is in no aspects a good game, if I had the option I would have asked my money back bacause tha game is broken.       Every moment you spend in the game you will feel like it's released months to early. It's a shame because it definetly had some potential, but they just rushed it, and the result is a below avarage game that just challenges you not to lose your patience while playing. But trust me you will.","January 15, 2015","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I, myself, like this game but having to be constantly aware and in stealth mode slightly distresses me as I don't want to have to keep alert all throughout the game, I want some relaxing missions. This game most definitely is not for the people who get impatient a lot as this is a game that requires a lot of this, However I find this to be a good game, although I wouldn't personally recommend this game to my friends seeing as we aren't the type to play these games (we're quite impatient). However I would recommend this to people on Steam who like stealthy, vampire games for the more patient people.

A really, really *bad* story with dialog that will leave you cringing. And the ending is simply atrocious. Fortunately, it is just an excuse for you to  use and develop your vampire powers, which are pretty cool. Kill from a distance, teleport around, blend into the shadows, x-ray vision, confuse and a fair bit of other nifty things makes playing the game fun. You definitely feel superior to those lowly humans ... until you make a mistake and they fill you full of holes.\n\nThe game mechanics work except that the default behavior is 'drag a corpse' rather than 'kill' and if you try to kill someone that is standing on a corpse you ... well, its goes badly. The camera will also get confused on occasion and that goes badly too.  There is some tactics involved as the guards have patrol routes and killing them unobserved involves assaulting them at exactly the right time. If they catch you, the whole zone will go hostile for a while and try to track you down. Mostly, its not too hard keep out of sight until the alarm resets, and you can even use that hostile time to draw entrenched guards out so you can kill them. There is bonus XP given for not raising an alarm though, and its cooler anyway to get through as a ghost. Lastly, you always get a marker on the HUD that tells you where you have to go so you can't really get lost. But finding the path there can be tricky.\n\nThe game saves automatically but you do get two manual saves per section and that gives a sense that death is to be avoided without being chained to developer checkpoints. A blessing, but you can still see the cutscenes a few too many times until you figure out the path.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the cutscenes on entering a new zone can leave you vulnerable and sometimes you have to be quick or you're immediately dead. They will even walk you back to where you should have gone if you start without them. You also have to learn how to kill some special guys though trial and error and the technique can be finicky. You die a few times there too.\n\nNot a whole lot of replayability as you end up with almost all the powers anyway but thing can go a lot easier if you pick the right powers early in the game and that can be worth an additional run-though.  All in all, a fun diversion for some 15 hours and a decent vampire game as long as you can ignore a terrible story told though cringingly bad dialog.\n","May 15, 2015","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people like Minecraft's pixel graphics, some others prefer Crysis 3's graphic cards burning quality.\n\nThe main story feels like unfinished (or that should be the proper ending), and It definitely gave me the impression that this game could have more DLCs and expansions to play, but sadly no.\n\nThe only thing you may enjoy after beaten the whole story is racing against the cloak and completing some difficult challenges. There is a leaderboard for these challenges, but does it really matter? Ask yourself after a glance on people's review and release date.\n\nOh and, although I think this game is okay, it's still a little bit overpriced.

If this had a better team of developers or maybe just better animators, there's a chance it could've been a decent game.\n\nDARK is a 3rd person stealth-action game where you play as a modern-day vampire on a manhunt for the person that changed him into the brooding, blood-sucking monster that he is.\n\nThe overall story is very generic and poorly put together. There are so many plot holes, the story that's leftover is almost nonexistent. Every event basically says, "Well, this is happening just because."\n\nControls, while slightly responsive, are still clunky and all over the place. All these upgrades and special moves, and you'll just run around one-punching enemies. Run around? Yes. The enemy AI is so terrible, I managed to duck behind a corner and kill EVERY SINGLE GUARD one at a time. I was left with a pile of maybe 20 - 25 dead guards next to me.\n\nOn the plus side, the abilities are okay. Not extremely innovated by any means, but they're neat. However, when you can simply run around and one punch everything to death, there's not really a need to use any of them.\n\nDon't even get me started on the voice acting though. I understand good talent is hard to come by, but PLEASE. I could find more believable dialouge in an old insane asylum.\n\nBottom line, if you enjoy wonky PS2 games, this would make a nice addition to your collection. It's part of the reason I have the game in the first place.

I'm so used to having these epic mini-cinematics (Far-cry, Styx, Mordor (best kills ever) Dishonoured, Blood Dragon, Mark Of The Ninja (2D vesrion of Dishonoured!  So awesome!) That it feels somehow lacking when you backflip someone into a headlock and then just snap their neck. But, the no-knife has a purpose - stealth kills grant you something more importaint... blood to use your abilities. Each ability uses blood, and you will find yourself calcuting who to use abiolity kills on, and who to stealth-drain to restore your presious ability reserves. I enjoyed it, as it prevented youfrom being too over powered. I never flet like I coud walk into a room and clean up.\n\nEnemy AI is basic, but good. Their patrol routes cover each other, making the hardest ting in a room being "who to take first" - leading to a gap to take the next guy..... they look /follow  with guns drawn if they hear something (you), walking on broken glas makes a sound... they call eachother for help (there is a huge ability point bonus for not raising the alarm by the end of the level). The problem with this AI though, like all AI, in all stealth games, ever,  is they don't realy notice when all of their buddies have gone "missing". you can drag and hide bodies. Bodies trigger alarms. Alarms put everyone on high alert, guns drawn, actively and systematically hunting you out. AI has a 'range of sight', rather than a 'line of sight' so get 20 meters away from you and they won't see you dragging their patrol partner down the stairs.\n\nI played it with quicksave and considered getting caught as an instant restart of the area. I enjoyed it, quite a bit. It filled a gap in the Stealth genre for a bit, until I find something else sneaky-sneaky-stabby-stab-stab. Get it on a sale, I did, and I am happy with my buy.\n\nIf you go the Stealth Route, it makes no difference if the game is on Easy or Hard - that setting only affects the amount of damage they do to you, which won't be a problem if they never see you....","August 16, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a middle-of-the-road PS2 stealth game and should have been a budget title at release. It's no Daikatana goes stealth, as some ubersampling-coddled critics would have us believe. It's cute in the way an ugly, broken thing can be cute at last call on a rainy Tuesday night.","November 12, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also with the story i liked it, so i hope for a 2nd game to get more of it :) because it is quite fasinating.

The story on the other hand..... a laughable B-movie script at best I'm afraid, although there's still enough to keep the game ok.\n\nAll-in-all, a good game, just not quite enough to keep me playing longer than necissary.","July 6, 2013","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hell, they'll pull corpses out of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s just to stay in HOSTILE mode.)\n- Inconsistencies in skill tree (Some abilities are pretty much either literally useless or do the same thing as others in a slightly different way)\n\nThis all being said, the idea of the game is amazing and what it could have been awes me. I'm saddened to see it be killed by controls as listed above. Lanky, stiff, clumsy, and unplayable almost. It's like this game never got out of alpha.","July 8, 2015","false","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
