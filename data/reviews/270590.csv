"http://steamcommunity.com/id/r2p/recommended/270590/","r2p","BaltasarOnMeth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/r2p/","600 products in account","My first impression:\nLong night indeed looks and feels like the old horror adventures I used to love during the Playstation era. I am not very far in the game (I hope), but I am already certain, that I will finish it.\n\nA few (unsorted) notes:\n- The controls are as good or as bad as most action adventures of the era Long Night tries to connect to.\n- There is no combat. Think Clocktower, not Resident Evil.\n- There is little explanation of the health system. Sometimes I die, sometimes I don't.\n- You can turn off checkpoints (there are save points, make sure to memorize the locations) and interaction popups (tapping A/X while bumbing along the wall is back, yay). This replaces a difficulty system and greatly improves immersion.\n- The game is not dubbed.\n- Story is represented by short visual novel style films.\n- Make sure you are a quick reader! The text in the videos is so fast, reading the text, looking at the picture and understanding what's going on can be a pain.\n- There is a lot of text to read. Books, notes, journals, diaries. You can also click on most items and read a description. This is a feature most modern games are missing. Yes, I want to read more about that picture on the wall, that plate on the table and that empty bed with smelly sheets. Well done!\n- Most of the text was obviously not written by an English native speaker. This might be bad for some, but it brings back the charme of the genre ca. 2000, when all games like this came from Japan, with weird translations. This one however, rather sounds like good French English... and I was right, it's a French developer!\n- You can freely roam the camp, as free as you can roam any place in a horror game at least.\n- As the main cast is a bunch of teens, be ready for a lot of teen tropes.\n- There is an actual inventory.\n- I spent 88 minutes in the game without finding a map. The camp is not that big, but...\n- ...the camera angles do not really help in finding my way and knowing where I am. I actually have no idea of the geometry of that camp, thanks to that camera. Like I said, the game reproduces a late 90's charme, including those fun details we actually never missed. EDIT: According to the comments, there is a map. Thanks to Choux.\n\nThe first five minutes were full of "Ugh, the visuals!" and "Err, controls...", but then it was like "Aaaah, I missed it!"\n\nBest five bucks I have spent in a while!","July 7, 2014","true","1.8"," 103 of 131 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","103","131","2","3"

But don't worry, you'll find a whopping two puzzles in the whole game to help pass the time!\n\nThe whole time you're outside, you're constantly being assaulted by some sort of ghost thing who runs after you, and since the whole place is linear corridors, the only way to escape is backwards. The only way to get rid of her is to either outrun her until she gets bored or you reach one of a handful of hiding spots which get rid of her 100% of the time (a heavily oversimplified take on the system from Clock Tower). You can get this down to a science after a couple of attempts and every time she shows up -- about once every 45 seconds by the end -- it's just an annoying detour.\n\nThe story makes absolutely no sense, and the giant walls of text that make up the notes do little to give a sense that any more thought was put into what happens than Weird Things Are Afoot. The closest it ever comes to a coherent narrative is in that one area that I'm pretty sure you can skip entirely.\n\nThe final area is kind of cool visually, but it's an absolute dog to play and starts and ends abruptly with no real attempt at coherency. Near as I could tell it had NOTHING to do with ANY of the other ~spooky stuff~ in the rest of the game. Finally, after about fifty deaths or so, I reached the end, it played a cryptic cutscene that wrapped up nothing and dumped me unceremoniously back to the main menu.\n\nGraphically it's sort of OK and the controls are decent when you're not wrestling with the camera (camera-relative controls and dramatic camera angles clash once again) but outside of that there's really nothing that gets me itching to play episode 2.","July 8, 2014","false","2.1"," 115 of 153 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","115","153","0","5"

First of all, im not sure, if either the Developers lied to the backers: they said, that the game would be 50% completed. They never said, that Long Night was going to get an episodic release until the fourth last update and two updates later they already told us, that they went bankruipt. Or perhaps they simply completely miscalculated their situation with the game ? Noone will ever really know, because theyr statement was a bad joke. Just stating, that the sales on Steam went pretty bad and an investor jumped off. So ... the biggest problem with this game is: it will never be finished.\n\nIf you donÂ´t have a problem with that - the whole game is somewhat half-baked: the atmosphere is decent and the graphics are okay - but the controls are terrible. It feels somewhat spongy.  Im okay with the point, that you canÂ´t fight the banshee chick in the beginning BUT im not okay, that I cant find a way to either avoid the confrontation with her nor survive it, by simply running away because your staminia or whatever it is, is so low that sheÂ´ll catch up with you eventually. Storywise this game is a disaster. YouÂ´ll get chunks of something that might have become a story in later chapters. But until now ... nothing.\n\nSo - as a small resumÃ©: Am I angry with the developers ? Actually - no ! Kickstarter was my risk, and come on - 15$ wont kill me. For me, it was actually wort a shot and giving the developers the chance to try it. BUT would I back another of their projects, or a project of any person involved in this ? Nope ... I fear not. If they were more open from the beginning, telling us "Okay, with the 10k we want - were going to release a first chapter and look how things are going further on" IÂ´d still had backed it. But things feel somewhat different and give you some sort of bitter taste, when they post an update saying "Yep, weÂ´ll release the game (that was 50% done btw) now as a series of 3 parts, ainÂ´t that groovy ?" (And no, thats no joke they really tried to sell the chapter form as a good idea to the backers) and two updates later they already tell you "K folks, thats all - weÂ´re broke"\n\n\nAnd can I recommend the game ? Hell no ! Why should I recommend a title that will, most likely never be completed ? Keep your hands away !","April 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","39","44","2","2"

Not even for the price of 99 cents i bought it for in the halloween sales.\n\n\nthe game seemed to be good at first, its a creepy story told at the start of the game in a comic style which is good.\nthe first problem i had during this videosequences was, that it lagged. i got the sound effects and the written story part so fast that i couldnt read it all (and i can read fast) the pictures to the written story part were slow. in the end the whole story was told and i still had still plenty appearing pictures without any sound. Then it crashed my computer, so i restarted to try it again. the same problem accured but my comp didnt crash this time.\n\non this point i have to say i have a good gamer comp i can play games like DayZ with a miserable programming without problems with my system. it was weird that the game lagged. i didnt care too much about it, since i still knew enough from the story so i started playing.\n\nthe graphics arent good, which isnt the problem to me when i play a good story based games. i played plenty indie titles with a weak graphic but a good story. but its a point to mention in a recommendation.\n\ni started as the blonde guy walking back to the camp and spotting a ghost lady at the playground. so i walked to her, since there is no way to not walk to her anyways.. i tried around 10 times to run away, but my character had to breath and she got me. i tried of course to not run that fast for a while to not stop completely for a few seconds because that means your death. the problem is the ghost lady runs as fast as my fastest possible run and she doesnt get out of breath...\ni never came away of her instant killing. i came to a house which i couldnt enter..and the other way was just a way without anything where she also killed me.\n\nso...i got really fast tired...start game..run...get eaten..restart..run..get eaten...im not far into the game and someone could say i cant write a recommendation about it, but...sometimes you dont have to bother yourself to play completely through a game you hate or like already in the first minutes to write negative or positive recommendations about it.\n\nim sure i would find the solution to outrun or "scare" her away. but im just not in the mood to try so. i got fast that annoyed of it, that i told myself "nah thats just no fun to play".\n\nyou cant just start up a game being hunted this insanely while u dont even know the controls.\n\nthe unspoken rule for horror games are....start slow, get used to the controls and to the atmosphere..and then appears the first enemy. No matter if its alan wake, outlast, the evil within, resident evil series, amnesia, slender man and many others, you walk around, check out the scenery, get used to the controls. In Long Night you start, walk for 5 seconds and get right away attacked.\n\nit isnt creepy in any way. and a horror game should be scary or creepy. its just annoying and nothing else. i got a WTF feeling, got tired of it..i thought "ya ya fine eat me again..lets run left way..lets run the other way...ugh lets just play something else"\n\nthe controls are horrible. the camera movement is really bad. i dont know how often i runned into the playground fence because of stupid controls and camera bugs and got instant killed again.\n\nThen i read about the game and what other people think of it. i should have read it before. i find out that it was planned for many chapters. the game studio was shut down and the developers stopped working on it (which i understand why cause the game sucks noone wants more chapters of that crap).\n\nstill it means even if someone enjoys this game, the story is unfinished and will never get continued. so the whole point of playing it is senseless.\n\nya i know my english in this recommendation kinda sucks too, plenty grammar fails and typo errors..and i know about it..the thing is..i got a headache from the game and everyone understands that the game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...so i fullfilled to warn other gamers...my positive recommendations are better LOL","November 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

The controls are not very intuitive and the entire thing, while pretty, is badly designed. The main character is incapable of running in a straight line, which means that as you are chased by insanly fast enemies, you pinball back and forth on the enviroment in die. A lot. In addition, they tried to be artistic with the camera angles, but it simply made the controls even more difficult and made it hard to see.\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend it, even if you do have a game pad.

And let's not forget the UGLY...\n\nThe GOOD:  Spooky atmosphere, effective jump-scares, logical puzzles, genuinely interesting storyline (complete with clever red herrings), nice in-game graphics and well-designed sound.  Oh, and it's mercifully short, at least thus far (though I believe there are more episodes to come).\n\nThe BAD:  A slight lack of check and save-points (especially at very beginning and very end), cheap/amateurish cut scenes (with, granted, their heart in the right place), and a fair dose of "what the hell am I supposed to do next?" confusion throughout.\n\nThe UGLY:  Frustratingly frequent and mechanically awkward "chase" sequences in which obstructively-placed foliage has as much chance of killing you as you have of successfully making it to one of the clearly-designated hiding spots (the convenience of which is dependent upon which direction you happen to run in).  The first such sequence, barely ten minutes into the game, nearly made me throw in the towel right there and then...but you get used to it.  Kind of.\n\nOverall I'd say that the good ultimately emerges triumphant, but we'll have to see how future episodes pan out...and here's hoping said episodes will be free to those who have already bought the game, or at the very least dirt-cheap (five bucks a pop being a bit of a stretch, in all honesty).\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","September 15, 2014","true","4.4"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","1"

The graphics look halfway between a PS1 and PS2 game and there's a slight unpolished feel to things. Controls are weird (WASD to move, spacebar to sprint?) and cannot be changed. I would say a gamepad is almost mandatory.\n\nThat said I would still recommend it.  The atmosphere is creepy. For most of the time there is only one enemy but it's creepy as hell and you never know where it's going to pop up and send you into a panic attack trying to get away. While the graphics are primative and performance unpolished, it has that unique art design most Frech games have and it works. At less than $5 it's worth the price if you're into survival horror games.\n\nOne gameplay complaint I have is they never explain to you how health or dying works. You have a "mental state" that seems like health but I never noticed it do anything when it got low. When the enemy catches you, sometimes it's an instant death, sometimes it's harmless. I played through this episode twice and I still have no clue about either.  "Health" doesn't seem connected to the enemy killing you and your mental state sometimes degrades on its own. The game tells you to use inhalers to restore your mental state but there's a VERY limited amount and you are never given any clue when or why you need to use them because you never notice mental state affecting anything. There's still more episode to go so hopefully they'll fix that.\n\nOne STORY complaint I have is you coming across a document related to the central plot that is such a blatant X-Files reference (right down to one of the people having the exact same name!) that it breaks the immersion a bit.","November 3, 2014","false","3.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The developers took some serious inspiration from Silent Hill with surreal atmospheres, frustratingly deliberate camera angles and view-dependent control schemes. Overall, it was well executed.\n\nThe reason I do not recommend this game is that it is waaay too short. I know it's only episode 1, but the 2.4 hours I spent playing the game do not warrant the $5 I spent to get it. Most of 2.4 hours I spent playing this was me repeating the same frustrating chase scene or overly confusing shark puzzle. I know this is titled as "episode 1" but even episodes have resolutions to the stories within them. The story that was started was in no way resolved, and the ending rasied way more questions than it did answers. I left the game feeling unsatisfied, and wanting more than I got. While wanting more is usually a good sign, and encourages players to buy the next piece of the series, I don't think I will be buying the next one. Especially if the episode is as short as this one was.\n\nIf you want to spend $5 on a very small, albeit well done, content then maybe Long Night is your time. The cut scenes were well done, the atmosphere was spot on, but I honestly feel like the developers could have released more content, or at least fixed a few common bugs in gameplay before release. It's not as if the game is bad by any means... it's actually really good! It just feels more like a long demo than it does a first episode to a series.\n\nI really liked the world of Long Night, but I would not buy the next episode unless I was assured there be more content and less glitchy gameplay.","December 16, 2014","false","2.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I played 105 minutes or so, mostly because of the infuriating and deliberately clunky "running puzzles" that compose the last HALF of this title. I sincerely wish I could have my $4.99 back, because I wouldn't spend more than $1 on this game or any subsequent chapters. The only thing I can think of is that people who backed the game feel overly fond of it, or the friends of the developers are being very outspoken here.\n\nTo elaborate...\n\nTHE PROS:\n*Great cut-scene graphics, very Gone Home meets Telltale games. A pity they flash so fast that you can't read the text, though.\n\n*Retro-style nostalgia in abundance, even the year it takes place in.\n\n*A fairly interesting storyline.\n\n*A "creepy, scary" villian type that is pretty unnerving.\n\n*Decent cliffhanger ending. I feel sincerely intrigued by what happens in the rest of the story, but...\n\nTHE CONS:\n*Horrible controls. I understand the Retro static camera, but the poor controls paired with the "running puzzles" and the fact the main character has asthma simply make the game 100x more frustrating than fun.\n\n*Short -- If the clunky running mechanics hadn't have doubled my time, I'd have finished this in 35-45mins. Tops. Totally not worth $4.99 in my book!\n\n*No audio controls -- not to disable the music, nor slider-bar it down. The music isn't -bad- it's just loud compared to the other sounds, and it somehow makes my head want to explode when getting frustrated with the running puzzles.\n\n*Poor Storytelling "plot devices." I'm all for foreshadowing, or having a plot arch that spans the entire series of episodes. However, when you present a LOT of story elements that the player can't unravel and decipher until they purchase the later episodes, it just feels weak.\n\n...and that's just what I can think of, off the top of my head. If the other episodes were included FREE with this $4.99 purchase, I -might- be able to recommend it. Maybe. But probably not, because this game just left me insanely frustrated and completely confused as to why the reviews are so overwhelmingly positive thus far.","July 8, 2014","false","2.3"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","2"

I mean the comic-style horror (not the super jumpscares that we normally go through) gives it a good vibe. The story gets better later on.\n\nHowever, the controls...oh god the controls. They are just too sensitive. When changing maps, your direction goes back to the same. For example, you're heading down and when the map changes when you heading down, it tries to go back up.\n\nThe interface is terrible. For the gamepad, it rotates to different stuff rather than what you want.\n\nAnd at the end...oh man the end. Just dodging that shark thing. That is worse than the Chantelise and FF8 final boss.\n\nIn the end, the story was great.

Or at the very least, keep it organized.\n\nSTORY: There is clearly a -lot- of stuff going on in this story, and in an episodic game, obviously you're going to be left with a lot of loose ends after just the first chapter. I'm a bit of a completionist and a fast reader, so I was perfectly happy to track down and read every single note and diary in the game, and it didn't break the flow for me at all, but those who lost patience with games such as Amnesia in this regard might not be so keen. I don't mind feeling confused about a game's story as long as the mystery is actually compelling and not just a bunch of random run-of-the-mill spooky bull, and for me, it definitely is compelling. The main draw for me isn't the history behind the creepy going-ons, though-- let's face it, it's pretty much all been done and it's nothing against the game when I say I don't expect much there -- but the dynamic of the four main characters and learning more about their stories. In the under two hours it took me to finish this episode, I actually felt a little emotionally invested in the characters' fates, which isn't a familiar feeling for me when it comes to horror games.\n\nGAMEPLAY: I'll be honest -- I almost quit at the very first confrontation, because I got myself killed just about twenty times in a row; and the last checkpoint was directly -before- a non-skippable cutscene. It was ridiculous. BUT stay with me. Yes, it can be tricky at first being chased around the map because a) your camera is all over the place man it does not just follow right behind you and b) it's hella dark and you know in horror movies how when they're running they always look back and trip on something yeah this will basically literally happen because there are bushes everywhere so you'll be running and your camera will flip the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out and next thing you know you're careening into a bush and then you're dead. but hey if you look at it that way, it just adds to the challenge, right? also, your character is asthmatic, which means if you overuse sprint, he'll have an attack and literally just be unable to move. this is actually a detail I really like, because while lots of horror games have the exhaustion mechanic, this one actually comes up with a good explanation for why your character has the stamina of a two year old (among the sleep also had a good explantion in that your character was in fact a two year old).\n\nAfter all the practice of that first confrontation, though, and realizing that the little glowy blue things are places you can hide (thanks for the heads up, game, I should have known that the proper thing to do when running for my life was stop and investigate shiny stuff by the side of the road ) the rest of the game was perfectly playable.\n\nSCARINESS: Let's keep it real here; horror games are my favorite thing in the world, but I'm an enormous wussy. I wouldn't play them if I wasn't in it for a good rush though. With that said, for me, this game had a really nice balance in this department. There are areas where you feel constantly vulnerable, areas where you feel pretty safe (a nice relief from constant tension) and areas where you really have no idea what's going on and isn't that so much worse. There was a good atmosphere throughout and a refreshing variety of different types of creepy, none of which were particularly jump-scarey -- another plus. It was satisfyingly scary / creepy without being cripplingly so. I felt nervous, tense, and sometimes downright on-edge, but not uncomfortably stressed.\n\nADVICE FOR NEW PLAYERS: You can hide in the blue glowy spots. The little glowy insignias on the wall in some places allow you to save. There's a map in the D4's cabin that you can take. As you find hiding spots, visit cabins, and find dead ends, they will be marked on there. Super useful. Also, you can't run when you're holding your lighter.\n\nTLDR; Overall, an interesting storyline with a lot of depth and detail. Good soundtrack, pleasant art and atmosphere in general. Under-instructive in spots, but I prefer that to games that don't let you think at all. A casually fun challenge level, moderately scary, and mechanics that were definitely imperfect but not enough to detract from the overall experience. Not a game for everyone, but one that I personally loved, and would pay to see a second installment of.","March 20, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/270590/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","It all starts on a nice summer night where four best of friends are sitting around telling ghost stories. One of the group decides to tell the story of something that happened right there at the camp they are staying at. Now of course you know they have to see if the story is true, and what ends up happening will have all 4 separated from each other, and lost. You will play the part of one of those characters, the one that actually told the story. It is up to you to try to figure out what is going on and where everybody went.\n\nGraphically I have to say that I was pretty impressed with this game. The cut scenes that were done in a mature comic style looked amazing. There was also a lot to the models used in the game for the main character as well as the camp setting. One of the things that I have to say was a nice change of pace was the fact that even the mundane items that you will not have to interact with looked just as good as the items that you are going to interact with. Also, as much as I hated to see them, the death screens were also very well done and some were quite creepy.\n\nNow this being a game that has gone through some crowdfunding I can kind of understand that there is no voice acting in this game. They didn't meet that stretch goal, but I really really wish they had some voice acting in this game. It would have added an element that would have caused a deeper immersion into the game.\n\nThe controls are a bit odd if you are going to be using a keyboard, the preferred method of play was with a controller. You are going to be using 'E' to interact with your environment. You are going to be using WASD to move around, although you will notice that because of the way the camera is situated you are going to experience some drifting from side to side as you move. Finally you are going to be using the Enter key to pause and pull up your inventory.\n\nAlright so you are at this camp that you and your friends have spent many summers at. There's definitely a sense of misfits banding together. Now this being the first installation of the game you are not going to solve every mystery that this game holds, but man would I have like a little bit more to play. I think it was really at about the 40 minute mark of the game where I caught my stride and wanted to see where the game could really take me. There of course is the scary â™¥â™¥â™¥ bloody woman that will chase you down in a heartbeat that always kept me on edge. There was also a lot of items that I picked up that I guess will have relevance down the road, or maybe not. The biggest problem is that this game is barely over an hour long. I do understand that there's more to come, but I really wish that there was at least a little bit more to grasp on to.\n\nThis is a great looking game what closes the first chapter way too fast. I did like what I played, and yes I did die quite a few times in the game, more than I would like, but most of the time it was my fault for dying. I will say this SAVE, SAVE, SAVE, SAVE, these are the checkpoints for most of the game and if you do not save you are going to have a lot of retracing your steps to do. Now comes the hard part, a grade, it's kind of hard to give this game a grade because I hope that there's something that is just around the next corner, something that I can get further into, but as it stands I just got into the game and then was thrown back to the intro screen having completed the first chapter. So I guess the best I can give this game is a 7.2 out of 10.","August 1, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Along with that style, it has many of the quirks and gameplay flaws that are expected. Overall it is a very enjoyable experience, it is erie, the story is interesting, and the characters are likeable. There are however some huge flaws in the game, and I hope that the developers listen to the fans before releasing Episode 2.\nMajor Flaw #1: The speed of enemies. I am just fine with having fixed camera angles that sometime interfere with the controls, it's the style of the game, and frankly I enjoy it. The only problem is that enemies move as such a ridiculous speed, that when a camera angle change occurs it can completely screw you up. It no longer becomes a frightening pursuit, and instead becomes a series of trial and error.\nMajor Flaw #2: Without spoiling too much, there is some bad puzzle design at the end of the game, specifically one that requires no brains, and merely trial and error (it involves a stain glass floor). Really that whole last scene was just trial and error, I hope we don't see more of that in Episode 2.\n\nFinal verdict: It's a great retro-style game, and if you enjoyed PS era horror you shouldn't miss Long Night, in spite of its flaws.","July 16, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Just like in Clock Tower combat is not possible, the only option is to run and hide. There are only three hide spots in the entire game though, and I didn't have to visit them very often. The puzzles were fun, but pretty few, which I guess is because of the episode formatting. Also the entire plot becomes known within the first 15 minutes of play time, which could have been a bit more stretched. Maybe there will be some twists left.\n\nAll in all the game was extremely fascinating to play, but fell a little short.
