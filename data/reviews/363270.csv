Very hard, you won't be flying through the levels like in other physics racers. After the first few tutorial levels are finished, you'll have to work hard, just to get to the finish line on most maps.\n\nThe first thing that stands out in O3DX is the fact that although you can only move your vehicle on a 2D plain, all the levels are rendered in 3D. This gave the developer, the ability to add things like tricky, slow corners and dynamic camera views.\n\nMastering the levels requires a mix of leaning forward and backwards as well as clever management of the brakes and acceleration, as you progress through the levels, the game also throws some quite tricky puzzle elements at you, these portions of the game can't be solved with horsepower, only brainpower.\n\nIf I would have any criticism about the gameplay at this point, it would be that each level forces you to use a particular vehicle, whether it's a big heavy 4x4 or smaller ATV style vehicles. Some customization options would go a long way, not just on what vehicle you can use, but also livery's and other options to alter the appearance of each of the vehicles. At this point in time, they come how they come, like it or not.  That being said, each one feels distinctly different and are very fun to drive.\n\nGraphics:For the most part the graphics are amazing, the actual levels themselves are beautifully crafted, with great textures and animations throughout, light shafts illuminate the environments and sometimes you can't help but give the environments more attention than the task at hand. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the majority of the vehicles, while some look OK, others look a little low-res and somewhat stand out (I'm looking at you Jeep.) That being said, the game is still in Early Access and I'm sure that at some point,  the developers will give the vehicles the same love they have given to the beautiful environments.\n\nControls:Controls are fully redefinable through the launcher, which is always a nice feature. The default keyboard controls are simple but very intuitive, responsiveness is nice too, I've crashed and blown up many vehicles during my time with O3DX, but at no point did I feel the controls were to blame for my demise. At the point of writing this review, I have been unable to use my Xbox 360 controller, this seems to be a known bug that has been acknowledged by the developers, according to a forum post, a patch to fix this issue will be published in the very near future.\n\nSummary:O3DX is a very well realized point to point physics racer, it offers some new and interesting innovations to the standard formula and they have executed these innovations very well, Easy to get into, but very hard to master, perfectionists will spend hours mastering each of the games levels and even if that's not your thing, O3DX will still consume plenty of your time, The graphics although a little substandard at times, will completely wow you for the majority. If you're a fan of games like Trials or Joe Danger, O3DX is right up your street. I'd have no hesitation in recommending O3DX even at this early point of development. It's not quite there yet, but even now, it's more polished than other games that have already reached the end of their development.\n\nAt this moment in time, I'd give O3DX a 7.5 / 10.","August 25, 2015","true","6.5"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","44","58","3","4"

It’s a fresh new approach to sidescrollers.

And therefore it takes a while to get used to it. You might expect to pick up the controls and get going from the start, but there are a few things you need to get used to first. Because it’s not a pure sidescroller, the controls will flip whenever the camera angles flip. This will take some time to get used to. But once the penny drops in your mind it becomes natural.\nNeeds achievements.\nNeeds Steam Cloud.\nSome vehicles are not polished.\nTakes a while to get used to this new approach.\n\nYes, it's in Early Access, and the items on my bad list might still be attended to.

The game is on a 3D map but your vehicle automatically stays on a linear path -- the gameplay and skill is where you rev up the gas, where you apply the brakes or handbrake, and, most of all, where you lean forwards or backwards to keep control during the big jumps and steep climbs. One mistake and you could stall, hit explosive barrels, or even fall off the track completely.\n\nEach of the (currently) 30 levels may be relatively short, but it's a challenge to reach the goal for each one. And that doesn't even go into the fact each level has several stars to collect, some of which require fine-tuned controls to take an alternate path (often a lower or higher level than is easily reached); as well as a set time to beat.\n\nGraphics look beautiful, with sun flares, dust or snow kicking up beneath your wheels, and atmospheric effects like rain or snow on certain levels.\nThere is also a lot of variety in levels, from deserts with dusty hills and mesas, to lush fields with ruins, to snowy hills.\n\nThe game has a nice thumping soundtrack throughout that really fits with the theme of wanting to go fast, keeping the adrenaline pumping. The vehicle engine sounds also sound real, as if you're really close to the action.\n\nThe game  has a few minor bugs which should be fleshed out during the early access period, but it's very much playable and fun to do so,","August 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","2"

I've seen early acess games that when finished, don't have half as much polish as O3DX, I played through the first levels of the game, and I'll be playing a lot more. It's in the same genre as the Trials series, but with heavy/not so heavy cars. As far as I got, the gameplay is smooth, you play fast, and you restart fast, though when I tried to go in reverse, sometimes my car would just go full speed and couldn't really control the timing to stop. I'd also like to point out that I played the game under the system requirements, but still played smooth with low quality settings, haven't found any game breaking bugs or glitches, so all in all, this game has  a lot of potential, and it's quite fun to play, even at this stage of development, I'm looking forward to see more, like achievements, or even jumptricks of some sort, those would be great, but not really required, O3DX, great early acess title, hope to see it as an awesome fully released game.","September 4, 2015","true","3.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

While harsh sounding I simply cannot tolerate this unpolished mess of a game.\n\nFirst things first lets review what this game really is, O3DX or Offroad 3D X-treme is to give a better perspective a game that plays like trials fusion which is a visceral, fast, and difficult 2D sidescrolling racing/physic game. Except it is a poor imitation of the Trials series.\n\nLets go with the graphics, at first glance it looks alright on the screenshot right? Well not really because take a look at this  Image  those line effects you see? Not dynamic, they are baked in which means that in the situation like you see in the image in which I am going at 1 km/h it still appears giving a silly illusion of speed which is not there. The textures are muddy and bland plus the props are overused.\n\nSound\nThe only saving grace this game has is the powerful BGM meanwhile the SFX is terribly inconsistent. E.g the sound of the engine is simply a few second of sound noticeably looped ad infinitum while the sound of tyre crunching against the dirt sounds like someone took a plastic dustpan and ran it over a gravel road over and over again whilst Simultaneously drowning out any other sound the game might have had. Also that gravel sound also plays even if you are driving on the snow. Meanwhile other sound effect sounded like they came out of the SNES era, not powerful and actually felt pretty awesome, for a child that is.\n\nGameplay is hanging corpse for this kind of genre, to get addicted to this sort of game it must provides plenty of physic puzzles, great illusion of speed, and a compelling enviroment all which this game does not have. The car [a ♥♥♥♥in.g humvee] cannot even get its sorry buttock over the a little hill and it will find any reason it can to lose its goddam.n speed. Go over that bump? Lose speed. Tight corner? Lose speed. Best part is when you manage to conjure enough speed and go over a ramp only to find out you triggered a bulletime mode [that is only specific to that one spot] you will inexplicably lose all of your speed. Physic puzzle? More like pray to whatever god you have that the model of physic they are using does not screw you over, I restarted a level 3 times and it behaves differently for all of those 3 times not to mention that so called obstacle will screw you over because they are placed just outside your camera view and other obstacles are just floating rings given no reason as to why they are so and will blow your car up because fuel tanks are convenietly placed all over it and will explode at the touch of a feather.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? Hell no. If this game was my student and I am its teacher I would give it a B+ for effort but a deserved D- for execution. Avoid it if you can and just get the other game that does it even better than this.\n\nOh I forgot to mention, in order to give off a feeling of dynamic to the track the camera will randomly move around a preset path to show you highlights and so on which does not work of course and instead gave me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ migraine instead. Plus I can clearly see the car is going 10 km/h you are not fooling anyone.\n\nIn short, a sloppy game done wrong in a genre where explosion, speed, and a sense of visceral is of the utmost importance.\n","September 16, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

On one hand I love the concept and simple controls. On the other hand it's hard to play a game that crashes all the time, and doesn't let you control the camera.\n\nThe first level pack is fine, but even on sale it's not really worth $8.49... maybe $4.24.\nIf the second level pack worked like it's suppose to, then it would be worth $8.49.\nAnd if I could get to the third level pack, then it would be worth $12.50.\nAnd if I could finish the game and feel satisfied, then it would be worth $14.99.\n\nI also noticed the store page is slightly misleading. It attempts to present the game as a new release for 2016, but this game has been in Beta since 2014, Alpha since 2015 and STILL is a Alpha product. But, I also have to keep in mind it's an Indie game with lack of help. And since they don't have much help, the developers are not seeing their bug report messages either, which makes matters worse. It's hard to find good help these days.\n\nThe game uses the Unity Coding engine, which is not so forgiving with slouchy logic code (so I've heard). Don't get me wrong here, so far it looks like they've done a great job, but obviously it needs more tweaking and optimizing to be done to it before it's considered a finished product.\n\nThe vehicles and terrain look really nice even on the lowest graphic settings. I find the vehicle crashes to be hilarious, but sometimes you crash for no apparent reason and have to reset the track, which is not funny at all.\n\nSound FX are pretty basic, you get what you pay for. But I would like to give the devs kudos to the handbrake SFX, because it sounds exactly like somebody is parking in your driveway outside. I've already fooled 3 people with it so far.\n\nMost of the music rocks! I'm digging the soundtrack to this game. Big kudos on that! - But I would suggest the music to continue playing during a track reset instead of restarting the music. That gets kind of irritating after a while, especially since you do have to do a lot of resets while learning each track.\n\nThe game certainly has a challenge to it. Many of the tracks have intense situations where you MUST successfully clear an obstacle exactly right, or else suffer another reset to the beginning. So prepare to see a lot of loading screens. I sort of wish the game didn't have to do a reload for a track reset. There should be a way to do a simple recovery to the beginning and just set particular variables to zero again... but I'm sure the devs had their reasons for doing it like they did.\n\nIDK... over all I think I'm going to sit on the fence with this one 50/50. It has big potential... it just needs more work done to it.\n\nIn the game's current state, I can not honestly recommend this game. At least no further than the first level pack. I guess I would be recommending 1/3 of it ??? But, SORRY, it's thumbs down on this game until they fix it.","January 28","false","14.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

That's the first thing you should remember. I'm saying it at the beginning, because this game is early access, and this review is going to mention a lot of things that still need to be improved. But the game is fun, and challenging, and I really enjoy playing it.\nWhat the creators of this game say, is that with O3DX they have tried to create a new game genre. Something different for gamers to experience. Have they accomplished it? Well...\nLets start with first impressions. First impressions are not that great. The first few levels of O3DX are extremely easy, and honestly left me somewhat confused to what the point of the game is. If you've ever heard of Trials Fusion, then you will know what I mean. O3DX is like Trials Fusion, but with cars. If you don't know what Trials Fusion is, it's like a side scroller, but in a 3D environment. Your vehicles is somewhat "glued" to a set path, and all you can do is choose when to accelerate.\nThe steering is extremely simple, you can accelerate, reverse, break, and lean your vehicle forwards and backwards. Which is where some of my initial confusion came from - in the first levels all I needed to do was hold the up arrow button. You can imagine my reaction, what's the point of game where you just hold one button to complete a level?\nHowever, I looked at some of the reviews, so positive, all mentioning, you should at least get through 6-8 levels before you judge. So I did, and then I got to the good stuff.\nWhat the first levels did was getting me used to how the vehicles react. They also showed off the truly lovely graphics of the various environments that you drive through. (This game is definitely lense flare central, and I love it, I'm a sucker for a good lense flare.) Getting used to the dynamic, cinematic camera angles is another thing. They look great, but they also add some difficulty as very often they won't allow you to see the path ahead. You have to quickly learn to memorize the paths. The first levels also allowed me to enjoy the badassery of the short but very rock'n'roll soundtrack. On a side note, some levels also offer a sudden unexpected slow motion moment, when the car is doing a particularly epic jump. Not gonna lie, it's entertaining.\nThe developers also mention extremely realistic physics in the game, and I would be willing to agree the cars reactions are usually very much on point. With the occasional sillines, when for example my car instantly flipped onto its hood when it literally touched a wooden plank on the road.\nOnce you get through the first few levels, and you think you got the hang of this simple game... it gets unbelievably more difficult. The further you get into it the more obstacles the levels introduce. Some of them explosive, some of them mobile, some of them just really really difficult to get through. Having a good feel of the acceleration rate and timing in this game is everything, and it's very unforgiving. When a game is challenging I start really having fun. If I am willing to retry the same level 20 times in a row, that's a sign of a great game.\nIn the end I do have to remind everyone that this is early access, and early access always comes with a baggage. In the short time I played it, the game crashed on me twice. It also presented sound issues (turned off SFX and music, and yet the slow mo sound effect blasted out of my headset unexpectedly). All in all though it's a fairly polished product by now, and the devs are updating it daily. Literally a day after I played it for the first time they released an update that fixed most of the problems I had.\nWould I recommend O3DX? Yes. To people who like rage inducing challenge level, and to people who like simplicity. It got me smiling, and it got me very very frustrated, and then very satisfied, when I managed to beat the challenge that was in my way. And in the end, the only thing that truly matters if you enjoy playing title. And I did. Very much.","August 30, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

To a summer's day? Uh, no, think again buddy!\n\n...Ok, let's start positively...\n- First of all, we can see this game is very acceptable graphics-wise, and is perfectly acceptable for what it is.\n- Sounds: Can't say they're amazing, but I didn't find them annoying either, so we'll call that a positive as well.\n\n...So now we'll talk Negatives...\n1. NO resolution options - this might only affect the Mac version (which shouldn't be an excuse), but it's a little annoying because the way this game is setup (due to the camera, mentioned in my gameplay issues below), you really need to run it in a smaller window.\n2. Although a minor gripe, it's still something that should be better implemented, and that is, I found it hard to navigate all the menus with the keyboard, and had to use mouse to get around half the time.\n3. Lastly, and this is probably the most serious of issues - the actual gameplay. Seriously, this is perhaps the most important thing to get right, and it bombed badly. This issue is so important to address let's have subsections:\na. The first gameplay issue is the camera zoom/pan/angles - because the camera is zoomed in so much most of the time, you can not see far enough ahead in the track to adjust your speed or angle of the vehicle. This single point alone made most of my gametime frustrating, restarting levels because I stuffed up due to not seeing the obstacles in time.\nb. Second gameplay issue I came across was the sudden drop in speed of the vehicle when going up a hill or when you land even slightly unevenly - this caused me to have to restart levels due to not having enough speed to get over an obstacle, or not getting big enough jumps.\nc. Third gameplay issue that I'll mention is the unexpected vehicle crashes that occur - I might be driving over an obstacle, and all of a sudden the vehicle will crash, or, on one occasion, the vehicle randomly jumped in the air and crashed into nothing before landing in a mess on the road.\n\nI can forgive everything else, but I gave up playing after 1 1/2 hrs due to the gameplay issues alone. The random vehicle crashes, the vehicle speed issues, and bad camera make this more of a game of luck than skill. I actually played this briefly quite a few months ago before it came onto Steam, and it really doesn't seem to me like it has changed much at all since then. Due to this, I am not putting much hope into the gameplay issues being sorted before release, but let's hope the devs do.","September 16, 2015","false","1.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I passed them without using the joystick, simply pressing accelerate and then suddenly the truck doesn't have enough power on the next playthrough? Things like this seemed to happen frequently. The sound was terrible with the gravel effects drowning out the sounds of the car or almost anything else. The music was probably the best part of the game.

The actual gameplay, the thing they need to get right, is just not good or fun. Cinematic camera angles? The camera is zoomed in most of the time so you can't see far enough ahead in the track to adjust your speed or angle of the vehicle for the upcoming obstacle. The way the camera pans and angles doesn't show whats ahead and just focuses on the vehicle. It made playing frustrating not being able to see the obstacles in time. Your vehicles speed feels sluggish and not powerful at all. Going up hills or landing unevenly causees drastic drops in speed leaving you unable to get over the next obstacle or not getting a big enough jump. Easy controls? The controls, minimal as they are, just aren't as responsive as they should be.  Ridiculously Realistic physics? The animations and physics are poor and need a lot of work, everything looks and feels stiff. For a game thats supposed to be about speed and physics, it doesn't deliver at this time.

In my short time playing the game I had a bit of fun with it, but there were also a lot of frustrations and parts that just made me want to rip my hair out.\n\nThe game plays a lot like a Trials type game. The only issue is that the vehicles in this game have physics that are constantly changing each time I play the level. It took me a good while to beat the first level just because the car would sometimes not go fast enough to get over a rock.\n\nThe game is also very unforgiving. There are no checkpoints at all, and if you make one mistake you are stuck and have to go back to the beginning. I just found this rather annoying. I would go too slow and get stuck. I would go too fast and hit explosive barrels that blow up my vehicle.\n\nAnother issue I had was the controls. This is more so due to how the camera is worked in this game. With a static camera that stays in one position the controls make sense. With it constantly rotating it makes it hard to figure out which button will rotate me forward and which will rotate me backwards.\n\nThe only other thing I found wrong with the game is my timer always seemed to be bugged. Instead of going up at a constant rate it was very jumpy and updating at random intervels. A sort of meh thing but it still bothered me to look at.\n\nNot all of the game is bad though. It looks really nice and and the music, though it does drone, is also well done.\n\nOverall I'd say my experience was rather lackluster, but it is in early access (according to the store page as I'm writing this) so maybe some of this will change in the future? I don't know. I enjoy the concept of the game and love games like this but it's just hard to recommend this one in particular.","September 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"
