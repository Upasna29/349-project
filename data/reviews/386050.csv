"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/386050/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Proto Raider is for the most part a puzzle game, where your only input is the ability to jump. Your character that I'll name Bob for this review, will never stop running and will recklessly run into any of the numerous hazards you will encounter without a second thought. You can't tell him to slow down or change directions either, so what looks like a simple task for any platformer will be a massive undertaking here. Your goals for each level will be to collect the key and exit through the locked door. It is never as simple as that though as they will quickly start introducing elements like quick sand, fire and poison to name a few of the deadly things you will be encountering. As you might imagine things quickly get complex, but Proto Raider is forgiving in a way since there is no timer to speak of and there   is no life system, allowing you to try as many times as you desire without consequence.\n\nBefore starting the game you should head into the options menu where you can change how fast the gameplay is, invert colors or change it into monochrome. You can chose to have the ASCII art to be either pixelated, bold or normal. There are a surprising amount of options for a game of this type and all that is really missing is the option to rebind the keys. Yes, you only press one button to play this game but the restart level button will also be used plenty. Getting back into the game itself, there are three treasure chests scattered across the level that may appear optional but are pretty important as you will soon run across a dead end until you collect a certain amount. Getting these makes the game a lot more challenging since getting the key and heading toward the exit is usually a simple task, but you are likely going to have to replay the mission again to collect those chests anyways.\n\nThe amount of variety between levels is pretty huge. Seems like every other level has a new feature introduced like a pickaxe to mine, scuba gear to swim or a pick-up that reverses gravity. There is a lot of thinking here and it does get frustrating at times as you see Bob run the wrong direction, straight to his doom, but I never felt it was the anythings fault other than my own. It does have a few annoying bits like having to mine 100% of an area to progress, miss even one pixel and you will have to restart. There are two levels like this in the overall 64 levels this game has to offer, so it is not a major issue. These levels are separated into three themed areas, them being water, dessert and jungle. At the end of each area you will face a boss that you must defeat with a weapon like a sword or a crossbow. Bosses usually die in about 5 hits but careful as their bodies may be hazardous  after death. The blood effects are also quite cool to look at as it splatters all over the objects and drips down. It doesn't look violent since it's just the letter “p” in red floating down but it may be something that interests you if you are purchasing for a child.\n\nBosses go in a set pattern and don't react at all since they have no AI. They seem to attack randomly though so some reflexes are required. Other than bosses there are no other creatures you will be able to kill, the game is mostly based on avoiding obstacles and figuring out the optimal route for escape. In case you were wondering if there is a story, well kind of. You start off looking for treasure and then find the love of your life in some deep, unexplored jungle and must impress her by collecting tons of wedding rings around the stage, leading me to believe that she may in fact be Sonic the Hedgehog in disguise. Anyways, this is a gameplay above all else type of game and it's story offers very little. Graphics are purely ASCII art and there will never be a background. The artstyle works very well, is easy to run and stays at a smooth frame rate of 100fps. Music has a pretty soothing tone to it and fits the game rather well. There are not many tracks but the soundtrack never became a nuisance. Hanging around the main menu without pressing anything will trigger the credits screen, which seems fine but you can not exit the screen without forcing the game to shut down. Whether that is a glitch or intentional it is a pretty big problem.\n\nIt is quite amazing how much they managed to do with the game considering all you do is jump. From sailing across a breeze of wind, to throwing axes at monsters and even mining with one button press works pretty well. The amount of ideas they have from start to end ensure that the game doesn't get stale with it's very simple concept and control scheme. And to top it off the devs plan to add even more levels later on. Proto Raider most likely won't appeal to anyone but puzzle fans. This game does require some precise platforming at times but it most likely won't appeal to platformer fans due to lack of any control besides jumping. Having said that, Proto Raider is a really good puzzle game that requires both brains and reflexes. Looking at the screenshots of the game you may think it is a simple fan project with little content, but you'd be mistaken. This is a fully fledged game with plenty of bang for the buck. Highly recommended to those looking for a forgiving yet difficult  puzzle game.","October 7, 2015","true","6.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","19","22","6","0"

Sort of like a less music based, more RNG, simpler, even more retro aesthetic bit trip runner (sans scrolling screen of course).\n\nTHAT SAID: at its current price it's more than worth it. Even if you only get a few minutes of fun out of it the price is low enough to justify the novelty of the game alone.","August 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","17","23","3","1"

The game will automatically make your character run in a specified direction and you must use your mind to read the task ahead and decide when is the best time to instruct the character to jump. It sounds rather basic explained in this sense but it is a lot more in-depth experience than that.\n\n\nGraphics/Music\nThe graphics are classic ASCII 8 bit inspired lines and dots, to me personally, I find this rather appealing and applaud any game that uses this style. There was plenty of options available in the options screen to ensure you can have as much ASCII graphical pleasure as your inner retro monster desires.\nThe music is nice and has a sort of chillout classic 8bit sound to it, I found from replaying levels and listening to it for a few times it never really grated on me.\n\nPros/Cons\n\nPros\n+ Graphics are very retro ASCII style.\n+ It has the most simple premise of any game but is still so challenging.\n+ A lot of levels keeping you busy for some time.\n\nCons\n- Some puzzles can be over frustrating.\n- Certain boss fights can appear impossible first time round\n\nFinal/Personal Thoughts\nI personally received Proto Raider in a bundle and was unsure what to really expect. I was very happy when I played the game to discover it was a rather simple yet satisfying puzzle game and I was surprised how the developed the game to offer so much on a simple premise.\nIf this is in the sale definitely give this one a shot, it's a good casual time waster if nothing else.","December 22, 2015","true","1.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The controls are pretty tight, the puzzle platforming gets just challenging enough to stave off boredom, and the ascii look is as good or better than most games of its type. Surprising depth involved in the design, too. I love the music most of all. Reminds me a lot of instrumental songs from Air/Lemonjelly/Zero7.

On top of this, the ASCII-style of the game is surprisingly gorgeous, and the music that plays throughout is quite relaxing and beautiful.\n\nIt's not perfect though; the traps you encounter often do not appear to be programmed with set patterns, which sometimes results in unavoidable deaths thanks to sheer bad luck. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it can be a bit frustrating to die several times through no fault of your own.\n\nThat being said, this is a really enjoyable little gem that I'd absolutely recommend to anyone as a fun way to kill an afternoon.","March 2","true","1.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

On one hand it's a neat little game with a look that fits it well. On the other hand RNG in the form of obstacles can make everything a real pain. Objects will still move when you are waiting at the start so most of the time it's just about finding the best time to actually start. I would like to note that these RNG obstacles are not in every level but you will have to complete them to progress. That said I feel I can recommend this game but only with the RNG warning. So if you are the type of person who likes puzzle-platformers and can look past the RNG issue then you might like this game. If RNG makes you get mad quickly then this game is not for you.","March 19","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was nervous on one of the first few stages when crates didn't break or drop at the same speed (and an ASCII 'shard' of one remained and killed me), but by the time you're dealing with 3+ random launches per stage and you can't slow down or "hold" position to dodge, it straight up comes down to "did you begin the level a second too early or late" on whether or not you'll die.","December 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","13","24","4","0"

But someway during development, the rest 20 levels or so got pretty bad, specially the last couple of levels (currently there are 63 levels) and the last boss were really bad. In the last boss fight, there are mice looking things coming down the ceiling and you have to stay close to the golem head to kill it and you can only change direction; at first it might not seem bad but when you actually play it, it's so easy to kill the boss by just staying at one of the edges of the platform and then keep rotating that it's laughable. And the fact that the mice keep coming down after you kill the boss really pisses me off it's so unnecessary.\nTo sum it up, the first levels are good but then they just start to test your patience, become monotonous and just not fun anymore. It gets so frustrating and cheap that I rage quitted a few of times and I beat freaking Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 both the normal and the Scholar of the First Sin edition. So unless they fix these issues and stop going down this path, I can't recommend this game.","March 13","false","4.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You'll need decent reflexes to clear some of the monster-fighting levels, yes. For 90% of the game, though, it's more about figuring out and executing the optimal path through each one-screen level to collect all the treasure and escape.\n\nThe peculiar rules of the game's physics take some getting used to. You can't control how high or far you jump except by timing it so you collide with an obstacle. The jumps themselves use a strange arc that loses all momentum at its peak, dropping you straight down. And though the game's animation moves pixel by pixel, jumps only launch when your character is lined up on a column of the ASCII-styled text grid, leading to a delay in response to your button presses. It's not unfair, exactly, but it requires unlearning old assumptions.\n\nThe closing credits promise more levels in later updates, but what we have here is already an optimal length. My recorded time is what it took to 100% the game, collecting all but red-herring chests. It's perfect for its style, giving you time to learn and master the mechanics while retaining a sense of discovery with the surprises each new level introduces. A worthy purchase at full price or otherwise!","May 29","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
