"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/403670/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nLumber Island – That Special Place is an adventure horror game developed by a single man named Dean Forge using the Unity5 engine. The game was released in October 2015 on Steam.\n\nThe game is played in first person as you explore a derelict island which was once a lush forest,, hence the name Lumber Island.  The game gives no real indication on how to progress out when you begin. You are essentially left to your own devices and have to work out everything yourself. You find clues scattered around the island that point you in the right direction of where to go next or how to progress, but no real in your face objectives. Your character is only armed with a lighter or a flash light in the later levels. Thankfully this isn’t one of those games where you have to manage your batteries or fuel reserves, allowing you to light your way to your hearts content.  Each of the four or so levels have one enemy in – these enemies will kill you as soon as they come into contact with you. You can only run from them in order to escape your demise; you have no form of fighting back.  Most of the game focuses on finding keys and opening doors to the next level; this is cleverly masked by other tasks to make it not seem so dull though.\n\nDue to the game not giving you any clear clues on how to progress at points; you do get the feel that you should be looking to progress just a little bit further than last time when you die. Yes you start right from the beginning from the level, but you can soon catch-up to where you died since you now know how you got there, so you can skip out the time wandering around trying to work out what to do. I really liked that the game gives you no aims – the way it words the clues and notes scattered around means you actually have to read them and take in the information for you to actually understand what is happening.  For those that have played Penumbra, this game has very similar traits to that in this sense.\n\nGraphically, Lumber Island does look really good. As it is running on the Unity5 engine you would expect it to be as of a certain standard, but it does go beyond that standard. The lighting in the game could be done a little bit better; but the poor lighting also adds to the horror effects of the game. The animation of objects and characters in the game are all done well; I had no problems there. I did notice a few texture glitches in walls though, there is a faint flicker where the textures join up, only a slight issue but still can be easily resolved.\n\nThe story in this game is fairly interesting as well, it has a lot of flash back scenes which do become a bit confusing, but it adds to the story as a whole. You can really immerse yourself in the story with the amount of notes and reports around each of the levels; I would highly recommend people take the time to read them to get the most out of the plot here.\n\nLumber Island’s soundtrack is one of the most horrifying I have heard; it keeps you on edge constantly.  Whilst playing people actually had to leave the room because of the music playing in the background was freaking them out so much. On top of the soundtrack, the sound effects also play a huge role in horror games; there aren’t massive amounts of them, but the ones which are in, are produced very well and add to the atmosphere.\n\nAs I have said before, the game gives you no clear objectives, so this can lead to times when you are literally walking around the levels with no clue on what you need to do next. This will probably put a lot of people off straight away, but if you can look past that element, the game actually still has a bit of difficulty when it comes to the enemies you have to overcome. Some of them will rely on you being quick on your feet in order to escape them, the scene in the third level is one of the most memorable horror scenes I can think of in recent memory, and took a number of retries in order for me to actually pass it.\n\nLumber Island’s level design is fantastic, the first stage especially, you have so much to explore and find in the world, whilst also dealing with the main plot. Some of the areas on the map bear no importance to the main story but are still there for you to see and enjoy. A lot of care has gone into creating each of these levels to a really high standard.\n\nI finished the game in just over three hours; this was done completely blind with no aids from walkthroughs, so I was actually quite pleased I managed to do it! The game is completely linear though, so once you finish it, there is no need for a second play through.\n\nTechnically, Lumber Island is a sound game. Yes I wasn’t able to push out 4k graphics with settings on full, but this is a really punishing game on the graphics, but I was able to get a constant 60 FPS when in 1080p on full graphics. A keyboard and mouse was used to play the game due to the first person nature, and the game is definitely best played in a dark room to add to the effect.\n\nLumber Island is a real hidden gem in the Steam store; you really wouldn’t think this was made by just one man, and I applaud him for creating such a great game. The price of £3,99 is absolutely perfect for this type of game. Yes it can be completed in three hours, but would you rather experience a really well done indie title, or have that foot long sub? I know which I would choose….\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's a shame the dev insisted on hiding certain objects or making them quite small as this detracts from the good atmosphere found in each level: thankfully if you're stuck or too frustrated you can find help in the forums or Youtube.\n\nIf you like the genre you'd do much worse than Lumber Island, the game is decent and its story is worth a playthrough at least as long as you don't expect tons of originality.","November 8, 2015","true","1.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacksendary/recommended/403670/","jacksendary","Jacksendary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacksendary/","192 products in account","So I got this game recommended for Halloween and while the atmosphere in the game is super eerie and creepy, the puzzles and bugs of the game just ruined the experience for me.\n\nI were multiple times able to run through objects and wall, and fall out of the map as well as the physics object were super weird. While some puzzles were really interesting and well thought out the majority of them were really hard to figure out and I ended around just clicking everything hoping to find something as there were not really much to go on from other than a few sound or visual clues on some of the puzzles, but those who did have the clues were really nice and seemed to be well thought-out.\n\nThe game does also have a save decent function, and instead of restarting the game from the beginning it only takes you to the beginning of the level. The last level were pretty punishing as you needed to do certain things in a specific order or you'll get kill and restart the level from the beginning!\n\nThe background music were the same 2-3 minute loop over and OVER again for the entire game, and it got really old fast and the few times there were a bit of silence or change to the music it was amazing.\n\nThe main monster; while he were creepy and it did get me a few times, the hiding mechanic makes it so easy to escape it. Instead of the suspense of seeing the monster looking for you to seem to simply reset when to hide and the other "threats" in game were main cheap ♥♥♥ jump scares.\n\nI will say the game is decent and I'd probably not be this critical over it if I haven't paid 5€ for it, to be honest I've played better free horror games that had an equal 2-3 hours play time.\n\nI will however say the ending and the story the games tries to tell is pretty interesting and I've still not entirely figured out what it all means but I probably won't play the game again to find out which is a shame.\n\n\n\nPros:\nNice atmosphere\nInteresting plot\n\nCons:\nMusic gets trivial\nBad Physics/going through walls\nMonster/Jump scares\nThere's better free games\nPuzzles\n\n\nProbably wouldn't recommend this unless you're really running out of things to play.\n","November 1, 2015","false","2.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","1"

(2-3 hours) This hidden gem is quite a treat for horror fans. The level design and atmosphere is amazing and  the game mechanic feels like Amnesia or Penumbra. The HUD is pretty much empty to get the best immersion! You can only walk around and interact or move object around with your cursor.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty logical imo. I didn't stuck at any of those puzzles :) I enjoyed a lot to explore around and move all the objects around to find stuff and solving the puzzles.\n\nI normally lag like hell with max settings on any new game with good visuals but this is one must be very compatible with my old pc.

But, if you treat the game as a "walking simulator", you will enjoy just exploring and moving through the world.\n\nApparently, a sequel is being planned to flesh out the story. As it stands, you'll be left scratching your hand trying to understand how all the parts fit together.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/403670/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Lumber Island- That Special Place is an Adventure game set in a horror setting. Most of your time will be spent exploring and solving odd puzzles like getting a murderer to leave you alone by fetching him his shoes. You play as an unknown entity who you will never see. Not even it's hand is visible when holding a lighter, it just kind of floats on it's own. Starting off you awaken in a nearly abandoned island which is home of a murderous lumberjack that roams these lands. You will have to avoid him as you try to figure out a solution to escape this place. Your character has no means of defending itself and if he is spotted all he can do is flee then hide under a bed, hoping not to be seen. The lumberjack is surprisingly fast so if you spot him close by it may already be too late to flee, in which case he will jam that axe into your head. Dying means starting the area all over which is annoying, however the areas are small and knowing exactly what to do, you can get to where you were before your demise rather quickly. This game has a checkpoint system that also saves the game but you never know when you have reached one. That does make dying feel a lot more frightening though on the other hand you don't know when it is safe to shut down the game without losing any progress.\n\nOne of the first things you will notice when you are given control of your character is how sensitive the camera is. The slightest movement of your mouse will send the camera flying and there is no way to change the sensitivity levels. Camera on the gamepad is more tolerable but still far too sensitive, making it annoying to explore the ares for clues. This is made into a bigger annoyance since many of the puzzles require you to find a small object that you may easily miss and searching every nook and cranny can grow to be a pain. After the first beginning area you can take all the time in the world due to only the first level having an enemy that wanders around. That's not to say your completely safe however, there are a few cheap deaths scattered about that you have no real way of predicting. Strangely enough the first areas of the game have the hardest puzzles and after that they make a lot more sense. Being a Adventure game you have to throw some logic out of the window and remember that you can carry anything from a lever to a entire lever in your pants. There is no way to see what is in your inventory for some odd reason so it is best to play this game uninterrupted or you will more likely than not forget what you were doing.\n\nFrom start to finish this game has a foreboding and creepy atmosphere that has you certain that you will be killed if you take a step further. The lumberjack feels like a very generic enemy that has a sack over his head but the rest of the monsters are very creepy and if you spot one you will not have much time to get more than a glimpse of it's grotesque features before being in serious trouble. You never get a good look at them and are the type of enemies that will surprise attack you and leave you no hope of escape if you wander into a place you shouldn't. There are no indications of what places you shouldn't go in which both makes for cheap deaths and a sense of dread as you are forced to explore to continue. The monsters animations are rather crummy though this works to the game's advantage as their unnatural janky movements add to the sense of eeriness. Your only interaction in this game is a sprint button and a button that picks things up, allowing you to throw them around to find hidden items. Whats rather nice is that you can sprint for as long as you want, unlike many other games where if your character runs more than three feet he will stop to take a rest. You have very little indication of what you are supposed to do but my advise is to look for the teddy bear.\n\nIt is a good looking game and can be rather taxing on your system. I experience occasional frame dips and a certain area near the end of the game had me down to the 30fps range due to all the books in the area that could be interacted with.  This game is dark, very dark. Your lighter draws very little light and most of my time was spent squinting at my monitor hoping to find something that would let me advance. The combination of having to find small items plus being unable to see further than two feet in front of you can be irritating. Another annoyance with the game is the music/ambient sound. It is a very short loop that plays through the entire game and quickly becomes tiresome and funny enough the few instances where it stopped the game felt much scary. In your journey to escape the island you will come across notes that either aid you with cryptic clues or adds backstory to the setting. To be perfectly honest the story completely flew over my head and I understood none of it. I'm sure there is more to it than meets the eye but I left the game more confused than when I started the it.\n\nLumber Island is not a long game by any means. If you are more competent at Adventure games than I am it will likely take you about an hour to complete. It is a low priced game so only you will know if that is a acceptable amount of bang for the buck. The replay value comes in the form of trying to get a grip on the story though that seems unappealing due to having to squint at my monitor some more searching for extra notes I may have missed. I would say it is worth a playthrough as the good outweighs the bad and it is a pretty creepy game. It is the kind of game that has potential but is heavily weighed down by quite a few flaws. It is an Adventure game first and a horror game second as every room seems to have something to find and figure out. None of the areas are large but they will take some brain power and sharp eyes to get through nonetheless. There is very little blood and no gore in this title. It is centered around a few disturbing monsters and psychological trickery to keep you on your guard. When all is said and done Lumber Island is a solid enough Adventure game to recommend to fans of the genre that also enjoy a horror setting.","November 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

But it is a pretty bad game.  It makes no sense.  You wander around in the dark with some murderer out to get you.  If he sees you, you're dead.  You can't hide; he'll get you.  And he must have night-vision goggles.  He can see you before you ever see him coming.  And the only way to stop him is to find a couple of boots and give them to him???  WTF?  How is anybody supposed to figure that out?  Poor game design.  Poor puzzle design.  Great atmosphere.  I'm sorry I wasted money on it though.  Another game for the trash bin.  Put the 3-5 bucks toward a decent horror game like Outlast or SOMA.","December 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It looks amazing, is highly immersive and atmospheric, and has a genuinely intriguing plot...but again, ONLY if you persevere with the first area, which I'll confess even I nearly gave up on (hint: it's not that hard, once you observe the AI for a while and play it super-safe).  Rest assured, though, that your perseverance will definitely pay off.\n\nThere may be a small need for patience right at this point in time, though, as there's definitely some teething technical issues the devs may have to address (optimisation, perhaps?)...though once we're out of THOSE particular woods, which I'm confident we will be...a definite winner on our hands!!\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.","October 3, 2015","true","5.8"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mzcookies/recommended/403670/","mzcookies","Mz Cookies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mzcookies/","342 products in account","NOTE: This review focuses on my personal views on the CONS of the game.\nI must say this game surprised me a bit, straight from the beginning. The graphics are beautiful and the story is interesting and I do recommend it, but I will discuss the two main things that bothered me the most.\n\nYou, as the player start the game with no hints as to what your goal but as you start exploring,  the story begins to unfold and you come accross an intimidating enemy whom at this point - you know nothing about. This can either be taken as a pro or con, but as for me, I would have preferred a little introduction to the game and what I needed to do.\nYou figure out what you need to do from finding notes and interpreting the clues, the puzzles aren't too hard nor easy. Some just require a bit of thought and patience - which I prefer over overly difficult puzzles.\n\nAlthough I said the story is interesting, it needs a little more work, just to fine tune it. It gets a bit confusing, with flashbacks and no narration to give the player a clear understanding of what is going on and how each memory ties in with the main storyline. It seems as if it was the devs idea to encourage individual players interpretation which for me, wasn't done effectivly.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game for just $5. Despite discussing more of the negative aspects of the game, it has a stand-out storyline, eerie setting and beautiful graphics for an indie horror. It's a short game, maybe an hour to an hour and a half playtime but it is worth it!","November 29, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","7"

Within the first minutes I had already experienced an issue due to not having a mouse cursor (or any control) in the game.  I tried both keyboard & mouse, arrows, xbox controller and nothing would help.  Others in the discussion forum has had the same problem without any help, I fixed it by running the game in compatibility mode for windows vista.  After about thirty minutes I had experienced another couple of bugs.  After browsing the forum and game reviews seeing all of the bugs that many had no fix, I decided to wait and hope that further fixes will make this game playable.\n\nThe graphics in the game look pretty good and set a great erie atmosphere.  The game ran flawless and felt optimized in that area.  The sound and background music really had me excited feeling the bass run through my body while wearing headphones.","January 23","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is honestly just insane how good the game looks, how smooth the mechanics are, and how much detail there is. The story is fun and makes you constantly wonder what will happen next. The scares are great, and the atmosphere of the game is just downright creepy. The game took me about 6 hours to complete, and I had to look up atleast 5 youtube videos to walk me through it.
