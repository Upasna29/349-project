I have played games that were free to play that are many times better than this, and from my first hour in game, I can't reccommend this at all. I will however, continue playing, and perhaps things will get better and I didn't just waste 30$\n\nEdit: All right, after.. approximately 30-40 more minutes after first impressions, I decided I couldn't take it anymore (partially because the camera is awful, but also because I seemed to have fallen through the floor...)\n\nAnyway, the game is not good, and especially for the asking price, I would say don't buy this game unless you literally have nothing better to do. Even if the devs are the greatest people in the world, and they could be, this game is pretty awful.\n\nToo much running time between encounters, pretty much empty maps, junk crafting mecahnics (in that it's incredibly time consuming and there's no way to craft multiples at a time.. just have to click one by one) make this game.. Well, pretty awful in my opinion.\n\nThe entire thing would have worked better as a jrpg with pixels, and the game certainly feels like an (old) jrpg with pxiels and awful camera... in 3d.\n\nSo yea, I would highly reccommend against buying this, unless you'd like to be generous and give the devs a donation. Haven't tried the other package (battle tactics, or chess) and that could be better, but I would definitely pan the primary game itself.\n\nEdit 2: Since people are clearly not finding this review helpful either via bias or because they think I need more information, let's update this review again.\n\nWhy Combat is Bad: Combat is basically sitting next to a monster and using auto attacks on it. Each auto attack is 3 mana. In between auto attacks, you have the option to use one of the skills you have unlocked which consume more mana and do extra damage as compared to an auto attack. (Or use one of the hp/mana consumables) While this is acceptable for something like a jrpg, in a format such at this game, it leads for very dull, uninteresting combat where you sit around and wait for cooldowns to pop up before clicking on a button.\n\nI suppose one could compare this to many themeparks on the market, but for this game it's especially bad because the graphics are lack luster. On the flipside, the simplicity means that anyone can understand combat after a few minutes of it, so the game has that going for it.\n\nAnother gripe I have (minor, really) is that hp/mana do not regenerate out of combat. You must use consumables to restores these stats, or walk into a glowing barrier like thing, where upon you get teleported to the entrance of the zone with full health, but the same amount of mana.\n\nThe crafting of consumables is easy, but because the crafting menus don't allow for producing more than one 'set' at a time, you end up sitting at the npc's who craft (Yes, your character does not actually craft, as far as I can tell), for a long time, reptitively clicking "craft->main menu_>craft->main menu" until you can finally craft either mana packs or health packs, which each require at minimum 6 clicks, as far as I can tell.\n\nNow, all of this is bad, but what compounds all of it and makes it worse is the maps.\n\nThe maps are HUGE, giant!... And very, very empty. Now, I could be completely wrong about this because I didn't spend much time exploring any of the maps, but the maps seem to be huge just to be huge, with 2-3 monster spawns of each enemy 10-15 seconds away from each other. This is annoying at best, especially given that either running or walking is relatively slow, there's no eye candy to explore, and the camera is jerky and takes some time to get used to.\n\nSo then, we have bad combat, irritating crafting, giant, empty maps, and bad cameras.\n\nAnything else I'm forgetting..?\n\nAh quests. Quests are generic kill monsters here, or find the npc. Nothing intuitive about them, and they use all the worst aspects of the game to complete (combat and moving from place to place).\n\nGathering is acceptable, albeit very lackluster in that you walk up to a box and click gather. You wait a few seconds and then the resources are in your inventory. Wait about 15 seconds before gathering the same type of node again, because otherwise the boxes will be marked as 'empty' (No, they don't despawn).\n\nI think that should just about cover why I thought this game was bad, and I hope others find this more helpful now that I've gone over the game more in depth.\n\nAs a side note, I will say the game would have made a perfectly good jrpg, but the game attempts to be a jrpg in 3d format and... does so very badly.","April 4, 2015","false","1.6"," 74 of 107 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","74","107","4","4"

Reason I say this is the basics like camera control and key board config is just a plain mess. They insist on using mouse button to control the camera but it also the move button to. And the camera zooms around at fastest setting no way to scale it down. So in combat you end up looking at undersides of monsters you fite or at random things as  you move thrue the map.Then you got the keyboard setup that just dont work. They use the F1-12 keys and so does steam.  Set something on f12 and was taking screen shots and healing.They use a key layout that was used 10+ years ago and even then they place a odd key to throw you off. Then you got the targeting for monsters its so small of a area to click you miss it all the time with the camera like it is. If you want to see it at its worst try clicking on the quest manager its maddening at times. As it stands would not have bought this if there where more reveiws.","February 27, 2015","false","1.0"," 63 of 99 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","63","99","7","3"

Ugly graphics, sounds and terrible controls. I don't think there is anyone online. You are just dropped in to the game and the told to find all these people in town. You then go talk to them and run back. This sounds easy enough if you knew where to go and could click on the fricking npc (same button as guided walking and I kept missing the npc).

Seems they changed the name, don't know why but it's shorter and easier to say so that is a plus. Nothing has really changed but the name and logo it seems. There are a few new points I think I can say about this game now.\n\n- I like it. It is fun. Simple, playable, addictive (once given a chance).\n- The game design is bad some of the complaints from other players are not exaggerated, some are, but others will agree the game has some design flaws (I don't want to get into that atm but the game is very much playable and a lot better than other indie titles).\n- No players, no community wtf.\n\nOn the leader board I see some players at high levels that I'm struggling at level 15. It would have been nice to have veteran involvement in the community to inspire activity. Also the leader board needs updating as it doesn't work well. I don't really care for achievements but it would have been nice to have that actually working.\n\nWith all that said, I had to change my review back to recommend because I actually like this more than a lot of aaa titles I'm currently playing and other mmos I completely abhor. For this reason, I feel compelled to reconsider my opinions of this game but I will still speak strongly about a few things that you should keep in mind:\n\n- I don't believe this game will ever get popular. Don't expect this to ever be an mmo.\n- I think the server should be released so that other players can host their own games, THAT COULD BE AWESOME!\n- This game has a future as far as community involvement if the developers give the game to players to host, modify scripts etc. As it currently stands, I don't see how it can gain user interest.\n\nOlder Reviews\n--------------------\n\nEdit Review: Sorry but I had to change my review to NOT recommend. This game had potential but nothing here has seemed to really change. The community is dead. As far as the game play is concerned, there are a few flaws that needs to be looked into but no real updates since I played this game last has been made.\n\nI like this developer's other games but this one seems abandoned. If something changes here that makes me want to play it again, I'll update the review.\n\nNOTE: Some of these negative reviews are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but some of the other palyers make the same points I do. It's a decent game with some flaws (nothing that can't be looked into) and a dead community.  In this state it's a no go for me. Check out Fasaria World Online which is a lot better than this and it's just a turn based browser game. A lot of time was put into that game and looks like it has a future. I have no idea why the developers dropped the ball on this game. So sad.\n\nPrevious Review: No subs. Thanks for that. Ancients of Fasaria is pretty interesting thus far. It has a futuristic/fantasy and unique flare about it that I like. Not bad at all for an indie team. I'm interested to see how this game develops.","January 18, 2015","true","9.2"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Full of glitches that cause your character to move and stop in random places. No fall damage that I could find even jumping off a 5 story castle window gives you no damage. The map layouts were done in a rush you can tell by the lack of detail. Then you have to run from one side , talk to a person, and then run all the way back to complete a quest is just un-needed effort for nothing. I give this game a -2 out of 10 . I gave it this based on how much I payed for the game 40 bones when the game, even if the glitches were fixed, is worth no more than 4.99 with all dlc included.

Wasn't too sure about some of the reviews and feedback to make a final decision.

The game play is pretty smooth, the character progression is nice and the rewards great. It seems like there is a lot to do and the game is easy to learn as I never felt like I didn't know what to do or where to go.\n\n*I'm not one to try to over sell or under grade a product's worth as everyone's taste is different.

These imbeciles went to my profile and negative voted most my reviews. BTW i don't give a flying f about my review ratings, but if you do, don't be afraid of these idiots, just keep the review private, it will still affect the game rating.

I tested this game years ago when this solo developer project started.  The single player game and the original browser game was fun, though the browser game was a bit of a money grab project for those who did more than play it casually.\n\nReasons why you shouldn't buy this game:\n\n- Storyline feels like it was written by a middle school child.\n- Controls are horrible, worse than old school EQ1, and yes that is very bad.\n- Graphics are just as bad as a game that was created back in early 2000's (EverQuest 1, Dark Age of Camelot (before graphics overhaul, etc)\n- Gameplay is clunky as hell and delayed reactions of every skill as if the server actually a person's laptop that is about 7 years old.\n\n\nOverall the quality of this game should make it worth about $1.00, if that.  As I said before, this is a single person developer project and was developed years ago.  Why this game was revived with absolutely no new additions, no new graphics, no new anything is beyond me.\n\nOne other thing I must add is that the developer of this game, Thywill (or something close to that), does approach purchasers to request that they write positive reviews. Offers forum positions and moderator positions in the various amatuer games as a reward, aka bribing.  Out of all of the positive reviews this game has, there is probably only 1, maybe 2, crazy people who think this is a good game.

Not much has changed as far as user interest or community growth.\n\nTrolls. I mean who wants to be part of a community where people either hate your game or speak ill of it.

In spite of what seems to be a negative observation, I have not reversed my positive review because I believe it is a good game that never got the love or appreciation it deserved. The game has some flaws but was great fun while it lasted.\n\nGet the game provided you wouldn't feel jaded by a rather lack luster community experience.

The game has different areas to explore and things to do that makes the game very interesting. Ancients of Fasria is also casual. For me that is the best thing. I got into the game very easily and quickly and I like the fact that the learning curve is easy although there are lots of things to master.\n\nMissions are awesome but Questing needs a lot of work. Although questing is simple, it requires more work having to do one quest at a time. When you don't complete a quest, you have to go back to the quest master to start the quest again. In spite of this, questing is still lucrative and I still like to do them. Missions are the best. You collect parts, craft them and turn them in. Need I say more? Simple but effective.\n\nBattles were surprisingly very well done. The salvation/damnation skill was a nice addition. The enemies though can do annoying things at times like turn their back to you or get out of range while still attacking. Even with these issues, the battles are still exceptional and very rewarding,\n\nThe drops, items and gear are what makes this game come together. It sometimes feels like a dungeon crawler like game. You defeat mobs and get the goods. The best part are these dragons and elites you can find in caves and just run them over and over again. You reset to the start after you defeat them but you get platinum tokens, these special gift boxes, mission points and karma. The rewards are very nice.\n\nTo conclude, Ancients of Fasaria is rewarding with lots to do. Also, you only pay once. If you don't get far when you play this game the first time, who cares, you can come back anytime you want.

Unfortunately, the actual game is bad. The writing is bad. The interface is bad. The level design is bad. The grinding is bad. You need to walk everywhere, even to the next planet (even if you have wings), and while you can "run", if you did it any slower it'd look like the moonwalk. The glitches are bad (had to quit the game 4 times). The NPCs are bad (there's an attribute NPC you have to seek out when you level to upgrade your stats; it's not a skill trainer, just gives you a choice of upgrading Att/Def/HP/Mana). The quests are triple bad ("bring me 10 rats" means you have to kill the 2 actual rats in the level 5 times each -- and you have to walk there - and there's no point to kill other mobs on the way there because you can only have one quest open at a time). There's no main quest line to advance, only mission points, and you grind them; you can actually advance by running around your base repeatedly opening the same boxes (they even have a visible cooldown) and then crafting with the stuff you found and turning the result in. Did I mention the crafting is bad (twice so because of the interface)? You can't craft any equipment, and none drops.\n\nThe developer is friendly and posted a nice reply to my original short review, which is why I put in the hours to create another character, played to complete the first zone and then some more to peek into zone 3, wrestle with the end boss of zone 2, and and get my first set of wings. I feel I have a pretty good grasp of the game by now. However, the execution is such that it suffers from bad design decisions everywhere. I haven't found a single aspect of this game that didn't have something wrong with it, except maybe the soundtrack and the way potions scale as you level (via your pharmacy skill). In all of my hours playing, I saw one other player (the game's on a bundle that sold well over 1000 copies), so I can't comment on the party system or the chat.\n\nI have to admit this game has all of the fascination of a pileup on the motorway. As with a clicker game, you can get into it and go through the motions thinking "wtf" all the way, knowing you're playing a bad game and still continuing precisely because it is so predictable and requires little thought or skill. But why would you want to when you could play other RPGs that outclass this one in just about every respect?\n\nDon't.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review is an updated version of my original "first impression" piece that you'll find below.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst impression: Terrible online RPG.\n\nThe controls are unlike any other RPG, it's full of modal dialogue boxes, I got a beginners quest that made me die a lot and run out of mana, I get some beginner's skills that have complicated conditions that apply to using them, the world seems to lack detail, and I have no idea what I'm doing or why.\n\nWhy would I want to play this?\n\nAddendum: The "official server" is hosted off a dyndns service (no-ip.com), and I can't connect right now. "Singleplayer" means PvE, and it can be upgraded to "multiplayer" (PvP) later, but not vice versa.
