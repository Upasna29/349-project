"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harshlycritical/recommended/446910/","harshlycritical","HarshlyCritical","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harshlycritical/","444 products in account","(Full Disclosure: The developer is a friend of mine and I provided some voice acting in this game. With that said, I can recommend this game in good conscience because I think it's genuinely fun, challenging and well-designed. It has a lot more content than many of its survive-the-night peers like Wick, Emily Wants To Play and Sophie's Curse, to boot.)\n\n"Night Blights" is a survive-the-night game that combines Five Nights at Freddy's time management with 3D exploration. You play as a child, seeking to protect their family from home invasion by pesky, hungry Blight monsters who would love to eat your family but will settle for eating toys instead - provided you feed them in time. The game features seven levels in the core campaign, plus a survival mode and unlockable extras via a star rating system for each level.\n\nI've played a lot of games in this style, some of which I mentioned in the disclaimer. Night Blights is, by far, the most content-rich of all of them. Each level brings new threats to the fold - on the first night, you'll have just a couple things to keep track of. By the second, you'll have a couple more. By the third, a couple more.\n\nThe objectives stack as new areas of the house are unlocked, and it provides a decent challenge curve without growing repetitive. With each new challenge comes a wrench to your previous strategy, and winning subsequent nights requires adjustment.\n\nLike any game, Night Blights is not flawless. The platforming (Yes, there is platforming - one of the many ways this game stands out from its peers) is a little rough, and grabbing objects like toys or stools can feel too slippery. Minor complaints and personal frustrations aside, the game controls magnificently overall for a two-dev game that tries to do as much as Night Blights does.\n\nCouple things before closing out: 1) This is not supposed to be a super-serious horror game. The main attraction for the game is gameplay and fun. 2) If you played the free GameJolt version of this game released last summer - Yes, the Steam version is MUCH different and is definitely worth $5.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to anyone who like this style of gameplay. Come one, come all, disenfranchised FNAF fans! In all seriousness, "Night Blights" is much more than its time-management mechanics. At its core, it is a fun, light-hearted B-movie homage that was treated with plenty of care and attention to detail, and features more than enough content to warrant the price tag.","April 17","true","9.0"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","52","58","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/recommended/446910/","SkyeF","Flutter Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/","413 products in account","Night Blights is a "Horror" Game, which at first glance looks really similiar to FNaF4, however it came out originally before FNaF4 did, and the game itself is completely different.\n\nI've originally played this game when it was released on Gamejolt, and it was a really great experience. The Steam version is a lot more polished, has more features, and is in general a lot better, that's why I recommend buying it.\n\nNow, the "horror" here isn't supposed to be taken COMPLETELY seriously. The game can be scary, however it focuses more on gameplay mechanics, that being scary. So if you're looking for the same horror experience  like in Amnesia or SOMA, you're out of luck.\n\nNow, each night of the game, it becomes harder, and more ways for the Blights to enter your house are added. You will have to take strategies to where organize the toys, which path should you take first if a Blight is about to enter from 2 different entrances, and such. The fact that you have to constantly do things, or you will die, is giving a lot of tension to the game, making it more exciting, and adds to the scary factor. This game, I can guarantee, is not a jumpscare fest.\nDuring the nights, various things can happen, such as a painting falling, or a Blight just staring at you from the top of a staircase. These little things add a lot to games like this, and make it a lot better.\nThere's also a Survival mode and Free Roam mode here, which gives the game more replayability, so you can come back to it just to play for fun and try to survive the longest.\n\nIn other words, Night Blights is a Horror game which focuses more on the gameplay factor than the horror, and in result provides great gameplay, with simple, yet good mechanics.\n\nSo if you like the FNaF Games, or just want a small bit of scares, I recommend this game greatly. I only have less than a hour on Steam as of right now, but I spent a lot of time on the Gamejolt version, and I definitely say its worth it.","April 15","true","6.3"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

I however can say that. I have beta tested this game for the developers many times and have gave some ideas which could possibly be in the game.\n\nThis game is great fun and for the price of it youre 100% going to get your money worth. This game has a good and in depth story line in which you have to defend your home and family against the dreaded Night Blights until the morning. But be carefull! They will try and get in from every window and escape from the cupboards and under your bed to eat your family.\n\nThe art work in this game is awesome, their are a lot of Easter Eggs for you to find but the theme is deffinatley scary and it does make you look behind you a few times. I have had some scary moments playing this game as well as great fun. I dont want to give away a lot of details.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to everyone who wants a game they can either pick up and play now and again or someone who loves the in depth fear factor of gaming.\n\n10/10","April 15","true","0.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Probably one of the best Indie games on Steam. Night Blights is fun, its challenging, and it is way more polished than other games like it. This is not a jump scare simulator and it is not a super serious horror game. Also, this is not a FNAF rip off or a "puzzle horror" game that becomes easier once you figure out the pattern. Night Blights is a fun and slightly creepy survive-the-night game that will most likely scare you at some point.  It is worth every penny of the $4.99 price. I give it maybe a week before this thing blows up, so buy it now before it goes viral and the price goes up.","April 15","true","4.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's honestly not quite as "scary" as I'd hope for, but its pretty fun trying to survive the nights and protect your little baby bother.  Each night of the week gets progressively harder with more things to watch for being added each night such as shutting the toilet if a blight tries to come up through the toilet, and bellowing the fire to keep them from coming down the chimney.  Gotta stay alive each night from 11pm to 7am, and it keeps you busy!  ..No just standing there waiting like in the first FNAF.  It's fun!\n\nAlso the book that you read is awesome and fun to read as it talks about the new threats each night in a cool poetic fashion.\n\nEasily worth the $4.99 USD asking price!  One of the better FNAF games I've played on Steam!

Usually when games scare me, especially when jumpscares are normal, I either just watch it and admire it from afar, or play it for a little bit before just stopping and and end up not playing it that much. With this game however, I find it to be so fun and challenging that I'll risk the jump scares because I feel like it's worth it when I survive the night. I also love the little easter eggs that are in the game. Everytime I play it, I find a new one and I just admire that the time was taken just to put a little easter egg like it in the game. The only complaint I have is that I can't look further down because if I stand right next to a toy, I have to walk away in order to pick it up. This is a major problem when I have to give a toy to a blight immediately, but I have to take the time just to step back and pick it up instead of looking more down and getting it. Other than that, the game is absolutely wonderful and I'm glad I bought it.","April 22","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You're not going to see any changes in the mechanics of the game, the core is still there. Which is a great thing. Gary has worked his ♥♥♥ off to get this game where it is, and it shows! Gary and I have become good aquantinces, so I've been able to see this game come from where it began, to being a popular game on Steam and I could not be more proud.\n\nYou take the roll of a child at night, trying to protect your family from the Night Blights. To do this, you need to keep wardrobes closed and the blights fed using your toys. As you progress through the night, this is going to become more and more difficult with more mechanics being added. To add to that, the more you run..the more tired you get. If you let yourself get too tired, you will fall asleep. Ending the game and everyone dies.\n\nThe jumpscares are completely random based on how you manage your time and energy. So you can't telegraph when the next scare is coming. This really is a gem of a game, and I hope that Gary and Trapdoor games does extremely well with the new release.\n","April 24","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
