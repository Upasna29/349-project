I love these crazy sim games, and I love forklifts. This game is decent and it is fun... for the most part. It is not 2014 video game era material. It is unpolished, unoptimized, and slightly buggy.\n\nPros:\n1. A good forklift sim. Plenty of different forklifts and I want to say they are realistic but I've never actually driven a forklift. The controls are good on the forklifts themselves.\n2. Good selection of levels. Five different levels gives you a decent selection and for the most part they are well designed. However, the one's I played there were a few bugs in them that were quite annoying, like the map was way wrong.\nThat pretty much does it for pros.\nCons:\n1. Horrible grammar. I know this was made by I believe Germans but still, some text is unreadable.\n2. No tutorial. Seriously, all sims need a tutorial.\n3. Controls. You cannot remap your controls and honestly that is my biggest con of the whole game. It would be fine if the controls were mapped to a different spot but where they are at now is completely counter-productive. My mouse is perfect for forklift controls but I can't map them. Also there isn't even a control layout on the settings page, I had to press every key on my keyboard to find out the controls until I pressed F1 and it brought up all the controls.\n4. Poor graphics. Overall they are not terrible but these little things make it bad. No driver for your forklifts, no collisions with the people walking around, and even though I have an old laptop it run's pretty bad, even worse for some levels and points of view.\n\nOverall 5/10. I like games like this and honestly I had been waiting for this exact game. I have Forklift Sim 2009 and I'm not sure it is by the same people but this one is a lot better. Still there is work to be done and I think a lot of the issues could be easily fixed. But, as I've read in the community hub, this developer doesn't actually finish their games, which is very sad because these games have so much potential. When you look at Euro Truck Sim 2, it could easily be a shoddy, unfinished game but instead it has modding, seamless controls, amazing graphics, and a great fanbase. This one could be like that but the developers don't want to and it is very sad to see.","February 25, 2014","false","2.4"," 100 of 128 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","100","128","0","2"

Need I say more?\n\nWell actually yes. After staring at the sky for all of 5 seconds you notice as exciting as it is how the strength of light from the sun may alter if clouds go over it you notice it to be just as linear as the rest of the game, but that WAS the most impressive thing I found about this game. In fact after not too long I had succumbed to driving around the car park guessing the make and model of the small variation of cars parked there just to get a kick out of the game.\n\nThis is another game that works in the true typical style of other mundane task simulator games that have come before it. Many years after the creation of Forklift Truck Simulator we've been given this game, which honestly doesn't offer that much more than that game did all those years ago. With the addition of slightly improved graphics and a couple more levels and forklift choices it feels like a pretty similar game, and not worth even the discounted price it's currently going for.\n\nWait for it to reluctantly include itself in a game bundle somewhere if you must have it, but otherwise I'd save your hard earned cash for something else.","February 25, 2014","false","1.3"," 49 of 70 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","49","70","0","1"

I did not enjoy playing this game! Because the game doesn't work - loads falling off the forklift for no reason etc..\n\n-- I have a lot of experience with these types of vehicles both in real like and in other games like farming-simulator. So, I think I am well qualified to review this game.\n\n--The first pallet truck in the store was OK, yet I was enourmously annoyed with the game makers, because they send you all the way back to the start if you fail. (I just moved onto the next vehicle I had unlocked).\n\n--Its totally unreasonable to ask us to do all of those jobs again. just because you failed one time trial by 1 second. Yep. That was it for me.. I lost count of all the jobs I'd done, there were that many, so I guess I must have been somewhere near the end if there is an end to this game.  No-way am I doing all of that again..\n\nNext - I hate the time trial aspect of games like this. it shows little imagination, when the only option they give you is time trial. If this is a 'simulator' the makers should know that speed is not the primary issue. Saefty is. I worked in a warehouse once. If pallets needed to be moved, a reasonable time would be given - Simple as that.. In this game, I failed because the game only gave me about 7 minutes to move three pallets from inside to outside in the car park.\n\n-Plus I was already outside, (damn it). - failing by just one second and having to restart at the very begining. Nope - stupid useless game...\n\nThen when I got onto the next vehicle; the forklift truck - (I know how to drive one in real life), I know about tilt and carrying the load low etc.. (I held a side lift licence for four years)!!!..  Yet - try lifting the load up to the shelf! It won't go . besides the load creeping forwards whilst you are driving - or not being able to get the pallet on the forks in the first place, the last straw is when you try to life at the destination.  As your forks go up- the load creeps off the the forks - This is impossible in Real Life. Basic angle and gravity dictate it.  The game is flawed and stupid..\n\nYet this Funking load still persists to creep further and further until it falls off the forks. Its a stupid fail - that should never happen.. This game is NOT WORKING for that reason..  Talk about broken. Now I know why it was only £1.74 I still feel robbed and let down at that.. But never mind - its only £1.74 - but the price isn't the point..\n\nNow I know why all those other commentors were saying this is a pile of crap - (because it is). It would have been great - if it actually worked.. If the forks don't actually lift - then the game is a fail - isn't it?\n\nBasically, I usually enjoy this type of game. My first thoughts when I read what other people were saying about this game, (all were negative), was that, perhaps people should have to pre-qualify themselves to be able to comment on a game like this, by having had played other similar games.\n\nMy thoughts are, that perhaps, the developers of any game should be able to set an experience level, attained (hours) playing other games that are similar to theirs..  Like I love Farming Simulator - yet people claim it is boring - but then they usually play COD or GTA5 - So sure - they are going to find it boring after playing fast paced games like that..\n\nIn a similar way - its why old farts who cannot play COD, BF and GTA5 should not be allowed to comment on them, because these multiplayer encounters are just too quick for them. They don't enjoy their game and then give the game or other p[layers a bad comment.. I see it all the time...  I know, as I am one of those older players. But I can actually play and am usually in the top three if not first in COD and BF MP matches..\n\nBut - my point is, that I do see peole my own age; who cannot play -  marking games like COD and BF down as crap.. I think its the same with this type of game.. Only opposite...  The younger people - who play the fast paced games like COD etc, will always shoot down games like this and games like farming simulator, Train Simulator, ETS2 etc..\n\nOnly - after saying all of that - I'll admit it.. - This game SUCKS! Don't waste your money.. What a shame!\n","June 16, 2015","false","6.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The first thing that hits you is the exceptional, laid-back, atmospheric, synth driven music that reminds me of Tangerine Dream and provides a psychologically potent contrast to the busy work environment.\n\nSome of the levels are also are a true joy to drive around, in particular the various buildings in the production facility, although the technical standard of the graphics is nothing to get excited about and there's a nasty amount of pop-in.  The tasks are varied enough to keep you interested. They are chosen randomly so that each time you play the level, you will be moving boxes from different places. This is a questionable idea for the time attack mode, as it introduces an element of luck instead of it being pure skill, but this randomness does work for the the main game where you are given a time limit and you get given more time when you complete the task. For both modes, it can keep you engrossed in a level for a lot longer than you would expect and keeps them replayable.\n\nThe free play mode is not great. You can move some boxes around, create a few walls, fail in your attempts to create stonehenge and create some crude pixel art, but ultimately it isn't minecraft, the pieces aren't designed for this purpose. It doesn't allow for great amounts of creativity and so you will find yourself spending the majority of time in the modes that give you structure and a reason to be there.\n\nSadly, as much as I wanted to like this game, and as much as I would have liked it if the implementation was done correctly, there were some problems that mean I can't really recommend it.\n\nThe biggest problem that I had with the game was the poor implementation of box physics... This is something that is fairly essential to get right in a game about moving boxes with a forklift truck. When raising or lowering a box, gravity seems to effect it only in steps, so you can lower the forklift just a small amount and it will not move the box, it will be hovering in the air (it could be a problem to do with raising and lowering when tilted). You will see these problems in the jerking movements of the boxes and it can sometimes lead to unfair failures, particularly in the last port level where it is extremely noticeable and exaggerated due to the size of the containers. You can pick up a crate in this level, tilt backwards, notice that the crate remains totally unmoved, move the forklift down a bit so it is hovering in the air and then you can even drive off with it remaining magically unmoved in the air until you are totally clear, at which point it will drop to the floor.  Boxes also don't seem to have much weight, your forklift will happily pick up huge crates and even stacks of crates upon crates without causing balance issues.\n\nAs good as the music is, there are only three tracks.\n\nYou can drive straight through people... Not a huge deal as it's not a game about killing, but other games like Driver handle this by having pedestrians at least attempt to avoid the vehicle instead of walking straight through it.\n\nAltogether, it showed some promise, but given the poor implementation, it is difficult to recommend at full price. The only reason to buy it is because of the soundtrack and the fact that there aren't many other games to choose from that are about forklift trucks.","July 28, 2014","false","11.9"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

It seems that not a lot of thought went into the game as far as as I can see.  There is no tutorial to begin with, so that the player is forced to experiment to see what keys control what actions.  I don't think that there is a save function, again without a tutorial it's hard to tell.  Backing up is a challenge due to only 1 camera angle with a limited range of view.   I also find it annoying that the player morphs right through by-standers who simply wander around aimlessly .  The tasks seem to endlessly repeat themselves with only minor variations.  I assume that there are other venues and forklifts in the game, but unfortunately I lost patience and interest in the game long before I reached that point.   This is not the first game from this publisher to leave me frustrated and disappointed.

I feel like I really have a dead end job at Costco or Walmart. I even have pleanty time during the tasks to horse around, before doing what I am meant to do - just like in a real warehouse. It'a almost as if this is an actual training simulator for those that work at such places. You can totally ignore and drive through people - like they often do in real life - but without consequences such as death or bodily injury. If you have never worked in a warehouse, I suggest getting this game. It's an amazing experience that most people choose to pass up - and now I know why! You too can have this amazingly boring experience in your life - every day. I can't wait to come home from my exciting day job, just to experience my new mind numbing game job.","April 10, 2014","true","2.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

Very realistic. I used to be an FLT driver and all i can say is WOW! Spot on, great job, this is so realistic, it would be useful if this was included in the FLT training program for would be drivers.\n\nThe graphics are very good for a recent game, the shadow and lighting effects really push my 770 Lightning to the max limiting my performance to a mere 50FPS (Its that demanding!) The collisions need some work though, as the character models seem to go strait through you? (Could this be looked into?) The music is very calming, but i would have liked the ingame option to select a different track or two. Cant find the save feature either? The controls are easy to use after a few pallets, The multiple buttons can seem a bit daunting to FLT novices! Press F1 ingame to display them ;)\n\nOverall id give this 4 out of 5, it would get the 5 if those discrepancies i mentioned were fine tuned, but for any simulation fan this is a must! Perhaps a quick in-game Tutorial guide for new FLT drivers could improve sales also?\n","March 27, 2014","true","0.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","9","17","3","2"

Physics?  Pfft, not in this game!  Heck, you can't even run down the multitudes of people wandering around.  You go right through them!  The missions are grab a pallet from one spot, drop it somewhere else on the map.  That's it.  That's all.  There's no shipping manifests.  There's no store management.  There's no warehouse inventories.  All you do is grab the flashing red pallet, and put it in the flashing blue square.  That's not all though.  To up the challenge you can do timed trials to see how fast it can be done!  Oh, and don't forget the exciting FREE MODE which has no objectives at all and just dumps you in the warehouse to move pallets around as much as you please!...  This game got boring after about 5 minutes.  Thank God I purchased it in a bundle with some other games I actually like.  If you're getting this in a bundle, then fine, do so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/billzo987/recommended/273940/","billzo987","[FM] Billy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/billzo987/","429 products in account","Warehouse and Logistics Simulator Review\n\nFirstly to start of this is my first proper review and it's for this game i know kind of strange right?\n\nWarehouse and Logistics Simulator is a simulation game developed by the team at app2fun. This is a single-player only game and is currently at the time of writing this review available for £3.73 in the UK but its full price is usually £10.99.  This game was released on the 25th February 2014 on steam and has received many mixed reviews. Some people have said that " its the kind of games old ppl love 10/10" and others have said "WTF nothing like a real fortlift 0/10". I will give my options on the game.\n\nFirstly when you are taken to the in-game menu you are greeted with a quite poorly designed menu with some very bad music that is on loop. The Menu has only a few buttons these are: Standard Game, Time attack, Free Play, Options, Credits and Quit game. I shall now go down the menu in this order reviewing each part.\n\nStandard Mode\n\nStandard mode is the main part of the game in which you can unlock the different areas. When you click on the standard mode you are presented with the different areas with different forklifts, There are a total of 5 different areas in the game these include a department store, high bay warehouse, production facility, construction site and a port. These are all locked at the beginning of the game apart from the department store. When you load the game you see at the top of the screen a score counter and a time counter. In this mode you are instructed to go and collect and take pallets of objects to the designated area in a certain amount of time. If you do around what i believe is 3 pallets you get a new task which is the same and eventually you unlock the next area.\n\nTime Attack mode\n\nThis is the same concept as before but instead of working to unlock different areas all you are instructed to do is transport as many good and pallets as possible in the specified time.\n\nFree Play mode\n\nThis is as simple as it gets all this mode is, is as stated no rules or time limit, and to go around as you please.\n\nOptions\n\nThe options menu is very very simple and very lacking any customisable options. The game options allow you to choose from 6 different languages English, German,French,Spanish,Italian and Polish. The option menu also allows for not very many graphical options. You can choose from high, medium and low graphics quality, anti aliasing on or off, SSAO on or off and HDR on or off. You can also choose the resolution up to 1080p but sadly there is no windowed mode button.  Finally there are different options for the audio such as Overall volume, Music Volume. Oh and there is also mouse sensitivity and invert y-axis. This options menu is very disappointing especially since it doesn’t contain and control configuration but the game has very basic controls. W,A,S,D for moving the forklift. Up,Down,Left,Right for operating the forks and then 1,2,3 for the different camera angles.\n\nCredits\n\nStandard credits.\n\nQuit\n\nThat’s up to you.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall i would say this game is only for those who are desperate to play a forklift simulator as this has no unique selling points and even at that i would say only buy this is it is on sale as this game is a very lacking game. Only featuring 5 areas, bad spelling within the descriptions such as in free play mode “transport as many good as you life". This game feels as if it was rushed or just ported over to steam to try and make a bit more money. I wouldn’t recommend this as there are other fantastic simulators such as Euro Truck Simulator 2. I would only recommend this is you are a diehard simulator fan or are very bored and looking for a laugh or two.\n\nRating: 4/10","June 23, 2014","false","2.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Not only is it keyboard only, but the physics are terrible on it.  It is pretty sad when I can get under a pallet perfectly, ease it off the shelf, and then as I am lowering the pallet it just falls THROUGH the forks and hits the ground - destroying the pallet and costing me pretty much any points earned in the round.\n\nI've also operated plenty of forklifts in real life, and have never personally encountered any spacial displacement anomalies that caused pallets to fall through physical forks to their doom.\n\nThe only good thing this little game has going for it is the steering isn;t that bad, considering it is keyboard only and you cannot use a steering wheel with it.  But for the price, I'd pay ... maybe 3 dollars for the main game and another buck for the DLC ... but in my opinion it definitely was not worth the 13 bucks I spent on it (purchased both game and DLC to check it out).\n\nFortunately, Steam protects these purchases so I am going to apply for a refund from Steam for this.

It is not worth anything at all. It is a shame because the forklift models look nice and are easy to control.
