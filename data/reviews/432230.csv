I really liked this action game!\nThe graphics are terrific, I really liked the characters,\nand the monsters, the general setting is classic fantasy but cartoonish.\nThe music is terrific too! really good and seems real nes hardware involved!\nWhat I really liked is the option to play up to 3 players, a must-have for a good laugh with friends.","May 29","true","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
