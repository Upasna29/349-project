"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/412010/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer/publisher.\nCrossbow Warrior – The Legend of William Tell is an action platformer game, developed by MobyDick Games, releasing in early December 2015.\n\nUsually I am not a massive fan of platformer games, but this one took me by surprise. The game play is somewhat easy to grasp and pleasantly fun to play. You play as William Tell, a crossbow warrior. The platforming is done slightly different, you can sometimes be playing from a side view simply traversing the environment, sometimes you can be in a third person view taking on an endless runner sort of challenge as you try to dodge on coming obstacles. There is a small element of combat too, which I wasn’t a huge fan of, simply because it is hard to control the crossbow. It takes about three seconds for your character to ready himself to fire, and the aiming technique feels very clunky and hard to actually figure out where your shot will land due the poor hitbox detection.\n\nCrossbow Warrior can be controlled either using the keyboard, or a controller. For platformers, the norm would be to use a controller, so this is what I opted for, but it just didn’t feel very responsive to my actions, there is a slight delay in between pressing the button and what is actually carried out on screen. Obviously in platformers you need there to be no latency at all with the controls so this was very off putting and did hamper the gameplay to quite a large degree. Some people have noted that you don’t get the latency issue with the keyboard but it is still hard to control any sort of platformer with a keyboard. This really needs to be addressed in a patch in the future.\n\nFrom the screenshots on the Steam store, the graphics look really nice, and whilst they do look really impressive in game, there are some moments where you are stunned at some really poor work. For instance, the enemies are very poorly rendered at a very low quality. The environments and backdrops you are playing in though are really beautiful; and the water effects are actually very very good. The graphics are somewhat of an up and down issue with Crossbow Warrior; I wouldn’t be too bothered about them if the gameplay were up to scratch.\n\nThe early levels of the game are very simple; you can easily progress to about the half way point in the game in just over an hour – that is where the difficulty starts to ramp up though. The difficulty is definitely not helped by the controller issues, but there is a significant increase in the mechanics you have to use to progress. The game does a good job of splitting up the different types of stages you have to complete, so you don’t get the same missions repeated after each other. You can add a little more difficulty to your run through by trying to collect all the items in the levels as well as trying to beat the “expert time”.\n\nI finished the game in just over three hours. I felt that to be just the right length before the technical issues with the game really became an actual major annoyance. There may be an essence of replay ability with Crossbow Warrior with the mechanics such as beating the expert times, but sadly I don’t have any urges at the moment to go back and complete them, so I am happy with the one play through, and I would think most would be satisfied with that too.\n\nApart from the glaring issues with the controller latency, I did notice a few other problems, such as a minor stuttering issue on some of the levels which are obviously more graphically intensive. Also the game launches in German language for some reason and even after you change the language, some of the menu text still remains in the wrong language which I thought was a bit sloppy.\n\nTo sum up, Crossbow Warrior – The Legend of William Tell is a game that I am struggling to put into either of the categories of thumbs up or thumbs down. I am going to recommend the game, simply because, yes I did finish the game and yes I did have some fun whilst playing it. It is by far one of the better platformer games, this is definitely not helped by the controller problems, but it is definitely not the worst platformer on Steam. The regular price of £4, 99 is fair but I can certainly see this game being included in a couple bundles over the coming months.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980388679/recommended/412010/","76561197980388679","YourChagrin","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980388679/","259 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0_wVNkkdTI\n\nFYI: This is a port of a mobile game.\n\nCrossbow Warrior – The Legend of William Tell is a budget indie game that tells the story of the unlikely hero William Tell’s triumph over a tyrannical emperor. Unfortunately I found the game’s storytelling and gameplay mechanics underwhelming. While the game is no slouch in the audiovisual department these aspects don’t outweigh the fact that Crossbow Warrior is just not that fun to play.\n\nThe game opens with a tutorial level to get you acquainted with the basics. This is essentially a side-scrolling platformer with the most basic of combat mechanics and there are actually levels that be completed without defeating any enemies. During the levels you can pick up various items like chocolate bars that make you run faster and flowers that server as collectables, there are also secret areas in some of the levels. The levels are designed to be played multiple times inspiring you to go back to get a better clear time or to collect all of the items. There are a few levels that deviate from this formula like when you must navigate a dangerous river while in a rowboat or endless-runner style levels that have you avoiding obstacles without stopping.\n\nRegardless of the level type they are all held back by the unresponsive and unintuitive platforming. William Tell has no weight to his movements, so I could never get a feel for whether he would land and continue for a few steps or just stop dead in his tracks after a jump. This led me to over and under compensating constantly when landing because it never felt consistent and consistency is paramount in a platformer. There were also many occasions where I would press the jump button, but Tell would not jump he would just continue running into a river… Or an enemy. This led to a very frustrating experience as jumping is a primary mechanic in the game. These imprecise controls carry over into the endless runner style levels where you can’t always tell where you can or can’t walk. This leads to premature jumping that results in landing just shy of your goal. I’ve played many platforms in my time and the platforming in this game just doesn’t feel right. I’m sure it’s possible to reach a point where you could learn the limitations of the system, but nothing about the game inspires you to keep banging your head against the wall until it clicks.\n\nThe storytelling amounts to still images with captions underneath them. From what I can tell this is a faithful retelling of the legend of William Tell, but the presentation is very dry. There was a point when I wondered if this was meant as more of an educational tool rather than an actual video game much like Valiant Hearts, but the story bits were so sparse and bare-bones that I can’t see this being used as a teaching tool.\n\nCrossbow Warriors is a very pretty game with a great art-style and fantastic effects. The lighting is top-notch and the weather effects do a great job of making it look like you are in a torrential down-pour. One of my favorite levels tasked you with navigating a river with many hazards while rain poured down obstructing your view; finding hidden items in this level was fun and exciting at the same time. William Tell’s animations are very stiff however and this also affects the gameplay as well as the visual presentation. The audio presentation is also excellent offering appropriate music and sound effects that fit well with the great art-style.\n\nI wish I could recommend Crossbow Warriors – The Legend of William Tell without exceptions. What you get out of this game is very subjective. With the low price point you may be able to overlook the unresponsive controls and lack of storytelling, but I cannot. For me the game just doesn’t play well enough to justify any price point. It is too bad because the concept is great and the presentation is on point, but unfortunately the moment-to-moment gameplay and storytelling drag the the experience down for me and I cannot recommend this game.","December 17, 2015","false","2.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Gameplay consists of mainly sidecrolling platforming although in certain levels the view changes. Defeat enemies with your crossbow or save your ammo and instead jump on top of them. Collectibles exist in every level for achievement hunters along with a hidden apple for you to shoot with your crossbow. A few minor glitches exist, although gameplay is very smooth. Something not mentioned in the tutorial was that jumping from a crouch launches you higher which is needed to clear some obstacles.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nCartoony graphics suit the humor in this game\nSome levels are challenging, and there are no checkpoints in a level!\n"Expert" time cutoffs for speedrunners and replayability\n\nCons:\nIn the city escape level, possible to get glitched under the level, forcing a restart\nJumping is awkward and hard to control sometimes\nEnemies have inconsistent hitboxes when you try to jump on them\n═══════════════════════════════════\n\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis is a fun, lighthearted, although challenging platformer where you get to play as the legendary folk hero William Tell. Great buy for all ages!\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curation page  here","December 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

Mr. Tell and his son, Walter, were visiting the stunning village of Altdorf (I have been there and it is a breathtaking place, surrounded by majestic mountains). Tell refused to bow publicly in front of a hat that was positioned on a pole in the market place by Gessler (Vassal of the Austrian Emperor). As punishment, he was arrested and required to shoot an arrow, with his crossbow, through an apple placed upon his son’s head, in order to avoid execution for them both! All I can say is, I am very thankful that I was not born in the 1300’s and that my name wasn’t Walter!\n\nCrossbow Warrior – The Legend of William Tell is a 2d action platformer where you will play the story of this legendary hero from Switzerland. There are 29 challenging levels to beat and you will have to collect a specific number of the beautiful Elderweiss flowers, find the hidden apple (in each level), and to make it even harder, do so within a specific time-frame. And let me William (Tell) you . . . you must be an expert in this genre of game to achieve all of them in the same run! Nah, not possible in the same run!\n\nI like the different type of presentations, some levels will be as your formal side scrolling platformer and some like a speed runner one. Which makes it fun!\n\nAim with your crossbow carefully so your bolt hits the archery targets to unveil hidden places. Shoot through hidden apples, drop boxes on despicable Harbsburg soldiers, jump on their heads or just shoot them! Face furry and cuddly cute animals, I would like to name one in particular . . . the fluffy bear!\n\nThis game has a good and cute style of carton graphics and shows good humour too, for example: chocolate will give you a speed boost and cheese more health (that was in the old days)! . I enjoy the soundtrack, it has an inspiring touch to it. Control-wise, it could be smoother in my opinion. Anyone can play this game but be aware it is quite challenging at times.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics & soundtrack\n-	29 levels to beat\n-	Good platformer / Speed runner\n-	Fun To play\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Control could be smoother\n-	Can be very challenging at times.\n-	No trading cards\n\n7/10\n\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
