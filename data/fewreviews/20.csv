When I would get in trouble, TFC would be taken away, and I would have to go outside and play. I can still remember my best friends names, though I doubt they still play it. I can even still remember my favorite medic. I remember mulching until I could finally kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of anyone (this was before stat tracking, though I would assume the hours would be in the thousands.) VIP, Climb, and Jump maps were perfect to kill time and be silly with all your friends.\nThough I havent played since TF2 came out, I miss this game more than anything ever. Definitely the fondest memory I have as a child. This game made me fall in love with Sierra (VALVE), and to know what real FPS's should be like.\nI have purchased this game three times after the initial gift, to install on friends and girlfriends computers so that I could play at their houses.\nBuy this even if it's just to have it in your collection and you never play it. At least you can say that you have it and pretend that you are OG.\nI love you TFC.","November 1, 2014","true","9.9"," 652 of 696 people (94%) found this review helpful 112 people found this review funny","94","652","696","112","25"

They are completely different games with different mechanics, although the classes seem similar.\n\nGeneral:\n-TFC has grenades.\n-Classes also have armor.\n-Health Pool is different.\n-Bhop is possible.\n-While in TF2, the best gamemodes are Control Points, King of the Hill and Payload, in TFC it is actually Capture the Flag.\n\nScout:\n-In TFC, he is used for his speed to cap the flag, rarely fights.\n-No double jump. Concussion grenades are used and they are way more powerful.\n-No Scattergun, has only a weak shotgun and a Nailgun used against sentries.\n\nSoldier:\n-Soldier has normal grenades and nail grenades - which shoot nails in 360 degrees and deal damage.\n-Has a normal weak shotgun and a more powerful one.\n\nPyro:\n-No airblast.\n-Flamethrower deals damage depending on the amount of armor the victim has.\n-Has an Incendiary Cannon which acts as a Rocket Launcher, but sets enemies on fire.\n-Has normal grenades and Napalm grenades - which set enemies on fire.\n\nDemoman:\n-No Stickybomb Launcher, replaced by the Pipebomb Launcher. Pipebombs don't stick to surface.\n-The Grenade and Pipebomb Launcher share the same ammo pool.\n-Has a single-barrel shotgun.\n-Has a detpack which has the ability to clear obstacles and open new entrances.\n-Has normal grenades and MIRV ones - they split into smaller grenades which explode.\n\nHeavy:\n-Has 2 shotguns.\n-Also has MIRV grenades.\n\nEngineer:\n-Cannot pick-up buildings.\n-Has powerful EMP grenades which blow up the enemy's ammo and cause damage.\n\nMedic:\n-Medic is also used for capping flags because of his speed and concussion jumping ability, but is more powerful than Scout.\n-Can infect classes with his medpack.\n-No Medigun therefore no Ubercharge.\n-His super nailgun is good against sentry guns.\n\nSniper:\n-Basically TF2 sniper with the Classic and grenades.\n\nSpy:\n-Has a Tranquilizer Gun.\n-Has a shotgun.\n-Can feign death.\n-Has Hallucination Grenades.\n\nCivillian is the last class which is used in special gamemodes.\n\nTeams are pit against each other where Red uses defensive classes to protect their flag from Blue, which use mainly Scouts and Medics to capture it.\n\nThe community is very small and there are only a couple of servers at a time, but the game is a classic and I recommend it.","July 20, 2015","true","1.2"," 327 of 362 people (90%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","90","327","362","33","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InkIncorporatedIncorporation/recommended/20/","InkIncorporatedIncorporation","Ink Incorporated Incorporation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InkIncorporatedIncorporation/","31 products in account","If anyone were to ask me what my favourite video game of all time is, my reply to that question would be Team Fortress Classic. Team Fortress Classic is a remake of a Quake mod known as Team Fortress. Team Fortress was made in 1996 by three Australians named Robin Walker, John Cook, and Ian Caughley. Team Fortress became very popular, and it was so popular that these three men got hired by Valve with plans to make a game called Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2 went through many changes, and it was eventually released, but before Team Fortress 2 came, there was Team Forterss Classic. Team Fortress Classic was made to promote Half-Life as well as provide something for the Team Fortress community to play while Team Fortress 2 was being worked on. This game, made for those simple reasons, ended up being what I see as a masterpiece.\n\nIf you don't understand the concept of Team Fortress, it's actually not very hard to explain at its core. There are two teams, RED and BLUE, and these teams fight over objectives like capturing flags, capturing control points, or silly stuff like fighting over a football (soccer ball). Within a team, there are classes. You can pick from nine classes in Team Fortress. These nine classes are the scout, sniper, soldier, demolitions man, combat medic, heavy weapons guy, pyromaniac, spy, and engineer. Each of these classes have different abilities, weapons, and stats that make their role. For example, the heavy weapons guy has a big gun known as the assault cannon, a lot of health and armor, slow speed, and more resistance to knockback than other classes. This makes him able to play in a defensive role very well.\n\nIn Team Fortress Classic, there are many maps you can play on which is one of my favourite parts of the game. There are official maps like 2fort, well, dustbowl, and avanti, but there are also many nice custom maps that this game's community has decided to make themselves. The maps can differ, but a lot of maps play like the official maps. For example, there is a capture the flag map known as bases2k3, and there's nothing to it but capture the flag. However, there's a map known as security_r, and a demoman has to plant a bomb on this map to deactivate the security which can lead to another way to exit and enter the enemy base.\n\nI find the graphics nice even though many people dislike them. If you put this game on software settings, low resolution, and low video quality or use gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST, it gives it a nice classic look. I like the appearance of old-school games so I don't exactly find graphics a huge disadvantage of this game. Also, for its time, these graphics were pretty great. Graphics don't matter as much as gameplay does. You can have a good game with bad graphics and good gameplay, but you can't have a good game with good graphics and bad gameplay.\n\nI also love this game's community. The people in this game are friendly to new players, love to joke around, and they are often very dedicated to this game. This game's community does have bad parts like overly strict admins, elitists, and people who do things like camp spawn. However, these guys aren't really what I would consider the large portion of the community. The community is very strongly against Team Fortress 2, but that doesn't mean they'll hate anyone for liking Team Fortress 2. They just dislike the game. Most new players come from Team Fortress 2, and like I said, the community is willing to help new players.\n\nThis game has a very small amount of players, and I hope that it can be revived by getting more players. Very few players stay in this game because they are upset because of its difficulty, but stay around, and you'll learn. It's not impossible, and a lot of new players assume it is. All you really need to know is the basics for the game to become playable, but there are difficult skills dealing with mobility, positioning, and tricks. This game is different from Team Fortress 2, and if you are aware of that, you should treat it like a completely different game. Keep in mind that Team Fortress is the granddaddy of class-based, team-based, multiplayer shooters. You might love it if you play enough.  I'm not a pro at this game, but I enjoy this game every single week.\n\nFinal Rating: 10/10","December 20, 2015","true","721.3"," 167 of 187 people (89%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","89","167","187","25","7"

(You can check for players with the in-game server list, bots won't be shown.) TFC offers one-of-a-kind exciting fast paced gameplay with tons of tactics and ways of playing the game. Easy to get into and enjoy, hard to master. However, you're bound to have fun along the way.\n\nDespite old age, the game has a timeless design with a completely customizable appearance; you can choose from many custom models, sprites, skins, textures etc. There are active community servers hosting many of thousands of custom maps total with official game modes like; Capture The Flag, Control point, Attack/Defend, Escort, Deathmatch as well as custom ones like King of the Hill, Hold or Score Ball etc.\n\nIf you're interested in skill jumping (with weapons) there are servers hosting maps made for conc-, grenade-, rocket- and pipe jumping. There are also a lot of movement skill maps where you can climb, bunnyhop, strafe, surf, ramp slide and even water glide (shark) on a few servers. Or if you just want to play some random fun maps and mess around, there's escape, puzzle, hide & seek, sniping, role-play, secret hunting, low gravity and so on. As for mods, there's NeoTF (which gives you extra abilities and buildables), AdminOP (Ent Mod, Radio Mod, Hook Mod) and others.\n\nIt's not just one of, but The most popular online multiplayer game of all back in 1999 before CS took the crown. Nowadays, there are barely any FPS games that don't get boring after a few hours. TFC will have you keep coming back for more, time and time again.

The story, the graphics, and even the controls feel different, but if you play it long enough you will come to find that the game is Team Fortress at its core. The game itself has all the Team Fortress 2 "DNA" in there you just dont quite see it at first. If you play a while you will not only feel the Team Fortress-ness in the game (its the original Team Fortress so obviously) But you will get to see where the masterpiece that is Team Fortress 2 comes from, you get to see its "roots" so to speak.

This is for new and potentially new players. Vets of the game already know why TFC is still for sale, and not F2P like it's "decendent".\n\nTFC is a game I've been playing for over 15 years. It is, without a doubt, the most FUN game in my library.\n\nYou have the same 9 classes as TF2, however, with many differences. The Spy can't turn invisible, but can "feign death". Be careful with this ability, as it's not impossible to spot a Spy trying to pull their tricks.\n\nGrenades! TFC has grenades, and lots of them! Every class(except Sniper) has a class specific secondary grenade. All classes(except Scout) have your normal issue "Frag" grenade. Using these grenades can help you either kill an enemy, or assist your movements.\n\nWhen you first begin playing, you WILL get your butt handed to you. A lot. This is normal, and all TFC players have been through it. Don't let that deter you. The game engine has lots of nuances for you to learn, but it takes time. Really, it takes lots of time to learn, but many players are willing to teach you. All you have to do is ask.\n\nYou may encounter players who have forgotten what it's like to be new to the game. Ignore them, or mute them. I may not be the best TFC player around, but I'm a team player, and I don't mind teaching what I know. Feel free to friend me, and just ask.\n\nDon't expect "Hats".

You just have to know that if you treat it like Team Fortress 2, you're gonna have a bad time! This game is significantly different than Team Fortress 2. It has a more competitive, fast-paced feeling where people try to work together to complete the objective. If you're used to Team Fortress 2, you have to know some differences before you get in game, get your ♥♥♥ wooped then go to write a negative review about this.\n\nScouts are not designed for combat and are just for completing the objective. Getting a single kill as a scout is hard to do.  I personally like this scout concept over the Team Fortress 2 one. The people that still want a fast combat class in the game, don't worry! There's still a class for that. Recently, Team Fortress 2 got a new rifle called the 'Classic'. If you know how that works, you can grasp the concept of the classic sniper pretty well. Although, the TFC sniper does not suck as much as the classic. Soldier is the same except he has two shotguns. On the topic of shotguns, there are two of them. A double-barreled one that does more damage yet a slower fire rate and a slower reload and a single-barreled one that does more damage yet a faster fire rate and a faster reload. Shotguns in this game have no fall-off.\n\nDemoman is pretty similar. Your pipebomb launcher is your stickybomb launcher as Team Fortress 2 players are used to. Except the pipeboms do not stick. You have a single-barreled shotgun and you can place an instakill detpack that explodes in 5, 20, 50 seconds. The detpack can also be used to open entrances. Medic is the most changed class. Medic is for combat, healing, and capturing objectives. Your medkit can infect enemies and you have two shotguns. You also have a conc grenade that you can use to conc jump which we'll go over later. HWGuy has the same difference as soldier. You still have a minigun, but you have two shotguns.\n\nPyro is weaker than his Team Fortress 2 counterpart. Your main job is to confuse and it is not to wreck. You have an incendiary RPG and you cannot airblast. Spy is the second most different when compared to his Team Fortress 2 counterpart. You have a double-barreled shotgun, a pistol that slows enemies down, and a nailgun. You can disguise still and you can do a crappy feign death that makes you turn into a corpse. No one falls for it and it doesn't even show up in the killfeed. It's good for hiding yet it sucks for tricking. YES BACKSTABS STILL EXIST. Engineer is pretty similar. You cannot upgrade dispensers and teleporters, but you can upgrade sentry guns. Sentry guns can be upgraded in 1 hit as long as you have 130 cells (metal). You also have a weak railgun that's more for finishing off rather than taking on a full health target. Dispensers only give armor and ammo, but no health.\n\nGeneral Differences:\n\nThere are grenades. Grenades. Every Team Fortress Classic class has a frag grenade (except scout), and a special grenade. Scout has two special grenades.\n\nMovement is a lot more intricate. You can jump with grenades and bunnyhop.\n\nThere are more gamemodes and maps.\n\nOn flag capturing maps, you don't take the flag back to your flag and you take it to somewhere else.\n\nThere is armor.","December 28, 2014","true","348.1"," 54 of 57 people (95%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","95","54","57","11","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wircea/recommended/20/","Wircea","Wircea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wircea/","76 products in account","You must try this game, who knows, maybe you will like it.\n\nThe game mechanics are somewhat different from the ones used by TF2, and I could explain most of them:\nAnd yes, I will try to compare this game's features with TF2's, assuming that most players are now coming from it.\n\nControl point maps\nIn control point maps, instead of staying on a capture point until it gets claimed, you have to bring a flag on it. While this doesn't support much the teamwork strategy because everyone is like "The flag is now mine, I am going to cap",  some people play the right way and let the scout do the job while they offer covering fire.\n\nHowever, some maps like Dustbowl on the first stage are messed up, the RED team camping near the grenade backpack and spamming all the way until the round ends.\n\nCapture the flag\nSame as you can see in TF2, that's how CTF acted in all team fortress stages, excepting that, unlike TF2, the place where you have to bring the flag is different from the place the enemy can find your flag, making this a bit confusing for new players.\n\nEven in this moment I bring the enemy flag to my team's flag in 2fort.\n\nEscort\nA great gamemode, that in TF2 got brutally converted into payload. (there where alot of reasons I will explain later)\nIn this gamemode you will have to escort (AKA help a a guy reach a place alive) a class called "Civillian" (yes, TFC  has 10 classes).\nThe civillian features low stats, having only 50 health points, no armor, grenades or weapons other than an umbrella, which is a crowbar reskin.\n\nThere are 3 teams:\nThe escort- only the civillian available. Only 1 can play as the civilian in a game.\nThe bodyguards - the people who must escort the civillian to the destination. Only soldier, heavy and medics available.\nThe assasins - must prevent the civillian to reach the destination. Only playable as snipers.\n\nIn TF2, the escort mode was scrapped for multiple reasons, such as the fact it had too many limits.\nYou had class limits, being forced to play as medic, heavy and soldier as bodyguards and as sniper on the assasins.\nAlso, certain civillians were trolls, refusing to get out from the spawn or jumping in front of the enemy.\nNo more saying there could only be 1 civillian, releasing many flamewars between players.\n\nThen Valve made a similar gamemode, where you have to 'escort' a bomb cart by staying near it so you can 'push' it, while the other team prevents you for doing that.\n\nClasses\n\nThe scout:\nUnlike in TF2, the scout was NOT made for agressive combat, not even for combat itself. It has a 'syringegun' called nailgun and a single-barrel shotgun.\nPlayers use the scout's speed and the conc-jump technique to quickly complete the objectives.\nUnfortunatelly, the scout has low health, being able to be killed by a single rocket, and lacks double jumping.\n\nThe soldier:\nThe soldier from TF2 seems to not have changed much.\nThe only differences between them is that the TFC soldier has 2 types of shotguns equipped at once and also has hand grenades.\n\nThe pyro:\nOh pyro... poor pyro, the class valve forgot to buff.\nYou basically have a flamethrower that shoots rapid-fire 'bubbles' of fire, that will never hit someone.\nAlso, the afterburn is only like 2 seconds and deals like 4 damage/tick.\nThe pyro also has a rocket launcher that does not need to be realoaded, but deals no damage at all and ignites the enemies that stay in range, but again, the aferburn is weak.\nYou also have a single barrel shotgun...\n\nThe demoman:\nA class you will rarely see played, same as in TF2.\nPeople don't know the air detonation technique, which is deadly in TFC.\n\nAs the demoman, you have a grenade launcher with a clip of 6 and a sticky launcher with also a clip of 6. They use the same ammo and clip, tough.\nThe demoamn also has a single-barrel shotgun, and the unique abbility to set a bomb that is able to open new routes on a map by removing certain walls.\n\nHeavy weapons guy:\nThe heavy is more decent to play that in TF2, you have a plenty of health and armor, and a powerful MIRV granade that creates explosions similar to the Sentry buster from TF2.\n\nYou also have 2 shotguns types: The one-barrel and 2-barrel.\nYou cannot deploy your minigun without firing, so you will stay more in combat rather than camping near corners, like people do in TF2.\n\nEngineer:\nThe engineer is quite weak compared to the TF2 one. I mean, you have a double barrel shotgun, which is very good, and a railgun, which is the worst weapon in the game due to the slow projectile and low damage.\n\nThe sentry upgrades instantly if you have enough 'metal' (called 'cells' in TFC) and is the only upgradable building.\nThe sentrygun cannot rotate, the engineer being forced to place the sentrygun in corners, or to rotate it manually.\n\nThe dispenser is not upgradable and does NOT generate ammo, health and metal, as it does in TF2, so the engineer has to fill it manually.\nAlso, the enemy can use your dispenser.\nYou will rarely see an engineer building a dispenser, unless they are really bored, because it does not heal, does not provide ammo unless filled with, and does not give metal, so players preffer to collect backpacks filled with goods at every corner.\nThe only good thing about dispensers is that they can repair armor (if filled).\n\nThe teleporter is not upgradable, but efficient.\n\nThe lack of hauling buildings and the addition of grenades in TFC makes it hard to be an engineer, trust me.\n\nMedic:\nThe medic is actually an upgraded version of the scout, but not worth playing.\nThe lack of 'assist' in the kill feed and the fact that you don't get points for healing, will end up with you having 0 points even if you were an efficient medic that deserved #1 in TF2.\n\nWhat do I mean by upgraded scout?\nRemind scout's weapons? Nailgun and single barrel shotgun, also a crowbar.\nMedic's loadout? SUPER Nailgun, DOUBLE barrel shotgun and the medkit (as melee).\n\nThe medkit is the most overpowered weapon.\nWhy? once hitting an enemy with it, it will become infected, causing his health to drain constantly until dies or healed by a medic. Also, the infection can be spread trough teammates... darn it valve.\n\nAlso, the medic is designed more for combat, and healing teammates that are hiding, because you cannot heal while you or your teammate move.\n\nThe sniper:\nRemember the sniper rifle in TF2 called "the Classic"?\nUse it to see how being a sniper is like in TFC.\n\nThe spy:\nThe spy, a kinda broken class, has a tranquilizer gun that slows down enemies, a double barrel shotgun and a knife.\nThe stupid thing about the spy is that the disguise takes about 5 bloody seconds (while just like 2 in TF2) and you have no cloak feature.\nHowever, the lack of spychecking weapons other than the medic's medkit, may do the job.\nYou can feign death, but you have to stay down, as a random dead body, and if you move, you actually spin like a drunk hobo and suspicious players will shoot.\n\nThe backstab seems to be broken most of the time, resuting in failed facestabs.\nAdditionally, if an enemy scout or spy runs into you, your disguise is removed.\n\n\nOnly things I don't like on this game (along with the broken classes) are these:\n-Lack of resupply cabinets: If someone spawn camps you and you are hurt badly (or infected) you are forced to die.\n-Solid hitboxes: You cannot get past teammates as in TF2 and you cannot do the bump-spycheck.\n-All classes use the same voice, the only lines you will hear being "Medic!" and "Excuse me, I'm in need of medical attention." thus making it hard to see which class is approaching.\n\n\nOn short, totally worth playing, and if you are bored you can try the FUN servers (which are better than the TF2 ones because the civillian class is used alot in them), and if you totally suck like me, you can enjoy playing singleplayer with bots.\n\n+8/10","July 18, 2014","true","41.6"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","55","62","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourgrandmothersuckseggs/recommended/20/","yourgrandmothersuckseggs","Nagito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourgrandmothersuckseggs/","24 products in account","Team Fortress Classic is a FPS developed and released by Valve Corporation in 1999. It is the sequel to the popular Quake mod, Team Fortress, now remade with the Half-Life engine. And it is the prequel to our favorite Party Simulator, Team Fortress 2. Matches in Team Fortress Classic pit two teams against each other, with each team member having access to nine distinct classes. Competition takes place in a variety of scenarios, usually capture the flag, VIP protection, or territorial control. Since its release, the game has undergone significant upgrades to player models and game modes.\nI'll just say it right now guys, this game is GREAT. The classes, the graphics (Aged rather well, considering it was 99), the fast action and variety of weapons etc. I think it's actually near perfect.....Gameplay-wise.\nWhat really brings the game down to me is the fact that now it's almost empty. If you want proof, open up Counter Strike 1.6 and take a look at the servers. Then, open up TFC and take a look at the servers. Sad, sad indeed. And the only servers with actual people are full of people that are probably going to kick your ♥♥♥ big time, no mercy will be shown, so you have 3 choices: Get good, get good or GIT GUD, these guys can't even be considered simple veterans, these guys probably know the game better than the creators themselves. The game is really different from TF2 so don't think it's all going to be sunshine and rainbows, the gameplay is faster, no hats, no other weapons and the game doesn't get all the updates and attention TF2 receives every day. You know what this means? Almost no people in the servers and unbalanced gameplay at some points because of no patches (Grenades, Bhopping and MEDIC, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IT MEDIC). However, if you want to play a solid FPS, that, in my personal opinion, would be way better than Counter Strike 1.6 (Yes, I f.u.c.king said that.) if it only had more people. PLAY THIS, it's an absolute must for any FPS fan and an overlooked, underrated gem nowadays.\n9/10","February 17, 2015","true","23.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","88","15","17","17","0"

Work with other players and defeat the opposing team, with each and unqiue class that is design to fit you. Sure that may say a lot of a game like this. But either way, this game is much as fun as the secondary installment of the Team Fortress game, only that one is a bit more cartooney.

Team Fortress Classic is the first standalone Team Fortress game and it is very challenging.  It takes a lot of skill to be good at this game.  If you expected Scout to be a close-range powerhouse, you are going to be very dissapointed.  The only class that feels very powerful at times is the heavy when he is camping a corner.  This has some of the same maps as TF2 but they are also very different.  If you are one of those people that are constantly ♥♥♥♥-talking "gibus noobs" in TF2, prepare to taste your own medicine.  The TFC community seems to be VERY hostile to TF2 players.  Half of the chat in TFC is people ♥♥♥♥-talking TF2 and the other half is teammates communicating.  There are however some TFC experts that welcome new players and will teach you the basics and some advanced techniques to improve your skill.  I'll give you a tip right now:  If you are a Scout, NEVER try to kill someone, especially if you are alone.  The Scout is the worst class for killing enemies.  Also if you get infected by a Medic, please don't be a ♥♥♥♥ and go into your spawn.  Overall it is worth the price because there are still a few servers with around 20 players at all times.  Just NEVER bring up TF2 unless you are talking trash about it.  I have even seen people vote-kicked off a server for trying to defend TF2, and you do not want to get kicked from one of the only good serevrs.","February 19, 2015","true","23.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

While still primitive as far as it's graphics and mechanics, TFC can still definetly provide a fun and fullfilling experience. It has a rather significant lack in servers, but when there is a populated server, the battle can get intense and fun.

First, this game was a Quake mod and then developed to it's own game, leaving us Team Fortress Classic. This game has all the thrill of games like Deathmatch Classic, Counter Strike, and Quake. The diversity of the classes is what makes this game the most fun. Instead of having to worry about overpowered weapons, this game is completely equal because everyone has the stock weapons, period. I purchased this game to see what came before the game, Team Fortress 2, in which I play frequently. This game is an all-around classic and is one of the best FPS games i've played, dispite it's age. Pretty much as long as you are into First Person Shooters or games like that, you'll enjoy this one. On the downside, Valve doesn't actually have official servers like they do in Counter Strike: Global Offensive or Team Fortress 2, and are all Third Party Community Servers, but as long as you find a good server, that's all that matters. If you are apprehensive of purchasing this because of the graphics, don't be. It's like that because it's old, and remember that the gameplay makes up for it. I promise you, as long as you keep playing and don't give up you'll like it. It may take you a few hours to get as good as you are at other FPS games, because at the beginning, you're not going to be so hot. One thing for TF2 players, there isn't hats or any way to waste your money. So just remember that one purchase is it. Anyway, as long as you are open minded to trying this game out, you should enjoy this game very much.","June 17, 2015","true","151.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

At first it's a hard game to jump into and can be quite annoying from time to time. There are many things that make this game what it is.\n\nFirst off, this game set the standard for what every class-based shooter should be. From the fast-running scout to the hefty Heavy Weapons Guy, this game introduces most-needed diversity in what any game should have to keep it running, and to keep players playing. Sometimes, however, it just doesn't seem like the classes are doing what they should. On maps like 2fort (CTF) or Dustbowl (TC), the Medics are the ones that are the guys pushing the flag by using their frag and concussion grenades to propel themselves towards the capture point, rendering the Scout useless and completely diverts the MEDIC'S role away from what it seems.\n\nThe game play of this game will keep you sitting at your desk for hours on hours. The on-going struggle to carry a piece of cloth on a pole to an enemy base will be as if you're running with a piece of pie dangling in front of you -- Long and annoying at first, but rewarding in the end. The stalemates of the grenade tosses at the beginning of matches can be aggravating, but you'll feel like a secret agent slipping through as a spy.\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely marvelous, and will live on forever. This game is worth the five bucks, it's tons of fun, and it will keep you entertained for years to come.","April 20","true","11.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

And they’ve all been completely remade to be more modern and they look great.\n\nSame follows with the modes, all the new and official modes are based from the unofficial modes such as Dustbowl and Crossover.\n\nThere isn’t much more to say other than the fact that the whole game just feels like a huge tribute to Quake and it’s fans that contributed to Team Fortress and helped shape what it is known as today, then turned it into a very well-polished stand-alone shooter.\n\nThe game is $4.99 and it’s a must-have for anybody who played and enjoyed the original, but I don’t recommend it if you don’t even have a clue what Quake is to begin with.","September 24, 2015","true","4.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","13","18","3","0"

We didn't know that at the time, we just loved playing it. The multiplayer was fun, but shallow. It didn't involve any strategy beyond kill the other team more than they kill you. But Half-Life included a copy of Team Fortress Classic, and I absolutely fell in love with this game.\n\nTFC involved a team of classes, each with different abilities, weaknesses and weapons. This was rare back then. It meant that you had variety in how you played the game and team cooperation could mean the difference between winning and losing. The best map was 2fort and camping the flag room as a Heavy was a favorite.\n\nTeam Fortress Classic will always have a special place in my heart. It is one of the best first person shooters ever released. The game still has a small community, mostly made up of PC gamers in their 30s like myself. Long may it last. If you've never played the game before, it's an important installment in the FPS genre. Give it a try.\n\nFor a more modern gamer, also do yourself a favor and download Fortress Forever. Fortress Forever is a HD reimagining of TFC and is a wonderful, addictive game. And it's free.","August 11, 2015","true","89.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

TFC follows the same rules as before, 9 classes, two teams, hundreds of maps, and a lot of killing. TF2 I never liked due to the serious unbalancing of the game, and yes TFC is a tad unbalanced too, but TF2 took it too far. That being said, It's nice to play TFC because I feel as if newcomers have a slighter chance of getting kills, BUT, if you are a newcomer, YOU WILL BE CRUSHED because this game is a tad dead meaning many experienced players do play this. As far as I know, there are about only 5 dedicated servers left for REAL players only, no bots. Drippy's 2fort is one of them that always seem populated, but I hope you don't mind playing 2fort for awhile since that seems to be the only popular real server left.\n\nThe graphics are from Half Life 1, sooo you should get an idea of what it looks like. As for sound, nothing really, just explosions, guns being shot off, turrents, doors opening, grunts from jumping, ETC.\n\nThe gameplay in this does require a bit more skill so mastering it is really hard. Snipers will pick you off instantly, Soldiers will destroy you, ETC. Haha, the gameplay is quite fun though, but remember, each class isn't for everybody, so you may need to experiment some if you wanna figure out what's best for you. My favorite is the Scout and Engineer. My only complaint in this game...are the grenades. As much as I love TFC, the grenades are absolutely overpowered and spammed to hell. The thing about grenades are that their blast radius is HUGE and people spam them everywhere. In 2fort, I have been killed too much by opening a door and having a grenade thrown at me and having me killed. Grenade spamfest is almost the name of the game, but once you get used to it, this game is downright fun and awesome.\n\nSure, this game is sadly dying, but there are still some servers left for real players, there is a server that hosts Dustbowl 24/7 for real players too and it's the second most popular server so if you get bored of 2fort from Drippy's, there is always that server. So help us TFC lovers bring this classic back to life by buying it. It's only $5.00, and it will offer you hours of fun on end. Many sleepless night I've had on TFC, trust me. I have almost 50 hours in this game and I know that I will still keep playing more in the future. So buy TFC today! You have nothing to lose other than your social life.","January 12, 2014","true","79.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

At one point, I just connected my computer to the phone line and played some games online like Unreal Tournament and Half Life. Afterwards I read something in a magazine about this Team Fortress mod, so I downloaded and installed it. It was great fun, untill my parents received the phone bill at the end of the month..\n\nWhen I did get cable internet, later that year, I spend quite some time playing Team Fortress. A first person shooter in which every one has his own role/skills, which was never been done before.\n\nObviously, there are not that many players in TFclassic anymore. It's still a fun game but with the dated graphics and TF2 being free2play, there is no reason to go back to TFclassic but for nostalgia sake. I still recommend this game for what it used to be but be sure you got some friends to play with.\n\n","March 13, 2015","true","0.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","1"

You'll see at least 2 full servers per day.\n\nThis game IS NOT like TF2, I repeat, NOT LIKE TF2. The only similarites between the two TF games are the classes and maps. Nothing else.\n\nGrenades are very important on the battlefield.\n\nThis is a great game if you want to see TFC and enjoy the thrilling expirience.\n\nIn TF2, Spy isn't a relatively hard class to master , but in TFC, it is quite the opposite. No cloak, no instant disguise. However, It is rewarding seeing enemies splatter ang gib upon a backstab. Instead of a revolver, Spy gets a weak nailgun, a super shotgun, and a tranq pistol.\n\nOther classes follow suit.\n\nThere's no fancy hats, different loadouts, or anything. Just plain default.\n\nSo, if that seems good for you, get TFC. If not, you can stick to Hat Simulator.

Although I wasn't too big on it at first, I eventually began to prefer Classic over TF2. In fact, I think that it's actually more worth it to pay the $4.99 you need to buy this game than to freely download TF2. Yes, it lacks TF2's interesting characters, but it packs a punch with its gameplay that is even more challenging than TF2, not to mention that it's also more balanced. Only real problem with the game is that it lacks a lot of online players, and the servers that are still up aren't always the greatest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sendator/recommended/20/","Sendator","Panama Playmate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sendator/","23 products in account","Is this game bad? No. This game is obviously a good little shooter that was once THE king of online gaming before the mod known as Counter-Strike came along and it was replaced by the admittedly better Team Fortress 2. But why did I not recommend it? Because fifteen years ago this game was FULL of players well into the 2000s. Now only a special few still play the game. It's a shame because its actually quite a nice little gem to have in your inventory and show off to your friends.\n\nPros:\n- A good selection of weapons that you wouldn't find in Team Fortress 2 (Pyro has a fire nuke!)\n- Pure nostalgia entering servers that are 10 years old and still have Scatman music playing in the background.\n- One shot snipers.\n- Much harder to play and understand. Very rewarding.\n\nCons:\n- Unfortunately those same weapons I mentioned before do barely any damage. (Pyros Flamethrower does 3dmg!)\n- Serious balance issues (Pyro is the worst class in the game)\n- GRENADES. THEY SHOULDN'T EXIST IN A GAME LIKE THIS.\n- Hardly anyone plays anymore.\n\nOverall you should spend that five bucks if you truly want to see what this game is about. Otherwise I would be recommending Team Fortress 2 or any of the other First Person Shooters.\n\nAlso to any Aussie players, there is one local server but it has a password on it. Thus you may need to use the US servers.","March 5, 2015","false","5.3"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","16","31","2","7"

There are many features that you may have gotten used to in Team Fortress 2. But I ask you, what makes a game? A staggering amount of useless hats, unusual weapons, and silly taunts? Hell no!

Nowadays the community of active players shrank and it is not that easy to find good games to join. However that did not change that the gameplay is fun, lots of classes to join with each playing a bit differently. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I thought I would at least take a look at it. It's cool and I see the appeal so I recommend it. Though I cannot give it a higher score because I haven't played that much and with TF2 (and it's huge community) this seems like a slightly outdated mulitplayer game. But it IS fun and it paved the way for other multiplayer games so I have to give it credit for that.","October 4, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Each character is set up to be balanced with their own unique abilities. There is no unfare/overpowered/exploited characters, it is completely balanced, and is not about the stats. This is a game that I can simply pick up and play a round or two. I love this games and I think more people should try it.

Not a problem. You and your enemies have higher health than your modern day twitch shooter. Also the netcode is amazing! You would probably have a smooth gameplay if you entered a lobby with 150+ ping anyways, so don't let your ping scare you. You will engage in actual gun battles, not a "who saw who first." Don't like being a slayer? no problem! you can sometimes run past enemeis throwing yourself at the objective with almost no penalty. You can use mic or text chat. There are a lot of buttons, but don't let this overwelm you! You mostly will just jump, shoot and throw a grenade. Pure FPS fun without all of the b.s.

What more is there to know? Well, for one thing, it is the ghetto of multiplayer FPS'. Meaning, functions such as objective mechanics and pre-round/round time are map-based, and time is not shown on the HUD, it's generally shown through a server-side command. Other than that, it's quite fun, if not unfogiving, but what fun is there in a game if it offers you little challenge and doesn't punish you for not meeting said challenge?\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast-paced team-centric gameplay, unfortunately it's not exactally bursting with players every day. Most servers are full of bots, and the one that don't have mods that, while not always detering from the gameplay, tend to not retain the original gameplay fully.\n\nNeeds Steam Trading Cards.

Nowadays the community of active players shrank and it is not that easy to find good games to join. However that did not change that the gameplay is fun, lots of classes to join with each playing a bit differently. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I thought I would at least take a look at it. It's cool and I see the appeal so I recommend it. Though I cannot give it a higher score because I haven't played that much and with TF2 (and it's huge community) this seems like a slightly outdated mulitplayer game. But it IS fun and it paved the way for other multiplayer games so I have to give it credit for that.","October 4, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Compared to the newer TF2 it really isn't great. The graphics are poor (for these days) and the gameplay modes and maps are limited. However the gameplay is actually quite good. Each class posseses unique and useful perks. Also it is suprisingly easy to find a match. I got this in a pack with HL1 and two dlcs for £8.99. The only real difference beetween these games and new ones is the graphics (not suprising seen as they came out over ten years ago).

Buggy although strangly amusing and succsesfully modded servers only make it better. For those who think the game is a big bucket of ballsup banonza you are indeed not completly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, for you see you have your opinions and we (TFC) players have ours. Only deleting the game of the face of the earth would offend, upset and bore us but it's under our control if we let them convert us. People saying it's had it's run doesn't mean we can't stop playing. people who say 'forget the past and embrace the future' are only giving advice (unless there forcing you to) either way, it's your choice. i like to chose to remember the past and embrace the future AT THE SAME TIME! people also complain about realism: like the nail guns, super nail guns, rail guns and silenced tranquileser pistols all firing incredibly slow moving nails, that is just merely one of the aspects of the game, and it's you'r opinion if you don't like it. So the game is good, buggy, unrielistick, old game still having it's run (although now its a mere crawl) a lovely unbalenced bundleof fun.\n\n\nalthough not having a back strory that could of been an unintensional aspect of the game. for me, i made my own little story:\nin the future black mesa is a mess! the army has been partaily disabled by gordan freeman and both sides are still stuggling to kill one another. after the death of the vortugonts (<--incorect i know) leader black mesa no longer has to worry aboutthe alians and tries to rebuild, the army realise letting black mesa rebuild and continue research on dangerouse things would be bad and could end up destroying everything but they cannot fight withou men! and black mesa neads to beprotected... so they hire mercenaries to fight there battles. black mesa sometimes attacking or the army attacking. both teams of mercenaries made there own flag black messa was rebuilding so the mercenaries chose a building. the army however was trying to destroy and kill all black mesa mercenaries and personel to stop forward production. this continued to the day the combine invaded, hunting the vortugaunts and there once evil leader. finding out about his death they had nothing better to do other than invade and loot everything so the army was then faced with another problem and with only 9 merceneries and about a 6th of whats left of them they where killed in & hours giving black mesa the time to hide itslelf in another location, changing there name eg. mack blesa and rebuilding leaving there old facility to self destruct, thus gordan freeman was somened upon the time of need. please tell me this is not a bad game now that it has aback story. and if it already has a back story please tell me so i know if i embaressed myself talking about something i don't know about.","December 23, 2013","true","90.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This comes from a person who mainly likes half-realistic games like Counter-Strike.\nThe graphics are of course dated 1999, includes whacky physics and animations, also voice chat will make your character's mouth move. Sounds are mostly recycled from Half-Life, aswell as the robotic announcer. Gameplay is a ton of fun, not too realistic, you have your 9 classes all with different roles, a handful of different game modes and maps. There aren't many active servers with players, so you'll play against third-party bots most of the time, but you would get your a** kicked if there were some TFC Veterans in here still. This game also screams teamwork, not like teamwork in Call of Duty, but also not like teamwork in Left 4 Dead.\n\nTL;DR, Little multi-player-only, semi-futuristic, first-person-shooter that is not too active, but even 15+ years after date, is still fun to play.","February 22, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The move away from the clunky Source engine makes all the crazy movement tricks much smoother to pull off, and the general feel of the game is improved, especially when you take into account the vastly reduced loading times and system requirements. There is also more character in this installment, which has bloodier gibs, more distinctive maps, and a generally fresh feeling, which Fortress Forever can only hint at. Frankly, TFC makes Fortress Forever feel like a cheap knockoff itself.","November 25, 2010","true",""," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I also love the fact that on TFC. You focus on team working. That's right they're are no hats, no microtransaction crap... I know this game takes awhile to get used to. But, Its worth it in the end. Plus there are no taunt distractions (I'm talking about you conga taunt). None of that. And I like the mods people do and people still play this game. :) Plus I think this game requires more skill which I think why TF2 fans are scared of it. If you compare this to TF2. TF2 is just an easy game and really no skill involved compared to TFC. Anyways, if your angry about TF2. I'd recommand those people to play this game instead its tons of fun! :) By the way....

So if i were to give this game a rating (this goes for the pack also) I would give it my 7/10, well maybe 8/10.","September 25, 2013","true","14.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

The grapics are lower quality, but they take up less space and are more friendly to those that are still using DSL. If you like shooters and have a terrible computer and internet connection, this may be the perfect game for you.

Why? Because it's so difficult to understand. There is no feedback and its so hard to tell whats going on in matches because its so fast paced. Its hard to explain but if you try it yourself you will know exactly what I mean. Experienced players get a huge advantage over everyone especially with grenades in the game. The learning curve is so steep that it's not even a curve... It's a wall...\n\nHowever if you're good at games like quake or half-life then I defilently recommend this!!!","April 26","false","32.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoderNaeta/recommended/20/","NoderNaeta","Naeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoderNaeta/","15 products in account","While Team Fortress Classic was once at the pinacle of greatness, it has since declined greatly for modern or new gamers. Today, very few servers host this game, and many of them are die-hard veterans which do not seem to welcome new players help populate this mostly dead game. Because of this, simply getting into this game can be difficult, both with the terrible class balance (Soldiers, Engineers, and Heavies dominate) and spam of grenades.\n\nHowever, there are some good points on this game, of course. The fast paced action is a bit more with the bunny hop exploit which is the dumbest thing in this game, than the actual gameplay personally. But regardless, keeps you on your toes. The classes do have different gameplay styles, but specifically the Medic is played outside of intent as a combat class. This was the same case in early versions of Team Fortress 2, but the Medic was only shut down of its combat strength for good in TF2. Many of these good points are truly up to an opinion, and things such as graphics and its engine are more fact than opinion.\n\nOverall, Team Fortress Classic is more for older gamers, and those familier with Quake and such. Every TFC session I have has me feel like I wasted my time and forced myself to even play. Any good point in this game comes down to more of an opinion standoff for many, and it is very rare do I have a glimmer of fun. If you came from Team Fortress 2, like myself, and wanted to try this out, I recommend you do not. And if I had to score Team Fortress Classic, I would give it a 6/10.

But there is a huge problem in this game and that's playability which causes me to not recommend it.\n\nWhen paying REAL money for the game, you'd expect yourself to be able to actually play the game. I bought this, didn't find any servers and after few hours, I found one where I had like 300 ms ping and getting constant lag spikes and sometimes even disconnects due to the server being located in someone's home PC in Alaska or something. I'm not sure have others came across this problem but from my experience, it feels ridiculous that you pay for a game that you can't even play.\n\nMaking this game free-to-play would make me recommend it. It's an awesome game but what's the point of buying an awesome game if you can't even play it?\n\nSorry, dislike, I have to.","May 5, 2014","false","1.1"," 36 of 78 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","36","78","2","6"

However what kills this game of a recomendation from me is the nearly dead community. At most there is 20 to 30 players spread across diffrent servers, and most of the time there is only 15 or so players on diffrent servers. I dislike other things though like the grenade spam, the annoying medic poison (which is pretty op) and the classes having weaknesses that outweigh the pros of the class. Same thing with other classes having to many pros and not enough cons. Like some the weapons feel like you are hiting your enemy's with rubber bullets. But you know what for what it is, it cerntainly isn't bad. The lack of a community just kills my recommendation though.","February 6, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","21"

I noticed alot of servers werent even full and the ones that were are laggy, not bad laggy but when your fighting its a huge streak the will just freeze everything. I sort of enjoyed this game it is very much like TF2 but different, ALSO if you have played TF2 your skills will not transfer you will be like the normal bad player in TF2. Over all i give this game for people who havent played tf2 a 8/10 but for the ones who have a 5/10. I dont recomend buying this game but if you put alot of time and effort you will master Team Fortress Classic.","February 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","7"

The gameplay, mechanics, physics, and everything about this bundle of joy is amazing, and very enjoyable. Although I have not recommended this game, I still give it a strong 7.5/10. The reason I cannot recommend this is because of the more recent creation of Team Fortress 2, the Team Fortess Classic community is dying out. It's difficult to find a password-free, public server with a decent amount of players on it. If you do see a server with 'players', there's a possibility that the 'players' are bots, therefore abysmal at the game. On the rare occasion, you might find a server that actually has players on it. This is ALSO a problem. The likeliness is high that the players on the server are very good Team Fortress Classic players, and have years of experience. As a latecomer, it is very difficult to become even decent at the game because of the simple fact you get completely anialated by all of the other players. One thing I must note is that, if you are a good, or even the best Team Fortress 2 player in the world, don't get this game with high-expectations. The combat style is very different, and very fast-paced. Even with years of experience in Team Fortress 2 it takes much time and dedication to get good at this game, and be able to have fair fights with other players. Another thing which is enjoyable is that despite the fact some players are very good, all of the loadouts for each class are the same, therefore every player in theory should have an equal chance, however this obviously varies on the fact some players are extremely good, like I previously mentioned.\n\nNOTE: The reason I have low playtime on this game is because I had it and used to play it before steam began to count playtime. Even before steam existed. I would take a rough estimate and say that I have between 150-200 hours of playtime in this game total.","May 17, 2014","false","3.1"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","15","36","0","3"

This game is old, and it kinda shows. I wasn't around in the time it was released, but TFC was probably great back then, just like Half-Life deathmatch was. But was is the key word here, it really hasn't aged well. On modern computers it's unstable and glitchy. I found myself invincible at times, constantly at 1 HP at others, walking backwards through walls. The community with it isn't great either. They're all just judgemental, calling new or unexperienced players "♥♥♥♥♥♥s". Hating on the superior (but faithful) sequel, TF2, for it's expansive cosmetic item service and it's popularity. I understand that back in the day many people loved this, but it can't keep up with, well, TF2. I don't reccomend this to anyone other than the purpose of nostalgia. And yeah, that's a fine reason to like or buy a game, I rebought Sonic Adventure, twice.

It's not that TFC is a bad game, it's just that it's very old and doesn't attract as big of a player base as it did all those years ago. It's a well-made game and the class roles are unique. If you can find a server to play on or are willing to set up a LAN party with friends, then I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with this game. Otherwise, you're better off going with another class-based shooter from a more recent era, such as the fantastic sequel, Team Fortress 2.","February 9, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

TFC is a quake-style shooter, nothing to it.  Low skill floor, high skill ceiling.  You may have a bit of trouble at first but as soon as you get a good understanding of bunnyhopping and the occasional grenade jump, you're ready to go.\n\nPerhaps it doesn't have a lot of players, but you know what?  No big deal.  This game's so much fun, I don't mind only seven servers.  As long as you avoid playing Drippy's 2fort, this game is just great all around, from its leftover quake mechanics to its completely different weapons and style.  Its gamemodes are also a lot of fun-- a Dustbowl where you carry YOUR OWN flag to each point, the insta-capping 5 point Warpath, the civilian escort mission Hunted, and the base assault mission Ravelin.\n\nWith many more crazy game mechanics, such as engie's building detonation and the demoman's Detpack that can both be a timebomb and a secret path opener, this game is a must-have for someone looking for a good semi-teambaesd multiplayer deathmatch that focuses on objectives rather than KDR.\n\nEither join an existing server or make your own using Half-Life's dedicated server tool and make a group for this game, it's up to you.\n\nSpeaking of Half-Life, did you know once you buy this game you can find all the HL1 soundtrack in the files?  Well, now you do.  Now get fragging!\n\nShameless group promotion:\nIf you're really having trouble finding players for this game, not to worry!  I've started a Steam group called R3VIVE Gaming, and we're entirely dedicated to playing HL1/GoldSrc games every Friday and Saturday night, occasionally being TFC... now at 165 members and counting!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/r3vivegaming\nCheck us out some time if you're looking for some TFC players, and you can use our Community Game Scheduling forum section to schedule your own matches with members.","June 21, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

You may have a bit of trouble at first but as soon as you get a good understanding of bunnyhopping and the occasional grenade jump, you're ready to go.\n\nPerhaps it doesn't have a lot of players, but you know what?  No big deal.  This game's so much fun, I don't mind only seven servers.  As long as you avoid playing Drippy's 2fort, this game is just great all around, from its leftover quake mechanics to its completely different weapons and style.  Its gamemodes are also a lot of fun-- a Dustbowl where you carry YOUR OWN flag to each point, the insta-capping 5 point Warpath, the civilian escort mission Hunted, and the base assault mission Ravelin.\n\nWith many more crazy game mechanics, such as engie's building detonation and the demoman's Detpack that can both be a timebomb and a secret path opener, this game is a must-have for someone looking for a good semi-teambaesd multiplayer deathmatch that focuses on objectives rather than KDR.\n\nEither join an existing server or make your own using Half-Life's dedicated server tool and make a group for this game, it's up to you.\n\nSpeaking of Half-Life, did you know once you buy this game you can find all the HL1 soundtrack in the files?  Well, now you do.  Now get fragging!\n\nShameless group promotion:\nIf you're really having trouble finding players for this game, not to worry!  I've started a Steam group called R3VIVE Gaming, and we're entirely dedicated to playing HL1/GoldSrc games every Friday and Saturday night, occasionally being TFC... now at 165 members and counting!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/r3vivegaming\nCheck us out some time if you're looking for some TFC players, and you can use our Community Game Scheduling forum section to schedule your own matches with members.","June 21, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

While this game is a "milestone of fps", this game has aged badly. The controls are just bad, some class feel waaaay more usefull as others (I'm looking at you, Demoman and Scout.) And just everything is bland. Besides a couple of levels, there was nothing that made this game any different from other fpses. No crazy customazation or weapons, just nothing. To top it all off, the servers for this game are just DESERTED. With luck, the most you'll find is 5 people. Overall, I can see why this game is considered a classic, but it's doing a really bad job of showing me. All I can say is skip TF and go directly to 2. It's unique, it's funny, and did I mention it's free? I'm sorry TF, but I think it's time to be put down.\n\nPros: I can see innovatation for it's time.. +\n\nCons: ..But it's no longer 1999. And it's aged badly. -\nGeneric. -\nSome classes are useful, and then some are just downright bad. -\nNo good stages.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 3/10.\nRECOMMEND: No. Just get TF2.","November 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","1"

At the last minute, their baby-sitter canceled, so they had to bring along their two year old son with them. They had been across the border for an hour when the boy got free and ran around the corner. The mother tried to find him, but he was missing. The mother found a police officer who told her to go to the gate and wait. Not really understanding the instructions, she did as she was told.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later, a Mexican man approached the border, carrying the boy. The mother ran to him, grateful that he had been found. When the man realized it was the boy's mother, he dropped him and ran. The police were waiting for him. The boy was dead, and in the 45 minutes he was missing, he had been cut open, all of his organs removed, and stuffed with bags of cocaine. The man was going to carry him across the border as if he were asleep.\n","January 8, 2014","false","3.8"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","1"

But I had some casual fun in this silly game, still fun to be had to just fool around with all of the classes and see what they do. It is better to get it on sale if possible, it gave me a bit of a quake vibe in terms of how it played.\nworth it for some casual tf classic fun.","October 20, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally love this game.","January 12, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or you can ♥♥♥♥ around with backpacks and get destroyed by hackers on the 100 servers that are running.
