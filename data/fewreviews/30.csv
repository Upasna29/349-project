Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before. I was in the middle with Peters and his trusty sniper rifle, carrying the M2 Browning. And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.\n\nThe others had been glancing uncertainly at the MG I held in my hands, but I quickly dismissed the growing fear as they were undoubtly only nervous about a rookie with such a powerful weapon.\n\nIt was quiet. Too quiet.\n\nThe bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.\n\nThe sound started as a low rumble. We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking. It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling. We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.\n\nBut nothing could prepare us for what happened next.\n\nA giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nWe opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.\n\nStewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson. He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.\n\nOne of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind. They never saw it coming.\n\nBy now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his sniper rifle with reckless abandon.  Running out of ammo, Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.\n\nI was cornered, MG propped up against an overturned cart while I mowed down soldier after soldier, spent casings flying everywhere.  From out of nowhere, a fist collided with my face and I blacked out.\n\nWaking up, I found I was tied down to a chair in a pitch black room.  The only thing visible was a glowing box directly in front of me with words written on it.  Squinting my eyes, I barely made out the small, black letters.\n\nThe box read:\n\nKicked from server.

The creative young'guns teens who introduced the game were pretty immature at the time, but they figured out how I can lay down, whereas cliffie and goose never figured that one out in CS :)\n\nIt could have ended up a better game than it stands today, but it still is a fun game to play.The development team didn't listen much to us [CoFR]Crusty old Fossil Rockers, and the weapons balance ended up off-kilter. That said, I am a life-long gamer who plays lots of other games, but I return to DoD and the HL1 engine because I have a few friends I've played DoD with for a long time, and I like the net-code for the most part.\n\nI recommend this game, especially to the new gamer who wants to learn how to use teamwork as part of a small squad.

This game is like the grandfather of WW2 games , Before COD and all other WW2 games there was Day of Defeat. I have a major love for this game. I also made alot of good friends amongst my battles along the way :) {"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers"}\n\nThe game play is a bit older and slower then its predecessor of the day Counter-Strike.The Capture the Flag gameplay and Objective Play inforce strong team work and communication game play. The game has aged a bit of course but the key gameplay is still relevant today.\n\nIt may not have had as a big following as did CS did but the community it has , has kept this game alive and well even today. I would highly recommed this game to anyone that loves WW2 games and Loves the old school game play and who also would like to see what we played back in the day,before the flood of WW2 games saw the light of day.\n\nI will say there are not as many servers today as there were back in the day, but there are a few good ones still alive and kicking today.Some with bots and others packed we people {At certain times}. I myself am still very active to this day in this game.\n\nSo give it a try and see you on the Battlefield Soldier !!!!","January 28","true","232.4"," 57 of 59 people (97%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","97","57","59","12","24"

A lot of the players are non-Steam, so the charts are only correct for the Steam users. It's a WW2 shooter with realism. It is very hard to get into this game since it has a big learning curve and pretty much everyone is extremely good. Most of the maps are very well made and balanced. There are a few narrow maps which are a slaughterhouse if there are too many players though. I believe that there are things you should know before playing this game, so here are a few words of advice:\n\n- Grenades are very powerful\n- Grenades are detonaed quicker if you pull the pin and do not throw it for a while\n- Most Grenadier and Sniper shots will be a one shot kill\n- In narrow maps it will be very frustrating, so play on larger maps first\n- Automatic weapons have recoil which is very hard to handle, so take your time to learn the basics of each weapon\n- Constantly check the map to see if you have teammates around, so you know if it's safe to push\n- You will die. A LOT.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Things like spots, weapons, maps and tricks you will learn along the way of playing it. First few hours will be very frustrating, especially for someone who hasn't played realistic shooters, but you will find yourself scoring more and more kills over time and it will be very satisfying. So, give this game a shot even if at first glance you think that the game is bad or everyone is too good or cheating. It is one of the best WW2/Realism games I've played for sure.","April 27","true","45.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/30/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Day of Defeat is a WW2 themed multiplayer team and class-based game of capturing and holding off points. Capturing points is not the only gamemode, but most played, if not only one, around. You could get betas of the game for free as mods for Half-Life 1, but the final versions were released as paid Retail product by Valve. And as you can see, it got on Steam too.\n\nFirst thing first, since it's a multiplayer title... How is community of this old game? It's doing well! It may not have overwhelming amount of players, but you will always find few almost-full servers. And while dod_avalanche map appears to be favourite among the community, you still will get to enjoy some maps variety on various servers. Not so much on game type variety though, capturing the flags points is most played.\n\nAs said, Day of Defeat is a WW2 shooter. Team and class based. A mix between arcade and realism. Weapons are as deadly as in many such shooters, just having single person rush forward will do no good, should do that in team. Many weapons also have big recoil, which depends on your stance: moving, standing, crouching or prone. Being prone is the slowest and clunkiest, easy to hit from above, but harder from long distances, also giving character almost no recoil when shooting. Yes, camping is a viable strategy here, but I feel that I have more chance to break through camping than in, say, Counter-strike. Players can respawn any time, so putting yourself to risk isn't bad idea. Each character also have a stamina, which is used when you spring and jump, slowly recovering afterwards. The slowing effect after using it is quite punishing, so you should sprint from cover to cover. Don't use sprint when moving to the front from the spawn point.\nMaps are designed to be more of pipes, like classic maps, not open fields, providing a main path and few flanking routes. Even more curious, the maps are assymetrical, which may possibly provide some inbalance (I think that Nazis in Avalanche map have height advantage). Breaks the usual symmetry monotony though, more interesting. Some maps even feature British forces instead of American ones. (they have less classes though)\nNo, this one doesn't have vehicles, it is not Battlefield after all.\n\nEach team has up to 10 classes. The only difference most have is primary weapon and whether they have or not grenades to spam at corners and choke points. None have ironsight, if you wonder, aside from scope for sniper rifles. And most of primary weapons tend to be quite similiar to each other, which I don't like, as I prefer classes to be more diverce... something what Day Of Defeat Source did. Classes can be divided into:\n1) Close Range Assault classes - have guns with light recoil, good for running and gunning, and then getting one-hit killed by another rushing rifleman.\n2) Assault Support classes - more recoil, medium range, they better occasionally crouch or stand to be able to litter enemies with bullets at close range.\nClose range and Support get mixed a bit together, making other classes.\n3) Riflemans - Killing mens with one bullet per few seconds, medium-long range class. Well, and short one too. Only bad when rushed by few mens. Just crouch occasionally\n4) Machine Gunners - limited, they can deploy their machine gun on sandbags or while prone. Their machine gun allows them to give your team control over area. Just watch out for snipers and grenade spam. No grenades.\n5) Snipers - not really much of different from Rifleman, just got scope and more accurate while scoped. No grenades though.\n6) Bazooka - You got rocket launcher. And if you imagine infantry going "whee" from rocket - too bad. It's a utility weapon, which only very few maps have use for, like blowing tank in some map (that I didn't get to play in public servers yet). Very annoying whenever Random keeps giving you this class.\n\nThe graphics technically are quite outdated, but still provide it's own quirk. The music is almost non-existing. Only main theme and victory tunes are there.\n\nSo, nice game, especially when measured with other HL1 mods. Still fun and still has active multiplayer. But the people who don't like hitscan weapons and who like to get right into action, it's not for them.","September 13, 2014","true","21.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The simple, predictable mechanics of the GoldSource engine give you a level of fine control over movement that greatly contributes to the depth of the gameplay.  It's not without some bugginess and rough edges, all games of that era had that, but once you get past the dated graphics the gameplay stands up to any modern FPS out there.  I would argue it surpasses them.  Once you get passed the initial learning curve, you'll have some adrenaline-pumping moments, sneaking behind enemy lines, going on fast-paced rampages, chucking an enemy's grenade right back into his face.  The community is quite mature and friendly and has a relatively high proportion of female gamers.

There are hundreds of custom maps, many of them every bit as good or better than the official maps. It's great to play a game knowing that you're helping the other people playing be able to enjoy themselves.\n\nIt's cheap, buy it, stick with it for a bit, and help keep this awesome community alive.","November 11, 2015","true","357.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Hours of endless fun owning the leaderboards with the unbelievably OP FG42 Sniper. The community is also very experienced some of which date back to when it was released in 2003, and most of which are adult and don't blast their mics saying they just hit a noscope. Unlike modern mainstream FPS games it's usually a 1-2 shot kill with a decent rifle at reasonable ranges, (e.g M1 Garand) and 2-4 rounds with the likes of a Thompson or MP40 at short-medium range. Players coming now from modern FPS titles perhaps found this in a sale will have a steep learning curve with gunplay and the low time to kill by todays traditions. The satisfaction of mounting an MG42 with a bipod at the back of an alleyway gunning down dozens of men rushing through ending upwith a massacre and pile of 15 dead bodies from a single MG ammo box, sensational. Or being that one guy who has the OP position in the building that overlooks the central area of the map picking off every last troop that runs across the battlefield with a sniper rifle the whole round. This game is and always will be one of the closest games to my heart and I still play it almost everyday today. I highly suggest you to pick this up in a sale sometime or purchase it for the full price if you're willing to, you won't regret it.","May 30","true","28.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Let me explain.\n\nTry to imagine CoD3 (or World at War, even), take out the pretentious campaign and simplify the gunplay, and you get a fun game.  Now imagine that same concept with an ♥♥♥load of fun maps (my favorite being dod_charlie), a thriving multiplayer community, and slap it all together in the GOLDSRC Engine, and you get Day of Defeat.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are fairly realistic (as realistic as you can expect in a game from 2003)\nEach selectable "class" provides new ways to dominate your opponents, assuming you know how to use them.\nRealistic damage and recoil systems, because you'd probably need a chiropractor after firing a machine gun for more than 5 seconds without mounting it.\nNotably better than the Source remake.\n\nCons:\nFairly primitive compared to newer games in the genre.\nWhile people DO still play it, you'll be hard-pressed to find a full server.\nWhile the Stamina mechanic IS realistic, it gets annoying during the final few minutes of a match.\n\nOverall, Day of Defeat is a fun game to play when you've got nothing to do, or are looking to check out something new, or if you're trying to prove that classic FPS multiplayer games aren't dead yet.

Here are the reasons why.\n\n#1: The players head does not bounce up and down while they move so your vision stays level and still.\n#2: The game runs very smoothly because its old and doesn't require a high end system to kill quickly and accurately.\n#3: The developers allow a highly visible colored sprite for the crosshair so aiming is very easy.\n#4: You can easily customize your game server using AMX MODX with a ton of really cool plugins.\n#5:  Most of the other FPS games today are trying to make the game to real. I personally do not want to sit in a tank, or on a boat and use artillery, or call in air strikes or shoot people from a helicopter. I'm a soldier, a (Grunt) and I want to get down into the trenches and use good old fashioned rifles, SMG's, grenades and Melee weapons. keep it simple. Less will always be more in FPS games. :)","December 2, 2013","true","341.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Once you have looked past the graphics you get a great game with so much structure. Choose either the Axis or the Allies and from there you have a wide range of classes for different weapon types. This game is so well structured because of its community. If someone sees someone in an assult class then they will go long ranged to co-operate with the assult class instead of your average, load-out based FPS where people choose weapons because they like them. I highly reccomended Day of Defeat for these reasons and if you are still tossing and turning, wait until it is on sale when it goes down to $2.50.","January 5, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Per-pixel accuracy, anticipation, map awareness, reflexes, it had it all without being a complete spas fest like Quake. The added "realistic" nuances of modern FPS such as larger maps, larger player matches, movement penalties, class/archetype dependencies have only taken away from the pure competitive FPS experience. Unfortunately, this style of FPS is an end of an era, encapsulated in its time. Games that try to fuse this with modern elements such as the latest Counter Strike releases feel dated. The last attempt to revive this title (Source) also tried fusing modern elements to gameplay but compromised what made DOD unique and great in the first place.","December 24, 2015","true","260.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Half life, CS 1.6 and TFC look far better than this, and they are much older. Trees, Barbed wire, and various vegetation textures are glitched, and will somtimes not be transparent as they should be. effects are also, unreasonably crappy, as grenades do not show an actual explosion, unlike most older HL games (keep in mind this game runs on another engine, though), and gun fire creates and unjustifiably large, half-♥♥♥♥♥ light effect.\n\nGameplay is not terrible, though certain effects form jumping, running, and going prone can be annoying. There are many diverse classes with unique weapons, and sometimes even map specific weapons and gamemodes. Most maps are conquest, while some are search and destroy. Unlike CS there is respawning, but on wave timers. Controls are ok on default, but I would recommend some custumization, as some keys, like flashlight, are stupidly placed (it's "n"). Some maps are poorly lit, quite a few are unnecessarily large, and most are designed so that the battles of WW2 end up more like WW1. A bloody stalemate in the middle of the map that shifts forward occaisionally, only to be stopped by someone in a bottleneck with an MG.\n\nWhile there is still a community, there are alot of empty servers, so lukily there are mods for bots. While playing can be pretty frustrating at times, it's still a fun game to play, and is far better than it's source counterpart.

Here are reasons to buy DOD non-source: You don't own or do own and just don't want the textures for gmod, you want an addictive game, you don't go crazy if graphics arent perfect.  Here is why you should buy DOD source: You own and do want the textures for gmod, you want a more serious experience, and you want better graphics.

Ripley [1st MRB]","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995935948/","180 products in account","Please ignore all the reviews saying 'this game is dead'. That is simply not true. DOD 1.3 has a thriving, though comparatively small, community as of 2015. You will always find populated servers and the clans/communities running those servers have been around for years. They know how to run them well. I have noticed that each server tends to have a busy time of day and everybody plays on everybody else's servers. Play this game for a few weeks and you will notice the same people popping up everywhere you play. That is a wonderful thing to say about a community, and this one is as friendly and welcoming to new players as you are likely to find. According to steam stats the game has ~200 players (30 day average). Source has around three to four times that number at time of writing. Whilst that doesn't sound like a lot it is definitely enough to sustain this game with many different servers utilising different setups and mods giving some nice variation in gameplay. There is even still competitive play and a league still in existence. The only thing you will not find is realism, the last unit having died a few years ago. In conclusion, this is a GREAT game which deserves to go on being played. Try it. It's cheap and can run on a calculator. You may play it for two minutes and think 'the nades are ridiculously overpowered'. That would be my one major criticism of this game. You may, however, love it.","September 2, 2015","true","927.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon sugar (don't stir). Set aside until foamy, 5 minutes. Whisk in the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla.\n\nWhisk the flour, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the salt and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand mixer. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed with the dough hook until thick and slightly sticky. Knead on medium speed until the dough gathers around the hook, 6 minutes. (Add up to 2 more tablespoons flour if necessary.)\n\nRemove the dough and shape into a ball. Butter the mixer bowl and return the dough to the bowl, turning to coat with butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 1 hour 15 minutes.\n\nRoll out the dough, fill and cut into buns (see instructions below). Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan; place the buns cut-side down in the pan, leaving space between each. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325.\n\nBake the buns until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pan 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Sift the confectioners' sugar into a bowl, then whisk in the cream and melted butter. Transfer the buns to a rack and spoon the glaze on top while still warm.\n\nHow to Form Cinnamon Buns\n\n1. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle with the longer side facing you.\n\n2. Spread with the softened butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the far long edge. Mix the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the butter.\n\n3. Brush the unbuttered far edge with water. Roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder and press on the long edge to seal.\n\n4. Cut the cylinder with a sharp knife to make 6 equal-size buns.\n\n5. Enjoy\n\n6. Upvote this comment so more people can make this delecious bun.","April 22","true","19.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It plays very realistically, if you're shot once, you're essentially dead. The game features all of the classic weapons used during the era. If you're deciding between this and it's sequel, Day of Defeat: Source, just know that they both feel very different. I alternate between the two occasionally. If you don't care about graphics, you'll love this game. My only gripe is that there are only two factions to play as. US/U.K. and Nazi Germany. I wish that there were more factions available, like the U.S.S.R. and Imperial Japan. It's also unfortunate that they didn't show up in it's sequel either. Another thing that bothers me is that the Nazi Swastika is not used. Instead, the German Cross is. People say that it isn't in because of fear of offending people. But if you're offended by it, then maybe you shouldn't be playing a WWII game, hm? The only reason I can understand for removing it is that the Swastika is banned in Germany. However, I wish there were a workaround to this. Some servers DO have the swastika, so I'm certain there is some way to deal with it.","April 3","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

You can tell it's dated by how it plays, and the mouse moves a bit weirdly, but it's no big deal.\n\nDay of Defeat is one of those games where you play it for a very long time the first time, and then leave it forever. It becomes very repetitive. The choice of weapons is short, and the maps on most servers are few and far between. The gameplay is a bit awkward, where everything feels clunky, and dodging flying grenades is difficult.\n\nOne thing I will mention is the Community. Man, if there were no community, there would be no game. Peopel are always communicating. About their personal lives, about the game, about strategy, about what to do next and how to work together. The community is truly one of the game's strongest points, and it made me enjoy the heck out of talking with people.\n\nThe soundtrack is another big point. I really enjoyed listening to the victory themes for both sides, as well as the front page. It has this interesting antique WW2 feeling to it, and I really liked it.\n\nAll in all, I do not recommend this game. Just get Day of Defeat: Source if you were really thinking of buying a Day of Defeat title. It has more people and servers on it anyways.","May 1, 2012","false","9.6"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","4","14","0","0"

Often overshadowed by it's significantly more popular older brother, Counter-Strike, Day Of Defeat is a relatively unknown to many and while it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by similar retail games it does provide a decent World War II experience.\n\nDay Of Defeat pits the German Army against either the British or American forces, which one is chosen depends on the map being played, in relatively small surroundings. Although it is not a game that aims for any sort of uber realism it does feature a number of mechanics to encourage slower and more realistic behavior such as a stamina bar and significantly decreased accuracy when moving. Respawning into the battle happens in waves which keeps the action going and prevents too much downtime but unfortunately also encourages less entertaining behavior such as spawn camping.\n\nThe class based system is fairly limited and only changes the weapons you use which creates a rather bland experience.\n\nGraphically it is clear that the old Half-Life engine has run it's course, Day Of Defeat is by no means a good looking game and the lack of detail can get distracting at times especially when considering that it's main rival is the stellar looking Battlefield 1942.\n\nAll in all Day Of Defeat is a mod success. The people that played it before it turned retail are the people that's going to play it afterwards, it's not a game that's looking to pick up any new fans in the transition. Perhaps it is easier to understand if you view this, not as a game going from mod to retail. But as a team of developers going from amateurs to professionals. It is an astonishing accomplishment and I wish them all the best in their future endeavors, I am just not really sure I want to pay for their advancement.","June 2, 2013","false","292.1"," 12 of 34 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","12","34","0","0"

It's a class-based WWII shooter where different classes have different weapon loadouts. Unlike modern FPS games, guns have a kickback YOU have to actively compensate for, and grenades (your own and your enemy's) can be picked up and thrown after the pin has been pulled, making grenades much more versitile and strategic, something that even Day of Defeat: Source lost by replacing traditional grenades with grenade launchers.

(now to the review.)\n\n=Graphics=\n\nNothing great it looks old but still manages to hold up by my standards. that's about it.\n\n=Gameplay=\n\nThe gameplays has two teams (Axis vs. American or British allies) fighting over points on the map and once all points have been captured that's when the round ends. When you die you have to wait for a rienforcement wave comes wich is usually a few seconds but the rienforcement wave timer can be adjusted. there are a few rifle, assault rifle, sub machine gun, and LMG classes to pick from wich all control different (i.e The LMGs have INSANE recoil so use that bipod.). It takes a hit or two to take someone out so you really need to work together and your stamina bar is used for sprinting, jumping, and withstanding LMG kick, it runs out pretty quikly so keep your eye on it.\n\n=My Verdict=\n\nI have yet to find a WWII shooter better than this, it feels so rewarding to kill other players and capping points and it should run fine on your PC seeing how it's kinda old but still very addicting.

The game itself is solid; classes are balanced, the new sprint system is nice (however it could use some tweaking) and weapons are realistic.\n\nEach team that you can play (Allies [Americans], Allies [British] or Axis) has it's own quirks and fancies. Some also have weapons that can only be accessed on certain maps (FG42).\n\nAfter playing as each of the classes, you get a feel for the weapon you have (i.e. you know it's recoil) and you gradually get better with it. The sniper weapons can be centered in the middle of the screen too (but only if you know the command)!

The map community was very active, producing a lot of interesting mechanics, hiding spots, and all around fun campaigns. CAL league was at its height, and this game (along with Counter Strike) were at their peak for competition and overall fun.\n\nCurrently, the servers are mostly filled with bots, people ahead of the VAC ban game, or old players who are still on old computers.\n\nWhen DoD: Source came out, many players took this as a cue to look elsewhere. It wasn't that everyone went to Source, it was that it dawned on them that there were other alternatives (DoD:Source, CoD, MoH, Battlefield, even World of Warcraft).\n\nI recommend this game if you're interested in map creation due to many interestingly laid out maps, strategic placement of architecture and models, game mechanics to win, and ability to create teamwork among groups of 8, 12, or more strangers.","June 24, 2014","true","202.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike modern FPS games, guns have a kickback YOU have to actively compensate for, and grenades (your own and your enemy's) can be picked up and thrown after the pin has been pulled, making grenades much more versitile and strategic, something that even Day of Defeat: Source lost by replacing traditional grenades with grenade launchers.

(now to the review.)\n\n=Graphics=\n\nNothing great it looks old but still manages to hold up by my standards. that's about it.\n\n=Gameplay=\n\nThe gameplays has two teams (Axis vs. American or British allies) fighting over points on the map and once all points have been captured that's when the round ends. When you die you have to wait for a rienforcement wave comes wich is usually a few seconds but the rienforcement wave timer can be adjusted. there are a few rifle, assault rifle, sub machine gun, and LMG classes to pick from wich all control different (i.e The LMGs have INSANE recoil so use that bipod.). It takes a hit or two to take someone out so you really need to work together and your stamina bar is used for sprinting, jumping, and withstanding LMG kick, it runs out pretty quikly so keep your eye on it.\n\n=My Verdict=\n\nI have yet to find a WWII shooter better than this, it feels so rewarding to kill other players and capping points and it should run fine on your PC seeing how it's kinda old but still very addicting.

Some also have weapons that can only be accessed on certain maps (FG42).\n\nAfter playing as each of the classes, you get a feel for the weapon you have (i.e. you know it's recoil) and you gradually get better with it.

The map community was very active, producing a lot of interesting mechanics, hiding spots, and all around fun campaigns. CAL league was at its height, and this game (along with Counter Strike) were at their peak for competition and overall fun.\n\nCurrently, the servers are mostly filled with bots, people ahead of the VAC ban game, or old players who are still on old computers.\n\nWhen DoD: Source came out, many players took this as a cue to look elsewhere. It wasn't that everyone went to Source, it was that it dawned on them that there were other alternatives (DoD:Source, CoD, MoH, Battlefield, even World of Warcraft).\n\nI recommend this game if you're interested in map creation due to many interestingly laid out maps, strategic placement of architecture and models, game mechanics to win, and ability to create teamwork among groups of 8, 12, or more strangers.","June 24, 2014","true","202.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Teams are pit against each other, where they both try to cap all flags. You usually start with 1 flag and try to cap the other 4. The game features a wide selection of classes, you can be the Rifleman, SMG user, Sniper or even a Machine gunner. As far as I remember, most of the classes have grenades.\n\nThere are also a lot of maps in the game, both official and custom and if you have ever played Team Fortress 2 you can visit your favorite cp_orange once again.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't have many players and only a couple of servers, but I recommend it, because its good old game and you might even get sucked in it.","November 15, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sammymbk/recommended/30/","sammymbk","Sammymbk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sammymbk/","52 products in account","A new battle had begun. Our objective as the allied forces: capture all flags and take over Caen. One thing stood in our way- the Axis forces.\nI chose the loadout of a sniper, and on my way to my favourite spot of a derelict building I captured our two closest flags. As I turned the corner, I pulled out my Colt 1911 in case any Nazi scum were lurking, waiting for me. Luckily, my path was unblocked and I safely made it to the window overlooking the courtyard.\nI scoped in to see my good friend John get shot in the balls, then stabbed repeatedly as he lay on the floor helpless. I avenged his death- all it took was a simple pull of the trigger. I saw man after man come out of the Axis base only to meet the cold, fast bullet propelled by my Springfield sniper rifle.\nIt was about ten kills later when I met my match. One of the men I had killed had magically respawned with a rocket launcher! And of course, he knew exactly where I was sniping from. He crawled out of an alleyway, round a statue, aimed and fired.\nI only saw him just in time, but not fast enough to stop him. The rocket flying through the air, towards me seemed to be going in slow motion -everything was. I accepted my death, and it didnt hurt one bit as it flew through the window and obliterated me.\n\n\nAll kidding and stories aside, this is what a 15 year old gamer historian would call a beautiful game. Sure it's got old graphics, but they're really not bad and it has a source version anyway (I prefer the original by the way). The loudouts are varied very well, players tend to be friendly enough and the maps can be amazing.\nBut the best thing about this game is the one hit kills. Most guns kill players very quickly, which makes DOD realistic and exciting. Highly recomended\n\n\nI made this review because I was bored and a good review is always useful when you're deciding whether or not to buy a game.","September 4, 2015","true","159.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
