"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/recommended/12900/","skillless","Peashooter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/","238 products in account","I bought this game when it first came out in the year 2008. It cost 19.90 USD then, and I got it at full price (there wasn't so much discounts on steam back then). Was I skeptical? Yes, I was. I was skeptical because the concept of this game seems simplistic. Of course, this game has convinced me after a while that I have made the correct investment by paying for it at full price.\n\nWhat this game appears to be is that it converts sound files (music files such as .mp3 ones) into a linear ongoing track of some sort. You get to control a small little car-like vehicle, though the only movement you can perform are sideways. The speed of your little car-like thingy is determined by the pace of your music, which is represented by the colour of the track you are riding on. I won't go into detail on the blocks and game play, but that's basically it.\n\nIn short, this game lets you ride the music.\n\nAnd yes, you can ride on almost any musical file you've loaded into the game, and this is what make this game great and worthwhile.\n\nThere is one particular game mode which I like - mono. It's basically a no-brainer where you simply hit the colour blocks and avoid the grey blocks as you move forward along the track. It's a splendid mode to relax yourself with, especially after a day of tiring work when all you want is some of your favourite music and soothing gameplay.\n\nI got it at 2008, and it's 2014 now. Years passed, and many parts of my life have changed. Still, what remained the same is that, after all these years, I will still give new music a run or two here, in audiosurf.\n\nOh and did I mention that I am still getting e-mails from audiosurf's scoreboard saying that I have been dethroned? Yeah, it's nice to see these e-mails amidst all those work mails and all.","January 5, 2014","true","154.5"," 180 of 185 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","180","185","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MCSMeister/recommended/12900/","MCSMeister","MCSMünster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MCSMeister/","114 products in account","Audiosurf is a very, very unique game and is definitely a landmark in the music/rhythm game genre. Unlike other rhythm games, which limit you to specific in-game songs, Audiosurf is limitless - it allows you to play any - that's right, any - MP3 of your choice, so you can suit your gameplay to your own music tastes. This freedom is rarely found, if at all, in music games, and it has set the stage for other music games in the vein of it, such as Beat Hazard and the more recent Melody's Escape. In my opinion, Audiosurf has infinite replay value, as long as you have a large amount of songs to play.\n\nBasically, Audiosurf is a game where you can "ride" your music to a track that moves and flows in sync with the song, as you hit blocks along the way. It’s sort of an amalgamation of F-Zero’s gameplay and Rock Band’s note charts (albeit less precise). Each MP3 has leaderboards, and for songs that haven't been played in the game yet, you have the opportunity to make the first play on a song and create the leaderboards for it yourself. Of course, this isn't the case with more popular songs that many people have played. Leaderboards also have a comments section, where you can (obviously) comment on a song. A neat aspect of leaderboards (and probably my favorite) is that if you get dethroned from the global leaderboards on a song, you’ll receive an e-mail by default, though you can turn it off if you’d prefer. You’ll also get an e-mail if an Audiosurf friend beats your score on a song, regardless of whether you have the throne on it or not.\n\nThere's also several ways you can play Audiosurf: just for fun or for competition. Audiosurf has a variety of different characters that are well-suited for both beginners and the more advanced players, amongst three difficulties - casual, pro, and elite. For example, Mono is the easiest (but also lowest-scoring) character, with a simple strategy - hit the colored blocks and avoid the greys. Then, there are the trickier (but higher-scoring) characters along the way, such as Eraser (my most-played character), which allows you to erase blocks and undo erases to create organized matches, and Pointman, which allows you to scoop up blocks and place them in different spots. It is highly recommended that beginners start with Mono, though, as I have had friends try the more complex characters from the get-go and it did not go very well for them.\n\nHowever, I’m not going to go as far to say the game is for everyone, as people have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to video games. Aside from the fact that you obviously have to like some sort of music, quick thinking, reflexes, and sense of rhythm play a big part as well. Also, if you are one of those people that tire out of songs easily (like myself), you shouldn’t have a problem for the most part in Audiosurf, but if you play for competition and someone dethrones you on a song you like, you may end up playing the song repeatedly to get a good-enough run to reclaim the throne. It’s happened to me a time too many :P\n\nAll in all, if you’re a music lover and want a new visualization experience to go along with your music, Audiosurf might be for you. Be warned, though - it’s very addicting if you have a large library of music.","October 19, 2014","true","236.0"," 115 of 120 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","115","120","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DonateYourHate/recommended/12900/","DonateYourHate","Gueruex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DonateYourHate/","133 products in account","You are staring at your steam games. There is a big list of around 70-80 games. You bought them couple games on the steam summer sale, but they have become bland, boring, and gray. You see you have an extra ten dollars left over from the last game you bought, which for you has also become boring quite quick. You scroll through steam and something catches you eye... Audiosurf. As you check the main page you see it might be fun and buy it. You play for 3 days straight.\n\nThis, is just as I was with Audiosurf, Bored of all my boring war games, the idea was old, and I needed something new. When I got audiosurf, I played the sample song,but thet quickely realized you can play custom music. Me, being a music person had a lot of music downloaded, but others may have to buy a few tracks and albums. I played everything, ranging from Skrillex to Nirvana to The Beatles, but this game can be played with virtually any game. This colorful cheap game was a new expirience to me, the gameplay was like nothing I have ever played before. With the charactor moving fastley dodging some colors and collecting others, making combos, passing song, it was extraodinary.\n\nAudiosurf has many charactors, each with different powerups. Some will scramble colors, others may avoid certain colors or jump colors. The most uniques charactor (and my favorite) Is Ninja mono (With ironman Mode on). It increases speed and difficulty, and all blocks are the same, but you must avoid gray blocks. But some others may prefer different charactors, I enjoy the ride, but some may go for points and records.\n\nOverall this Casual Music/Rythem Game has had me play for days and is quite addicting, but like everygame it has its flaws, it may have beutiful art and interesting gameplay, but after the first few days, you will only play it on days when you have almost nothing to do. Other than that this game is amazing. If you want a cheap game that will give you something to do and you love music, buy this game.\n","November 25, 2013","true","20.2"," 214 of 253 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","214","253","0","5"

Going up, down, left, right, or even a sweet loop. What’s added is that you collect colored blocks and try to make 3 of a certain color match up as you’re riding the waves.

The visuals of the game are utterly awesome, they just add to the effect of the whole experience.\n\nAudiosurf is a must-buy, great gameplay, audio, visual effects; you can play this game for hours and not even notice that much time has gone by.

While some songs are included with the game, the bulk of the game involves taking your personal mp3s, analyzing the tracks themselves, and generating levels on the fly based off of what the music is doing. There's a wide variety of modes, ranging from "avoid gray blocks but get whatever else you can" to trying to match-3 with specific colors, to beingg able to pick up and hold blocks and move them around.\n\nThe game features multiple difficulties for every song in addition to the variety of game modes which, when coupled with being able to run on any track, offers effectively limitless replayability.\n\nEvery song has a leaderboard and you can set up email notifications for when someone passes you, which can lead to some fun back-and-forth competition for the top spot.\n\nWhile a sequel is on its way and may be a better option to pick up, if you're curious what the game/genre is about, you can do much worse than picking up this game. Audiosurf is a ton of fun - I actually have far more than the listed 1.3 hours logged, I simply played it before Steam started properly tracking those stats.","September 8, 2014","true","2.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The small, web-based indie developer “BestGameEver”, despite having one of the worst and most clichéd company names ever, have managed to craft something which is psychedelically unique in its own special way. For a small fee, you get a game which has a practically infinite number of variations to play through, and coupled with this massive replayability, relatively tiny software specifications, and a moreover amazingly addictive experience.\n\nWhilst some might call Audiosurf a racing game, it isn’t like any other racing game I know and honestly, it isn’t. First, you can play within the game practically any piece of music you own, as it supports MP3, OGG, WMA and iTunes, amongst a couple of other formats. The idea is that you actually ‘surf’ along your own music, using a variety of different ships (which are essentially just hover-cars) that have a similar design and look to those in the 1995 game Wip3out. Each ship has a slightly different design, along with a special power, which specifies the distinct game type. While racing along your music, you will pass various differently coloured blocks, and the goal is to make collections of blocks larger than three in a 3x7 grid which moves along with your vehicle on down the track. In that way alone, this aspect of the game is slightly like Connect Four, only with three, and diagonals not counting. The racing aspect comes from the track itself, which again has a similar Wip3out or F-Zero look, and is intricately connected to whatever song you are playing. When the tempo speeds up, the speed of your car increases. Heavy drums and bass will create hills and dips; quiet instrumentation slows and steepens the uphill grade, whilst fast periods of the song will create smooth downward stretches. For example, if you were to play “Yesterday” by The Beatles, the track would be a smooth a slow uphill climb, with only a few bumps here and there. However, playing something like “Communication Breakdown” by Led Zeppelin creates a much faster, and potentially higher scoring, downhill run. On uphill periods, the coloured blocks will be cooler, and less valuable, whilst downhill will have warmer colours worth more points. It really does allow you to “live your music” in a way that you never thought possible.\n\nThere is quite a wide variety of varying modes to play. At the casual level, you can play Mono, where the object is to dodge grey blocks and hit the coloured ones. There is also Pointman, where you are given a spectrum of colours to match into place and the ability to store a block to use later, using various powerups (such as paint all blocks a particular colour, or sort all blocks), along with Double Vision, where you could theoretically play with a friend as the track is divided between two ships. On the moderate and hard levels, all three of these modes repeat with slightly more difficult variations, at the same time introducing the Vegas (randomly shuffles all blocks), Pusher (pushes blocks left and right) and Eraser (deletes all blocks of a certain colour) game types. What with all of these slightly different styles of gameplay, the replay value for wanting to go back just one more time (and then maybe another) explodes through the roof.\n\nThis fusion of puzzle and racing game aspects gives Audiosurf its unique edge. However, the lasting attraction will come from the simple fact of being able to play every piece of music you own, and so naturally giving the game (potentially) the best soundtrack ever, by definition of whatever you hold to be great music. Your high scores for each song are recorded within online leader-boards, divided into three different classes, depending upon which race type you selected. Email updates can inform you if you have been “dethroned” at a particular song, so as to encourage you to get back and reclaim your title. Along with your own music, the game comes with the entire Orange Box soundtrack (so you can now play Portal’s “Still Alive” to your hearts content), and also Audiosurf Radio, which gives free music designed to allow for the most competitive to play for a coveted position on the scoreboard. It is important to remember however that, on the other hand, if you don’t own much music, you aren’t going to get a whole lot out of Audiosurf. The various sound effects interspersed here and there are altogether decent, while the only bad piece of music is the repetitive techno beat which plays over the menus.\n\nGraphically, the game is perfectly sufficient to look at, and actually can appear extremely cool at many points. Whilst the game menus are rather bland, when playing the game itself the colour scheme varies and alters in time with the music, and its approach appears to be coolly minimalistic at first. However, hitting blocks causes stars and circles to explode in the sky with a soft hiss, almost like fireworks. You can also have a dark or light background, the dark one especially lending itself to the psychedelic experience. When flying down a tunnel of drum rolls and electric guitar, you really get a fabulous sense of speed. It is possible to have three different settings of graphical quality, though even the best computers will suffer a slowing of the frame rate at premium, as they do take up a massive amount of processing power. However, the enhanced graphics are more than adequate.\n\nAudiosurf is a simple, but astoundingly accessible game for all types of gamer. Whether you just want to casually surf down Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky”, or obsessively compete for the top score at Eagles “Hotel California”, Audiosurf will let you do it all at your desired pace and difficulty. Go out and get it, and fully experience what The Who meant when they sang, “I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow”.","January 10, 2015","true","21.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Along with your own music, the game comes with the entire Orange Box soundtrack (so you can now play Portal’s “Still Alive” to your hearts content), and also Audiosurf Radio, which gives free music designed to allow for the most competitive to play for a coveted position on the scoreboard. It is important to remember however that, on the other hand, if you don’t own much music, you aren’t going to get a whole lot out of Audiosurf. The various sound effects interspersed here and there are altogether decent, while the only bad piece of music is the repetitive techno beat which plays over the menus.\n\nGraphically, the game is perfectly sufficient to look at, and actually can appear extremely cool at many points. Whilst the game menus are rather bland, when playing the game itself the colour scheme varies and alters in time with the music, and its approach appears to be coolly minimalistic at first. However, hitting blocks causes stars and circles to explode in the sky with a soft hiss, almost like fireworks. You can also have a dark or light background, the dark one especially lending itself to the psychedelic experience. When flying down a tunnel of drum rolls and electric guitar, you really get a fabulous sense of speed. It is possible to have three different settings of graphical quality, though even the best computers will suffer a slowing of the frame rate at premium, as they do take up a massive amount of processing power. However, the enhanced graphics are more than adequate.\n\nAudiosurf is a simple, but astoundingly accessible game for all types of gamer. Whether you just want to casually surf down Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky”, or obsessively compete for the top score at Eagles “Hotel California”, Audiosurf will let you do it all at your desired pace and difficulty. Go out and get it, and fully experience what The Who meant when they sang, “I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow”.","January 10, 2015","true","21.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

You are a tiny ship that needs to collect colorful tiles for points as you fly down a raceway that is shaped according to the music you are flying to! Your ship increases and decreases in speed according to the pace of the music, and in general you need to avoid the grey blocks that don't correspond to your music - or you lose points. Highest points climbs the scoreboard!\n\nThe Good\nWithin the game, you can make use of a variety of streamed music for free, or import your own from your music list. For the most part, the graphics are clear (if a little seizure-inducing), and both the track and your ship's speed correspond to the music well for the majority of the time. There's a variety of game modes to allow you to challenge yourself.\n\nThe Bad\nAs mentioned, the game's graphics are pretty simple, and with the flashing colors and vibrant lights, if there is a game to cause epileptic seizures, this is definitely one.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the game doesn't always pick up a song's tempo or variance for the track and/or speed - which can lead to breakneck races through otherwise relaxing songs, or slow and sleep-inducing cruises while breakneck music violently plays in the background.\n\nThe game almost forces itself into fullscreen mode, though it really doesn't need it, and you have to edit an .ini file to avoid that.\n\nLinux users using older machines may find their WINE driver-interpretation does not line up with the in-game text, leading to corrupted password input.\n\nThe Ugly\nNot really anything. Audiosurf tries to be a music-focused racing game, and pulls it off with panache.\n\nSuggestions\nCan't think of much that isn't already covered in the sister game, Audiosurf 2.\n\nThe Summary\nMusical racing game that seeks to work within it's niche and keep there.  The result?  It works it like it owns it.  9/10\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 27, 2014","true","34.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/recommended/12900/","thistauruslovesgames","Hermix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/","193 products in account","Audiosurf. A nice indie match-three rollercaster ride-along.\n\nThe objective is pretty simple and straight-forward: create 3+ color matches as you ride the road to the end. The roads are based on the song that you choose to ride: (by default) the intense moments of the track are hot colors while the smooth glides are the cool colors. The points gained depends on those colors. Recommended that you match those reds and yellows more than the blues and purples.\n\nMy opinions of it all:\nThe Good\nIt's pretty simplistic and easy to enjoy whenever bored or feel like you wanna do more than just listen to your music. My EDM tends to alternate back and forth from swift to sluggish, giving me a feel of both ends. Watching videos, there is a way to change that blank background, the "rings of intensity," and the prisms that trap collected color blocks, but I haven't played around with that yet. Colors were decent.\n\nThe Bad\nUh, though there are other characters for the three difficulties (Beginner, Expert, Pro) that have a different way of accomplishing the goal, the objective remains the same: create 3+ color matches. The title Audiosurf actually suggested that there would be at least one character/mode that you literally "surf your audio." The creator(s) must not have been able to implement it for reasons unknown to me. Eh, it doesn't matter. Its sequel took care of that request.\n\nOverall\nAs Audiosurf 2 is in its early stages of development as the indie-sequel to Audiosurf [1], I truly do reccomend that players start with the starter. The achievements, as well as the top scores for the songs played, are worth the constant playing, if not to kick out boredom whenever that strikes you hard. Oh, and I forgot to mention this as well! If you want to see dancing colors, there's a free-ride mode, where you can just ride your song freely with no direct mission and stare at the scenery having a fiesta! In that, there's the standard mode (much like Mono with the gray) and visualizer mode--a free-ride mode that splits the screen in two and has four vertical screens depicting that same one path. Definitely suggest players to take some screenshots of that beauty.\n\n--Sir Shinigami.","December 24, 2013","true","122.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I have a few global which means I get dethroned once in a while. When I recieve such a notification, I immediately open Audiosurf and beat the new global score.

It's a total classic and gives you a whole new take on your music. I write techno music myself, so this is a useful tool to see how well the music flows, and how 'intense' the game thinks it is.\nThere isn't really anything I don't like about this game. It's simple, user friendly, and yet has plenty of options for the sake of diversity. I enjoy how there are different difficulties, and different player ships, making the game full of replayability. It's also nice that you can upload any .mp3 file you have, and don't have pay for music in order to play it. You can do this as well, but it's not necessarry. That's a bonus in my perspective. I also like how other people's scores show up on song's you'v e played if they have as well. Gives it kind of a competitive feeling...

There's a dozen or so different variants you can have it build, from the simple to the complex, so whether you want to zoom down a virtual highway, play a puzzle, or simply relax and have it make a pretty visual effect, you can do that.\n\nThe more music you own, the better, and depending on what you choose can make an enormous difference in the difficulty, so it encourages you to play all sorts of genres. The download also includes "The Orange Box" soundtrack, so you get a good chunk of the tunes from Half-Life (2), Team Fortress and Portal to start you off.\n\nThis is one of the great indie games of our time, and you simply must own it.

My only gripes are minor - the engine that the game is based on doesn't seem very good for games, and the point system doesn't let you compare scores across different songs. There is a 'skill point' system in place which is supposed to be based on the difficulty of the song you pick, but I've not seen a way to find out the skill points score for any of your playthroughs. There are ways to modify the way the game works - for example, using four lanes of coloured blocks instead of the usual three - but you have to edit the individual song tags instead of simply selecting an option in-game. Other than these things, this game is amazing. It's based on your music, and it heightens the experience of listening to music.","December 3, 2013","true","35.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was greta then and it is great now. Why? Well because it has a simple but brilliant concept - riding your own music. So after analyzing the song you picked the game creates a track for you to rock (or fail)! Visually it's awesome and combined with the big amount of modes it becomes really fun and relaxing (or stressful, depends on your goal). Sadly, there is no support for online storage or any songs that are not physically on your disk. So to compete with a friend he has to own the same song/track. And while speaking about competing, you also have to have a separate account to be able to submit your scores. In the end I would mention that while mouse is a good option I found using a gamepad the best way to experience Audiosurf. Definitely a great game recommended to anyone who likes music and/or arcade racing games!","October 20, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I never would have thought that a music game could truly be infinitly long.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThis magnificent video game turns your absolute favourite music into a level.\n\nWhat more could you possibly ask for?\n\nThis game is just awesome.  Even if the gameplay was based off of a pre-made set of songs it would still be fantastic. It's a blast to play as you catch and weave through notes. It is similar to that of "DDR" or "Guitar Hero" but not quite like it. It has its own unique twist on the repetitive music games of today.\nThe game is extremely fast paced (or slow, depending on your style of music) and is a joy to play. It has a really good 'pick up and play' vibe to it, so you can play a song or two and then put it down for awhile. The replay value for this game is out of this world, with a literally endless song track that you can play. It plays many audio files, so you won't be limited by the type of sudio files in your library.\n\nOverall, this game is a thoroughly enjoyable experience that I will continue to play for the years to come.

Not only it's one of the few family games out there, it's still fun to play with.\n\nAny song you choose has an impact on your gameplay.

If you do not find that entertaining, there's an option where you can simply relax while listening to your music and do some sightseeing.\n\nIf a song is "recognized" and upon playing it in Audiosurf, the (highest) score will be recorded in a scoreboard in Audiosurf.com (if you have an account there). You can do friendly competition among the community and even with friends who also own the game.\n\nAlthough there aren't that many cons with this game. some are worth to mention. It is pretty old (and there's Audiosurf 2) but still worth your time. Overall, the community has diminished and is barely active. However, they do not dent Audiosurf's reputation.\n\nThus, in conclusion, I highly recommend this game if you want music to choose the flow for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orangestar1/recommended/12900/","Orangestar1","Orangestar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orangestar1/","121 products in account","I've had a review for Audiosurf sitting around listed as "Friends Only" for the longest time now, recommending the game. However, I have to come back and amend this one.\n\nDon't buy Audiosurf.\n\nThis is an extremely controversial opinion to myself. I want to like Audiosurf. Really badly. I love Rhythm and Music games, and I love originality and creativity. That's why it pains me to say I don't reccommend it.\n\nThe game itself is fine. Play a few rounds of the demo and you might find yourself having fun with it. It's legitimately a pretty fun game by all standards. That's where it ends though. It's just "pretty fun".\n\nThe biggest problem I can see is the prevalence of the Mono game mode across YouTube playthoughs and leaderboard scores. Mono is such a bog-standard game mode that it's just enough fun to play as a time killer. It's like Rockband on No Fail mode where half the notes have been removed. It's just not challenging, but worst of all, it's the most fun.\n\nThe main game modes of Audiosurf are based around the three-of-a-kind matching block game on the track, where you have to connect 3 or more notes of similar color. It feels weird and unnatural to miss notes in a rhythm and music game. Trying to make up great combinations of 3-of-a-kinds while gauging how much of the song is left takes up your concentration. You're barely paying attention to the song in the background because what you're performing in-game is practically tangentially related to what's happening in the song.\n\nTheen there's the so-touted "ride your music". The fact that you're able to load up any song you want and get a perfectly personalized track based on what kind of song you've loaded in. The music analyzation algorithm is pretty great. When you play on Freeride, you can pretty much feel with the flow of the track where the computer got each part from. It's like a procedurally generated music video. Hell, it reminds me of the fondness of the Demoscene. It looks great. Too bad the engine chugs like it's got a drinking problem.\n\nThis is where any familiarity with the song ends though. In broad strokes, the algorithm is great. However, the actual note selection process for the gameplay portion of the game falls flat. A swift group of reds perfectly on the beat could be suddenly miscalculated to one note being offbeat. It's jarring, and again, gives that feel that what you're doing and what's happening are two completely seperate entities. Audiosurf is basically making a puzzle game based on your music. You don't ride anything.\n\nThat's where the real realization comes in. Watching Audiosurf is fun. Playing Audiosurf is fun. But when you're not playing Audiosurf, you realize that you pretty much just killed time instead of really playing any sort of game. Despite this review, I'll probably keep playing Audiosurf. Hell, its sequel looks like it's changed up the formula enough to be a nice fresh twist. That's why it's on my wishlist. However, as it stands, Audiosurf isn't really a good game. It's a fun diversion, but it really isn't worth it.\n\nMy reccomendation? See if you can pick up Frequency or Amplitude for PS2. There's no "riding your music", but it's got a similar style and is a hell of a lot more fun.\n\n---------------\n\nThis isn't entirely related to the review, but I don't know how rife the Leaderboards are with score spoofing. It's based on the IDv3 tags in the song, and if that fails it's based on the filename, but if you have a filename that's slightly different to the one that's already been created, you get a completely blank leaderboard for yourself. I don't know what's stopping someone from loading up a KitCaliber song and editing their tags to top the charts on a short, slow song: say With You Friends by Skrillex (kinda bad example but you get it).","November 16, 2015","false","24.6"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","21","38","0","7"

Now with an extra paragraph.\n\nAudiosurf is simply one of the most fantastic indie games to hit the market. This is for the simple reason that you can insert your own songs into the game. Sure, the options are limited to MP3s, but if you have a large collection of them then why not?\n\nEvery song you feed into the game is unique. A random track is generated based on the music and you collect blocks with your craft, attempting to make matches that make you gain the most points. There are a great variety of game modes to choose from (with some requiring more skill than others), and the fact that you can put any song into the game means that your potential replayability is only limited by the size of your library.\n\nThis isn't Guitar Hero's poor cousin. It is its equal. The various colours at times make you feel like you're having an acid trip. And, to be frank, I never got around to liking the Guitar Hero controller. It was really too awkward.\n\nWhen to buy: It's okay to get this full price, but the Humble Store and Steam have recently had pretty sick discounts - 1 USD!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/12900/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Audiosurf is a rhythm game in where you control one of various ships and try to collect blocks of the same color to make them match. You move across three lanes and blocks will be added to your inventory at the bottom of the screen on the lane that you collected it from. One of the neatest features of this game is that it allows you to play your own music and the game changes depending on the type of song you played. Song genres like heavy metal will be fast and frantic, throwing blocks at you to the rhythm of the music while slower paced genres like Country will be much slower and laid-back. It is recommended to start off with slower paced songs until you understand the game. If you don't have any music of your own Audiosurf does come with the Orange Box soundtrack that includes the songs from the Half Life series, Portal and Team Fortress 2. A cool little detail in the “Still Alive” song of Portal is that your ship will be Chell’s Portal Gun. It's not a collection of music that will hold your attention for long so it may be best to have some music you like on your PC before playing.\n\nYou just find the songs you want to play in your music folder and the level will be built on its own. The rhythm and speed of the gameplay is nearly always spot on to whatever song you are playing. The gameplay changes slightly from the different characters you can choose from. One has the ability to hold a block and add it to a lane of his choice while another can delete all colored blocks of the next type you pick up. They are very minor differences between them and it will come down to preference to choose the one you like the most. A character named Mono is the only one that plays far differently and makes all the blocks in the game the same color but you must avoid the gray colorless blocks. I found this character to be the most fun to play as it is more reaction based than strategy based so you can enjoy the song a lot more while still being challenged. There are also two modes where you just listen to the music with no consequences. One is Freeride which you can just drive around in without worrying about blocks and the other is called Visualizer has you just staring at the screen and the trippy colors.\n\nThe environments are very weird and make no sense though they are colorful and you can't help but stare at the weird floating blocks at times. You can change the backgrounds colors and add some screen effects like Negative colors and Paint to miss around with the look of the game. If the sound effects of picking up blocks annoys you and makes your song sound weird you can change it or simply turn sound effects off all together. Collecting enough wrong colored blocks and filling up your inventories lane will cause you to malfunction for a bit and be able to collect any more blocks for a short time. No matter how many times you overfill your inventory there is no losing in this game so the main motivation is to compete on the leaderboards. Unfortunately you have to make an Audiosurf account and give out your email address to be able to post your scores. This game is very old and people have gotten extremely high scores on any song even remotely popular so it can be very hard to compete so having friends that also play this game makes for a far more fun experience if you care about showing off scores.\n\nIt is not all about collecting blocks as you may want to avoid some blocks near the end of the song to get the Clean Finish bonus that rewards you with 25% of your total score. That is when the minimap that displays the entire level comes in handy as you always know how close to ending the song is or when it is about to get intense from a downward drop in the graph. You also get rewarded for avoiding all the gray blocks as Mono so it is wise to remember that it can be far better to let a block go and try to get the hefty bonuses. It gives the game some depth to the game but for those of use that don't really care much about the score it is still fun to play a level made by your choice of song. There is something oddly addicting to jamming out to your favorite songs while collecting colored blocks in a trippy environment. Tons of characters with my personal favorite being Mono, lots of customization and even multiple graphics settings for those with lower end PCs. Never experienced any stutters, crashes or other glitches, just awesome music and tons of fun. Would definitely recommend this game to anyone with music on their computer.","December 21, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Tons of characters with my personal favorite being Mono, lots of customization and even multiple graphics settings for those with lower end PCs. Never experienced any stutters, crashes or other glitches, just awesome music and tons of fun. Would definitely recommend this game to anyone with music on their computer.","December 21, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Oh, there is? And it’s psychedelic euphoria? Awesome, sign me up. Audiosurf makes a game out of your MP3 library, creating interesting, unique experiences for each song. The ability to “surf” every single song (and compare stats on an online leaderboard) makes it one of the most replayable games of all time, and adds incentive to getting into new bands. Actually, I wonder what sort of level Willow Smith’s ‘Whip My Hair’ would make…\n","April 4, 2011","true","254.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/12900/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Audiosurf is a rhythm game in where you control one of various ships and try to collect blocks of the same color to make them match. You move across three lanes and blocks will be added to your inventory at the bottom of the screen on the lane that you collected it from. One of the neatest features of this game is that it allows you to play your own music and the game changes depending on the type of song you played. Song genres like heavy metal will be fast and frantic, throwing blocks at you to the rhythm of the music while slower paced genres like Country will be much slower and laid-back. It is recommended to start off with slower paced songs until you understand the game. If you don't have any music of your own Audiosurf does come with the Orange Box soundtrack that includes the songs from the Half Life series, Portal and Team Fortress 2. A cool little detail in the “Still Alive” song of Portal is that your ship will be Chell’s Portal Gun. It's not a collection of music that will hold your attention for long so it may be best to have some music you like on your PC before playing.\n\nYou just find the songs you want to play in your music folder and the level will be built on its own. The rhythm and speed of the gameplay is nearly always spot on to whatever song you are playing. The gameplay changes slightly from the different characters you can choose from. One has the ability to hold a block and add it to a lane of his choice while another can delete all colored blocks of the next type you pick up. They are very minor differences between them and it will come down to preference to choose the one you like the most. A character named Mono is the only one that plays far differently and makes all the blocks in the game the same color but you must avoid the gray colorless blocks. I found this character to be the most fun to play as it is more reaction based than strategy based so you can enjoy the song a lot more while still being challenged. There are also two modes where you just listen to the music with no consequences. One is Freeride which you can just drive around in without worrying about blocks and the other is called Visualizer has you just staring at the screen and the trippy colors.\n\nThe environments are very weird and make no sense though they are colorful and you can't help but stare at the weird floating blocks at times. You can change the backgrounds colors and add some screen effects like Negative colors and Paint to miss around with the look of the game. If the sound effects of picking up blocks annoys you and makes your song sound weird you can change it or simply turn sound effects off all together. Collecting enough wrong colored blocks and filling up your inventories lane will cause you to malfunction for a bit and be able to collect any more blocks for a short time. No matter how many times you overfill your inventory there is no losing in this game so the main motivation is to compete on the leaderboards. Unfortunately you have to make an Audiosurf account and give out your email address to be able to post your scores. This game is very old and people have gotten extremely high scores on any song even remotely popular so it can be very hard to compete so having friends that also play this game makes for a far more fun experience if you care about showing off scores.\n\nIt is not all about collecting blocks as you may want to avoid some blocks near the end of the song to get the Clean Finish bonus that rewards you with 25% of your total score. That is when the minimap that displays the entire level comes in handy as you always know how close to ending the song is or when it is about to get intense from a downward drop in the graph. You also get rewarded for avoiding all the gray blocks as Mono so it is wise to remember that it can be far better to let a block go and try to get the hefty bonuses. It gives the game some depth to the game but for those of use that don't really care much about the score it is still fun to play a level made by your choice of song. There is something oddly addicting to jamming out to your favorite songs while collecting colored blocks in a trippy environment. Tons of characters with my personal favorite being Mono, lots of customization and even multiple graphics settings for those with lower end PCs. Never experienced any stutters, crashes or other glitches, just awesome music and tons of fun. Would definitely recommend this game to anyone with music on their computer.","December 21, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theimmortalampharos/recommended/12900/","theimmortalampharos","ImmortalAmpharos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theimmortalampharos/","85 products in account","I really wasn't expecting much from AudioSurf. I had tried many music-style games, including Amplitude, DDR, StepMania, Dance Factory, and Frequency, and I had already tried a few games that synchronize some kind of in-game object to music, notably Dance Factory. These games always gave me a poor result and always made me do everything manually, which was way too much work for what I was actually getting, since the presentation of the games ruined my experience with almost no options, a terrible interface, clanky controls, and horrible sound effects. This made me very skeptical of AudioSurf, but a few of my Steam friends had the game and played them very, very much. The game was on sale for 99 cents, so I thought "what the heck, I'll try it."\n\nI certainly would have paid full price for this game. The game has excellent presentation, may options to customize my game, flawless controls, and the sound effects are quite good for the game, although I prefer to turn them off.\n\nObviously, you can't expect perfect audio synthesizing from a program. You will notice very small things that are slightly off the beat, but they do not stop you from being immersed in the song. These little mistakes also only happen in the stranger songs that have many, many beats that make the program hard to detect the true beat. The thing that I really liked that never failed me was the track getting slower and faster. I specifically noticed it when I was playing "Bats!" by MicroThunder, where there is a split second where the song stops in the chorus, and the game actually noticed that small beat change, and the in game speed also changed! It really helps you get really immersed in your music, and it helps you to find little details about the song.\n\nI went through the pros, what about the cons? There are very few cons about this game, and the only notible one is that the game might be a bit challenging for beginners to the music game genre, or even new to video games. That is the only con I can think of.\n\nIs it worth it? Certainly, especially on the sales! 4.5 out of 5!","December 28, 2014","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For one the game is a classic game in a way, it just never gets old. There is still a community for it, and that community is most likely the same community of AS2. but this one just is one you have to find. Its one of those games that you don't have to be in some fancy community to have fun with, I had it for a while before finding the forums. The only thing that makes the game fun is if you and a few friends decide to do competitions by sharing (legally) songs and then the file that goes with said songs, so the competition is fair.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nI say 7 because while they are very pretty, they can be pretty bright, so sometimes playing at night isn't any fun, even when the background and color scheme is set to black. I play on enhanced (just below premium if I'm wrong) and don't lag, while keeping some of the trademark prettiness.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe only reason it loses a point is that you can't use Double Vision with someone else online, which if that were a thing, that would be really awesome, like as mentioned above, sharing song and the file etc etc, but for what it has, its a classic. I do enjoy the levels of difficulty so I can play on one difficulty for one song and then another for a different one and still have fun. Don't get me started on the modded for fun .ash files like Lu-Tze's Final Audacity.\n\nSound: Depends on your library\n\nLeaderboards: 5/10\nThere's leaderboards per song, per difficulty, and even split into friends, nearby, and global. However as I play a lot of downloaded songs from youtube, or songs no one has except for a select few, I don't get ot participate in the whole leaderboard thing except with the built in tracks.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nThe game has been around but the formula isn't old, I enjoy this game a lot and continue to do so, this game wasn't made by some big shot team so don't forget that.\n\nTL;DR:\n8/10\nWould surf again and will surf again.","October 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theimmortalampharos/recommended/12900/","theimmortalampharos","ImmortalAmpharos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theimmortalampharos/","85 products in account","I really wasn't expecting much from AudioSurf. I had tried many music-style games, including Amplitude, DDR, StepMania, Dance Factory, and Frequency, and I had already tried a few games that synchronize some kind of in-game object to music, notably Dance Factory. These games always gave me a poor result and always made me do everything manually, which was way too much work for what I was actually getting, since the presentation of the games ruined my experience with almost no options, a terrible interface, clanky controls, and horrible sound effects. This made me very skeptical of AudioSurf, but a few of my Steam friends had the game and played them very, very much. The game was on sale for 99 cents, so I thought "what the heck, I'll try it."\n\nI certainly would have paid full price for this game. The game has excellent presentation, may options to customize my game, flawless controls, and the sound effects are quite good for the game, although I prefer to turn them off.\n\nObviously, you can't expect perfect audio synthesizing from a program. You will notice very small things that are slightly off the beat, but they do not stop you from being immersed in the song. These little mistakes also only happen in the stranger songs that have many, many beats that make the program hard to detect the true beat. The thing that I really liked that never failed me was the track getting slower and faster. I specifically noticed it when I was playing "Bats!" by MicroThunder, where there is a split second where the song stops in the chorus, and the game actually noticed that small beat change, and the in game speed also changed! It really helps you get really immersed in your music, and it helps you to find little details about the song.\n\nI went through the pros, what about the cons? There are very few cons about this game, and the only notible one is that the game might be a bit challenging for beginners to the music game genre, or even new to video games. That is the only con I can think of.\n\nIs it worth it? Certainly, especially on the sales! 4.5 out of 5!","December 28, 2014","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While Audiosurf is far from amazing, it fits the bill for general entertainment and it's reasonably low filesize and quick loading times only serve to help it achieve this goal. With your choice of music ranging from .mp3 to .wmv files, multiple different "characters" to choose from, each embodying a unique play style for either casual playing or for a more challenging experience which is helped by Steam achievements and online leaderboards to test your skills.\nHowever there are drawbacks as always. My first time trying to play only resulted in an endless cycle of stupid in the form of "Audiosurf cannot detect Quicktime, please install Quicktime" yadda-yadda. While not a problem anymore I see that this glitch is common and can ruin a newcomers experience. All that in mind, I reccomend Audiosurf for anyone looking to chill.","December 25, 2011","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The big advantage of this game is that the huge flood of music on the planet Earth makes this game nearly never-ending, and every ride is unique and some are even real challenges. In addition, there's a whole lot of game modes that make Audiosurf even more interesting.\nThe fact that the game crashes for me every now and then when closing it is forgiveable. And I really can't find any other negative things, as much as I search for them.\nSo, all in all, a clear recommendation! Yes, I know there's Audiosurf 2, yes, I know Audiosurf 1 doesn't receive any more updates, but the sequel doesn't look too appealing to me.

For one the game is a classic game in a way, it just never gets old. There is still a community for it, and that community is most likely the same community of AS2. but this one just is one you have to find. Its one of those games that you don't have to be in some fancy community to have fun with, I had it for a while before finding the forums. The only thing that makes the game fun is if you and a few friends decide to do competitions by sharing (legally) songs and then the file that goes with said songs, so the competition is fair.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nI say 7 because while they are very pretty, they can be pretty bright, so sometimes playing at night isn't any fun, even when the background and color scheme is set to black. I play on enhanced (just below premium if I'm wrong) and don't lag, while keeping some of the trademark prettiness.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe only reason it loses a point is that you can't use Double Vision with someone else online, which if that were a thing, that would be really awesome, like as mentioned above, sharing song and the file etc etc, but for what it has, its a classic. I do enjoy the levels of difficulty so I can play on one difficulty for one song and then another for a different one and still have fun. Don't get me started on the modded for fun .ash files like Lu-Tze's Final Audacity.\n\nSound: Depends on your library\n\nLeaderboards: 5/10\nThere's leaderboards per song, per difficulty, and even split into friends, nearby, and global. However as I play a lot of downloaded songs from youtube, or songs no one has except for a select few, I don't get ot participate in the whole leaderboard thing except with the built in tracks.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nThe game has been around but the formula isn't old, I enjoy this game a lot and continue to do so, this game wasn't made by some big shot team so don't forget that.\n\nTL;DR:\n8/10\nWould surf again and will surf again.","October 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cikikrulz/recommended/12900/","cikikrulz","Unitron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cikikrulz/","43 products in account","What would happen if you combined Racing gameplay, Arcade action, and Music into one game? You get Audiosurf.\n\nAs far as music-based games go, usually they are very limited. You have your Guitar Heroes and Rock Bands, and then you have your Rocksmiths; however, there is a game that falls into none of those categories, Audiosurf.\n\nAudiosurf is a rhythm-based game, that plays similar to multiple game genres. It has the feel of a racing game, the gameplay of an arcade game, and of course the music. Unlike Guitar Hero or those kinds of games, you are not limited to the songs you can play, you can play any song that is on your PC. Instead of a pre-determined setlist, I can have my pick. How it works is that the game generates a different track for each and every song you pick to play from your computer, so there is endless replay value as long as you have an extensive library of music like I do.\n\nThere are various game modes and difficulty levels you can play, Casual, Pro, and Elite are each of the difficulties. Game modes include:\n\nMono: In Mono you only have to collect one kind of block unlike other modes, you may think this as being too easy, but let me tell you, playing on harder difficulties or intricate songs, it can get really intense. You have to avoid all of the grey blocks in Mono mode, but on harder difficulties the grey blocks will be the main object on the screen.\n\nPointman: With Pointman you have to match multiple colored blocks, more or less depending on the difficulty. You have the power here to pick up blocks and place them in different spots or pick up a powerup and wait for the perfect time to use it. This adds a lot of strategy to a seemingly casual game.\n\nVegas: This is another favorite mode of mine. With Vegas, you have the power to randomly generate powerups and shuffle the board so you can get matches and avoid overfilling.\n\nEraser: This mode allows you to erase a certain type of block from your board. This, like Pointman adds a great deal of strategy to the game.\n\nPusher: This mode lets you push blocks to another side to use for later. Another very strategic mode.\n\nDouble Vision: This is the amazing multiplayer, It's much like the modes other then Mono, except that you don't have the powers. I have had so much fun with this co-op multiplayer.\n\nThe high score system adds in a healthy dose of competition, and usually even on less popular songs there will be some sort of competition waiting. So even if you run out of songs to play, you'll still be able to try and master the songs you've played.\n\nAudiosurf is more then worth the 10 bucks it costs on Steam, and is a wonderful game that I'm sure you'll keep coming back to, Right up in the top 10 of my favorite PC games of all time. To be honest, there are no flaws in this game from what I can tell. Certainly a game worthy of more notice.\n\nIf you love video games and music, then this game is certainly for you.","July 10, 2014","true","324.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When you do good or at least you think (The scoring system is a little random) you feel like a total BADASS but the gameplay becomes a bit stale after a few 3 to 5 minute songs.\nIt has some built in tracks but mostly relies on your own music library providing a brand new "course to surf" with every new track. The courses consist of 3 lanes, guitar hero style notes appearing in the lanes for your ship in which you control to surf across to add to your score. With the inclusion of dead notes and notes to hold, its a simple pick up and play, best with a controller in my experiences and best in short doses which in an era of post guitar band rock heroes ++Hyper Beetles Ultra edition is just fairly good.\nProvided you keep some of your favorite tunes available on your computer I would recommened Audiosurf to anyone looking for a casual game and OCremix.com to anybody looking for some sweet vidja game tunes to play along to those who do not but would like to try it out the game to the fullest.\nThe game lacks some polish in the menus and feel very indie and amatuer in comparison to other popular music games but it works. A mix of Guitar Hero and with a touch of Rez and a podracing game, Id give it a go on a good sale if I was lacking in my music games.","November 23, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(>200 hours logged, granted some of those were my dad, sister, and friend, but still it's awesome) It's really fun and there's all sorts of settings that you can mess around with to change the colors, disable the weird effects and stuff if you have issues with that sort of thing. Normally a lot of games make me motion sick, but this one surprisingly doesn't. On top of all those convenient things, a game based mostly on your own music? Nice!

There are multiple "gamemodes", which have somewhat different tasks and abilities you can use, but I prefer the simplest "mono" mode where all you have to do is collect the colored blocks and avoid grey ones for the highest possible score.\nPerhaps the biggest advantage of the game is that it can use literally any sound file, but you preferably want to play it with some music you like <.<","October 7, 2014","true","27.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a fun experience where one can plug in their choice of song and ride the stream to the beat and flow of the music. Match colors to earn points as you ride the wave. Don't hit the grey colors though. They take away your chances for high combos. The game with purchase comes with the soundtrack to The Orange Box. Background colors can be adjusted to make it easier on the eyes. I recommend this game to anyone who just loves music and to those who are great at games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Digitalrazor/recommended/12900/","Digitalrazor","DigitalRazor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Digitalrazor/","170 products in account","AudioSurf, where music meets gaming. I've recently had the pleasure of playing AudioSurf and I must say I'm quiet impressed. Coming from a small indie developer, AudioSurf was a game I had little interest in buying till it was on sale for the price of $1. I thought to myself at that point "Why not give this game a try?" and it was one of the best investments I've made in a long time. For those of you who are familiar with games such as Osu! or to some extent Guitar Hero or Rock Band this game incorperates much of what those games thrive on. The game lets you pick any audio file as your track and you playout a skill based puzzle game in an attempt to rack up as many points as possible. The difficulty of the track however depends on the audiofile used, for instance if I you a simplistc mello song the track will play out as such, however if I pick something radical and upbeat I will find myself having a hard time hitting the marks and getting the points. Like Osu! and most other music skill based games the concept is simple but is hardly something people would call "easy", to change things up you also get the option to use "characters" that act as modifiers. These characters can change the game drastically and will keep you on your toes if you choose to change them up from time to time. If you're not sold on the game already then you probably won't enjoy it. The graphics are pretty but won't be enough to keep you playing. What will keep you playing is the literally endless tracks (as you can input more at anytime), soild skill based gameplay which leads into many leaderboards and such to see how you compare with friends.\n\nOverall AudioSurf is a great little game which borrows many aspects from some of the best "music" based games out there. Though you might not get something as polished along the likes of Guitar Hero, there is much fun to be had and I would highly recommend this to anyone in the procrastination market.","December 3, 2013","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/12900/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","To me, this game fits in the same category as Minecraft, in the sense of a game I can launch and play quickly while I'm bored or waiting for a download to finish. While Audiosurf is far from amazing, it fits the bill for general entertainment and it's reasonably low filesize and quick loading times only serve to help it achieve this goal. With your choice of music ranging from .mp3 to .wmv files, multiple different "characters" to choose from, each embodying a unique play style for either casual playing or for a more challenging experience which is helped by Steam achievements and online leaderboards to test your skills.\nHowever there are drawbacks as always. My first time trying to play only resulted in an endless cycle of stupid in the form of "Audiosurf cannot detect Quicktime, please install Quicktime" yadda-yadda. While not a problem anymore I see that this glitch is common and can ruin a newcomers experience. All that in mind, I reccomend Audiosurf for anyone looking to chill.","December 25, 2011","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some songs don't have waves at all while others are full of them and then there are the ones in middle, where waves are weak and not so rhythmic.\n\nAll in all, it's a great way to play and enjoy your music.

Durch eine frei wählbare Farbwahl für die abzufahrenden Strecken oder durch lustige Gimmicks wie das Portal-Surfgameplay wird Audiosurf noch interessanter.

The gameplay is quite simple; use your mouse/arrows/gamepad/ other buttons to move the shuttle around onto the different parts of the track to hit coloured blocks and accumulate as many points as possible. Except for that, there is not much more to do. Everything is already unlocked, and there are no other reasons except for the achievements to play any other mode except for the ones you like the most or prefer.\nThe visuals in the backround and on the track is appealing. This is a game that plays with colours, and it does it in the most fabulous way. It is a joy to look at how the colours vary with each and every song, especially when the colour compliments the mood of the song I listen to (dance/trance/house/techno), but the results may differ.\nThis is a game that nobody should miss out on. This is a great package, and despite the fact that you may restrict yourself from trying to play multiple game modes, you will always be entertained.\n\nScore: 9/10\n\n+ Free choice of music\n+ Fun and entertaining\n+ Simple\n+ Friendly for beginners\n+ Amazing visuals\n+ Great in its entirety","January 3, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hated the Guitair Hero series and Dance Dance Revolution never interested me.  Audiosurf, however, makes racing to your music a lot of fun!\n\nBasically, you have different difficulty levels along with different challenges depending on which mode you choose.  You then take any MP3 you have and load it into the game.  From there, the track is created by the game based on the music itself, where you can race through a brightly coloured obstacle course.\n\nMaybe that sames boring, but it's actually a lot of fun and requires some real skill to navigate some tracks.  I'd strongly suggest this title, even if you don't normally play "music games."  Best of all, it's relatively cheap and there's a demo to test it out.","July 7, 2011","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes Audiosurf better than other music-based games of its nature such as Guitar Hero and Rock Band is that you aren't limited to a pre-made track list. Whatever music you enjoy listening to, you can play in this game. On top of that, the gameplay modes keep the game fresh and the varying difficulty levels allow you to step up your game once you've had some time to get used to it.\n\nI would highly recommend this game!","September 19, 2011","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For one the game is a classic game in a way, it just never gets old. There is still a community for it, and that community is most likely the same community of AS2. but this one just is one you have to find. Its one of those games that you don't have to be in some fancy community to have fun with, I had it for a while before finding the forums. The only thing that makes the game fun is if you and a few friends decide to do competitions by sharing (legally) songs and then the file that goes with said songs, so the competition is fair.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nI say 7 because while they are very pretty, they can be pretty bright, so sometimes playing at night isn't any fun, even when the background and color scheme is set to black. I play on enhanced (just below premium if I'm wrong) and don't lag, while keeping some of the trademark prettiness.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe only reason it loses a point is that you can't use Double Vision with someone else online, which if that were a thing, that would be really awesome, like as mentioned above, sharing song and the file etc etc, but for what it has, its a classic. I do enjoy the levels of difficulty so I can play on one difficulty for one song and then another for a different one and still have fun. Don't get me started on the modded for fun .ash files like Lu-Tze's Final Audacity.\n\nSound: Depends on your library\n\nLeaderboards: 5/10\nThere's leaderboards per song, per difficulty, and even split into friends, nearby, and global. However as I play a lot of downloaded songs from youtube, or songs no one has except for a select few, I don't get ot participate in the whole leaderboard thing except with the built in tracks.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nThe game has been around but the formula isn't old, I enjoy this game a lot and continue to do so, this game wasn't made by some big shot team so don't forget that.\n\nTL;DR:\n8/10\nWould surf again and will surf again.","October 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a lot of fun, very addictive, and definitely one of my favorite games of all time. I recommend this to anyone who loves and can just get lost in music for hours.

Anyone who enjoys music and games will be kept up all night by this addictive racer/puzzler, all the while saying, "Just one more song". I've learned that music with high tempos and treble will be alot more fast paced with colors ranging from yellow to red, while songs that lack tempo and are quieter will be a slower ride with warm purples and soft blues. I can't recomend this game enough. When I bought it, I stayed up almost all night going through my music library searching for the most thrilling songs. Personally, I like to race to electronic music, especially Owl City's more house-ish tracks. Angles And Airwaves is also really good to play with. I hope this review was informative in any way.

Es gibt einem die Möglichkeit, die Musik auf dem heimischen Rechner in das Spiel zu laden und eine nach der Musik generierte Strecke abzufahren. Da jedes Musikstück anders ist, wird dieses Spiel nie langweilig und man fragt sich immer wieder: "Wie spielt sich dieser Song wohl...?" und spielt noch 'ne Runde. Durch eine frei wählbare Farbwahl für die abzufahrenden Strecken oder durch lustige Gimmicks wie das Portal-Surfgameplay wird Audiosurf noch interessanter. Fazit: ein nahezu niemals endender Spielspaß mit immer anderen Spielerfahrungen machen dieses Spiel zu einem der besten, derzeit erhältlichen Musikspiele!","July 27, 2012","true","95.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the best features in the game is the Ninja Mono. Play Ninja Mono and relax or go intense depending on your selected song.

Es gibt einem die Möglichkeit, die Musik auf dem heimischen Rechner in das Spiel zu laden und eine nach der Musik generierte Strecke abzufahren. Da jedes Musikstück anders ist, wird dieses Spiel nie langweilig und man fragt sich immer wieder: "Wie spielt sich dieser Song wohl...?" und spielt noch 'ne Runde. Durch eine frei wählbare Farbwahl für die abzufahrenden Strecken oder durch lustige Gimmicks wie das Portal-Surfgameplay wird Audiosurf noch interessanter. Fazit: ein nahezu niemals endender Spielspaß mit immer anderen Spielerfahrungen machen dieses Spiel zu einem der besten, derzeit erhältlichen Musikspiele!","July 27, 2012","true","95.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact I owned it long before I really got into buying and playing games on Steam. But is it good? In a word, absolutely.\n\nAudioSurf is one of the only games I can think of that offers truly unlimited replayability. The only limit is on the extent of your own personal music library and how much you like a particular song. It's simply really. You choose a song, the game analyzes it, and it creates a colorful and vibrant race course based on the tempo and beat of the song. You race down this course, all the while collecting colored blocks based on your chosen character, and then at the end, you get a score. Every song has a leaderboard that you can compete with others on.\n\nThe characters are spread out among three difficulties and range from simply matching colors to collect points, to dodging grey blocks and picking up colored ones, to the ability to shuffle and erase certain blocks, and more. If you're really hardcore you can even put on "Iron Mode" which allows for no mistakes whatsoever. No other benefit mind you, just bragging rights.\n\nYou can use any audio track you want really, even if its a podcast or something. It's up to you completely what songs you play, how often you play them, and what characters you use. The cost of the game pays for itself almost indefinitely.","May 16, 2014","true","67.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After I first bought the game I nearly tried out all of my favorite songs. You are steering different kinds of spacecrafts and you have to collect cuboids to fill up three columns (for double it is 6, I think). There are different characters (which can differ depending on the diffuculty you play) you can exactly do this with, the game builds up a track - fitting to the music - and then you collect these cuboids, I mostly play with the mono character. So for the mono character there is only one color you have to collect and on the higher difficulties you have to avoid grey blocks as well. The different difficulties are the following: Casual, Pro and Elite. I prefer playing on the pro level, because elite is a little bit too hard and and casual is too easy. If elite still isn't hard enough for you, you can turn on the ironmode, which makes the game even faster. The different levels of difficulty can give you more or less extra abilities, like the ability that allows you to collect blocks at all three lanes at the same time, but this ability gets removed on the elite difficulty.\nThe other classes were way to hard to play - at least for me - and thus I just tried them from time to time, but I never really got to play them much.\nIn addition there are scoreboards for every song, there is one for every difficulty, but I found it nearly impossible to get to the top of one (maybe I am just too bad). There were a few songs where I scored highest, but these weren't really much played by others.\nSo if you like music very much and you want a way to experience it in a completely new way, then try out "Audiosurf".\n\nP.S. "Audiosurf 2" is in early access right now and it contains the mono-mode and a few others, but there is a lot of stuff in the steam workshop you can try out, which is very cool as well, so it's worth to take a look at it as well.","December 29, 2013","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tailszefox/recommended/12900/","tailszefox","Tailszefox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tailszefox/","738 products in account","AudioSurf gameplay is fairly simple: get the colored blocks, avoid some other blocks, try to make them match. There's a few variations that basically change how you get and arrange the blocks, but the basis is always the same. That would make it a pretty standard puzzle game if it was its only aspect, though.\n\nWhat sets AudioSurf apart is the ability to import any kind of music and literally play it. Not just as a background music, but as the layout for the whole level. Elevation and speed, as well as the arrangement, frequency and colors of the blocks are all determined by the music. While a fair amount of games on Steam boast this ability, very few are capable to produce a level that feels unique and actually entirely determined by the music you import. As such, AudioSurf's tagline, "Ride your music", is pretty accurate.\n\nAt the end of the day, AudioSurf gameplay is very simple, and it's unlikely you'll spend hours upon hours on it trying to get the perfect score (unless that's really your thing). But personally, each time my music collection grows, I like to give a try to my newly acquired songs; the experience is different each time, and it makes you appreciate your songs with a new and interesting perspective.\n\nAlso, unlike a lot of other custom-music games who are stuck with MP3, AudioSurf also supports FLAC and OGG, which is pretty awesome in my book.","February 1, 2015","true","35.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
