When I bought the game it said "Multiplayer", but has now been fixed to say "local co-op".\n\nHere's a first impressions video; review continues below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rp74hR1ANg\n\nThis game plays like a mild-mannered cousin of Agar.io and Sparkle Evolution. You play as a small organism who you move around the screen, eating everything smaller than you and avoiding things bigger than you. You do this until you evolve, and then you do it again as an 'evolved' version of the previous creature. When you evolve, gameplay changes a bit in things like speed, acceleration, and additional abilities like a dash move.\n\nThe sound is nice and the music fits really well. The graphics are lovely-  simple, but not plain. And that's what you'd want from this sort of title.\n\nI'm torn on whether to recommend it or not, as it's only 99 cents and is obviously well made, but I'm really not sure I'll ever play it again. I'm going to say YES.","February 1","true","1.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","20","26","3","0"

You start as a wee little fish and eat your way to the top of the food chain. You will continue to grow and evolve up to 10 times; assuming you avoid the sharks and eat all the puny fish.\n\nThis game was originally created in less than 48 hours; while I’m extremely impressed with that; it does show in a few areas. The graphics are well done and pretty unique. The constant white background eliminates some depth of content though. Multiplayer is also just Local so that is basically worthless to someone like me. Online mode would be great.\n\nOverall, for 99 cents you get a pretty enjoyable game that has a plethora of modes to choose from including: Shark Survival, Arcade, Multiplayer and more! It's one of the better paid games you can grab for $1, but not something you specifically need to track down.\n\nWorth $2; only 99 cents though!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

But every game needs too improve. so here are some ideas.\n\n1.) Make a back round that doest move with you.

What if there was a mode where it started out blank. and you had the option to add feesh and invormental stuff in it. also change the colors of stuff.\n\n3.) add invormental stuff.\n\n4.) Add a bunch of cool music to it! well i shoud say add a diferent song with a diferent mood with each evolution.\n\n5.) Make it so you can see your mass (not points, mass) and otheres mass so you know if you are big enough to devour their soul or not.\n\n5.) online mode, of course!\n\n6.) A way to earn money and spend it on health. But you can't use that health in shark mode!\n\n7.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/415240/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Sometimes you just need a game that you can zen out of. For me that just about sums up Terrifying Jellyfish’s debut game, Feesh. The Steam description is particularly well written here because it explains in good detail the point of the game and there really isn’t much more to it than what is already stated there. So instead of going on a long winded post explaining the to’s and about’s the game I’m just going to state how it made me feel.\n\nMeditation isn’t one of my strong points. I’m generally a highly wired individually. Often to my own detriment. I can jump from 0 to 500 in the blink of an eye. Ainslie has tried to help me learn meditation techniques. I generally lack the patience. I can make mountains out of mole hills. I guess this has had a bit to do with my upbringing from the tough western suburbs of Melbourne but also stems from experiences later in life when I suppose you could say I was still a little impressionable. Meditation hasn’t worked as intended. I’ve found that video games can sometimes be an outlet for that – though they can also have the opposite rage inducing effect. Feesh is one of the first games that I’ve come across that really has that zen/meditational effect on me.\n\nThere isn’t much to the game. At least not in my experience to it. Its minimalist in a good way. It doesn’t have to offer anything more than what it does. It certainly wont appeal to everyone. Those seeking an epic experience are looking at the wrong game. But for those who can sense the meditative, calming and simpleness of a game such as this and can use it as a timeout then it’s fantastic. The sound, though one sound – it sounds like a kazoo – is rather annoying, the graphics, everything works to achieve this affect for me. I can definitely see myself returning time and again to continue to zen out.\n\nYou clever beans Terrifying Jellyfish. Now back to chillout mode.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group and curation please join us and follow us at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 10","true","9.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Plus it is a Ludum Dare game so that gets super high respect from me because I have participated in some of those in the past and they are not easy. Anyway, the game is very polished, has a simple but good art style, and enjoyable gameplay. It is comparable to agar.io, but I would say that it is much better. My only complaint would be that I feel that the camera is zoomed in a tad too much at the beginning of each evolution because I always find myself moving along and suddenly being eaten by a slightly larger fish. Maybe that was part of design in order to make the beginning of each evolution even more challenging, I don't really know. There are multiple game modes, which is good too.\n\nPros:\nSimple artwork\nFun, relaxing gameplay\nMultiple game modes\nUber respect for Ludum Dare entry as good as this\nUnderpriced\n\nCons:\nSlightly wonky camera at times\nSome REALLY challenging achievements(only if you are into 100%ing games is this a con)\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7/10. It is small and simple, but what it does it excels at. I would highly suggest this game for its full price, even more perhaps.","March 17","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've tried countless times now, the sharks are far too punishing to make the game fun. I understand having a predator that can eat you and follows you around but dont have 50 of them on 1 level unless its the shark attack mode. Theres no place for that ♥♥♥♥ in arcade or multiplayer. You get to the dashing feesh and the screen is so small that you dash right into a shark and theres NOTHING you can do. Its no longer a game about avoiding larger feesh and trying to eat, its a game about if you are lucky enough not to run into one of the 10+ sharks that are forever hunting you. DONT GET THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE!\n\nTo the Developer: If you dont plan to reduce the shark number to 2 max at any given point in arcade or multiplayer, then at the very least add an indicator that shows where the sharks are on the edge of the screen. Like a small icon pointing toward them so you dont blindly dash to your death. Both would be great and I would gladly give it another try after that.","May 11","false","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That said, I have to disagree with reviews that call it amazing in any way.  The fact that it was originally constructed in less than 2 days is an impressive feat, I have to agree, but the economy of action shows.  It needs a lot more love to be really noteworthy.  In particular the game is too easy at this point.  It's fairly sleep inducing it's so easy.  Your first time through, you will likely evolve several times without too much effort.  Figuring out what each critter does to/for you is interesting at first, but the mechanics aren't nearly deep enough to hold one's attention.  Furthermore, the backgrounds are a solid color, and you can't zoom in/out on your own, so you have no sense of scale until you've nearly outgrown the petri shaped dish.  That said, the controller controls were fairly tight and I did enjoy the fact that the developer took obvious care on the controls.\n\nSo, it's neat concept, but don't expect to get a ton of gameplay out of it.","February 27","false","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

These are not small problems either, they are game stopping. Every game we played we had to restart because the controls would not respond properly, or at all. Player 4 gets booted from the game as soon as it starts. The start menu has no way of exiting, as the exit button doesn't work. Really, it is just not a well made game, save your money.\n\nEDIT: I thought I should add that most of these problems occured during multiplayer.

Was it worth it? Probablly not. Was it fun? Fairly. Will I do it again? Yup, as soon as I see someone has beat my score. The game is quite entertaining for only $1 so I don't really see the point in not buying it especially if you like the first stage of Spore or like Agar.io. It's not the most revolutionary game out there but it is a fun little time killer. The one downside I have seen? The multiplayer kinda sucks. It starts and someone gets a little bigger than the other player/players and wrecks face then it is over. It only lasts about 1 to 2 min. If that got changed than I would 100% recommend this game for $1. Pick up the game if you want something to do for a little while or to play every now and then. I don't think it will hold you for to long though. If you are looking for a game to play all day this probablly isn't it. I rate it 8/10","February 14","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well let me tell you wether or not its the game you want in your Steam libary. So Feesh, taking a quick glanse at it, it simply seems like an agar.io rip off, but please don't get the game just so you can go into the reviews section and type: "THIZ GAM IZ JAST AGROI EXCEPT FISH! AND PLUS AGROI IZ FRE!" Ignore those ingnorant people. Anyways, Feesh in my opinion is deffiantly worth the price! If you got it on a sale... Well, whats even wrong with you, you cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cough up a buck! Anyways I'll start with the pros.\n\n\n\nPros:\n- Fairly cheap for such a good game, especaily if you get it on a sale.\n\n-Nice graphics.\n\n-Local multiplayer.\n\n-Simple but addictive gameplay.\n\n-Different modes.\n\n-Acievements to keep all you complietionists busy.\n\n\nSo yeah thats all the pros, but now we have the cons.\n\n\nCons:\n-Simple gameplay, gets repetitive.\n\n-No online multiplayer.\n\n-You grow way to fast, making arcade mode way easier.\n\n-The sprites don't really have any kind of movement to them, making it kind of look like statues chasing after eachother trying to bump into eachother. ( Well some do... )\n\n\nSo there, thats mostly what the game is sort of like so my final review of the game, yeah I would recomend it!\n\n7/10 Seafood Eating Simulator 2016\n\n","March 24","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
