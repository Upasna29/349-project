This game actually simulates the real wait time experience of waiting on long loading screens, but without the hassle and annoyance of having to play some game inbetween!  For all of you who have upgraded to the topnotch computer technology of today, and simply miss the bygone days of waiting on a loading screen so long you can get up, take a bathroom break, fix a supper, and take the garbage out all long before the loading screen has finished, than this is the game for you!  When you first start out your loading screen simulations only take a minute or two, but don't worry, with true dedication you can work your way up to six minute, nine minute, twelve minute waits . . . and beyond!\n\nNow the developers know that too much of a good thing must be curbed, so you are limited to only waiting 100 minutes each real-time day.   But never fear, you can hand them wads of real world money so that you can continue to enjoy hours and hours of waiting well beyond that first 100 minutes.  Add to that the possibility of a pay-to-win scheme for some character that you level up by waiting, and then pay money to enhance so that you can be the Load Screen Arena champion.  Get your name on the leaderboards and prove to the world that you can wait on load screens like a true champion and pay real world money to squash all those fools under you who are too niave to pay their hard earned money to be better than you!\n\n\nOk, in all seriousness, there just isn't enough to do in this title to really make it a game.  You set out on "quests" which you get to pick one of three from the inn.  Wait for the designated time on a screen still until there is a small "battle" (back-and-forth lowering of hitpoints between you and a monster that you do not get to affect in any way as it is determined by your character's current stats) and you receive the reward you picked when you picked the quest up.  you get to make minimal decisions of what stats to increase and equipment to upgrade, which for the most part, is just pick the next piece of equipment offered that has better stats than your current equipment.  There is almost no strategy in making decisions, and if you really want to "prove" to others that you are better, than you can pay money to enhance your stats faster so that you win in the arena matches which are also static back-and-forth, hitpoint lowering, attacks that you can not influence other than paying money to increase your characters static stats befor the battle.\n\nI put my time into this game as most reviews said the negative reviewers hadn't played far enough into the game to really enjoy it.  It's not a terrible game, and it is free to try out, but as you can only play one Steam game on your account at a time, you do not have the option of just minimizing this game and playing something more entertaining while you wait to make your two choices befor having to wait again.  There are other games to put hours into that you will be more engaged with and that have more choices and strategy, so I would not recommend wasting those hours on this title.  The higher you get in this game, the more options you unlock (dungeons, fortress building, pets) but it is more of the same substanceless fluff as the earlier game stuff, so it is hardly worth the hundreds of hours required to put in just to get there.  This title might work on Facebook, or some such forum where you are fiddling with a few options befor reading through posts and blogs and the like, but not really great for locking up your Steam account where you can't enjoy any other games while you wait on this one.","May 10","false","30.3"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","90","44","49","25","3"

Unlike other, more recent clickers, there isn't really much to do. The game is extremely grindy and with Grindy I mean having an option to select between one of three quests, although alternating, which comes with a quest reward, a time frame which the quest will take up and how much of your Thirst for Adventure it costs you.\n\nEach day you get 100 minutes worth of Quest for Adventure, after which you can use real currency to replenish the Quest for Adventure or wait till the day ticks over. The game lets you 'work' for the city guard, which basically is just a way to send your character for an hour or two to work, earning money.\n\nMore interesting features like Pets are hidden behind a level barrier, requiring you to go as far as level 75 to unlock pets. And you do so by going on the aforementioned quests. At the beginning those take mere minutes and even though there is a fight at the end of it, you have no control over the fight. Just watch your portrait send some cheap effect at their portrait as their (and your) HP bar goes down.\n\nThe game is awfully passive, even for a clicker and I think there are better clickers on Steam that actually engage you, even though you only click on things. This game however, is so passive... its boring. Click on quest, wait 3 minutes, click on new quest. Rinse and repeat.. maybe after a few weeks you'll be high enough in your level to unlock Dungeons, pets and other features.\n\nAlso when you are told your level 8 character is stronger than over 60% of the populace, then one has to question what the point is of playing. It seems awfully pointless to me.","April 22","false","3.0"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","46","57","2","2"

You have to actively click 2 buttons then wait from 10-90 seconds, then click again to collect a meagre reward (after watching an animation or clicking again to skip it). You gain nothing if you actually idle unless you take a "job" in 1-hour increments (that disables other actions for that period).\n\nThe art style is decent, but it's basically a picture book because of how slow paced this is.\n\nThe much-touted parody/humour element seems to be just some bad puns and outdated gaming / "geeky" references.\n\nThere are still settings not translated to English, odd for a game that boasts such a long history.\n\nI had some sync issues where buttons would become unresponsive, or my actions would trigger the animation but the game behaved as if I didn't perform those actions.\nConsidering the majority of positive reviews are saying "I loved this game 4, 5, 6 years ago", maybe it's best to remember this as a popular browser game of the past.\n\n-----\n\nFWIW, I'm a huge fan of idle games (1700+hrs in Time Clickers), RPGs, and parodies, but Shakes & Fidget is not a good example of any of those. If you're looking for a good parody RPG waiting game, try Progress Quest, the grandfather of idle games (progressquest.com, not on Steam).","February 25","false","0.7"," 300 of 479 people (63%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","63","300","479","20","29"

I heard you unlock more things when you get to higher levels but I don't have the patience for that.\n\n[EDIT] For people saying not having patience is a bad reason to not recommend a game:  I have played a LOT of idle games or "waiting games,"  Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, Restraunt City, Adventure Capitalist, and many more.  The waiting games I have had the patience to sink hours of my time into, offer LOTS of rewards.  Be it upgrades, Easter eggs or achievements... Shakes and Fidget doesn't.

Namely, it's an idle starical free to play RPG. You can go on quests, collect loot, do PVP, and eventually enter dungeons and build a fortress.

You have no control over the battle whatsoever. It just happens.\nThen I'm asked to visit the weapon shop. A bunch of stuff is up for selection. I randomly click on one that says it costs "1 mushroom, 22 silver" or something like that, attempting to see what features it has. I then notice my mushroom number depleting - even though I have not bought this item. I click a few times on other items, and notice the same thing happening. Only the number of mushrooms gets depleted when I click on those items, even though I have not technically bought them!

People say it's P2W. I haven't played deep enough into the game to confirm that. The weapon/magic shops give you 6 options per day, plus extras to replace anything you buy, but the better items often cost mushrooms. I haven't found this to be too big of a deal since you do get mushrooms from daily quests and while it isn't enough to keep you in the best gear, it's enough to give you a reasonable chance to advance.\n\nThe major issue I have with this game is the amount of bugs. This isn't usually something that bothers me. However, they can make the game so irritating to play that it's not even worth it. The disconnects are random and frequent. I've been disconnected from the server 1 second after logging in. More often, it's right in the middle of trying to do something. Yes, you can log right back in but when you deal with this day after day, it will wear on you. Also, and perhaps more bothersome is that if you play multiple worlds, the information for your different characters will not update when switching between them. This will require you to once again relog until it does give you the correct info. I play 3 characters on 3 different worlds, one of each type. I'd say it's close to 100% of the time that switching between characters causes this scenario, forcing me to go back to the character selection screen and back in.

Extremly satisfying to move up the ranks.\n\n- The gear system, though not extensive or stategic, does offer you a sense of progression.\n\n\nCons:\n- Interactions and combat are shallow. Combat, for example, is simply rolling the dice and telling you the result. 'Adventuring' is the same way.\n\n- Counters for various tasks can get tedious. For example, after finishing a match of PVP, you must wait a couple of minutes before you can begin a new round. When the combat itself is uniteresting, this makes it feel kind of slugish.\n\n\nOther Questions:\n\nIs it P2W?\nNo. Although there is a paid currency, it is very unabtrusive to the gameplay.\n\nIs it anywhere near as good as the trailer implied?\nAbsolutely not. The trailler offered me a bit of hype, but of course, a trailer is just a trailer.\n\n\nOveral: I would say this game is at least a way to fill time.

Said bonuses have a cap.\nYou can earn mushrooms (premium currency) by doing quests, thing is in order to upgrade those guild bonuses you need to buy mushrooms since the ones you earn by questing can't be used for anything other than to refill the "thirst"(stamina) feature. In essence this means only guilds with high spenders can aim for top guilds or even upgrade their exp/gold bonus.\n\nThe cherry on top is, even if you decided to spend money buying mushrooms to further your guild, you have no guarantee of recieving them. If you don't recieve them you'll have to get in touch with a support system that won't answer. It has been weeks already and no answer so don't let them scam you too.\n\nEdit: Steam ended up doing the refund because the devs a month after the issue still hadn't answered.","April 4","false","428.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Im playing it since 2010 or 2011, reached level 222 a few days ago (GER server 11). Even while it contains a pay2win-part, it is not imbalanced. You can aquire the same items that anyone who buys mushrooms will aquire, only the amount of quests changes and some speedups is achieved.\nMushrooms can be found occasionally while questing (the slower the mount, the higher the chance!). The only thing that can not be done by this is spending them in the guild, but I think this is pretty balanced.\n\nThe native client is a bless. While flash got pretty laggy when the client was open a few days (I think there may be a small memory leak), it now runs totally smooth. Also it allows tracking the play time, which sometimes makes me a bit depressed...\n\nI'd recommend this game. It is a nice clicking-MMO to have open while working on something, for the occasional relaxing few mouseclicks.","February 28","true","264.5"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","0"

You can not actually interact (as far I can tell) in battles because this just a "Time Sink" game, where you just watch health and damage numbers get bigger and travel timers get smaller, the player input is minimal at best, so if you do not want to play a video game, get this! If you want to interact in some way, shape, or form than stay away! I do enjoy the art style and overall world, but I don't feel as if I am not apart of it.

This is NOT a good game. In fact, it is barely a game at all. It is just a series of timers with an illusion of a game. The combat in the game is automatic. There are no skills, no strategy, your characters just take turns attacking each other with basic attacks until one person dies. Whoever has the highest stats and higher level wins. Unless you get screwed over by the random number generator.\n\nI DO NOT personally recommend this game at all.\n\nWith that said......the game is addicting and in a strange way fun. And honestly, if you want to play something while browsing the internet or if you have an office job where you are just looking for something to do to pass the time while you work. You could do worse then Shakes and Fidget. You can quest, unlock and conquer dungeons, fight other player's virtual NPC, join guilds and create or raid other player's guild fortresses. There is plenty of content there if you don't mind the fact that the gameplay is so shallow.\n\nAlso, the game IS made to try and get you to buy mushrooms with real world money,  But, I wouldn't call it Pay-To-Win. You can get mushrooms through questing(guaranteed drop for first quest of day and a rare drop after that) and all equipment and items can be gotten by playing through the game normally. Mushrooms are just a way for people with no patience to level up faster and get equipment quicker.","February 26","false","33.2"," 41 of 79 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","41","79","0","0"

If you go into it expecting some grand rpg adventure like Skyrim, don't. You will be dissapointed. If you go into it only expecting some crappy idler game like cookie clicker, you will be surprised by the strategic depth it offers over pretty much all idlers. You must make many decisions, such as whether to use a legendary item with a ton of luck to aid your dps, or instead go for more reliable damage from a smaller amount of your primary stat. Every time you go into the arena, you try your luck (and your stats!) against other players. If you enjoy minmaxing, you will find a lot of joy from this game, as there's enough depth to play the game's systems to your advantage in a satisfying manner. Fortresses are pretty fun, as while I expected some crappy farmville-esque deal, in reality I was pleasantly surprised by a simple yet intuitive secondary game where you could aquire gems to further boost the abilities of your character. With the goal of making this review not just a lengthy list of the game's features, I will simply say that this is a fantastic game that you should probably try out for yourself. The artwork and comedy is very tongue in cheek, and the experience as a whole when playing is quite enjoyable. Thank you for reading my crappy review of this not so crappy game, and have fun playing!","March 30","true","862.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Basically, what I am trying to say here is waiting games aren't bad. Like, 80% of all apps on the mobile and tablet are waiting games. Besides, it's a good game. I love the art design, just too cool.\nThe only cirtisism is that the advertisements WAY over exaggerate what the game actually is.\nBTW I know it says I've only played 20 mins, but I've been on it on my phone for about six hours or so.","March 2","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Too many more, it's not even a game. For e however, this is a pretty decent little waiting game romp. I can run this in the background during studies with little no fuss, giving a little treat every 5 or 6 minutes during my assignments. The art is quite nice, not amazing, but good enough; good enough to give me nostalgic feelings of Vanilla WoW. What really gets me though, is that it feels like playing WoW if it was boiled down to it's most basic elements. As a poor college student, I can't afford to pay 15 or so dollars a month as I enjoy eating too much to give it up. With this game, the loot, the leveling, and the pvp is given to me in a minimal grind format. Not to mention, the with the addition of fortresses, guild battles (Join The Kings Under the Mountains today!), raids, solo dungeons and a quasi-achievement system in the form of stickers; this game has a rather hefty amount of content for what it is. And the best part, no need to pay a single cent.","March 7","true","99.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is also a mailing system.\n\nAt the start missions last about 1 or 2 minutes, but later on, those quests will take ~8 minutes of waiting time, in the mean time you are vitually unable to do anything. The dungeon cooldown is one hour, and you also need to wait between  every pvp match unless you pay with Mushrooms.

You can select a race, customize your character a little and go on with your adventure.\n\nYou can create a guild, add friends and fight other players. There is also a dungeon system along with the adventures you can start at the tavern. You can wager your money in a little game at the tavern to quickly get money (If you are lucky). There is also a mailing system.\n\nAt the start missions last about 1 or 2 minutes, but later on, those quests will take ~8 minutes of waiting time, in the mean time you are vitually unable to do anything. The dungeon cooldown is one hour, and you also need to wait between  every pvp match unless you pay with Mushrooms. You can get Shrooms by doing stuff and buying them for real money.\n\nIf it wasnt for those hideous long cd's it would be a pretty nice game,  unless you have enough time to put into this game its pretty fun.","March 22","true","25.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From a time where browsergames were actual games and not build around the currency you can acquire through spending money. Unlike today where the game itself is just an UI to get you to spend money as much as possible as often as possible for every feature you could possibly monetize (like most browserbased / mobilebased games nowadays on steam and elsewhere).\n\nThe definition of "Pay To Win" (P2W) varies from person to person but I'd like to focus on these points in particular:\n\nQ:\n1. Is the currency exclusive to paying players?\n2. Do the obtainable features / items / etc. through the currency give a player an absolute advantage over other players?\n3. Does it split the community?\n\nA:\n1. No. The currency ("Mushrooms") can be obtain by simply playing the game. Though it is RNG-based you receive enough to get you through without feeling pressured to spend money to get things done.\n2. The features linked to the currency are mainly skip waiting times (PvP), energy (Adventure/Dungeons), refresh vendor stock. Which are hardly considered absolute advantages in my humble opinion.\n3. No, there are no areas or features exclusive to the currency or paying players. Everyone gets his face smashed in.\n\nThe gameplay itself is more of a hero manager with minimal interaction (browsergame restriction) and best experienced for yourself to give this game your own critic.\n\nIf you decide to give this game a try, fill your waiting times by reading the webcomic this browsergame is based on and enjoy the ride.\n\nThis review serves mainly as assurance for the wary.\n\nHit the subscribe button, follow me on twitter and facebook and don't forget to leave your money on my patreon page / fundme / kickstarter and my ...... just kidding get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here.","February 25","true","10.0"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

Or, if you're feeling adventurous, you can go to the Arena and get paired against another player who hopelessly, hilariously outguns you, and lose twice the honor you gained in your previous NPC fights. You can buy weapons, armor, and potions that up your stats, but they're expensive and give barely-noticeable boons. Supposedly, you can start building a fortress, or go fight in dungeons, but it won't give me any fortress points to start building or keys to start pillaging dungeons.\n\nThis game seems entirely pointless to me. All I end up doing is checking emails while I wait for fights to load. The only props I can give this game is that the artwork is legitimately beautiful--you can stare at it for ten minutes while you wait for your fights to load.\n\n1.5 out of 10","March 6","false","87.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

A game that you play while your at work, doing schoolwork, or anything of the sort. You play for a few mins, then get back to the task at hand. So if your looking for a game and you have nothing else to do other then just playing this... Then Shakes and Fidget might not be for you... However, if your looking for a game to play while your doing other things, then this is perfect for you!

No problem, 6 world servers are UP! Every weekend there are events that will boost your account (EXP, Gold, Epic, Shrooms).

But very, very slow pace compared to current online games. It's more of a social game when joining a guild, and just some very casual game on which you can spend 20s every 30 minutes from work or while alt+tabbing from another online thing.\n\nAnd no, it's not really pay to win, while it sure makes things easier, a LOT of top players have never spent a $ on this. What makes people win is time, time, and more time, paying for anything really gives nothing but a tiny tiny one-time boost.\n\nAlso, for those who says this kind of games has no place on Steam, one reason they probably never thought about: for people who don't have, and don't want to have Flash installed, having them here is great :)","February 25","true","687.2"," 20 of 43 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","20","43","3","0"

I do highly reccomend it, as I think it's super fun and has long time motivation. This is of course up to everyone else. Something that motivates me, might not motivate others.\n\n\nIf you really want something that is fun and has some nice mechanics, regarding browser games, start it. But do yourself a favor and look for a group/guild. Because then you can go on raids, which is actually pretty nice to look at, which gets you nice loot, and is one of the big goals in it.\n\nSo far, besides 1 - 2 other mobile/farming/browser games, this is one of my all time favorites.

Why? you may be asking. well first of its a thing not a game, it claims to be a strategy rpg mmo but isnt. this game has some sort of rpg thing involve. there are rooms tavern, shops, dungeon, guilds and a guard tower. i will explain these first.\n\nDisclaimer there are not 50 milllion playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game about under 200,000 are (Probs no one cause of who bad the game is).\n\nThe tavern\n\nthe tavern is the area of the game where you will obtain missions and refill you thirst for adventure. there are a set of people giving you missions higher your level better the loot. when i say a set i mean four theres hot chick, tourist guy, wierd grim reaper and troll. there is also a gambing guy who cheats you out of your money every time so that you can waste more time regaining it.\n\nThe shops\n\nThere are two shops magic and normal. magic sells relic and normal sells weapons and stuff. but the item change after twenty for hours which doesnt help when your 10 levels ahead (if you get that far without falling to sleep) and you want new items. you can sell items to them for about one silver which isnt worth a piece of ♥♥♥♥ in this game.\n\nThe dungeon\n\nThe dungeons are unlocked with a keys (dont know how you get them this game was too ♥♥♥♥ to get that far). there is about 15 dungeons there is nothing beside that to explain.\n\nThe Guild\n\nThe guild place is like any rpg mmo you join a guild done\n\nThe guard tower\n\nHave you wanted to spend a real hour doing nothing for one gold (which isnt alot). cause i sure ♥♥♥♥ing don't, I play games to do stuff in game not select make money then go do the ♥♥♥♥ing dishes while i wait.\n\nnow that thats done i have a bit more two explain.\n\nthe currency\n\nThere is a currency system is gold and silver as per usual but the is a third currency called mushrooms this is a item that speed up ♥♥♥♥ in game so you dont have two what 1 hour it a pay to compete game these mushrooms are proof cause the are quite ♥♥♥♥ing expensive for pieces of ♥♥♥♥ not to mention that the guy who sells it in game looks like a ♥♥♥♥en druggo.\n\nThe gameplay\n\nOii boy that best part of the game...........                                   Im lying as i said this a thing not a game this game has no gameplay is a start a quest the you have to wait the time till its done then watch a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat sequence go down for two seconds. see you get to do nothing in this thing, just buy equietment and get missions for "your character". i found more gameplay in smashing my head into a wall till it bled. this is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ for  a game.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary\n\nThis thing should not be on steam its a waste of space. I would reither bang my head against a wall. if you like wipping your ♥♥♥ with your money and flushing it down the toilet then this a game for you.\n\nI give this a 0/10\nI hope the game developer gets cancer and dies\n\n\nNever gonna play this thing again\n\nbye","February 25","false","1.0"," 19 of 46 people (41%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","41","19","46","5","0"

Start and activity, then sit till its over. There's even a timer displayed on the tab for this 'game' . So 90 percent of the time, you won't even be looking at the window. So you can just minimize the game then play a real game or do anything else while you wait for the timer to end, open the window back up, click something else. Repeat this process for as long as humanly possible till people can praise you for your skills in the art of.. nothing?\n\nI know how this review sounds but I honestly take quite an interest in idle and clicker games, but there is honestly no place for them on steam. If i wanted to play anything like this, i'd go to facebook or dip around on my phone. None the less... here i am, running this game in the background for no apparent reason. Despite how boring and pointless these kind of games are, they somehow trap you just enough to make you keep looking at it's window here and there to see your progress.

For what it is, this is actually a cool little game. The art style and humor is really nice. However, do NOT expect this to be an exciting experience. This is a energy bar-laden skinner box with an RPG costume on.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DROQrJFoogs\n\nYou choose a quest and then wait for the timer on that quest to run out. That's about it. There's shops to buy armor/weapons/potion/etc - you can do that stuff while the timer ticks down, but that's it. You're basically just waiting on timers. And then doing activities also reduces your "energy bar" for the day, which requires payment to refill if it empties.\n\nThat being said, if a skinner box with an RPG skin sounds GOOD to you, definitely check this out. Because there's a lot to do here. It really reminds me of a simple MUD that just happens to have rudimentary graphics as well.  I can see this appealing to a certain type of multi-tasking gamer, but I think for the most part I'm going to give this a thumbs down.

It's mostly text based, and a lot of reading is required, although not entirely. Once you know what your doing, reading is not really something that is nesscessary. This game is also very relaxing, for example, if your trying to layback, click acouple of times, kill some monsters, get cool new items. It's fun! If you lack taste in trying something new, then I don't reccomend.

It's pretty simple and nothing is too challenging. The artwork is a bit cartoonish which I personally don't care for much. There is one character that is in the Stable that scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. It looks terrifying.\n\nThe layout of the game is a bit cluttered with art and not much explaination. There are tips that pop up but they aren't completely clear on things. The help button on the game just gives you links to other things instead of being a mini guide in-game to help. It would be great to have a little help tab on each "page" to explain what it's for and what things do.\n\nI can tell I will put quite a few hours into this game. I will update this review later.\n\n25 active hours in:\nThis game has become quite boring. It was fun at first because it was simple and quick to play when you don't have much time. But things quickly slowed down when getting near level 20. I've made 4 accounts to try different classes and such and the warrior seems to be very good. The ranger sucks because almost every piece of equipment in the shops take away dexterity.. which is the primary thing to upgrade for ranger. The prices of items go up dramatically with it often costing "mushrooms" which you can collect over time easily.. but can just use real money instead of course. There is a fortress activity that you can do at level 25 but progress has been so slow and it's just not interesting to get on and do quests or anything anymore. Supposedly if you get to level 75 you can get pets?? How on earth are you supposed to get 75? It's difficult to get level 20!\n\nI recommend this game if you don't have a lot of time to get into a difficult game. It becomes a bit tedious after awhile though. The layout of the buttons and things are difficult to learn at first. As a graphic designer, it's all a bit frustrating to try and figure out what things do what without much explanation.\n\n4/10","April 5","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quite impressed with this little free-to-play. At this time there's no constant nagging to spend money on stuff and you can toddle along just fine without any pay to win antics plaguing so many other in the free-to-play categories. The graphics are rather cute and the outfits of the store owners even change to suit the time of day you're playing. Took me a bit to work out why they were in PJs last night until it dawned on me around, you guessed it, dawn this morning when they all changed to daytime clothing. Haven't progressed very far as yet, but I haven't had it that long either. Very low system performance impact (non existant) as another bonus.

Seeing that it was a highly rated and free game, I decided to check it out. I looked at it kind of strangely, since the art style, at the time, seemed very... weird. But after making a character (At first, I was a human, since i thought that the 'no stat changes' might benefit me later on, Haha), I see the 'Mage' Option, and am already excited, since I like Homestuck, and my God tier class just so happens to be a mage! So i click that, Human, and make it kind of like me, and get into the game. After a few quests, im rapidly levelling up, gambling with the man in the corner, and spending my afternoon giggling and messing around with this silly and amazing game. After a good ten levels I found the key to the Desecrated Catacombs, and I unlock my first dungeon, a real challenge for once! Soon after i make a guild (Named Homestuck if anyone would like to join.), and i just attack weaker guilds until I have some okay honor. A week or two later, I invite my friend to play, and after a bit of begging, I manage to drag him into the depths of the Shakes and Fidget world. Just a few nights ago, probably Sunday(April 17), I got the app and made a second account,(IlikeHomestuck413), that's already at the 10h level.\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is okay with a tiny bit of wait time, but if you dig deep into the game it's a lot of fun!\n(My Character name is Sharkcat12, if anyone would like to friend me or just talk!)","April 19","true","544.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xprofilenamex/recommended/438040/","xprofilenamex","xProfile Namex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xprofilenamex/","21 products in account","3 hours in review:\nSo far I enjoy the the game a lot. It's pretty simple and nothing is too challenging. The artwork is a bit cartoonish which I personally don't care for much. There is one character that is in the Stable that scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. It looks terrifying.\n\nThe layout of the game is a bit cluttered with art and not much explaination. There are tips that pop up but they aren't completely clear on things. The help button on the game just gives you links to other things instead of being a mini guide in-game to help. It would be great to have a little help tab on each "page" to explain what it's for and what things do.\n\nI can tell I will put quite a few hours into this game. I will update this review later.\n\n25 active hours in:\nThis game has become quite boring. It was fun at first because it was simple and quick to play when you don't have much time. But things quickly slowed down when getting near level 20. I've made 4 accounts to try different classes and such and the warrior seems to be very good. The ranger sucks because almost every piece of equipment in the shops take away dexterity.. which is the primary thing to upgrade for ranger. The prices of items go up dramatically with it often costing "mushrooms" which you can collect over time easily.. but can just use real money instead of course. There is a fortress activity that you can do at level 25 but progress has been so slow and it's just not interesting to get on and do quests or anything anymore. Supposedly if you get to level 75 you can get pets?? How on earth are you supposed to get 75? It's difficult to get level 20!\n\nI recommend this game if you don't have a lot of time to get into a difficult game. It becomes a bit tedious after awhile though. The layout of the buttons and things are difficult to learn at first. As a graphic designer, it's all a bit frustrating to try and figure out what things do what without much explanation.\n\n4/10","April 5","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after making a character (At first, I was a human, since i thought that the 'no stat changes' might benefit me later on, Haha), I see the 'Mage' Option, and am already excited, since I like Homestuck, and my God tier class just so happens to be a mage! So i click that, Human, and make it kind of like me, and get into the game. After a few quests, im rapidly levelling up, gambling with the man in the corner, and spending my afternoon giggling and messing around with this silly and amazing game. After a good ten levels I found the key to the Desecrated Catacombs, and I unlock my first dungeon, a real challenge for once! Soon after i make a guild (Named Homestuck if anyone would like to join.), and i just attack weaker guilds until I have some okay honor. A week or two later, I invite my friend to play, and after a bit of begging, I manage to drag him into the depths of the Shakes and Fidget world. Just a few nights ago, probably Sunday(April 17), I got the app and made a second account,(IlikeHomestuck413), that's already at the 10h level.\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is okay with a tiny bit of wait time, but if you dig deep into the game it's a lot of fun!\n(My Character name is Sharkcat12, if anyone would like to friend me or just talk!)","April 19","true","544.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't appeal to everyone, it doesn't have to. I find it enjoyable to be able to be working on something, head out on a quest, and check in on it to see how it goes. I like the guild fights, the arena, dungeons, the art work and humor.\n\nAnother complaint I see is the mushrooms and honestly...I kind of agree. As much as I like the game, things take a while or you lose out on buying something because you don't have enough of them.\n\nIn the end though, I enjoy the game and will keep playing it in the forseeable future.

Sure it is easier to play from Steam, but there is no difference from the two options.\n\n- Bad starting for new players on the international servers, because there are a lot of experienced players creating new accounts.\n- A very short part of the clans will ask for resources for you to enter the clan, you might actually get scammed by that.\n- No sound on the game, just when you are in a fight or click to go to a certain location.\n\nThere aren't that many cons, but there are some pros that make this game enjoyable\n\n- 3 classes, each one of them are completly different, different items, different stats and different special abilities.\n- Good variation in races, each one of those are different on skills that might make your character strong or weak on the start of your progress. (I made a guide helping you out choosing the correct Race+Class, here it is: My Guide\n- If you go away, you can leave your character doing missions or on Work Hours, so you get rewards when you come back.\n- The community is not toxic, except for the clan scamming, which is very rare to happen.\n- Big diversity on enemies, dungeons and items.\n- Balanced quest rewards and ranking system.\n\nIt is a free game, however dont expect this game to be like the most popular games today.\n","June 3","true","67.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabyoru/recommended/438040/","gabyoru","Gyoru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabyoru/","26 products in account","Shakes and Fidget is a different game. This game mixes point and click with rpg and some kind of time progress quest (Yes, you have to wait for the time to finish a quest and start over). Although, it seems that is going to take forever, but as time goes by a improve the gameplay system (it's all a matter of level: the more noob the more boring game).\n\nFrom level 25 you unlocks the fortress (which, in my opinion, looks like a game within a game  Inception? ). There you are able to create gems to improve your character, gain extra experience and increase the capacity of the warehouse. For that, you need to defend your fortress of another players and preparing the attack  of titans  others forts giving an upgrade in your soldiers (like I said, it's look like another game!).\n\nAfter level 50, you'll receive some quests with "broken glass". Collect all to be able to do quests and attack opponents and make dungeons at the same time (Yes, without it you're just going to be waiting  with a "face of landscape"  the end of quests to start anything else).\n\nWith the new update 'Pets', I don't have no idea what is this, but it's probably something with another Inception.\n\nImportant tips:\n\n- If your internet is wavering, don't upgrade your character: as soon as you press on "+" the game will crash and you'll lose all that gold that took 'hours' to take;\n- Don't forget to turn the wheel of Dr.  Yabba Dabba Doo  Abawuwu, with some luck he is quite useful.","June 6","true","387.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
