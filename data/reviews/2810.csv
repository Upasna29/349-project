This won't be universal, though, as the game has a very large learning gap and very little instruction, coupled with a format of gameplay that is best discribed as "love it or hate it". The lack of a tutorial doesn't help.\n\nFor those wondering if this is worth playing or buying, one must ask themselved what do they want first. Do you want to be a pirate in space firing on ships outside of the areas controlled by the law, and don't mind the high dificulty?\nDo you want to spend many hours trading items from one station to another to gain money and eventually buy your own states, hiring ships to trade for you and leading your new found corporate empire to grand wealth?\nDo you want to explore the universe, and all it's mystory and see it's dark secrets, with all the risks that may bring?\nDo you want to be a cop, shooting down pirates, evil robots, evil incests and whom ever else may oppose order?\nThis and much more is in the game.\n\nHowever: if you want instant gratification, always playing at a fast pace, or everything being handed to you?\nThen this game is not for you.","November 27, 2013","true","23.2"," 122 of 133 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","122","133","12","10"

I haven't heard anything good about rebirth the latest installment to the series but this review isnt about that. X3: Reunion Was the game that turned me on to the whole series. In fact just thinking about it now is making me want to sink even more hours into a title i have already sank more than what would commonly be called healthy gaming. Once you get past the steep learning curve and learn how to fly and fight and trade effectively, this game suddenly turns into how you would want to live in a future that affords you your own space oddesy. Space suddenly turns into your own playground and you become immersed in a universe that is fully dynamic.\n\nWith that said i think this title, X3 Terran conflict and X3 Albion Prelude were accidental. Terran conflict takes place after the events of this title, and adds a Major graphics overhaul. And prelude again expands on the story of Terran conflict as well as this title adding features and interfaces that were touched on in this title but done poorly. It is pretty evident the beauty of this game and the other X3 titles is the immersion of the struggle you are put through to learn, and adapt to the changes that happen around you all while getting the sense of achievement from overcoming and growing from the experiences you encounter.\n\nWhat these games lack is a sense of person however. You sort of create a character or take on a storyline however you rarely interact as that character. You never really see the character and the universe usually refers to you as pilot. In Reunion, the main story you play as julian brennan. working along side Elena Kho. Trying to find your place in the universe. There is an extensive storyline and it all seems to fit very well all things considered.  The other characters however offer a backstory as to why you start out where you do, and how the other races react to you in the beginning.  Ultimately it defines how difficult the game is in the beginning to get started. Once you get on a roll however and you grow all plots start and play out no matter who you play as with the exception of Julian's plot. his has a little more frosting so to speak. Otherwise its all essentially the same. Reunion is also of the three X3 games that has a main character. Terran Conflict and Prelude do not feature main plot character who playing as change the dialogue or offer any additional content.\n\nPros:\nDynamic Universe - Everything you do or not do effects the universe in some way.\nRich plots - The back story to each of the plots are very compelling and their rewards give a strong sense of achievement\nDiverse spacecraft - Each ship has its own classification as well as strength and weaknesses. Even some that are unique and rare.\nRaces - Each race is unique in its own way and their ships fit the typical role the races engage in.\nFleets - You can build, or buy your own fleet and wage war against anything within the universe, ofcourse doing so will have consquences such as you may end up destroying something you want later. The good news is there is one race you can attack and murder with extreme prejudice and not have to worry about losing a future trading station.\n\nCons:\nVoice acting - Its there but at the time this game was released other studios did it better.\nRaces - While each race is unique there is nothing unique among their individuals. Humans however occasionally have diversity among males and females but you will be hard pressed telling a male or female split, paranid or teladi.\nNo planetary exploration. The planets in each system are just there to look pretty it seems.\nNo station exploration. Each station you only dock at and interact with through the ship.\n\nFrom what i understand Rebirth attempted at affording planetary and staion exploration however at the cost of starship diversity. Further more these features were not done well and as such losing the ability to fly and construct a diverse fleet was too great of a sacrifice against bland cookie cutter stations.","November 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","52","58","2","1"

While I'm not  fan of the "jump-gate" type galaxies, that is probably my only complaint about this game.  Individual combat is fun, but I have yet to build a combat fleet, so I'm not sure how that will go.  The economic system is quite impressives, with dozens of different space stations you can dock at, and trade with.  Eventually you can even build stations of your own.  The game lacks a good tutorial, built into the main plot, so I was fumbling around quite a bit for a while.  But once I got the hang of things,  you can really see how well the various components of the game work together.","August 5, 2014","true","406.0"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","1"

Everything in it is vast and massive in a way that's both exciting and daunting. It is relatively easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of the game and the lack of any sort of proper guiding hand to teach you the basic will make many newcomers run for the hills. If you stick it out however you will find that underneath it all is one of the best open space games since the last game from the X series.\n\nReunion picks up where X2 left off and starts you as Julian Brennan once again. Your trade empire from the previous game destroyed by the Khaak you now have to resurrect it from the ashes, if that's what you want. The story missions available are in true X style utterly forgettable and easily missable. They can even be disabled entirely by picking from one of several sandbox starts this time around.\n\nAs always you start you start your adventure in the X universe in a small dingy of a space worthy craft and set about making your mark on the galaxy. How you do this is entirely up to you, you can trade, fight, explore however you like and in whichever forms you want. Some players might want to avoid the fighting aspect entirely and just set up a gigantic trading empire. Others might want to sustain themselves through pirate activity. The beauty of the X games have always been the choice they give you in going what you want to do, you are never forced to fight or forced to trade, it's all entirely up to you how you want to proceed from any given position.\n\nReunion is not without it's faults however and in this case, it's the bugs top the list. The game was almost completely unplayable at launch and while patches have managed to remove most if not all of the problems it is still not an issue that is so easily forgivable.\n\nGraphically is where the game is truly impressive however, never before has space looked this beautiful and the objects that inhabit it looked this crisp. Every new sector you visit has a sense of uniqueness about it that just makes you want to keep going to see what's in the next one. The ships are beautifully detailed and the background ambient images of stars, nebulae and planets tickle the imagination. This is indeed one stunning visual experience.\n\nThe soundtrack is the standard space opera opus that we have heard so many times before, it doesn't detract anything from the experience but it doesn't add anything to it either. Luckily it is easy enough to disable the ingame music and put whatever you feel is appropriate on the stereo. The voice acting you encounter throughout the game, from the missions to your ships onboard computer voice, is downright atrocious however and take you out of the game with an annoying level of certainty.\n\nAll in all X3 Reunion is a solid continuation of the X saga, building on the foundations that has remained mostly unchanged since the very first game. Should you desire an open ended space epic then this is the game for you. If you have the stamina to get into the learn the ropes then X3 is as good as it gets, at least until the next X game is released.","June 4, 2013","true","892.5"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","2"

I loaded x3 reunion and x3 terran conflict on my system. I tried it, and never looked back. So what can we do in the universe of X..  i though i'd never ask. You can build a massive Trading Hub or be a trader - pirate - explorer - and when you get there.. a fleet commander of mind blowing hive formations and other formation lines. And when i say build a fleet, i mean buy 200 carriers 200 destroyers 200 corvettes 200 Mammoths. Fill them with missiles for other ships. Shields to repair and ammo. all kinds of stuff for the front lines. here's the fun part... build that fleet 200 times more because you can. if you can mannage them. sit back durring the war, commanding and taking pics like a tourist. at the same time your factories are making everything for your ships and other factories. your trade lines are protected by lasers and also have satelite info feeds to situational awareness. maybe for fun, a mine that i encourage everyone to fly past ;) the squash mine. i would make the info on it read - " Caution, this mine bites the hand that feeds it." when docked at a station you can read funny events, and take on personal contracts looking for ships, lost people and wares. Starting out is slow but its not like your gonna speed through space in 3 minutes and have it all - in one of the X3 series is  a ship that simply can never fit through a gate and can build and store a whole fleet. i recommend this game to anyone interested in a different experience. p.s It's nothing like eve","February 26, 2014","true","44.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hyperion101/recommended/2810/","Hyperion101","Hyperion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hyperion101/","59 products in account","An astonishingly beautiful, deeply complex space simulator. The X series have always ruled the economy-based space sim genre and Reunion is no exception. It provides a large universe swarming with life as tons of AI controlled ships each mind their own bussiness and freighters trading wares between stations, affecting the ware prices, which makes the economy quite dynamic and feeling real. Your actions will always have consequences- if you destroy a trader ship, it will not arrive to it's destination and the station will not receive the wares it needs to construct it's products. These were always the core features of X games, just like it's amazing and calming soundtrack, detailed and unique sector backgrounds and intricate 3D models, making it a piece of art. You will notice many tracks ported from the previous X games, aswell as many new ones- my favourite is Home of Light, Kingdom's End and Seizewell sector music.\n\nSo what's unique about Reunion, when compared to the other X games? Well to be honest, I enjoyed the older X2: The Threat way more. It's atmosphere was just a bit different, it's interface control was quicker to control, you weren't forced to use a mouse occasionally and could do everything much quicker through keyboard or a flightstick/gamepad (which I really recommend for X3). It's a-life also seemed more detailed as every station had it's set of fighter and freighter ships, each with their corresponding orders. Here in Reunion, everything is replaced with universe traders, which are randomly spawned freighters with commands to endlessly seek the best deals and don't really belong to anyone. After I couldn't find a single station that owns at least one ship, I thought it's a bug. The interface of Reunion is difficult to get around at first and lacks propper organisation. Widescreens weren't so common back then so the windows aren't taking much space either, although there are no issues (except the main menu). There are also no station hangar interiors like they were in X2. Ships now usually dock from outside instead, into a limited number of ship holders. The speed of all spaceships is also reduced so the usage of the time acceleration becomes a must.\n\nDon't forget to visit the Egosoft forums, for mods and gameplay guides. X-Tended Mod (XTM) is probably the biggest one, but if you want to play the X games sequentially and take on Terran Conflict later, then it may spoil you lots of content as it ports most of the ships and stations from it. The cockpit mod is also really good because defaultly there are no cockpits in Reunion, unlike at X2. New Horizons seems like a nice alternative to XTM. Another great mod is CMOD II, which adds more immersive  sounds and Military HUD which.\n\nIf you're looking for a good space sim gameplay and don't care about the X story, skip this game and go directly for X3 Albion Prelude. If you haven't played the previous X games before, then Reunion is probably the worst one to start with and I would rather try the X2 for it's in-game tutorial that the X3 games lack. X3TC/AP could also be easy to start with if you don't mind reading some user made guides instead.\n\nSpeaking about the whole X series, Reunion is probably the worst one.

Add to this one of the most user unfriendly interfaces I have ever battled with in a game where every single key (and I mean every single key) on the keyboard is needed to do something in game, be it control the ship, communicate, trade or whatever, a little in game training would have been mildly useful. Forget a steep learning curve,  this is tendon twistingly ballistic - that's ok, but no fun. Games are at their heart suppose to be enjoyable. I only managed 5 hrs before it robbed me of my will to live.\n\nAnother word of warning, as others have mentioned in forums about this game, it takes time for things to start to happen( obviously longer than 5 hrs), it's not a jump right in and its all action after 15 mins, no, not this one. And that's fair enough for a complex space adventure/trade/sim/strategy game.

A reletively steep learning curve for a new comer to the series but there are plenty orf tutorials on Youtube and  on the Egosoft forums for help.\n\nCombat especially when piloting fighters seems quite reasonable so far. The interface is only slightly differrant compared to the later expansions of Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude and is not clunky in use. For referance I'm currently playing campaigns in both Reunion and Albion Prelude.\n\nIt might be said that the only reason to get Reunion these days is if you want to play the plot especially if you have the other two expansions. Which might be valid for some but I like Reunion for the lack of money early in the game compared to the later titles as it really gives you a sense of achievement further on. As well as various differculty settings starting the main plot {in regards to starting money etc} You are also given alternative starts of the Humble Merchant, Bankrupt Assasin, the explorer and a custom start. These ignore the plot and are perfect for a total sand box experience.\nThough these are not as many as contained in x3:TC and x3:AP\n\nReunion is more than just a space trading and fighting sim as it is also a strategy game at heart that you can build your own industrial or millitary empire or even both.\n\nIf you can't afford Terran Conflict and/or Albion Prelude Reunion is a good place to start.","February 9","true","68.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RolanDecoy/recommended/2810/","RolanDecoy","RolanDecoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RolanDecoy/","658 products in account","EgoSoft has almost completely redone the interface, but managed to keep the same feel for the game (in my opinion). This 3rd installment is not without bugs however. In fact its probably the most buggy version, with ships crashing into asteroids, gates, stations and eachother at a regular basis (even without SETA), missions (both story and incidental) not loading as intended or not configured properly.\n\nI have come to expect the usual interuptions mid-combat by your employees and wingmen, but in this version they actually tried to do something about it. The interuptions are better planned and the player is put out of harms way when control is taken away, which means that if you die before, during or after a cut-scene or whatever it will probably be your own fault (this time).\n\nThe universe has become a lot more vibrant and exciting and the dynamics are just as interesting as they were before. With new weapons, a new generation of craft for all species and new products there is again a lot to explore and learn. Not to mention the more involved pirating and policing one can do in name of one government or another.\n\nThe main story, however, does not yield any reward other than an ore mine in Paranid space, but can be played in full with the ship you start with (On Normal, the Argon Buster), which throws the story-line even more to the sideline. I concider that a setback, but only that. The story itself is just as interesting and informative as one would expect from the previous installments and it extends it real nice.","August 23, 2013","true","88.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drhuh/recommended/2810/","drhuh","Dies-A-Lot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drhuh/","147 products in account","Total play time: 43 hours before I gave up in disgust.\nCrashes: too many to count.\n\nThe good:\nlovely graphics. (When you can see them beside the immovable overlay screens.)\n\nThe really ugly:\nWorst user interface of any game I've EVER played. Confusing. Redundant. And impossible to actually FIND anything if you don't already know EXACTLY where it is.\n\nFlight mechanics: ships in space aren't air fighters. or worse cars in mud.  Why can't SPACE simulations get this right?  If I shut off the engines, I don't just bloody stop. I keep going. But not in this game. Freelancer got it right, and it made space combat FUN. Others never seem to have learned the lesson. If I want an air-based dogfight game, I'll go get that, not a game that's theoretically based in space.\n\nMouse resolution seem to be hard-coded rather than depending on operating system settings, then they don't give you a means to reduce the sensitivity. So if you have a high resolution mouse, hope you like making micrometre movements to control things. Or go with a joystick, which isn't nearly as precise - and you have to be VERY precise when shooting because there's zero give.\n\nStupidly high learning curve, and (almost) zero tutorial. Examples:\n-- In the FIRST tutorial (simulator) mission, you're told "don't forget to activate your turret" - and left with ZERO instructions on how to do that. You're on your own trying to figure out what you need. I did eventually figure it out, several hours into the game, and the answer is nowhere NEAR the weapon options panel they provide.\n-- They give you a jump drive? You have to "just know" that you need lots of energy crystals for it, and where and how to get them.\n-- Want to activate your jump drive? You better "just know" that it's going to make you stop in space with a big flashing "Hi, I'm a target" for a while. So although the enemy can jump as soon as they're in trouble, you trying to do so means certain death.\n-- Want to buy something? Who created that interface? Wasn't anyone with any kind of user interface knowledge.\n-- Want to do some trading? Well, it seems you don't have the trading interface. Except you DO have the trading interface, says so right in your ship inventory. Finally discovered that it's not the right LEVEL of trading interface, which is given a different name in the error message than it has in the inventory. Again, you just have to know.\n-- The list goes on, and on, and on. Sadly, most of the online advice is written by people who HAVE that encyclopaeodic knowledge and forgot that they didn't once have it.\n-- Regularly throughout the campaign you're told "meet you at XXX". Without being given ANY hints as to where it might be. Having to go to external sources just so you can actually figure out where you're supposed to next is definitely poor design.\n-- Attempting to build a "factory complex" is an exercise in frustration since the positioning controls were done by someone who had never, ever used any kind of CAD program. It's what I'd expect out of a novice doing a project for a Bachelor level graphics class, and even then they probably wouldn't get a good grade. It's not something I would ever have expected out of a commercial product such as this one.\n-- The list of faults goes on, and on, and on.\n\nAnd, finally, the kicker: the storyline breaks. Hard. With no way to figure out how the hell to fix it. Mission 7, finding the crystals, your contact doesn't show up where they're supposed to be, which means no way to continue. Since I've spent several hours between the previous mission and this one trying to earn enough credits to get a better ship, I have NO idea where it might have gone wrong.\nI might as well have started one of the "no storyline" missions, because this one is now totally hooped.\n\nNot to mention crash after crash after crash making game (almost) unplayable. Latest one? You finish a long mission (only the 2nd or 3rd one) with zero chance of saving and... it just hangs there, staring at the piece the Talon just dropped, keyboard locked. Did I mention no chance of saving and no quick-saves so you have to repeat the whole, long, frustrating experience rather than restart from further along the mission line.  Worse, apparently there's a way to save without docking, as I was reminded by the game when it misinterpreted my "fire at the enemy" for "save this game", but I was defeated in trying to figure out where or how to purchase the necessary bits and pieces to make it possible. I'm pretty good at figuring things out usually, but this game is that obtuse.\n\nI was REALLY looking forward to playing this game. But as it stands, it's an unplayable mash of crap that requires an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game JUST TO PLAY THE FIRST BLOODY MISSIONS!\n\nI'm sure the game is fun for those who took the hours and hours to develop that encyclopaedic knowledge required to do even the most basic tasks in the game. For someone like me who doesn't mind some complexity, but would rather just get in and play before I'm hit with the whole enchilada, this game isn't for me. Or for anyone else who feels that it shouldn't be necessary to digest a 96 page manual, megabytes of online information, and go through several hours of online learning just to complete the first few missions.\n\nAnnoying. Very annoying.\n\nedit: 8-Mar: yet I still intend to master this game. Yes, it's annoying in so many ways, but hopefully once I *have* acquired the required encyclopaedic knowledge (or at least a portion thereof) it gets better? Certainly has promise, I just hope it can realize that promise.\n\nedit: 11-Mar: after trying for many hours to get this game to work, all I can say is "no, not for me". If you want a game that takes hours of research just to START the game, and many more hours of external out-of-game research to even have a hope in hell of doing anything, then you might try this game. If you want something fun, not frustrating in the extreme, and something that doesn't resemble more of an office job than a "game", stay away. Far, far away. Personally, I'm giving up in disgust.","March 7","false","43.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

There is a slight chance you will crash trying to dock (using auto-pilot), there is a chance you will crash into a M2-class ship coming out of warp gate. There is a chance you will turn into flying wreckage by trying to claim other ship. Those bugs make it extremely autistic, cryptic and annoying (at times) but still fun and very addictive.

Having to read manuals, search for help online, it is just too much work for a whole lot of boring single-player action. So what if I can command a fleet, it's not like there is any point to it. With how much time it takes to even get that far from not knowing anything, would take way too much of my time. The controls are aweful, there is no story, and the gameplay is just boring.\n\nMy experience:\nI jump in, I go for story mode. It took a lot of me trying not to give up, to get through the first part. I followed the directions (there is no map to aid you in finding places so I had to pay close attention to the names and do my best), then got into a fight, did okay, then was told to go somewhere else to fight and that's where I got lost. I did manage to find the enemy, but was destroyed in a matter of seconds. What happened? The first enemies were so easy (now I think about it, they may have just been pirates or soemthing, all I know is, they attacked me first), but these next guys? So, I reloaded, this time I tried to find better weapons.... HAHAHAHAHA!!! ??? Good luck, unless you spent hours reading on how to play the game first (something a simple tutorial would have fixed).\n\nOverall experience.... a 1 out of 10.\n\nIt's the future... it's space... it should be charted out and mapped in some way, otherwise... how would you be able to navigate space? Thus, there should have been a map showing you were to go. Instead.. you have to ask for DIRECTIONS! OMG WHAT!? Really? I have to ask some random ship where something is? HAHAHAHA wow that is jut so funny!... alright 2 out of 10 for the comedy. Really people? You have to open comms with some ship to ask if they know where something is and thats only if they have that dialouge available, and sometimes, the directions are aweful and don't lead you to where you want go.

Except for 3-4 story missions.\nI read the manual, other players tutorials. The normal mode is just bad. Pirates doesn't bail their ships, how could I make a decent amount of credits? Flying and selling stuff(energy cells) in the little cargo bay for dozen hours?? SETA is only 10x faster, game's pace is very slow.\nThe interface is uncomfortable, you can't move windows(monitors) with a mouse for example nor the center on the sector map.\nSwitching to the next enemy works awkward, it marks the farest target instead the nearest one. That's why dogfighting sucks. You need money to equip your ship with good guns and shields, because pirates fly in small fleets, but there is no easy way to get money (except for abandoned ships which I consider as sort of cheating), only tedious trading and "quests" with low payments, you have to find an appropriate one though, which takes time.\nThe story.. it's hard to follow if you get distracted and they assume you know most of the game mechanics.\nIt could be easier to play on quickstart instead of normal, but there are newer games, they should be better, why play this?\nAlso, mouse cursor is stuck when steam overlay is enabled.","December 7, 2014","false","12.9"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","1"

Believe I read this was originally made for a x2 expansion, but made into its own x3. I think this game loses alot of good reviews due to this and easy to see why. Graphics are great for their time, but failure to fix crashes such as the infamous targeting crash after how many years is discouraging. Game has so much potential and in depth gaming hours. But you will have to dredge through the learning curve most would not undertake, and read a ton of tips and tutorials from other players on forums who made the journey to get satisfaction from the game.Don't know what the devs were thinking. And fixes for crashes and bugs... Just the main menu screen and 32bit movie clips will max out my gtx660 and raise temperatures to 80c for some reason, while in-game no problem at all.., and does not like multicores i've read.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/claske/recommended/2810/","claske","claske","http://steamcommunity.com/id/claske/","105 products in account","Clocking about 7 hours of play time yesterday starting from scratch I found X3: Reunion to have quite a steep learning curve. I had chosen the Normal/storyline-on difficulty.\n\nMaybe I'm getting too old (42!) to remember countless hours in my youth trying to figure out how to handle misjumps in "Elite", battles in "Wing Commander: Privateer" and similar games "Frontier" etc. but I had expected it to be a piece of cake to swoop in and save the day in this one...\n\nMan was I wrong!\nThis game puts you in battle from minute 1! I was still trying to figure out the viewscreen, icons, menus... let alone how to throttle up/down when the bogies came at me. Concentrating at battle at hand everything less important had to wait (unimportant like: do I have different types of guns on this boat, how do I target enemies, fire missiles...).\n\nFinally came the part where I took control of turret guns and I could "relax" a little and let the action just happen.\n\nIt was not until the "track the Marauder" mission that I got some spare time to investigate the menus and found information about the ship, keybindings for this and that. I had to visit a few game wikis to figure out why I could not repair the hull of my ship... I simply did not understand the pricetag was too high for my wallets contents. On my to do list is still to read the manual - this is very unlike the trend in modern games where you learn throughthe first couple of missions.\n\n\n\nWhy am I even playing this game? The answer is simple: pure nostalgia!\nThe games from my youth mentioned earlier had me spellbound then. Around the end of last millenium a demo for "X: beyond the frontier" came out with references to the same games I loved. I think it was only one ot two short storydriven missions... but the trading system was also revealed and I was hooked.\n\nThe best thing, as I remember that demo, was a lot of speach. And it was in german! Now, my german was nowhere near fluent but I could understand quite a lot. And what I did not understand only build up the sense of mystery and being in an alien world. It was perfect!\nSo of couse I bought the game when it came out... and played quite a bit before I realised that some of the spell of the demo had vanished. And in that realisation it came to me that I had been playing the game in english... I was missing the mystery of a german speeking world. Now I may remember wrong, but the game disk did not include german language files so it was not until much later that I found that it could be downloaded through some patches... tried it, but by then I was way too deep into the game to make the switch permanent... the spell had gone.\n\nWhen I started playing X3 this all came back to me when I was examined the different goods to trade.\nThe voice said "Teladianium" and I was back in the german world.\nSomething about this word has so much of the german language in it.\n\nEnough flashbacking!\n\nThe future:\nI expect to spend yet countless hours in the X3 universe, with both "Albion Prelude" and "Terran Conlict" in my steam library I predict I will not run out of missions in a while.\nThe though of building a trading empire, setting up my own Ore mines, programming flight patterns... everything that was not possible in the first game "X: beyond the frontier"... I wanna do!\n\nI recommend this game to anyone with a passion for space opera storylines, open sandbox worlds, and vast options for customising your role.\nOf course based on only 7 hours of play time :-)","February 7, 2015","true","38.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SupremeSpaceNerd/recommended/2810/","SupremeSpaceNerd","TK-421","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SupremeSpaceNerd/","42 products in account","Let me start by saying that I really love this game.  It's one of the coolest games I've ever played. You can be whoever you want (within reason) in this beautiful universe.  You can be an industry mogul, managing your company on a galactic scale.  You can be a cop, hunting down bad guys for money.  You can flip that coin and be one of the bad guys, a pirate, making your living by preying on defenseless ships.  You can be a freighter pilot, transporting wares from point A to point B for profit.  You can even be a fleet commander (after you've been playing for awhile), leading enormous space battles and snapping screenshots like a lunatic.  And that's just the beginning, it's set in a living world, where every ship you see is just like you, actually doing something and going somewhere in this massive galaxy and contributing to the intricate, supply and demand based economy.  Be that as it may, it's not for everyone.  If you have a lack of patience, a desire to build a huge empire right off the bat, or you like epic space battles from the word go, then do not buy this game.  If, however, you want to feel like you accomplished something when you do get those things, you want unlimited freedom in space, and you have a RIDICULOUS amount of spare time on your hands, then you will enjoy this.  If you are a busy person with lots of important stuff to do, you probably won't have time to do much in X3: Reunion.  If you are like me, and you have no life, X3: Reunion is the game for you.\n\nThe Pros:\n+Infinite freedom in space.\n+Beautiful graphics that have aged really well (the game was made in 2005).\n+Wide variety of ships.\n+You can drop in and out of the plot any time you like.\n+Realistic economy based on supply and demand.\n+Build your own space stations to further populate the universe.\n+Be the space trucker of your dreams.\n+Buy and sell space drugs.\n+Buy and sell space moonshine.\n+Buy and sell other goods in a black market as large as the legit one.\n+Persistent reputation that affects how you will be received by the locals.\n+Trade, fight, cheat, and steal your way to the top.\n\nThe Cons:\n-REEEEALLY steep learning curve, as the game comes with no tutorial.\n-Boring plot, but it really doesn't matter because if you are playing an X game for the plot, you're playing for the wrong reasons.\n-Starts off unbearably slow (picks up pace later).\n-Atrocious voice acting (makes for a good laugh now and again).\n-Confusing jargon (a jazura is a year, I think a mezura is a month, but I don't know for sure).\n-Terrible writing, bad puns, etc.\n-Your autopilot WANTS TO KILL YOU.\n-This game is highly addictive, and you will probably lose friends over it.\n\nIn conclusion, X3: Reunion is one of the best games I've ever played, and I will probably never sleep again.  My social life as I know it is over.  It's an absolutely fantastic game, but don't take my word for it, play it yourself and make your own opinion about it.\n\n11/10 would be a space trucker again.","June 2, 2015","true","44.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
