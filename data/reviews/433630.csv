You can't browse for music in-app (you have to use the VR web browser or desktop tab), and the visualizer is basically a few particle effects that seem to have almost nothing to do with the music. I know this is early access, but this is sparse even for an early access title.","May 27","false","0.2"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","4"

So i am supporting it.\n\nIf you can get this anywhere near the WinAmp visualisations that would be amazing...\n\nGreat Room scale Music Visualisation, with HUGE potenial.\n\nIf you need feedback PM me and i would love to contribute.","May 29","true","0.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I'm a very visual person, so I've always had a hard time getting a deep experience of music.  Laying down with ambient music like Maggie Rogers or John Frusciante dancing around me is one of the most relaxing experiences I've ever had.\n\nI truly look forward to how this evolves over time. There is lots of room for improvement, but this is a great start.\n\nIf anyone feels too crowded by the effects, I'd recommend laying on the floor and at the edge of your play space. Having the center area a couple of feet ahead of you is much better than being inside of it.","June 4","true","17.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Alot of people are over reacting about the price andamount of content of the application, but I believe its worth every cent, yes its sparse for early access but they want our feedback starting from the ground level. Here is basic functionality of what we want to make...What direction would you like to see it go, what features would you like to see added. Great job Devs it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to do these kind of things. Lets make this an awesome VR experience.","May 30","true","1.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You'd expect them to want to maximize the power of the graphics card but it seems this could run on any crappy pc.  Only reason to buy it is because it's the only thing out there of the kind right now but someone needs to make something better.","June 2","false","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","1"
