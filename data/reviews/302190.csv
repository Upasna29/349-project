While this is his first adventure ever and is rather dated in comparison to the new stuff on the market, it is still very much playable. Challenging and imaginative it is a point and click adventure which will entertain you for several hours. His landscapes, creatures and inventions often inspire a smile. While most story tellers rely on cheap sudden twists, his story telling abilities rely mostly on interconnections. If you loved games like Siberia, then this is a must and its only 99 cents.\n\nThe downfalls is that it is dated and the graphics are hardly crisp, some of the puzzles are really hard and have you scurrying for a walk through. And some of the letters that you find littered around the landscapes are hardly readable like a doctor's prescription on News Years.

What makes Amerzone stand apart from other adventure games are things that, at first, might seem like negative aspects: it's easy and it's short. This works in its favour, though, because the adventure never gets tedious and you won't have to resort to old-school habits like pixel hunting and combining every possible object in search of an answer. The story and ambience also set it apart, with an old-school, adventure film type vibe, that makes you feel like you're actually exploring uncharted territory (or, to be more precise, following in the footsteps of the only person who had travelled there before).\n\nOn a technical side, this version is a mere port with all the inconveniences of running such an old game. There is a set resolution, almost no options and, although it should run flawlessly, you never forget you're playing an old game. What Amerzone truly deserved is a remake, with all those beautiful landscapes rendered in high resolution, but since that probably won't happen, this original version is more than an adequate substitute.","November 27, 2014","true","3.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FOAMY89/recommended/302190/","FOAMY89","FOAMY89","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FOAMY89/","299 products in account","Amerzone is one of those gaming experiences that will stick with me probably for the better part of my life. It's a point-and-click adventure game a la Myst, but it's pretty different. It's not puzzle heavy at all, in fact I think there are only 5 major puzzles in the entire game. It's all about the story and the people in it. And it's a beautiful story about a story:\n\nYou start off by happening upon a dying man's last request. He asks you to return a sacred egg to Amerzone. All other agencies have turned down his requests for an expedition to go back to Amerzone. Not only that, but the country (or continent? not totally sure) is going through a dictatorship with a lot of bad results. There's a dash of steampunk and a dash of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle influence in the game, but this game really does feel like a story on its own. I didn't have any problems with how old the game is (I didn't play it when it first came out). The only rela problems I had with it were the parts where you had to traverse the jungle or a swamp and I'd get lost a bunch of times, but not enough to stop me from playing.\n\nYou, of course, end up completing the old adventurer's request, but the real special thing about this game is that while you are going on your adventure to finish his, you're basically tracking his footprints from decades ago and seeing how much things have changed. Instead of a busy town with lots of people in a trade market, you come upon a barren desolate town, a ghost town, where a couple of policemen drink their meaningless lives away. There's a lot being said here about culture and knowing your roots. The country is basically trying to fast-track itself into the developed world but by doing so is completely ignoring its rich heritage.\n\nTLDR:\nThis game is like a quiet poem that was whispered to you by someone old who passed away, and  you never really know if what they said was real or just a story. If you like games that are all about atmosphere and don't mind that this game is old then I recommend it. Also of course if you like Syberia you'll enjoy this. It's not very long, but I found the experience very rewarding.\n\nCheers.","October 4, 2015","true","3.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","1"

It perhaps hasn't aged as well as some older games, but it's worth a play if you like the genre.  It did seem rather short to me and the story fell apart a bit in places, so I would recommend getting it in a bundle if possible or on sale.\n\nGraphically very pretty for the time period it was created in, although somewhat fuzzy/pixelated on a modern system in places.  Nothing game breaking.  There was some minor annoyance in some parts that seemed too dark to see what was needed to progress, but that was very few places.  Character models probably aged the worst, but there are very few of them so no matter.  Animal models still look quite good; for example, the critters playing fetch with my grappling hook late in the game were delightfully well done.\n\nThe format is point-and-click in what I like to call "freestyle Myst" style, in that as you move around from spot to spot, you stand still in a static location as you do in Myst or Dark Fall, but you have free 360 degree freedom of view and click the movement arrows to move from spot to spot.  There is limited inventory and the interface is a little clunky, but again, nothing that is game breaking.\n\nThe story is straightforward but does leave a few holes and has some sketchy logic, but it was enjoyable.  While I do normally like games that leave me some room to mull over what happened and what it may mean, this one could have used some more detail and fleshing out of story and characters.  I had some questions that were more than just "give the player something to think about" problems and more "I think the player should have this information" problems.\n\nAnyway, I will recommend this because there is no "in the middle" option.  Given a choice between yes or no, I'd say yes, even though it hasn't aged as well as other games, because the story is interesting and the fantastical pseudo-Amazon setting is pretty fun to experience.  If you like the genre, give it a shot especially if you can find it on sale.","July 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

In other cases, you find games that are so unintentionally funny you can't help but reccomend to everyone you see. In Amerzone's case, it's a surprising mixture of both; hilarious cutscenes with some of the hammiest, cheesiest acting I've ever seen in a game, followed by a genuinely engrossing narrative and dated but impressive artstyle.\n\nThe game truly shines when you actually travel to the titular continent with Morrowind-esque enviornments and fascinating creature designs, but even before that, when you aren't listening to the cringeworthy dialogue, the atmosphere build and setup is utterly fantastic. I spent more time than I would like to admit pouring over the comprehensive journal of the explorer, filled with gorgeous artwork and introspective footnotes. I don't want to give too much away because it's such a fascinating Myst-like, but the reason for your journey is actually...decent. The amount of optional lore you can read about from the notes and journals you find are butter on bread, and while this game hasn't aged well visually, there is something endearing about the campy atmosphere and hammy dialogue that managed to enhance my over all intrigue.\n\nThis is not for everyone. At all. I would dare say that you would have a far better time if you kept a walkthrough open, but I'm trying to get as far as I can without one. It's about as old school as a point and click can get, but for once I can say the puzzles actually follow a form of logic. If you're curious about the relics of the not-so distant past, this is definitely a gem lost in time. The asking price is insanely cheap as well. It's definitely worth picking up just to form your own opinion of it.","November 13, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Another bigger annoyance is the fact that the game contains a lot of handwritten letters, which are quite hard to read due to the illegible handwriting.\n\nAs you'll complete this game in just a few hours, i'd say buy it on a 50% or more discount and you'll have some enjoyable hours for your money.","December 9, 2014","true","3.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It is in 1.st person view, which is unusual. -Syberia I&II, Paradise and Sinking Island were not, so this does give this game a tad of ''Myst'' feel to it, compared.\n\nYou just know it's Benoit Sokal's work when you start playing it,.. The lovely artwork and items you find in game, e.g. the journal you use as guide, is exactly like the one you find in Syberia, with handwritten texts and fantastic drawings, fun to look at because of its imagination, humouristic animals and the always warm stories behind it.\n\nI have played every single game made by Sokal, I can compare his releases. I'm his biggest fan, but I'm not going to lie, there are some annoyance with it.\n\nFirst of, there are no adjustments to sound levels, you sort of need a volume button on your keyboard or on the speakers/headset and hop on it occasionally. You can't tweek gamesound down and at the same time get everything they say just by reading subtitles, because there are non. Some locations were louder than others. I mean they are great crisp and belivable sounds, but levels are changing.\n\nThen you have the tab'ing out, that didn't work, or taking screenshots and then you have the cut scenes, they were quite pixel'y, not in playmodes though. But apart from the above, there were not really anything else to put my finger on. It's an old game. The oldest, so I recommend you keep a forgiving mind while playing this, because you sure don't want to miss out on it. It's a classic, and the story is memorable and sweet.\n\nVoice acting was great, art is insane, such an old game, yet so beautiful textures, humour filled elements and difficulty level: -Not holding your hand, but not frustrating either.\nThere were a couple of times I thought I was having a glitch or bug, always kept loosing my discs and searching for needle in a haystack,.. but, I was the one who were sloppy. There were no errors, nor any bugs what so ever.\n\nIt is with sort of sadness that I finished this game. Good 11 hrs of playing and reaching the end, I knew; ''That's it!'' Now there are no more oldtime adventures by Sokal to play, but brand new productions. (Which I look forward to as well).\n\nAs for this game Amerzone; -Yes, I do recommend you get to your collection.

People on forums were talking about this game, so I bought it to try it out.\nAt first, my expectations were high cause of fantastic Syberia, but it was fail from the start. I installed Amerzone on my XP cause the game was old. It was VERY buggy from the beginning as I couldn't even finish first half of chapter 1. Bummer .... So I tried Amerzone on W7 and it was not so buggy as I was moving through the game. I have to say that there are only a few NPC's in the game, so I was very dissapointed. Also, the game is easy which is cool as you don't need a walkthrough and it is finished in a couple of hours. Graphics were probably great at the time and sound effects and ambient are fantastic !! There are a lot of FMV's as you unravel a GREAT STORY and fantastic world through your voyage but there are also a lot of cliches in screenplay.\n\nOverall, I would give 74/100 score.\n\nFor everyone who likes Myst games this is a great game and not so bad for adventure fans as myself.

The graphics are dated but from a game from 1999 I didn't expect anything different. The mechanics are basic and a little clunky, the puzzles are a little obtuse and I don't know if I will ever replay the game again but it was worth it from a completists point of view.

(your multi-purpose ride ran out of fuel several times.)\nYou actually see death/desturction and a lot different exotic animals.\n\nThe bottom line however this is a simple Find and solve puzzle advanture which answers are always very linear.

Initially released in 1999, it was the first game designed by Benoit Sokal who is better known for his later Syberia adventure games.\n\nAlthough it runs remarkably well through Steam, it has all the drawbacks you might expect from such an old game.  The graphics are very dated and most scenes are static except for a few cut-scenes.  You can’t run in windowed mode, nor can you minimize/Alt-Tab out of the game.  This can be a big deal if you need to consult a walkthrough for help with one of the many puzzles as you will need to save and quit and then restart the game after getting help.  Thankfully, load times are short and you can save at any point.\n\nAmerzone's story is interesting, but not action-packed.  The puzzles are fair.  Most solutions aren’t instantly obvious, nor ridiculously complex, and they seem to make sense for the most part.  The pixel hunting is kept to a minimum and you won’t have dozens of inventory items to keep track of.  The voice-work, music and sounds are passable.\n\nAmerzone can be completed in less than five hours if you are an experienced adventurer, but it can purchased very cheaply, usually as part of a game bundle.  As long as your expectations are reasonable based on the game’s age, most adventure gamers will enjoy this classic.","December 29, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The graphics have aged well, all things considered, but the gameplay basically consists of "hover over everything on the screen just in case it's useful, and wander around until you happen across something that moves the game forward". A fairly useless model of gameplay, and, in light of other titles available to play, this is one point-and-click adventure to pass on.","February 6","false","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game is mostly visuals the story is very short on details. What happens to our char in the end who cares watch white birds fly. was that the child of the old man and tribal woman heck if I know. The game was also very short at best 3 hours if you are experienced with point and click, and the puzzles are mostly find the only clickable item and use.  I enjoyed my time playing, but i can't recommend it. Unless your new to point and click it's the perfect game to start in. As the puzzles aren't hard, only 2 need thinking,  there's no death or dead ends. In the end If pretty(for the time) Visuals made a game it would be top of my list sadly you need good puzzles and most of all a good story.\n\nIf you don't mind easy puzzles and little story this is a good point and click for you. Me I enjoyed it but only because I had a CD copy back in the day and never finished it back then.","February 4, 2015","false","3.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Not so Amerzone. I must have played through this a dozen times at least, and I enjoyed it every time. I remember how intrigued I was as a kid by the amazing vehicle used in the game.\nThe puzzles are easy enough for a child (who can read) to solve, but interesting enough to keep adults' attention.\nAll in all, this game is one of my fondest childhood memories. #biasedOpinion\nAlso, compared to Syberia, it lacks the never ending hours of watching the main character slowly run towards the edge of the screen before you can finally progress.\n\nThe graphics may be nothing compared to modern graphic technology, especially the really ugly humans, but the rest of the environment still looks pretty nice, at least design-wise.","June 27, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
