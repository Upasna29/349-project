It might be annoying to some people to have managed to make it so far into the story, only to get a gameover because they didn't have x item or y information, but it feels realistic and adds to replayability (especially since gamebooks from this company have more than one path to choose from when travelling from one point of the story to another).\nAlso, just note that most, if not all of the gamebooks from this company has an encounter early in the story that can make or break the game (gameover) far into the story.\n\nThere are beautiful, well-drawn illustrations scattered in the book relevant to the story passage at the time they appear. Music is pretty pleasant and didn't break immersion when reading the text.\n\nI like how the achievements are mostly there to hint to you that there are still parts of the story you haven't seen or experienced, rather than just placed there for overachievers.\n\nGive it a try if you're a fan of gamebooks and a good story, try to give this game a try.\nCan't wait to play the sequel. :)","November 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/recommended/335460/","BertieWooster","William Shakesman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/","1087 products in account","Assassin in Orlandes is the first of Tin Man Games's Gamebook Adventure series and what a strong start it is. A CYOA book, with dice throwing and "if you wish to turn left, turn to page 15" blah blah style adventuring. It is a lost art, partly because many of those old Fighting Fantasy books were more or less lifeless, dripping in theme but completely lacking in storytelling skill. This story is quite a fun ride though. You start out alone in a bar, your girlfriend has left you, and before long you are swept up in a maelstrom of kidnapping, blackmail, and even assassination! (Wait... "An Assassin in Orlandes!" I just noticed that! They must have planned that ALL ALONG! Brilliant!) Along the way, you'll travel through tombs, graveyards, castles, battle robbers, monsters, thugs, and even an assassin or two. The story is not long to finish, though you will want to go back and enjoy some of the branching paths, but even if you don't, the story does a wonderful job of telling a rip-roaring swashbuckling tale of adventure. The decisions are generally written with reasonable benefits and consequences if you think them through, too, so unlike most CYOAs the game feels like it is actually a game rather than a series of choices you must iterate though. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a CYOA story a little bit lighter on the anime VN style nonsense and heavier on swords and sorcery.","July 18, 2015","true","1.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","1"

Steam achievements are currently not working.\n\nIt's a book, but it's not. That can be positive (sound effects and music) and negative because you have to roll the dice to progress and you can't just leaf through it afterwards. Storywise, you're on a typical RPG adventure, you'll roll for combat and fitness checks every corner and die a lot. Which means you start over, maybe try a new path which still leads you through similar choke points until you die again. I did this 3 times on three different days because when the game makes you stop reading a story because of a virtual dice role that is frustrating, and then I switched the game from "classic" mode to "casual", which means it now works more the way I want it: I can just bypass the fights and checks and read on as if I'd won. And then I skip through half of the story which I've already seen in previous attempts (except the game can't skip like some Visual Novels do, you have to leaf through it and dice through it page by page) and get the rest of the humdrum fantasy campaign: betrayal, sorcery, nefarious doings that our hero thwarts, but not really anything in the way of character development or in fact anything that would make me think or feel.\n\nHigh point of the writing was the time I died from a piece of timber that was floating towards me while swimming in the river. True, it was fairly menacing, with sharp bits and nails poking out, but still it must've been really determined, or the water was just flowing much faster for that piece of wood than it was for me.\n\nSo, I don't exactly recommend this; I've seen free visual novels that were better than this. If you do play this, choose "Casual Mode" when you start out; contrary to what the instructions say, it plays exactly like classic mode except you get more bookmarks and some "cheat" buttons - you could resolve not to use them (and only use 3 bookmarks max) and see if you make it, and if you don't you won't have to start over.","August 20, 2015","false","2.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mar044/recommended/335460/","mar044","Mar044","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mar044/","307 products in account","Taking from such books as Fighting Fantasy, the book follows the old style gamebooks from the 80s well written and good story should draw anyone willing to read. Good background music, and artwork, and ajustable fonts and extras. The rules are fair and the options off choices on the page is actually better then Fighting fantasy giving you more logical responses then the standard go left and right. Fighting is fluid, my main complaint is that hardcore rules only allow 3 bookmarks which isn't a problem if you plan to play the whole game in one go, there is a casual mode and you don't really have to cheat if you don't want to but still, would liked to have had a hardcore option with unlimited bookmarks. It doesn't really stop you from playing the game hardcore, I think it just prevents you from going back over and over.\n\nAll and all its a good read and you should get the game if you don't mind reading and remembering how to use your mind to picture events, its a interactive novel, that plays like a game, so even though you are reading it as a book, you still feel like it's you living the story.","April 23","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately I didn't like the script. Up to the point I stopped playing because of an unknown missed flag, too many events followed the pattern of "walk into a situation, go into chase sequence, kill somebody, walk away". The plot seems to just happen to you, and there is zero indication of where branches will take you or what flags you're setting. Oh, and it has a lot of sudden roll-or-die events.","October 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you're nostalgic about that style of book, you'll get a couple hours of enjoyment from this game. The problem is that, outside of nostalgia, the choose your own adventure books haven't aged very well.\n\nIf you don't know the genre already, you read a few paragraphs of text, then you either make a decision, you roll a "fitness test," or you fight something. If you hear "decisions" and start expecting Telltale Games style moral choices you're going to be disappointed. Most decisions can be summarized as "you're running down a hallway, do you turn left or right?" That could still be interesting in a puzzle-y way, but there's typically no reason to prefer one direction over another. The fitness tests and combat can be summarized as "you roll some dice, and then you either succeed or you die." There is no meaningful strategy on the combat and if you fail you just die and have to redo the combat until you succeed or switch to "casual" mode and skip over it.\n\nThese types of gamebooks were fun back in the day, and I enjoy them in a nostalgiac way; but there's no reason to play this other than nostalgia. If you want a fantasy game, I'd reccomend you look up the old D&D games on GOG.com instead.\n\nEDIT: Almost forgot. The other reviews mention it, but I'll repeat it. The achievements are broken for a lot of people, and the developers haven't, to my knowledge, said when they'll be fixed. If that's important to you, keep it in mind.","August 23, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Orlandes in particular I feel is a better put together tale, and although the choices you make have less impact, it's a fairly well written story. Just keep in mind that this is a two part series, so to get the full charm and see the series miniature example of developer evolution, this isn't a bad place to start. The story follows your share of tropes and leads us off on a very gentle cliffhanger. The use of old school dice to determine encounters and sneak detection is a nice touch, and going on the highest difficulty will garuntee some roadbumps along the way and some surprising challenge for a choose your own adventure story, which definitely extends it out a bit.\n\nThe story is fairly standard, all being said, but what is important is that it's an enjoyable little journey. Is it worth the 10 dollar asking price? That's...tough. Even with all the branching paths, Orlandes is a short novella at best. The sequel, which has the same asking price, has a ton more content. On sale? Definitely worth the buy, but the price tag as of now is hefty. Orlandes is one to keep an eye on, and it will probably elicit that nostalgic feeling, even if it doesn't quite capture the charm of its predecessors.","January 14","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
