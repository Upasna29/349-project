The game is simple setup where you have x-ray vision for few seconds or just shoot people in face.  Can also use emp style grenades to confuse enemy with x-ray.

Game do not start unless real people join.\n\nYou can play coop mode with friends or more likely alone.

Rather than looking through the world with your eyes, you're seeing it through a screen painted on your helmet which can receive all sorts of disruption such as EMP grenades that require your helmet to reboot and "digital" smoke grenades that disrupt rendering in that direction.\n\nWhile in reality it's a really basic shooter, the premise is enough to make me recommend it based on that alone. Combine that with an exhaustive array of customizations for your equipment (and not only just stats, but visually) and there's plenty to play around with. The only real problem with this game is the lack of a reliable community and matchmaking system.","September 25, 2011","true","12.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Blacklight Retribution is a fun and expansive F2P game but this was a great kickstart to the series. Very minimal First-Person gunplay combined with a small but unique story while all being focused on a convincingly real futuristic world of electronic warfare. If you have $5 to waste; Instead of going to spend it on a meal at McDonald's, spend it on this here game. Even though you won't be able to play much (if any) online games, I promise the single-player missions will be all the fun you're looking for in a small game like this. The missions are short, but they have a decent replay value and I find myself running through them every few months just for nostalgia purposes.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a neat little sci-fi shoot'em-up, you've found one for quite a good price.","November 25, 2013","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not by constantly paying for Zen. You don't keep things you earn unless you buy them with Credits in-game, or real money. There is no currency or anything in Tango Down. And it's easier to level up than pay real money for guns and things in Retribution.\n\nThere is more things in Retribution to try, but I do wish it focuses more on the "F2P" method, Tango Down's only $0.99 on the Store, so it's fine for your wallet. The core gameplay of Tango Down is more fun than the gadgets in Retribution.\n\nThe servers in Tango Down are always up and running. Not like Retribution, you need to connect to Europe to play on public servers, and even private servers.\n\nI think this game deserves more attention than Retribution, but it's only my opinion.\n\n","November 23, 2014","true","9.2"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","0"

Gun modifications are impressive but that’s pretty much the only impressive thing in this game.

All I heard was people raving about how awesome it was when it was released. Sadly, I'm cheap and wouldn't buy the game at full price. I now regret that since I can't really experience the game fully whenever I want. I'm assuming the game basically lost player base due to the lack of new maps....which does make it a bit boring after awhile. However, (like I first stated) if you have friends who play it, or can coordinate with others, then the game is pretty fun.\n\nI do recommend the game. It is a blast - better with friends/partners - and provides some cool customizations. Of course, now BL:Retribution is out...and free...which also draws people away from this game.

The multiplayer sucks only because it is so incredibly hard to get a game started at all. I have attempted to join games, but there are no games ready to join ever. It forces me to start a game lobby to wait for others interested in joining. You have to wait till somewhere between 6 and 10 people are ready to play the game with you, or you can not start the game/match. No one can join midgame. I have waited 30 minutes on several occasions for more than 5 people to join, and by then everyone leaves. Because of this I hate the game.\n\nThe single player seems fun. Although the AI will stomp you if you rush in, if you are cautious the AI is incredibly easy. After getting to character level 2 I stopped playing, having 80 kills and 3 deaths. Too easy. (3 deaths from rushing in during the first scene. When i started to play cautious I did not die once, it became unchallenging.)\n\nUPDATE:\nNow, a game with a well behaved dev team can go far. But this game's dev team is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. They deleted my post complaining of game issues and threatened to ban me. One post asking for help and I get a ban threat. I then emailed his manager who was just as bad. And after reading about the other devs, they are all self-entitled ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ready to squash any posts they don't like in the slightest. STEAM initially told me to seek technical help from these guys, who pretty much just berate you.\n\nDon't just run from this game, run from its dev team as individuals!

With all that stated, let's review this game.\n\nStoryBlabbity Blah FPS games have no story, this game is no exception. There's not really so much a story as much as it was a tacked on description of the two factions -- The Blacklight Team and the Order -- which I will be copying word for word directly from the game for notes. The TL;DR of it is that it's the best of the best soldiers using the best (American, obviously) equipment to look for their Colonel while The Order is slowly coming in for the kill.\n\nWho is Blacklight?\nBlacklight is the covert ops unit that places the most advanced U.S. military technology in the hands of the finest soldiers in the world. Hyper Reality Visors, reactive armor and digital grenades are just a few of the cutting edge weapons that make these next-gen warriors the elite fighting force in the world. The team has been brought in to investigate the disappearance of one of their own; Colonel Klein and his team of Blacklight operatives. On the ground, the Blacklight team has found that things have quickly deteriorated and their search for Klien has evolved into their battle against The Order.\n\nWho is The Order?\nThe Order is a highly organized rebel group composed of Ex-US special forces and local militia, who have joined the cause. As former members of various militaries, these rogue soldiers use their top level training to build daunting fortifications that shield the construction of an advanced infrastructure that supplements further development of their own impresive cache of military hardware and new technology. Their equipment is the best hardware and technology that money can buy, purchased using their military contacts throughout the world.\n\nGraphics / AestheticsGraphics do support up to 1080p, but there are pretty much only two options out of the entire list, and that would be shader details (Which are on a number-based option, from 1-5), and the resolution. I guess you could include brightness, but bare with me on what I'm about to say. The aesthetics in this game are obstensibly giving a bleak apocalyptic setting, and your Hyper Reality Visor pretty much takes you out of the vision that you might be playing a liquidated fallout game\n\nGameplayAside from what you can expect from most FPS games these days, offering TDM, DM, S&D, CTF, and other strange variations, there's not much you can expect out of this game either. That's not to say this game was lackluster, but the main gimmick was that there was HRV, but it didn't hold out much hope when the majority of the maps were relatively small. When you aimed down sights, the weapon model would move directly to the middle of the screen. I guess one could say it was to make it simialr to doom, but I don't see the reference.\n\nBlacklight Retribution certainly had some changes that were for the better though. The addition of the tactical gear may not seem innovative, but compared to how it was in Tango Down, it actually seems laughable; These healing and ammunation stations that players would have, it almost seems as if it were abusable, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was. Customization remains to be a feature, that along with the story, needed an explanation for in a different tab.\n\nIt was neat to have, but much like how I've been building this review, came with some setbacks. The level requirement for each one was set at an ungodly curve, requiring you to play a LOt to get the "Doritos Pro MLG Swagging gear", which I imagine the people who have probably did not even make it to rank 70, because of the lack of players.\n\nHacking nodes or different terminals in the game is pretty much as innovative as the way nodes are hacked in BL:R. In fact, I'd love to see these modes implemented over there. It's not always been about matching numbers, and being able to play a Simon Says minigame to hack terminals would be neat to have.\n\nBlack Ops Mode needs to be in BL:R\nMaybe this part is just me, but the main redeeming quality about this game was Black Ops. No, not COD:BO, rather Black Ops in Tango Down was more of a campaign-mode. This no doubt changed to Onslaught Mode featuring a load of Zambros, but I figured after a while, why not?\n\nHere I am, at an unreachable place that the "militia" cannot jump or attack me with, and instead what they do is throw rocks at me. ♥♥♥♥, did they certainly break my bones. I'm not one to say that zambros can't do that, but it's something to think about when players get on a spot that make the crazed soldiers frozen in place.\n\nOverall ThoughtsMan, looking back at this, it's really gratifying to see the number of changes that HardsuitLabs is doing. In regards to this entire review, I feel that I've been pretty critical over the game. It was initially released in July 7, 2010, with its XBox release notably about a couple weeks earlier. As expected, this is not a great PC port, but is it worth playing after the fact that it has gotten some major discounts?\n\nWell, let me put it this way. I purchased this game because I wanted to know the lore. The executive producers and the developers put out a couple of minisodes that explained the universe behind Blacklight, but I was terribly shocked by the quality of the game to retain a rather drab story. That being said though, I believe that it cannot possibly get any worse than what was shown.\n\nI guess the best thing to come out of this experience is that "It cannot be any worse than this". There's a lot of room for improvement, and that was where Hardsuit Labs/Zombie Studios decided to recalibrate their aim and go for the bullseye. With the community nearly hitting a cultist status, I'd have to say that there's not much stopping the players nor the original developers from going up.\n\n\nBottomlineYou're paying a buck to play about 5-7 maps of campaign mode, which is at best the same quality as a Free-To-Play Campaign mode. If you continuously play this game, you unlock more gear, which you can test out with said bots for a higher score. Multiplayer is possible, but best of luck to finding a player.\n\nHow to install this gameSeeing as how I somehow used black magic to play this game, I guess I should share how to install it. I am currently using Windows 8.1, so when you get this game, just get the GFWL installer client from the xbox site, then right-click on it, go to compatibility, and run it as a Windows 7 Application, as well as making sure that it runs as admin.\n\ninstall from there, and then play yer game. Of course if you haven't already, make sure you have a Microsoft ID to sign-in.","June 12, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a testament to why making multiplayer-only games is still a bad idea, as is using the console version of a multiplatform title as your baseline.","June 13, 2015","false","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
