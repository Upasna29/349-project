"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/recommended/231200/","cheeseness","Cheeseness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/","533 products in account","For those who have not previously come upon it, Kentucky Route Zero is a five part point and click/text adventure hybrid described by its creators as a "magical realist adventure game about a secret highway in the caves beneath Kentucky, and the mysterious folks who travel it."\n\nI often find Kentucky Route Zero a difficult game to describe. The narrative follows the final delivery of a driver whose company is undergoing financial difficulty, as he seeks out 5 Doogwood Drive, an address that isn't on Conway's maps. Stopping for directions, Conway is told that it can be found on the other side of the Zero, a mysterious underground highway that the game derives its name from. As a vague plot synopsis, that probably isn't immediately appealing, and yet Kentucky Route Zero manages to be one of the most engaging and interesting gaming experiences I've ever had.\n\nGameplay is a juxtaposed combination of traditional style point and click adventure mechanics in 3D scenes for key areas, and evocative text only sequences, punctuated by an exploration oriented "driving" interface represented as a stylised overhead map.\n\nThe choices the game presents you with rarely offer alternate outcomes. In contrast to more traditional point and click adventures, where progressing is a matter of chosing the correct dialogue options or performing the correct tasks, KR0 opts for a far more subtle and resonating style in which your choices define the tone of the game and the attitudes of its characters in response to the situations and predicaments they encounter. In some ways, it feels as though the player's actions control a shifting lens through which subsequent revelations are seen - an understated, yet powerful mechanic that somehow makes the player's actions feel more real and meaningful than one would usually find.\n\nThe characters in and around the Zero feel deep and rich. Even characters whose appearances seem bit parts carry a sense of life and believability. As the game progresses, Conway attracts a party of companions who join his search for 5 Dogwood Drive, each with their own outlooks and energies, motivations and troubles. Each new character shifts the dynamics of character exposition, bringing new aspects of familiar faces into relief with the flashlight of their own perspectives.\n\nVisually, Kentucky Route Zero offers a deceptively simple style, and at first glance could be mistaken for 2D vector work. Instead, KR0's point and click scenes are entirely 3D, combining some great set design, fantastic lighting and some nice camera work with dynamic effects that work to enhance and support the game's aesthetics rather than define them (in particular, there's a super neat bit with some trees towards the end of Act II that creates an opportunity for two pairs of characters' contrasting experiences and enthusiasm to be presented at once in a way that is both interesting and in some ways moving).\n\nFrom a sound design perspective, the game is equally striking, with the already atmospheric visual and narrative tone boosted further by the kind of immersive soundscapes that tend to not be directly noticed until highlighted, but as soon as you're aware, you can't help but admire them.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is a masterful work of interactive storytelling that is executed astoundingly well. For those who already know this, here are a couple[superlevel.de] of articles[superlevel.de] and[superlevel.de] interviews[animalnewyork.com] which are worth checking out if you haven't come across them already.\n\nIf you're undecided or would like to see more examples of this team's narrative work, Cardboard Computer have so far released two free standalone interludes, Limits and Demonstrations[kentuckyroutezero.com], and The Entertainment[kentuckyroutezero.com], which take place between Acts I and II, and Acts II and III respectively.","May 20, 2014","true","23.3"," 176 of 198 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","176","198","0","9"

I couldn't tell you exactly why. The game's trippy, mysterious. Gorgeous. I could stare at this game for hours, but, of course, the mystery drives me on--because this is a real mystery, not some generic 'who murdered whom?' It's far more than that. I want to know who Julian is, what significance the mine has, how the barn ended up in a museum, and why the museum's occupants... why does the museum have occupants? Kentucky Route Zero is a mystery, a real mystery. I want to know more--I must know more!\n\nAnd yet... the more I know, the less I understand. This is less of a traditional point and click adventure game, and more of... well, some sort of adventure. There's one point in Chapter 2 where my mouth dropped open, though I was looking at nothing more than inky blackness and a 2D map sketched in white lines.\n\nThis game looks good, but it sounds even better. The experience is practically made by sound. Oh, sure, the strange figures that appear if you shut off the lights in the mine are frightening, but something about it is way more compelling when you've got those headphones plugged in. Immersing yourself in this game's aural landscape is like taking a bath. Soothing. Gentle. Calm.\n\nAnd yet... something there is unsettling, always unsettling. This is a room with a Bureau in an old cathedral, an abandoned storage facility that used to be a church, a floor occupied entirely by bears. This is a game that unnerved me with a simple phrase and a sound effect. This game... this game... it's something you, and everyone you know, ought to try.\n\nAs games I tried in 2013 go, Kentucky Route Zero was moving, mysterious, engrossing, and over all too quickly. For now. The first two chapters have released, and the game will be updated with three more in the future. I can't wait.\n\nI loved every second of it, and I'm sure you will too.","January 5, 2014","true","2.1"," 153 of 182 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","153","182","0","14"

It was very enlightening, we studied some of the new waves of storytelling, watched some David Lynch movies, played some live rpg games (based on Kult, best rpg ever) and so on... best course I ever attended, shame it was so short. I remember writing an essay about videogames, mostly focused on my experiences with graphic adventures and a game I couldn't stop playing by then called Half Life 2.\nI just wish I could go back again today, after playing Kentucky Route Zero. It feels like the kind of game I was wishing for in those days.\n\nKR0 is a captivating exercise of storytelling, sucks you in from the beginning and minimizes the interface to focus on the audiovisual experience. Same goes for all the technical aspects of the game. Graphics, music and gameplay are well polished and just let you enjoy the story without getting in the way. They all do their part, and do it very good.\n\nThe enviroment is dreamlike, inmersive, deceptively lifeless. So many details  appearing out of the corner of the player's eye, so many left to the player's imagination.\nThis is not a usual adventure, but more an interactive story. The narration comes mostly from what you see and what you hear, saving you from reading huge walls of text. Actually, the text is just another element, and it doesn't give any important information most of the time. It does add up to the overall experience and it's a pleasure to read.\nSomething that caught my attention is that you never seem to be in control, just like in a dream. Your mind will struggle to follow a logic path to the story, but the game will break your will and ultimately take you for a ride. Just sit back, get comfy and enjoy it.\n\nI can't wait to go back and continue with the game, just wanted to recommend it to everyone looking for a good, innovative experience in the already bursting indie scene. Games like this make me feel proud to be a gamer and, having passed my 30, look to my friends who jumped off the videogame train because it wasn't mature enough for society standards and think "You don't know what you're missing".\n\nPS. Big points for the references to Gabriel García Márquez, recently passed away colombian writer, creator of the magic realist that influences this game heavily. I bet he would be proud and happy to play this game.","June 24, 2014","true","3.9"," 111 of 126 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","111","126","0","7"

It's actually a weird pseudo psycho trip. Calling it an adventure would be grossly overestimating the game's abilities. It's  a narrative driven story that drifts so far into lunacy it's getting extremely hard to even follow it, let alone understand what's going on. It's definitely "interesting" and I would have liked to actually finish it, but again...where are the remaining 2 episodes? You can't charge 23 bucks for an episodic game and then after over two years not even finish the story...that's actually a scam if I'm totally honest, so I wonder if you would get your money back from Steam...probably not, because Steam customer support sucks ♥♥♥...","May 24, 2015","false","4.4"," 418 of 596 people (70%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","70","418","596","14","17"

Don't listen to these negative reviews claiming the game is a "scam".\n2. Don't look for anything on this game's story, if you think you're going to buy it, buy it without an idea of the story you're about to witness.\n\nIt's true, Kentucky Route Zero has been in the making for over a couple years now. But how can you blame a 2 person devolopment team? Especially when they offer so much with each episode. Not to mention the INTERMISSION episodes they release for free on their website cardboardcomputer.com.\n\nIt's been over a year since the last episode, and they have a srict rule of not having release dates for each new episode. An admirable stance as release dates can be a source of stress for indie developers, and often cause skimping out on certain aspects of the game.\n\nSo they work at their own pace, working to make the story they aim to, with no restrictions. And they've done an excellent job so far.\n\nI refuse to say anything about the story, as I walked into this game with no prior knowledge beyond it's good reception. I've found it incredibly amazing and all the more engaging because of this.\n\nI will say this game is very close to the peak of the "Weird Americana" story genre. It's a game filled with ghosts (in more ways than one), tall tales, shady backgrounds, and many old things.\n\nIt's a story of missed connections, faded relationships, longing, and regrets. The developers say it will be a tragedy, and I believe it.\n\nA major complaint is the illusion of choice in the game. Being text based, it offers you many different conversational options. The main character's backgrounds, feelings, and dialogue are all filled in by you through these options. But episode to episode they don't make much difference.\n\nBut is that a real complaint? The developers have the story they want to tell, I don't blame them for not making these options integral to the games plot.\n\nBut furthermore, why must these options have tangible effects in the game world? Each of the characters aren't total blank slates, but they do leave much room for your own filling in. I've found myself creating these character's intangible personalities, and basing my decisions off what i've created.\n\nAnd it's not like in life there are either options A, B, or C that all lead to different outcomes. Some decisions dont matter in the larger sense. Some don't make a difference.\n\nIn short I love this game and if you're into narrative video games, grab this ASAP.\n\nA last warning though, I can't agree with the price either. I happened to get it on sale for 10 dollars, and I suggest you wait for a sale too. I don't see any problems with offering the individual episodes for the people not totally committed to the story, or skeptical of it's entertainment. BUT, I do see that it's a good excuse to say "hey, if you buy it all, why not play through them?".\n\nA+","June 23, 2015","true","24.9"," 76 of 91 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","76","91","0","0"

Lox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weird_vector/","209 products in account","It's tricky to write about Kentucky Route Zero because it's best to know as little as possible about it before playing. The last thing I want is to reveal too much.\n\nThat being said, I can tell you that it's not a typical adventure game in many aspects. It's closer to the new Telltale games in the fact that it has no puzzles, no collecting items, nothing to distract from the essence of the game. It's driven by dialogue, observation and exploration, any action scenes are basically non-existent. The most unique thing about it is the narrative mechanic. The player shapes the story, but not in a way that you might expect.\n\nThe story is very reflective and melancholic, yet not self-absorbed or pretentious like some sad stories tend to be. It's quite ambiguous and not at all straightforward, exploring multiple themes and leaving a lot of room for interpretation and discovery of its meaning - not a thing for everyone. It might even seem not quite coherent at times, but there's a method in this madness.\n\nAudiovisual design is flawless. Distinctive art style helps create the vagueness and uncanny feeling of the world, perfectly corresponding with the story. There's a lot of atmosphere in almost every scene. Oh, and the scenes. Beautifully crafted, the moments they present can range from calming and touching to rather unsettling ones. And one of them is simply the most perfectly executed musical performance I've ever seen and heard in a game.\n\nIn overall it's not a game for everyone. You won't find in it a dramatic and dynamic plot, exciting action or difficult choices.

The unusual atmosphere and odd interactions with characters is at once unsettling and hypnotic, its logic clashing with reality yet somehow seeming entirely natural in this bizarre segment of road you've found yourself lost on.\n\nThe plot trickles out through nebulous exchanges with persons that may or may not even exist, giving you answers as they simultaneously create an abundance of new questions you haven't time to ask. This ambiguity could very easily be the downfall of the game, but there's a self awareness to the narrative's construction that holds it together as it continues to distort its world into a mysterious cloud of disconnected yet overlapping plot lines.\n\nI'm being intentionally unclear with my descriptions because Kentucky Route Zero relies so heavily upon the player's unknowing of what exactly it is. Were I to have come in already versed on its events, I have little doubt that the magic that kept me engrossed as I tried to fit the misshapen pieces together would have been lost, and what I would have been left with would be an artistically inspired but far less stimulating experience.\n\nAfter only playing the first act of five, I haven't a great deal more to say about Kentucky Route Zero besides how immensely it made me want to explore more about it and learn its secrets which it has only just touched upon. It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what makes it so interesting to me, but more than anything it is likely the endless possibility of what could be in store after what was essentially a prologue of sorts.\n\nPerhaps I'll have better answers when I've been through the remaining acts, but regardless of what they contain, Kentucky Route Zero has already established itself as wholly compelling. It feels like the road I'm heading down could take me anywhere, and I want to see everything along it.\n\nAct II Review Update\n\nAfter completing the second of Kentucky Route Zero's planned five acts, the first is now clear as existing as a sort of necessary introduction to what is to come. It displayed hints of an almost hypnagogic second world hidden beneath our own, setting the story in motion without drifting too far from reality as it slowly allowed its mystery to reveal itself.\n\nAct II is when the Zero is finally allowed to take the spotlight, where former pretenses are rejected as the developers firmly take our hand to guide us through the play being performed in front of us. Kentucky Route Zero's vision of what it is and what it will be is so strong, so confident, that it need not hamper itself with explaining its events as its method of storytelling so entirely encompasses its plot that it would almost be detrimental to the experience should any clear answers be given, or perhaps exist at all.\n\nAs its dreamlike world comes more into focus I still have no idea where it plans to take me, and oddly I'm entirely accepting, even excited by that lack of knowledge. Kentucky Route Zero is keeping me in the dark, but its steady reassurance that it knows the way through is enough to keep me moving onward. Wherever this might end up, act II showcased nothing that leads me to believe it has any chance of losing focus, only becoming more captivating as each new piece of its overarching narrative is introduced and I'm taken further inside boundless imagination.","November 16, 2014","true","2.7"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","49","57","0","2"

Agency might be via micro-decisions, such as what to shoot in a linear FPS, stat progression trees and character customisation in an RPG, or varying strategic and tactical choices influenced by the randomness of procedural generation. It is the perception of player agency, even if only a perception, that adds a level of immersion that allows one to be drawn into a story and personally invest in it.\n\nIn Kentucky Route Zero, while the player moves various protagonists around the screen and clicks dialogue choices, these rarely have any noticeable influence on the story other than exposition.\n\nI therefore find myself drawing comparisons with other, more established, non-interactive media, such as graphic novels, literature and film that are more reliant on narrative and where examples of mature, quality story lines are plentiful.\n\nHow, then, does this game compare to great film, great literature, or a great graphic novel? On that basis Kentucky Route Zero can reasonably claim to be good, I think, but not quite great.\n\nUltimately, if I want to be taken for a ride I actually get better immersion from letting a story wash over me while reading or watching a movie. At Kentucky Route Zero's pace, the interaction can tend to break immersion rather than enhances it.\n\nIt does seem to me, however, that there may be a tendency for those well aware of the woeful absence of genuinely intelligent, complex and mature themes in most games to be a tad overenthusiastic when they find a game that does take a decent stab at these, even if it fails on virtually every other measure by which we normally assess computer games (Rock Paper Shotgun 2013 GOTY, I'm looking at you).\n\nHaving said that, after now playing through Episode III, I feel compelled to add that for the first third of this installment the game genuinely transcends its limitations to become something truly sublime. It is therefore even more of a disappointment when the remaining two thirds of the same episode drops the ball a little on several levels. Nonetheless, there is certainly potential for masterpiece if the game's best form can be recaptured for the remaining episodes.\n\nHaving now played through Episode III after decent break from the release of Episode II, it is also worth adding that the game doesn't hold up at all well to extended pauses between episodes. The complexity and nuance of the characters and story, one of the game's big selling points, is also its biggest downfall as the minutiae is particularly hard to recall several months down the track. For this reason, I'd urge people to consider resisting the need for instant gratification and wait for the complete five episode experience.\n\nEpisode III is slightly longer than the first two episodes, possibly due to some repetitiveness. With two more episodes to go, one might estimate that a full meandering playthrough will likely take around 9 hours, which seems fair for a game of this type.\n\nEdit: updated 30 June 2014 to reflect having played through Episode III.","December 28, 2013","true","5.8"," 70 of 92 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","70","92","0","4"

I must say I am very disappointed in Cardboard Computer not being much more upfront about their incredibly, insanely long development cycle. Had I known, I would have held off until the complete experience was ready. I mean, we're not talking a few months between content, we're talking almost 2 years waiting for a single episode.\n\nThough I don't feel that Cardboard Computer are scamming people, I do feel they are slightly 'shady' and I think they should be a little more upfront with the community and provide a little more contact.

There are so many things to like about it; the art, music, and atmosphere are all amazing. And the story is a wonderful surreal journey that you don't often find in games. It's really a shame that I wont recommend this game because it had such promise and I was looking forward to playing it before the first episode was even released.\n\nBut all that being said, the game is incomplete. You're always going to have to wait for the complete package in an episodic game, but after 2 years without news it seems like we wont ever be getting the rest of it. I played the game when episode 3 came out, and I can honestly say that I just don't care anymore. Even if episodes 4 and 5 eventually do come out, I probably wont bother playing at this point.\n\nI fully recognize that this game is made by a really small development team and that these things take time, but whatever the reasons for the lack of updates, it doesn't change that the game has not not been added to in years. Charging $25 for 3/5 of a game without being up front about the fact that there's no schedule for the other episodes verges on deceptive at this point and no one should waste their time and money unless the full game is released.\n\nIf the game is ever completely I might consider going back and playing through the whole thing again, and will update my review accordingly, but for now it's barely more than half of a game that we probably wont ever see the end of, so there's no reason to play it.\n\n\nNote: Regarding my play time, I actually played it quite a bit longer and completed episodes 1-3, but did so in offline mode so my time wasn't recorded.\n\n***\n\nUpdate: I remembered this game recently and decided to check on the status of the remaining episodes. Or rather, I decided to try to find some status on them, but the developer is silent best I can tell. I bought this game over 3 years and still don't have a complete version of it. I'm generally pretty understanding when it comes to delays, but silence from a team that's this far behind is completely unacceptable. I have completely given up any hope or interest in this game ever being finished and honestly think it should be removed from the store until they prove active development. Hopefully that anyone thinking about buying this game will take notice of the fact that it's being as a complete package but isn't and wont buy it.","September 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 88 of 135 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","88","135","0","0"

With that said, if you are interested in what games can do, this is a must play. Absolutely.\n\nBetween the art and the soundtrack, Kentucky Route Zero is beautiful. You watch scenes literally construct and deconstruct. The ever present ambient music calms you. Personally, the musical performance at the Lower Depths in Act III justified my purchase (though I did buy it on sale). The unfortunate part is that it isn't a game and there isn't a plot. There aren't even characters. It's simply a world that you explore. There's a foundation for a strong game, but the execution relies on one aspect (atmosphere) and abandons everything else.\n\nI admire its ambitions--the dialogue selections become a personality test for the player through (sometimes seemingly endless) dialogue selection, and the pacing, when done well, is done VERY well--but, for me, it hasn't (as of Act III) been successful. Random things happening to / at / in the vicinity of empty shells of characters drives me away. I found myself skipping dialogue, hoping to push everything along. Conway limps through the entirety of Act II, nearly slowing the game to a hault by discouraging you to explore the world. Even magical realism and surrealism need a tether; and that may occur in the remaining two acts but that's a little too late for me.","July 18, 2014","false","3.5"," 54 of 79 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","54","79","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akswift/recommended/231200/","akswift","a.k.swift","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akswift/","71 products in account","Let me preface this by typing out why I really thought this would be a game that I enjoy and would be able to recommend:\n\nI played and loved pretty much all of the classic point & click adventures in their golden era. From the Sierra adventures to Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, all the Lucasarts games really, Simon the Sorcerer, Baphomets Curse, you name it.\n\nIn more recent times I really enjoyed the Telltale games and also the more philosophical approach of The Stanley Parable for example.\n\nIf you are in a similar position and thinking about getting this, it is actually not enough to tell if you will like this game or not. I cannot recommend this to you with a straight face.\n\nFirst off, the graphical fidelity is really limited, as you might have seen already, but I wouldn't really count that as a negative point. The art style is very distinct and on point, and amplifys the creepy and uneasy mood throughout the whole game. They also manage to get some stunning panoramas and effects out of this minimalistic style, it definitely works for this title.\n\nAs for the gameplay, there really is not much to speak of. It mainly consists of walking, driving and dialogue. The conversations aren't voiced so get ready for reading. A lot. Also a lot of really basic small talk that has no connection to any part of the story whatsoever. There are also frequent, short (mostly optional) detours from the main path that happen entirely in text form, no visuals.\nAs far as I've seen there is no form of puzzles or decisions in the game that have any impact on how it unfolds. I disagreed with people that said this is the same in Telltales games. Although the end result is pretty much always the same, there is at least an illusion of choice and advancement, using a thing with another thing to make something happen. Getting the player busy. There is none of that in KRZ, if anything it is very close to a graphic novel where things play out for you, not through you. (This is also evident in the way it is broken up. Acts and Scenes.)\nIt does a few really neat things, like seamlessly switching the character you control without you actually realizing it.\n\nWell then, the story. This is where I seriously got lost. I can't really tell all that much without spoilering anything, but I can tell you that it is basically all over the place. There is a goal or finish that you know about, but it gets replaced with another goal in the first few minutes of the game, and this new one never gets questioned, just accepted as necessary.\nCome to think of it, everything in this game just gets accepted, nothing is questioned. As a result, nothing gets explained or "solved" either. It's like a very elaborate acid trip. A ride you hop in that trails you along, getting crazier and more confusing by the minute. And you really have no choice but letting it happen and not thinking too much about it, moving on.\n\nYou would think that the game would make fun of itself through it ridiculous developments, but it doesn't. Apart from literally one or two very brief instances (one "running gag" and a kid), the tone of this game is dead serious.\n\nThe soundtrack is used very sparingly, but to great effect, and it's phenomenal. If anything, I really recommend getting that.\n","November 2, 2014","false","4.7"," 143 of 238 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","143","238","6","10"

I tried to come up with a nicer way of saying it, but I just can't sugar-coat the truth.  This game is a complete and total rip-off, and here's why...\n\nThey're charging full price for a game that isn't just unfinished, but shows no signs of ever being finished.  Simply put, the game is trying to follow the pattern of timely episodic releases popularized by Telltale Games.  There's just two problems with that:\n\n1) You can't buy individual episodes.  The only purchasing option on Steam is a full Season Pass.  You can't buy the first episode for $5 and then decide if you like it enough to buy the rest.  Nope, it's all or nothing.\n\n2) Releases have been anything but timely.  The first two episodes came out in January and May 2013.  The third was released in May of 2014.  There is no announced release date for the fourth.\n\nThink about that for a second.  They are charging full price for a game that has been only 60% done for over a year.  Early Access games wish they could get away with this.\n\nWhat's worse is that game critics have been tripping over themselves trying to heap praise on unfinished product, and it's not hard to see why.  The visual are striking, the music perfectly captures the feeling of rural Kentucky, and the story certainly has me on edge for the next two episodes...\n\nWhat's been delivered is certainly worth an 8/10.

Not the kind to spook you, but the kind to make you stop and think about life.\n\nFirst off, the bad. It takes a hell of a long time between episodes, which many people have complained about and is a valid issue. Gameplay wise, it's a fairly standard modern adventure game. you explore, solve an occasional puzzle, and talk.\n\nOther than that, this is a beautifully designed, beautifully written game that evokes everything from early 40's americana, to the 80's computer revolution, from Lynch-esque surreality to Springsteen-esque yearning. The artstyle is minimalist yet vast, with each scene having a distinctive palette and tone. The writing is top-notch throughout, mature and emotional where a lesser game may have been corny. The music and sound is stellar, combining traditional bluegrass and folk with dark ambient soundscapes.\n\nThere are choices in the game, yes, but they are not the kind of BIG, GAME-CHANGING choices that you'd see in a TellTale style game. The choices you make define who these characters are, what their past is, what they want to be. There's a beautiful scene in the third act where  Junebug sings a song, and your choices affect the lyrics. This is a beautiful scene for two reasons; each choice is actually sung, the only voice acting in the game, and as you hear it you realise that the song is, in fact, about Conway . Scenes like this are what make the game for me.\n\nIf you're a fan of adventure games, of litterature, of ghost stories, I highly recommend this game. If the lack of a release schedule bothers you, or if you play adventure games more for the puzzles than the story, you might find this lacking.","July 7, 2015","true","6.4"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","0"

I planned on sleeping last night, but I decided I would start up act 2 last night and play through until I finished 3. I ended up totally engrossed in the story of the Zero, on the edge of my seat, envoloped in mystery until the big hours of the morning. Needless to say, I liked it.\n\nBasic info: No puzzles, mouse only interaction. That means you can play this on your laptop, in your bed, upside down.\n\nBasic story: You're a delivery truck driver, Conway, and this is your last delivery. Ever. But you can't quite figure out the address...\n\nNow for the gameplay: what's that like? First of all, there is only one kind of puzzle in the game, and that's at the very beginning. This game doesn't try to be a puzzle game, at least not in the traditional sense. You'll never have to go find that one stupid piece of whatever to fit into the ambiguos slot to progress. Most of your time will be spent reading the humanlike interactions you have with everything around you and the stories they tell you and the stories you tell them.\n\nThe dialogue and descriptions are all meaningful in the most insignificant way. Your choices don't matter, but at the same time, they are what make up the game. Your choices are what make Conway, his/your companions, and the world of Kentucky Route Zero something uniquely yours. There are no wrong paths in this game, and as soon as you realize that, you can invest into your conversation decisions that sculpt the worldviews of the cast of characters and their perception of Conway, as well as yourself.\n\nBy the end of this masterful ordeal, you're playing Conway as much as you're playing yourself. People will make comments about Conway that resonate within your psyche because you made Conway who he is, so they're really talking about you. Or maybe they're not.\n\nThe beautify of this game is left to your own interpretation of the events. So please, don't watch a let's play of this game. Play it for yourself.","July 2, 2014","true","13.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/231200/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","Kentucky Route Zero is unlike any game I have played before, and so it is pretty hard to explain in terms of genres we are used to. It is definitely a point-and-click game, but it has very few puzzles and it never uses the pre-rendered static backgrounds that have been common in the genre since the 90s. The visual style is simple, but it is a sight to behold. It is amazing what the artist was able to do with flat shapes; shadows and contrast are used heavily to give the scenes depth, and the game actually looks gorgeous in 3D as well.\n\nSome of the scenes utilize angles very creatively to hide objects from you until you have done a bit of exploring. Of course this only works because the game has complete control of the camera the whole time.\n\nThe plot centers around a truck driver named Conway who works for an antique shop. He is trying to get to Dogwood Lane in order to make a delivery, but of course that turns out to be much more difficult than he originally anticipated. The gas station attendant that you meet at the beginning of the game tells Conway that he is going to have to take "the zero" and you spend the first act looking for Kentucky Route Zero.\n\nEveryone who gives you directions is pretty cryptic, and the landmarks they navigate by border on the surreal. Once you're on the road, you have a lot of freedom and there are more odd places to visit that have nothing to do with the plot of the game, but they add to the atmosphere nicely.\n\nI really liked the conversation system they use. You always get to choose what your character says, but I am pretty sure that the story line does not diverge based on that; the choices are purely to shape the character in your own mind.\n\nThe game sometimes switches the character that you are controlling. Most of the time you control Conway, but when they were introducing Shannon the scene played out from her perspective; Conway was simply marked as "Stranger." This gives the player the chance to decide what kind of person Shannon is before she joins the group.\n\nIf I have convinced you to buy the game, stop reading and go play it now. I'm going to start talking about Act II and I don't want to accidentally spoil anything.\n\n\nAt the end of Act I you find The Zero. There, I spoiled it. If you were hoping that finding The Zero was going to be Conway's big break, you'll be disappointed. The Zero is a strange circular highway underground with a very confusing navigational system. Depending on whether you are going clockwise or counterclockwise you will find different landmarks. If you turn around at a particular landmark, you will enter that landmark's layer and you will see different landmarks than before. It's easy to get lost, but don't worry- there is always a way out.\n\nAct II continues the outside-the-box storytelling. In one scene the narration and conversations are being related through people who witnessed the scene to a museum staff who is trying to figure out what Conway and Shannon were up to. I found it refreshing and quite delightful.\n\nNow seriously, if you are planning at all on playing this game stop reading now. I'm just going to straight-up tell you the craziest stuff that happens.\n\nMy favorite crazy moment was when I was trying to find a clerk who was supposedly on the fifth floor of an office building. I enter the elevator and see this:\n"(Conway scans a column of elevator buttons.)\nFifth floor. (Diagrams and drafts)\nFourth floor. (Archives and records)\nThird floor. (Bears)\nSecond floor. (Conference room)\nFirst floor. (Clerks' offices)\nLobby."\n\nNo, it couldn't possibly mean real bears. So I go to the third floor.\nOh. Bears. Bears that just sit there and watch me as I walk around.\n\nAnd then there was the time when we all went riding around on a giant eagle to find a hidden forest far away from the highway system.\n\nThe forest scenes were absolutely gorgeous, and some of the images are downright mind boggling. Look carefully at the eagle and the car.\n\nAct III:\n\nIt's been almost a year since Act II came out, with an interlude released in between. Normally I would be pretty miffed, but in this case I don't mind so much. The game is so strange, the waiting almost feels like a part of the experience. Speaking of the interludes, Act III is the first time that these have been clearly pulled into the main game. The Entertainment[kentuckyroutezero.com] was originally built as an Oculus Rift experiment where the player was a part of a theater performance; in Act III you visit the bar where this play was set and find a pair of expensive-looking goggles. Limits and Demonstrations[kentuckyroutezero.com] featured an interactive art installation; in Act III you meet a couple of people whose story was told in that art installation.\n\nMy favorite moment in Act III allows you to choose which lyrics are sung in a heart wrenching song.\n\nA lot of old technology has been featured in Kentucky Route Zero, usually tube televisions or transistor radios. Act III takes it in a computer science direction: a computer simulation called Xanadu has a large role; I am fairly confident that it is a reference to the vaporware Project Xanadu[en.wikipedia.org].\n\nAct III also hints at what may be in store for Conway after he completes this delivery run, and it isn't good. It isn't necessarily bad, it just has a vague sense of foreboding, which is a pretty good summary of the series as a whole.\n\nAct III certainly does not disappoint, so I definitely recommend that you go pick this game up. Definitely worth the $25 it costs.","June 8, 2013","true","9.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

This is truly an interactive story - beautifully woven narrative and some subtle and not-so-subtle imagery sprinkled throughout that makes you wonder what this story is really about. Do yourself a favor and go play it now.\n\nSide Note: Playing this game makes me wish I had better reading comprehension skills. It's something I've struggled with my whole life, but this game in particular makes me wish I could process prose more completely. I'm absolutely certain that there are subtleties in the writing that I'm missing, but that doesn't make the game any less enjoyable.","October 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

I was bugged by this reoccurring thought that, "Oh, this is just another in a recent string of indie games where everything is just... So Weird." The story was a little non linear and slow going, and it had to break through a lot of other minor annoyances in order for me to see the merit.  There is a lot of unskippable animation that really grinds (especially when one of the main characters is forced to walk around with a real time limp). It's as though one of the designers put their foot down because they didn't want any of the intricacy of their animations or level design to be missed.  And it is a beautiful game.  I was gradually won over, which is why I kept playing the game, but act three is where I really became a fan.

You won't see an inventory or puzzles, and the dialogue choices don't have consequences as such. The narrative moves at an uneven pace while keeping you interested. One second you might be controlling Conway but the next you're choosing dialogue option for the person he's talking to. The character you're controlling can be changed literally mid-stride, while two of them just running around. One scene can be told from a perspective of your main character and the next from the perspective of a guy he's seeing for the first time. I would say that is quite innovative for a game narrative.\n\nThis game is text-heavy with many dialogues and has beautiful eerie atmosphere. This weird atmosphere and shifting narrative reminds me a lot of David Lynch movies. That would certainly be the way to "gamify" his works. The game is divided into acts and scenes (out of five of which only three are currently released) and has a distinct theater play feel to it.\n\nWhile most of the playing time is running, clicking and dialogues, among the the odd activities you encounter here are a karaoke session, flying on a giant eagle and playing text adventure on an old oscilloscope.\n\nI would recommend playing this game if you're ready to read a lot and would like to experience gloomy atmosphere and surreal Lynch-esque story through rather experimental storytelling.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlagwerk/recommended/231200/","schlagwerk","Paparazzi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlagwerk/","211 products in account","Let's sweep away the indie circlejerk and pretentious flowery language: this is not a game.\n\nStay with me here, there's more to this.\n\nWhat we have is a product of an age where video games have become mainstream. Developers that tell a story, or show off cool graphics, or innovate with polished, unique, and engaging gameplay can all live happily together, because in the year of our Lord 1984 + 31 there is an audience for any and all three. And if you hit all the points, you'll have a mastery of the medium, a true classic for its time, worthy of every 10/10 "it didn't offend me" it can get.\n\nWhat you'll find is that not all can be skillful when it comes to "gameplay", or else discard the concept from the start. What is a game without gameplay? It's not a game.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is what you might call an "interactive storytelling experience" because there is just one (absolutely gorgeous) path without a single challenge or losing condition from start to finish. They say you only use 10% of your brain (and they are WRONG) but you'll only be using the parts that extrapolate out into infinity because the story is abstract and convoluted as ♥♥♥♥. Like they played Metroid Prime and ripped off its method wholesale, but decided it just wasn't cryptic enough. I liked Metroid Prime, mind you, but this comes back to the point I'm blabbing about for my share of internet points: it is not a game.\n\nA game involves the player in a challenge, a puzzle, something that puts bearing on the flashing lights presented before them. I have a whole bookshelf for the opposite, and if I wanted the sweet visuals and soundtrack too, there's always LSD and a Boards of Canada album. I played each act over a few weekends with the lights off and headphones on, just getting absorbed in the storytelling without having to break federal law. It demands some days of padding, because it's not a game you would want to kill in a day. There is probably less than 10 hours of runtime (as of this writing) to KRZ, and that's a generous estimate - the replay value is virtually nil, but maybe that's the point. It's firmly an "experience" but clicking back and forth to read more dialogue is not "interactive". It is a movie that pauses itself every time something cool happens.\n\nLet's wrap it all up here: I like KRZ and for $5, it was worth the dosh. It really is stunning once you adjust your expectations, but I know that not all of us are ready to do that when the word "game" is at the top of the page and "$24.99" somewhere below. Spend your disposable income on it, but know that what you're getting in return is disposable as well.","February 15, 2015","true","3.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The designers have clearly put a lot of love into this setting and story.  It is an interesting read; sort of a mix of Steinbeck, Douglas Adams, and maybe a little William Gibson.  It feels like Oh Brother Where Art Thou meets Lost.  The graphics and music are gorgeous, if not exactly cutting edge, and all in all the experience is enjoyable, if a little slow.\n\nUnfortunately, Kentucky Route Zero's interactivity is minimal at best.  The player is badgered for input at every turn but it is all conversational and does not seem to affect the order or occurrence of events.  I'm reminded of Roger Ebert's assertion that video games are not art because they change based on the player's actions.  I think that if Ebert played Kentucky Route Zero he might consider it art.\n\nThat said, it does seem like multiple playthroughs involving different choices might allow the player to learn more and different things about the mysterious characters, but I do not find the story so exciting or the characters so intriguing that I am chomping at the bit to engage the plodding point-and-click interface for a repeat performance.  For what it is worth, I am also not the sort of person who reads books more than once.\n\nWhat disappointed me the most is the wasted potential the concept had for exploration -- although the early part of the game takes place in a more or less open map of central southern Kentucky around Route 65, the eponymous underground highway, Route 0,  is literally a single beltway that the characters navigate only by making u-turns at landmarks.\n\nThese landmarks are not themselves destinations, but rather visual cues with the single purpose of telling the player where to turn around.  The visual cues are unusual and thought-provoking, but I found myself wishing they were all more like "The Maw," with jagged stalactites and stalagmites reaching out of the darkness to appear to consume Conway's truck, and less like "The Television," which was just a... well, a giant television.  Floating in space.\n\nI definitely enjoyed Kentucky Route Zero, and I look forward to the release of the final two acts.  It just wasn't the game I thought it would be, and the disconnect was sharp enough that I want to pass on the warning.  I find caves fascinating; I really feel like the designers could have done more to make the spelunking aspect of the Zero more compelling.  Instead, Route 0 is just a contemporary Kentuckian faerie land with a convenient and tangential link to the region's limestone karst geography.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm not saying don't buy this program.  Just know what you're buying before you buy it.  It is an interesting, well written story with a well plotted but linear arc.  While not as blatantly click-through as some visual novels I have "played," it is no adventure game.  There is no thrill of achievement here, no risk of failure, and the sense of discovery is the same you would receive from a good novel.  The tale progresses at its pace; do not look to direct it rather than be led through it.","December 7, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's creating an overwhelming feeling of melancholy fueled by the consequences of capitalism, regrets, the loneliness of the road, getting old, a brilliant bluegrass/sythie-soundtrack and a million other things.\nWith the exxeption of the games by "The Chinese Room", Kentucky Route Zero is also probably the only game I've ever played that is actually deeply concerned about the quality of its prose and dialogue.

I started playing it just to get a feel of what it was like and actually couldn't stop until there was nothing left at the end of Act III.\nThe story has a "familiar, but strange", kind-of-creepy-and-mysterious atmosphere to it - like the "this makes sense, of course it should be like this" logic of dreaming that actually makes less sense over time but gets more intriging; like a nostalgic mystery from your childhood you can't recall nor explain with words completely, and that warm but murky feeling still lingers.\nI'm a sucker for the character-driven kind of narrative, and this game does it in a brilliant way. The dialogs are amazingly well written, it has a lot of great references, the soundtrack is beautiful and it's visually stunning at every little detail. The gameplay is like a homage to those old point-and-click adventures we hold dear in our hearts, but with a nice, refreshing twist.\nAlso features bears on the third floor.\nJaw-dropping.

For one, I'm a sucker for beautiful visuals and ambience, which is exactly what this game delivers. It is, on the surface, a simple point-and-click adventure in which you navigate from one set piece to another. But that is where the writing of the game comes in, and why I fell head-over-heels for this game. As with so many popular titles these days, the story leans more towards ambiguity and 'draw your own conclusion' than straightforward storytelling; the game manages to create a visually-captivating world that is similar yet very different from our own, but I never felt like I was simply going from one batch of symbolism to the next. I didn't always quite understand all the events in the game, but before long I was immersed in the world and deeply attached to these characters, of whom I felt we knew so much with only a few words.\n\nThat brings me to another awesome point to the game which, for personal reasons, is so important to me. One of the two main characters of the game, whom you alternate in controlling, is a hispanic woman. I know that seems like a silly detail, but think about it: what other game character, much less protagonist, can you name that fits that description? Yet the game never felt heavy-handed or like it was trying to shove things in your face, going "See? See? Isn't this thing we did here awesome? Aren't we awesome for doing it?" All of the things it does right (of which there are many) are subtle details, inter-woven into the story in a way that just serves to enhance the entire experience.\n\nPlus, you get to make choices. Not big, world-changing moral choices, ala Fable series. More along the line of what Telltale Games have been doing: little choices in action and dialogue, things that truly make you feel as if you're in control of the character. If you consider yourself someone who enjoys narratives, want a unique and interesting experience, or are just looking to pass the time with something engaging, then I highly recommend this game. Hell, I recommend it even if you don't fall into any of those categories!

The tone of the setting is great; the game really feels like it perfectly captures the spirit of the southern US state, or at least it feels like a brilliant representation to me, from the UK, making me wistful for time in the country.\n\nThe art style is also beautiful, eschewing photo-realism, or even a conventional cartoon art, instead using smooth and vivid cel-shaded art to create wonderful set pieces, which often are revealed to be on a grand scale as the camera zooms out.\n\nWhilst the gameplay is broadly linear, every conversation utilises branching dialogue trees making conversations much mmore interesting as you have to make decisions on what you actually want to hear and find out about. Whilst you can also just follow the story and go directly to each location you are meant to go, I'd recommend taking the time to explore the whole map in between scenes, as the developers have hidden many extra locations and layers to the narrative which enrich the atmosphere even more.\n\nIf you don't like reading much then you probably won't find this game interesting, but if you appreciate rich storytelling you will probably find this game, coupled with its gorgeous art and music, to be one of the most emotionally engaging games you've played in a long time. Highly recommended.","May 31, 2013","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere, aesthetic, and storyline is absolutely engrossing and fascinating. Fans of point-and-click adventure and magical realism works like Twin Peaks will find a distinct pleasure in this game.\n\nIn greater detail, Kentucky Route Zero is a beautiful work that plays out in literary fashion, with chapters forming Acts that are released episodically. The mood of the game gracefully floats through moments of quiet beauty (a gas station at dusk), chilling dread (an abandoned mineshaft), and abstract humor (animals where they shouldn't be). Throughout the game, you're given choices in how a character will respond to something, though often times it feels as though the game is asking these questions directly to the player, with the character simply being a medium. The questions are like Rorschach tests, asking you to find a piece of yourself in the obscurity before you. The effect of this is a feeling that the story is starting to belong to you, and you may even contemplate the spiritual and existential thoughts presented in relation to your own life.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, so long as you can enjoy point-and-click games, you'll be right at home with the way Kentucky Route Zero. For those who are fans of good story, but more compelling gameplay, you may find yourself bored with it's simplicity, but that's the nature of this kind of beast. The game isn't concerned with challenging your ability to solve puzzles or press buttons quickly and correctly, it's here to tell a story, and so the gameplay is there enough to guide you along.\n\nAesthetically, both the UI and art style of this game are downright sublime. The world map and UI are minimalist and perfectly fitted to the game's spooky mood. I found myself frequently capturing screenshots of different scenes before me, followed by appreciating and figuring out what I'm looking at. The game takes place in the dead of night, conjuring up feelings one may get when driving down a dark, unfamiliar road with desolate gas stations and old houses illuminated by an amber glow of a single streetlight. Everything looks spooky and forboding, but you never feel threatened by an ominous presence, you simply feel in the midst of mystery and the supernatural.\n\nIf I had to criticize the game for any particular thing, it's that after you've purchased the game and played through the available acts, Acts One and Two, you're left wanting for a continuation for Act Three, but the developers have been fairly mum about when it'll ever release, so your experience will be left feeling incomplete along with everyone else still waiting. That said, Kentucky Route Zero in it's current form is still worth experiencing, and if you have anyone that have or would play it, you'll have plenty to discuss and appreciate even with it being as short as it currently is.\n\nOnce again, if you enjoy games that are focused almost entirely on story and atmosphere, and you enjoy stories and atmospheres that are spooky, existential, abstract, and deep, you will enjoy this game. It has certainly left an impression on me.","March 17, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm glad it wasn't longer, because I was exhausted by the end.\n\nNote: The second episode was released around May, and while there's been a related little thing released recently, there's no sign of the third part.

Jeep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/555-555-1247/","129 products in account","Kentucky Route Zero\n\nA Game In Five Acts\n\nBy Cardboard Computer\n\nKentucky Route Zero is a magical-realist (I know, weird) point-and-click adventure game set along the mysterious, lost highway of KY 0, the caves it is paved in, and the river, Echo, it runs along.\n\nIn the beginning, there's a horse-head. Yeah. Conway walks onto the stage. He will be the player's main character to choose for, though other people will join him along the way. Conway is looking for a 5 Dogwood Drive, somewhere along I-65 near Bowling Green, Kentucky, near the Tennessee border. After a tip from a blind gas station attendant, Joseph, Conway is sent down the interstate to find a "big, ugly tree that's always on fire."\n\nFrom there, the story erupts into a strange bath of folk music, hoarse coughing, clinking bottles, static, robotic punk bikers, XANADU, regret, debt, and horses. Lots of horses.\n\nSound strange enough?\n\nOK, so here's a little less of a poetic, rambling view, and a more practical one, focusing on the gameplay, visuals, and sound.\n\nIt's point-and-click, built in Unity, with a minimalist menu style and click-the-option progression in speech. The world is presented two-dimensionally, though it all exists in a three-D scape, which is revealed at times to create stunning sights or just to rip a mind apart.\n\nThe graphics are minimalist. Nobody has a defined face. The characters are more defined by words than looks, though each is significantly different in posture, height, and attire. Conway is tall and grey, with a brown jacket, whereas Shannon is short and brown, with a bright-blue shirt. The other art, like backgrounds and similar, is painted in a very geometric, yet lively way. Screenshots can do more justice.\n\nThe sound design is absolutely amazing, though I'm biased on the bluegrass music, as I grew up with old people from the Appalachian Tennessee. There's synthetic, ambient music in scenes to emphasize a feeling, and compliment the false-2D world, like in the trailer video. Small, consequential effects are implemented well, with car sounds while driving I-65 and soft tube-sound while browsing XANADU. The bluegrass is gorgeous, with the game developers contributing freshly-recorded songs from the 20th century at climactic times. Sad songs during a time of pain, asking songs during tense moments.\n\nNow, the elephant in the room.\n\nKRZ is incomplete by April 2015. There are five acts, yet by now only three are released. This isn't to say the game isn't being worked on, but that it is harder on Cardboard Computer than expected. Proof of continued development is a recent patch to add gamepad support, so boldly plastered there over the Act 3 promo as of... now. Also, free minisodes are released on kentuckyroutezero.com between acts, so those are good to grab if playing or if you want a taste before you decide to buy.\n\nTL;DR\n\nWell, if you're into experimental, easy-paced but strangely thrilling folk wandering... things, buy Kentucky Route Zero. It's art work, and a fun game to explore and find the secrets. If you're patient and thoughtful, you might pull a meaning out. If not, you atleast could spot some references to real-life events, or appreciate the unique stage-like style to the game.\n\nI recommend Kentucky Route Zero, from the bottom of my heart. It means so much more to me than just a game.","January 1, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's different in a manner that continues to mystify you as you delve through its beautiful, lonely aesthetics; carrying on your simple journey through a night that perpetuates your solitude.\nKRZ is a story that won't appeal to the conventional gamer or even the typical indie game fan. It requires an emotional aptitude to appreciate the environment that Cardboard Computer have brilliantly crafted. You won't find yourself loading up KRZ with an attitude of immediate adventure or conquest, for there is no regular high-riding emotion within the confines of Kentucky Route Zero's acts (currently waiting for Act IV). But, this is not needed. You find yourself immersed in the surroundings deeply, carrying the central character's journey truly as your own. The low mood of KRZ allows its emotive sections to soar effortlessly and truly touch you in a meaningful way that only builds into how brilliant the game is. All that exists within Kentucky Route Zero's ethereal confines solidifies its elegance in striking you with absurdity, loneliness, yearning and a great sense of understanding that very few games achieve, yet alone aim for.\nKentucky Route Zero isn't necessarily something that everyone will appreciate.

It's different in a manner that continues to mystify you as you delve through its beautiful, lonely aesthetics; carrying on your simple journey through a night that perpetuates your solitude.\nKRZ is a story that won't appeal to the conventional gamer or even the typical indie game fan. It requires an emotional aptitude to appreciate the environment that Cardboard Computer have brilliantly crafted. You won't find yourself loading up KRZ with an attitude of immediate adventure or conquest, for there is no regular high-riding emotion within the confines of Kentucky Route Zero's acts (currently waiting for Act IV). But, this is not needed. You find yourself immersed in the surroundings deeply, carrying the central character's journey truly as your own. The low mood of KRZ allows its emotive sections to soar effortlessly and truly touch you in a meaningful way that only builds into how brilliant the game is. All that exists within Kentucky Route Zero's ethereal confines solidifies its elegance in striking you with absurdity, loneliness, yearning and a great sense of understanding that very few games achieve, yet alone aim for.\nKentucky Route Zero isn't necessarily something that everyone will appreciate. It is a game meant for the early hours of the morning: to explore a world of night, where there is no fear, but a strange longing for the unknown and to explore its mystery. To finish what you have to do and conclude, to reconcile with yourself somewhere upon a long journey home that is Kentucky Route Zero.","December 31, 2013","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cardboard Computer have justified its price tag with this Act alone; when all five are released, this will be an essential purchase.","June 28, 2014","true","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And I couldn't be happier that I did.  Ugh this game is just so good!  I would even argue that it's perfect.  It has everything I love, and if it's not my favorite game of all time it's pretty damn close.\n\nSo here's the thing: I absolutely love my pretentious/artsy games.  Vanishing of Ethan Carter?  Hell yeah.  The Stanley Parable?  Obviously.  Limbo?  Grow Home?  Flower?  Journey?  Check, check, check, and check.  I think you get the picture.  I want games that give you this greater sense of depth, this feeling as if there is something big, something important behind what you're experiencing that you just can't quite grasp, and Kentucky Route Zero pulls that off perfectly.  Does this game's story make sense?  Not really, and yet in a way it still does.  As you get further into the game and more deeply immersed into the world, it all starts to feel as if while you don't have all the pieces necessary to solve the puzzle you're still not too far behind, and if you pay close enough attention you'll start to make some really interesting connections and have some really awesome moments of clarity.\n\nOn top of that, Kentucky Route Zero has some of the best dialogue I've ever seen in a game.  There's no voice acting so you'd better get your reading glasses but believe me, it's worth it.  Not only is it insanely well written but what makes the dialogue in the game all the more incredible is how you can interact with it.  For instance, you can have perspective changes where suddenly you're participating in a conversation as a different person than you were before.  On top of this, you often get dialogue options that essentially give you multiple ways to respond that will actually shape the past.  For instance, you have a decision right at the start where a guy asks what your dog's name is.  The way you respond actually determines what the dog will be called for the rest of the game, and while that may not seem too significant, I still found it to be super cool.  Later on, there are some moments where these decisions do seem to be slightly more significant as well, I'm definitely not gonna spoil those though.  All of this excellent writing does wonders to build this incredibly beautiful, strange world of magical realism that I've quickly fallen in love with and found myself wanting more of.\n\nOf course, that brings me to an unfortunate point:  This game will be composed of 5 acts, of which only 3 are currently out.  I've looked at the history of their releases and it took about a year for Act 3 to come out.  It's been almost a year since then with no Act 4 in sight, but it seems very likely that it will come out soon based on that time frame.  The amount of love and work that went into Act 3 was so evident that I have nothing but the highest hopes for Act 4, there's no doubt in my mind that it will be absolutely mind blowing.  In the meantime, I'm probably gonna have to replay the first three acts once or twice because I just can't wait to dive back into this world and see what else I can find!\n\nHappy trucking on the Zero.","April 17, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

I feel like there's a lot symbolism I'm missing or hasn't been made clear. There's themes of purgatory or moving on or death, but three episodes in, it's still not 100% clear. What's the Zero? Who are the characters? What's going on? This confusion is broken occasionally by wonderful gems like Too Late To Love You Now, but it feels like those are the exceptions, not the rule. The developers have also been way too slow to deliver new episodes. They are now at least three months late, and I don't see a clear post explaining why. Probably worth it 75% off but not otherwise.

That being said, I feel like I'm experiencing the slow development of what might be one of my favorite games of all time when its over. If you're interested in narrative, downright brilliant uses of sound, or horses then you should pick this up.","June 24, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A lot of the decisions you make are superficial but are meant to express how you're responding to the experience. It's a little but art-y and really beautiful.\n\nI don't think I'm doing it justice.

For the most part, it succeeds. Dripping with rich dialogue and gorgeous atmosphere, Kentucky Route Zero peers into the life and past of Conway, a down-on-his-luck deliveryman, as well as a cast of other strange folks driving the less traveled ‘Route Zero’. Conversation options are creative, often giving control instead to whomever Conway is talking to.  After most scenes, you return to a roadmap where you can drive around freely. There is no marker on where to go outside of directions gleaned from dialogue. KRZ does not contain any ‘action’ outside of narrative choices and the driving sections. Where KRZ shines is its unforgettable imagery and its strangely relatable cast.\n\nIf you are not a fan of ‘art games’ or tons of unspoken dialogue in your games (which is the crowd KRZ is catering to), you probably won’t enjoy this one. For everyone else, KRZ really is a must-buy… if you can find it on sale. The price has not fallen much since it's release.","August 25, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

I know that sounds like utter hyperbole, especially when people call tripe like Bioshock Infinite the Citizen Kane of games unironically, but its not, KRZ is amazing to an almost baffling degree for a video game. KRZ is an adventure game focused on exploration and character development, the main crux of the gameplay is exploring the Kentucky backroads and the enigmatic Route Zero and having a hand in shaping the cast's personalites and pasts along their journey.\n\nA melacholic sense of loss and slow decline just permeates throughout the game.The graphics are minimalistic but beautiful and really adds to this lonely and mysterious atmopshere. The level design  and how its all framed is also great and it can get quite unique, showing the game world in different and interesting ways. The game's fantastic soundtrack also really adds to the atmosphere and  it is used to great effect making for some really memorable scenes. KRZ's writing puts every other video game to shame and it has a creativity and skill that most games lack. The characters are also quite likable and you want to see their journey through. Overall KRZ just sucks you right in and really feels like you're on an adventure into the unknown.\n\nEpisodes have been slow going but its been totally worth it. Wait if you want to, but if you buy it now you will not be disappointed. KRZ is just a great example of what video games can do with storytelling and really needs more love.","August 29, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is gorgeous and elegant, the characters are endearing and unique, and the incidental moments of folk tunes that slowly build in your speakers at unexpected moments give the game a haunting beauty.  The story is very mysterious and endlessly fascinating.  I cannot wait to see where this goes.\n\nUpdate: Having played all the episodes currently available (up to Episode Three), all I can add to what I said before is that the game continues to deepen into one of the most intriguing and original pieces of electronic art I've ever played.

It's too late now to play further, but I'm eager to play more.\n\nSomeone in the reviews said that if David Lynch would make a game, this would be it. I absolutely agree. The atmosphere is eerie, a little tense (in a calm, surreal way) but overall very ambient. The dialogues are beautifully poetic and metaphorical and makes you feel...something. I can't explain, just like when you would watch the mini-series 'Rabbits' by David Lynch (or the movie 'Inland Empire', if you are not familiar with that one). To me it feels like the ultimate form of self-therapy and the most beautiful kind of art.\n\nYes, this game is art. From the few places that pop up when you are driving down an old road and find an even older building, where, down a dark hallway, you find a group of people sitting around a campfire and a lady comes up to you and gives you a coffee. It doesn't mean much, but it gives a somewhat melancholical feeling, in a good way of course.\n\nOf all the little indie games that are out there to be found, this one won my heart over the fastest. And I'm not even half way there yet.

If neither of those apply, Kentuck Route Zero is probably up your alley.\n\nThe sound design and graphics are spare but expertly used. The game leans heavily on swathes of color and ambient sound to pull you in, and I feel like that works really well (as a side note, the soundtrack is included with the game, so that's a plus). The whole thing has a very dreamy quality to it, though as a lifelong resident of the southeastern US, I can't say as it bears much resemblance to real life Kentucky. But that's okay. The Kentucky of Kentucky Route Zero is a strange almost-character that feels very much alive as you guide Conway through it.\n\nI'm eagerly awaiting the next chapter.","February 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I just can't recommend it because it's boring and I have no idea what's going on.\n\nIt just feels a bit weird for the sake of weird. Everything is disconnected. It's slow. I played the first three chapters in something like 7 sessions because I couldn't get through 30 minutes of it without starting to feel my eyelids droop. "Time for bed, I suppose" I would say out loud (I live alone), and then I would realize it's only 9:30PM. I swear this happened at least 3 times.\n\nThe writing is really good, actually. That's what's so dissapointing really. It's just really well written sentences and sentence fragments that don't tell you a whole lot, they just sound like a smart person wrote them. Lots of little vignettes that I haven't been able to put together.\n\nThe sound is very well done too. I like the songs, I might actually purchase the soundtrack.\n\nThe Zero itself was a huge let down. I get it, it's this mysterous highway and we're supposed to use our imagination on what it looks like. I wanted it to look like Homer Simpsons fever dream when he ate the insanity pepper.

It's too late now to play further, but I'm eager to play more.\n\nSomeone in the reviews said that if David Lynch would make a game, this would be it. I absolutely agree. The atmosphere is eerie, a little tense (in a calm, surreal way) but overall very ambient. The dialogues are beautifully poetic and metaphorical and makes you feel...something. I can't explain, just like when you would watch the mini-series 'Rabbits' by David Lynch (or the movie 'Inland Empire', if you are not familiar with that one). To me it feels like the ultimate form of self-therapy and the most beautiful kind of art.\n\nYes, this game is art. From the few places that pop up when you are driving down an old road and find an even older building, where, down a dark hallway, you find a group of people sitting around a campfire and a lady comes up to you and gives you a coffee. It doesn't mean much, but it gives a somewhat melancholical feeling, in a good way of course.\n\nOf all the little indie games that are out there to be found, this one won my heart over the fastest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vskjefst/recommended/231200/","vskjefst","vegard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vskjefst/","265 products in account","*Updated for Act III, see bottom of the review*\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an indie episodic point and click adventure game, developed and published by Cardboard Computer. Revealed on Kickstarter back in 2011, the developer had to reach a goal of USD 6,500, but managed to raise USD 8,583. Kentucky Route Zero was planned for release in late 2011, but as with every single game development project ever, that never happened and eventually the game was instead split into 5 episodes with the first one released in January 2013 and the second in May.\n\nThe game’s story revolves around a secret highway in Kentucky and the mysterious folks who travel it. The player controls Conway, an antique furniture deliveryman, as he attempts to complete the final delivery for his financially troubled employer. Along the way he’ll meet dozens of strange characters and make a few new friends to help him overcome the obstacles in his path. Gameplay in Kentucky Route Zero is slow-paced, focusing on exploring new environments and talking with new people. Thankfully, “slow” doesn’t equal “boring”. The story is very well written, and although the player seems to have no way of affecting the outcome at all, it’s a pleasure to discover everything along the way.\n\nThe game has a simply, yet beautiful art style. Background and scene transitions are often brilliantly done, and it’s a shame not all the locations are visualized: Some of them are only described in text on the map screen. I’ve got a feeling the game could have been so much better with every location drawn in the Kentucky Route Zero style, even locations that are not responsible for driving the story forward. And driving is a key word in Kentucky Route Zero. You do spend some time “driving” around on the game map, making it a little disappointing when you reach a new location and it’s simply just described to you textually.\n\nThe music in the game is, like the visuals, great, but it suffers from the same problem: It’s just not enough music. Also, it’s a soundtrack that works very well with the game, but it’s not a soundtrack you’ll sit down and listen to, like the Machinarium soundtrack. The sound design, too, is a curious piece. I played the game with headphones on and it has serious volume problems at times, with some sound effects almost drowning out other sounds in a scene. This could of course be intentional, but I doubt it.\n\nThe replayability isn’t much to talk about. There are a lot of nice surprises, twists and turns the first time you play through, but since it’s hard to surprise the player twice when telling exactly the same story, Kentucky Route Zero is a game most people will play only once. And this brings us on the the subject of game cost. The game retails at a massive $24.99, which is rather pricy for this game. Yes, you will get 5 acts for that price, but I’ve already played through the first two acts and spent around two hours doing that. If we can use that as a pointer, you’ll get 5, maybe 6, hours of gameplay for $24.99, which isn’t impressive. It should be mentioned that you also get the soundtrack and a “private newsletter” included, but even though the soundtrack is very good, it does not justify the price. To put it in a way the internet generation understands: The price of this game is too damn high!\n\nKentucky Route Zero is not a bad game, far from it. But I’ve got a feeling it could have been so much better. Just a little more music and a few more visualized locations would have made wonders. Cardboard Computer has promised to release three more episodes, and unless they decide to pull a Valve on us all, those remaining episodes might very well change my overall impression of the game – for better or for worse. If that happens, I’ll come back here and let you know.\n\nAt the current price and with only two episodes released, I would not recommend Kentucky Route Zero, unless you are a die hard point-and-click adventure fan.\n\n*Update for Act III*\nCardboard computer finally managed to release the third act (still out of five acts) of KRZ. I know this goes against popular opinion, but even with this third act, I can't recommend the game at the current price. Act III adds roughly 2 more hours of gameplay, and while it's a beautiful audiovisual experience that will tickle your brain where it fees good, I don't feel that I get my money's worth.\n\nWait for all five acts to be released, THEN go ahead and throw your money at Cardboard Computer. At the current release pace, this will be some time in 2016.\n\nThis review is also available on http://www.vegard.net/.","January 12, 2014","false","5.4"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

It's art. However, art comes in a lot of varieties... and you'll hate it if you don't have the proper mindset. This is one of those games where the gamers who are tired of the same old same old hold up as an example of "look, video games can be so much MOOOARR!!0eleventy11!!" Kinda' like when your pretentious friend invites you to eat at some artsy restaurant, and you order and the food tastes meh bordering on WTF because your food palette really wanted a non-subtle burger and fries, but you got some kind of truffle pate in a soufle or somesuch.\n\nSince mindset is everything for this game, let me describe what you need.\n1] you need time and patience. you can't rush this.\n2] you need to have an open mind and keep clicking. yes. suspend disbelief with that wtf moment. keep clicking.\n3] you need to be inquisitive enough to wonder what happens next, even if you're confused.\n\nI really can't recommend this game at this price. Right now, I'm feeling like I want 3 hours of my life back... you're buying an experience... an experience I'd liken to getting a major second-hand high from a bunch of dudes filling the room with the Light of Jah.","September 7, 2014","false","3.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

I don't have nearly as much time to play games as I used to so a purchase and commitment like this is somewhat a big deal to me and as such I researched this fairly heavily before jumping in.  I have to say, I regret it.   People talk about the great writing, but I think it's more non-sensical, abstract dialogue rather than something meaningful.  It's sort of like back in college when you'd sit around with your friends on a Friday night in a chemical-induced haze and say things like "But doesn't *everything* matter?  I mean *matters*!" and you'd all think that you guys were speaking brilliantly about life.  People will talk about the story and what not, but even that is so muddled.  At the start, it seems like it's going to be a ghost story but Act III almost devolves into some sort of corporate dystopian theme and it's not a good direction.  Even the music scene that people rave about is nothing special.  I was expecting a big setup but it's really just a meaningless musical number in the middle of the game.  There have been some great games with great writing, great story, great dialog, and even great music.  This game attempts to be all that but in the end is just pretentious at best and a waste of time at worst.  That said, I see value in this type of "game" -- that is, the game that's more of an interactive novel rather than the traditional puzzle-solving quest.  However, there's a way around that -- just buy a better adventure game and play it using the walkthrough.  It is guaranteed to be a better experience.","July 31, 2015","false","7.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","7","15","3","0"

The format in which I am going to review this product will be with the individual episode, and then, when the final episode is released, a sum-up/TL;DR will be at the bottom.\n\nEpisode 1\nThe first episode sets an incredible standard for the rest of the series to follow, as it sets the stage of an incredibly visceral and surreal saga with awe-inspiring beauty, in even the most subtle of ways. It introduces the player to set characters, as well as the main system of the game, basically being able to write your own character's story and character development, leading to a huge amount of dialogue. Out of the three currently released, this one is most likely my favourite, as it's when the game is still slightly odd (Constantly burning trees, ghosts, .etc) without stepping into the territory of batshit insane.\n\nEpisode 2\nThe second episode allows for the backstory of the already presented characters to come to light, as well as what exactly The Zero is, its relevance to the surrounding characters, and its use. One of the greatest experiences in a game I've ever had the immense pleasure of enjoying was exploring the Zero, all of its nooks, crannies and locations.\n\nEpisode 3\nThe third episode introduces colourful and enjoyable characters into the game, as well as some of the most atmospheric computer segments in a game ever. This was most likely my least favourite of the episodes so far, but I still enjoyed it far more than other adventure games that came out this year (Life is Strange).\n(TL;DR before Episode 4: Would I reccommend this game in it's current state? Only if it was to somebody that greatly enjoyed a story intense and immersion based experience.)\n\nBut in order to enjoy this game it's true atmospheric glory, I would suggest playing the game with someone in the room, in order to converse the significance of events in the game and characters. After grabbing that person, turn your lights off, close your blinds and explore The Zero.","December 31, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But what a film!  The surreal and ever-mutable "script" reminds one of Charlie Kaufman and Neil Gaiman works without being an obvious ripoff.  And the vector animation is brilliant, hearkening back to the old sega genesis classic Flashback, but far beyond it in execution.  The scenes show unprecedented depth and the ambient soundtrack and fx are outstanding.  It's the little things, like watching an office floor full of bears head-track your every movement, the fluid shifting of perspectives from character to character, or the subtle shimmer of every appearance of the word Zero on the screen that make this title just so damn interesting.\n\nIf you're looking for straightforward action/strategy/puzzles/etc, this title is probably not for you.  On the surface, it's perhaps easy to overlook the the unspoken details of this experience - it's very light on exposition.  But if you enjoy reading, indie films, and video games as I do, there's a really rewarding experience waiting for you.  Let your brain be engaged in the story, and trust me, you'll love it.","September 26, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I didn't notice that what I bought was a "season pass" and not a full game until well after I'd finished playing as much as I could. I honestly loved the game. Its narrative was touching. The music still sticks with me. The game was like a work of art. So I personally did not mind that the game was unfinished. However, the enterence fee is a bit hefty. So: If this is going to be one of the few games in your library, do not buy it. It is a bit of a one-hit-wonder. It doesn't have a lot of replay value, at least not to me. The beauty (or downfall, in some cases) of this game is in the way it tells the narrative. You cannot backtrack on your dialogue choices, and some choices are relatively similar. This gives the whole adventure this feel of permanence. If I were to replay the game, I feel like it would almost water down my first experience. It's almost like a book or movie. I have to wait a while to replay it, otherwise it won't be great.\n\nBut with the lack of replay value, the long wait for scenes, etc, is this game any good? Yes. The craftmenship of this game is amazing. It has a lot of moments that captured me. There's this one scene I remember getting particularly entranced in, this moment in a bar where the visuals and audio worked together to recreate the feeling of music. There is a lot of love that goes into this game. It is unlike any other that I have played before. It's strange, but awesome. I guess captivating is the best word to describe this game as a whole. It is definitely a labor of love; you can really tell that the developers put their all into making this game. It's worth playing at least once. Try to shoot for a sale price if you're concerned about the longetivity of the game. This is a game that lasts longer in memory than in playtime.","January 3","true","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I put off reviewing it for so long because it's such an odd game and I didn't know what to say about it. Anyway, the point is that I am going off of my faulty memory.\n\nI liked this game but it's not for everyone. It's really hard to pin down. It plays like the graphical adventure games of olden days--King's Quest, Police Quest, Space Quest, etc. except you don't really collect items in an inventory, neither do you really solve any puzzles. It almost feels like a surreal text adventure populated with quirky characters but with some impressionistic graphics and haunting music to go along with it. It's like a game that Sierra On-Line would have made back in the day, if David Lynch and William Faulkner had worked there.\n\nThe game feels more like a tone poem. It's eerie at times, but not scary. It can be hauntingly beautiful at times, leaving you feeling melancholy. Sometimes it can be weirdly comical. As I said before, you don't really solve any major puzzles and you only occasionally feel like you are pursuing any sort of goal or are part of any story that is advancing toward any kind of resolution. You sort of go along for the ride and you do have decisions to make, but those are mostly just selecting dialog. The gameplay, what little there is, feels like mostly just adding some subtle nuance to the way the characters interact with each other.\n\nLooking back over what I wrote, it can seem like I am being negative about the game, but I can say that it was a very unique experience and I thought that the presentation, however odd, was enjoyable. If you want to try something really different, I suggest you give this game a shot when it goes on sale.","June 17, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is developed by Cardboard Computer, and there is a computer made of cardboard in it. Actually, the game may really be made of painted bits of cardboard cut into interesting shapes. I do not know, but what I do know is that this game is quite decent.\nYou start off the story with an elderly fellow named Conway, who is delivering a package in his truck to someone located on Dogwood Drive. To get there, he is told, he must find a way to [wobbly, smoky lettering]The Zero[/wobbly, smoky lettering] in order to get there. What follows is what happens in his pursuit of this location.\n\nI feel I ought to address the issue of the acts, as they stand currently this fine January afternoon in 2016. There are at this time three of five promised acts, and the development of the remaining two acts has been pushed back to an indefinite time. Act IV is purportedly imminent, but the exact timing is still undefined.\n\nIt is some folks' opinion that you should wait until the game is completely and totally finished before you bother with the first three acts, as the developers are totally attempting to scam us all by falsely advertising a five-act game while only delivering three.\n\nIt is my opinion that if those are your thoughts in this debate, you ought not be playing this game, as I am reasonably certain it simpy is not your sort of game. Having played through the first three acts, I do not feel particularly stiffed in not having the last two yet. I have backed projects on Kickstarter, for goodness sakes, and if that has taught me anything it is that a rushed project will yield nothing but misery. Certainly, this is a long night, out on the road, but isn't that kind of the point of the game?","January 9","true","7.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played this on my laptop for an hour or so but I just found the game strange. I returned to the game again after a month or so and something finally clicked.\n\nThis is not a game in the traditional sense, but more of a psychedelic interactive novella. The gameplay, if you can call it that, consists of travelling around a bizarre world and encountering strange characters and events as well as choosing dialogue options (sometimes for multiple characters at once!).\n\nTo best be able to appreciate this game I think that you need\n* to play with a controller\n* to play on a big screen or TV. While they graphics may seem primitive there is a lot of detail in the surroundings, especially from Act 2 onwards.\n* decent sound. The sound design in this game is great, but on laptop speakers it is terrible :P\n\nIf you like games in the style of "Dear Esther" and "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" but want a more dialogue-driven alternative, this might be something for you. If you want a traditional point 'n click adventure with puzzles, this will probably not be your cup of tea.\n\nBeware though that the release rate of the 5 acts in the game has slowed down by a lot (act 3 was released 2 years ago).","January 12","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I didn't notice that what I bought was a "season pass" and not a full game until well after I'd finished playing as much as I could. I honestly loved the game. Its narrative was touching. The music still sticks with me. The game was like a work of art. So I personally did not mind that the game was unfinished. However, the enterence fee is a bit hefty. So: If this is going to be one of the few games in your library, do not buy it. It is a bit of a one-hit-wonder. It doesn't have a lot of replay value, at least not to me. The beauty (or downfall, in some cases) of this game is in the way it tells the narrative. You cannot backtrack on your dialogue choices, and some choices are relatively similar. This gives the whole adventure this feel of permanence. If I were to replay the game, I feel like it would almost water down my first experience. It's almost like a book or movie. I have to wait a while to replay it, otherwise it won't be great.\n\nBut with the lack of replay value, the long wait for scenes, etc, is this game any good? Yes. The craftmenship of this game is amazing. It has a lot of moments that captured me. There's this one scene I remember getting particularly entranced in, this moment in a bar where the visuals and audio worked together to recreate the feeling of music. There is a lot of love that goes into this game. It is unlike any other that I have played before. It's strange, but awesome. I guess captivating is the best word to describe this game as a whole. It is definitely a labor of love; you can really tell that the developers put their all into making this game. It's worth playing at least once. Try to shoot for a sale price if you're concerned about the longetivity of the game. This is a game that lasts longer in memory than in playtime.","January 3","true","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The way the game mixes its story telling and perspective is really unusual and something only a game can do. You start playing as a character and get used to that being 'you' then later shift to playing other characters interacting with 'yourself'. Other examples incude playing as characters describing in the past tense what your characters have done and playing everything through a game within the game!

So whats left? The world to explore, interesting characters, and an incredible story. Each inch of this game drips with personality and care that it draws you into its backwards world and makes you hunger for more.\n\nThe only problem is: right now there isn't more. At the time of writing only 2 out of the promised 5 acts are out, but that's OK, because each act gives you a LARGE map to explore and things to do. AND hidden on their website (Google search this game, I'm sure you'll find it), are 2 side episodes made in between each episode.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly crafted game with incredibly detailed sound design, unbelievable writing, and a visual style that looks simple at the first glance, but becomes insanely detailed the closer you look.\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone, fans of adventure games or not.","November 25, 2013","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The entire world seems to shrink to exactly the size of your headlights illuminating the road.  The nighttime is almost another country, one where it seems anything can happen.\n\nKentucky Route Zero takes this idea and runs with it.  It evokes a sense of magical realism that permeates the game, and coupled with a fantastic, slightly-pixellated-but-not-really art style that reminds me of Sword & Sworcery, launching the game is an immersive experience, one that doesn't let up until the act is over.\n\nYou play as Conway, a deliveryman working for an antique company trying to find an address.  As you might imagine, getting there isn't easy, and according to several of the characters around it requires travel on the Zero, a conceptual highway.  The destination doesn't really matter in KRZ, though; as ever, it's the journey that's truly breathtaking.\n\nBetween story beats you can (and I wholeheartedly recommend) just drive around the little bit of Kentucky and explore all of the different sights, abandoned buildings with weird little encounters in them.  These are where the game truly shines, the little vignettes that occur largely through text as you explore different areas.  I wouldn't want to spoil any of them, but let me just say that they're not to be missed.  Every time I finished one I felt this kind of Zen serenity, like I had just read a koan.  Finishing an act is even more overwhelming, usually with something utterly fantastic happening, and I just had to sit for a good five to ten minutes sorting through it in my head.\n\nI recommend Kentucky Route Zero, but only if you like a slow-paced, introspective, slightly weird experience,","September 25, 2014","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So whats left? The world to explore, interesting characters, and an incredible story. Each inch of this game drips with personality and care that it draws you into its backwards world and makes you hunger for more.\n\nThe only problem is: right now there isn't more. At the time of writing only 2 out of the promised 5 acts are out, but that's OK, because each act gives you a LARGE map to explore and things to do. AND hidden on their website (Google search this game, I'm sure you'll find it), are 2 side episodes made in between each episode.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly crafted game with incredibly detailed sound design, unbelievable writing, and a visual style that looks simple at the first glance, but becomes insanely detailed the closer you look.\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone, fans of adventure games or not.","November 25, 2013","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LamplightBlue/recommended/231200/","LamplightBlue","LamplightBlue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LamplightBlue/","245 products in account","Very highly recommended overall. Not recommended at the moment unless you are fully aware that it's already taken Cardboard Computer 3 years to release 3 acts out of 5 (apparently, they are close to releasing the 4th) and you will probably have to wait for quite a while still for the game to be finished. If you are aware of that and are okay with it, then yes. Absolutely.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is lacking in gameplay even by point and click standards, but if you don't mind that, it's a good example of what can be done with the concept of interactivity outside of a traditional game medium. The way interactivity works here is that, like an actor in a play, you don't get to change the course of the narrative, but you do fill in the blanks, determine who your characters are and help create the mood with your choices. And although the story itself is intricate and multilayered as well, those things -- atmosphere and characterisation -- will probably form at least 51% of most people's experiences with the game. The writing (and the game is fundamentally text based) is slow but succinct in a wistful way, which forms most of the game's tone. Ultimately, this is a beautiful world to think, wander, get lost and feel sad in.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is a fairly strange and experimental game, so I definitely would not recommend it if you're looking for a conventional point and click experience. But if the idea of a very gentle, slow-paced, melancholic game that is dripping with atmosphere in its visuals, sound and writing appeals to you, then at the moment, for me, this would be one of the top choices.\n\n(When it's done. Unless they mess it up.)","January 8","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The plot and basis of this game is incredibly refreshing in its originality, not only introducing its lore but completely submersing the player in it. At times it can feel hard to follow because all you want to ask is "What the hell is all this?", which you may. But at the same time you can just say "Well alright then" and dive deeper.\n\nThe game gives you control over not just one character, but the entire cast of the game, manipulating the dialogue and developing the characters as you see fit. Each character has their own personality and background that could be interpreted in many different ways, and the game allows you to interpret them however you like and expand upon it through the dialogue choices you make.\n\nThis is very much an exploratory game; a large world with nooks and crannies giving more insight as to where you are. Don't expect the game to point you towards hidden trivia, take the time and find it yourself. And if you get stuck not knowing what to do, eh you'll figure it out. It's a slow-paced game, treat it as such.\n\nAlright now down to brass tacks. Is this game worth buying? Yes. When will the rest of the game be released? Hell if I know, go harass the developers if that's your style. Buying episodic games before they're finished is an investment, and I believe that the current 3 acts released is a good sweet spot of available content to allow you to get your money's worth and pray that you get some return.","July 3, 2015","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juldans/recommended/231200/","juldans","Juldans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juldans/","127 products in account","Kentucky Route Zero is a game. Kentucky Route Zero is also an experience. It is possible to perform in-depth analysis of the many notable references within the game and experience, but I will not do it here. Kentucky Route Zero is divided into five acts, out of which only three have been published at the time of writing. This three-fifths situation does not stop me from preparing this quick review. Kentucky Route Zero is worth it.\n\nMany games have the character of a novel or a short story. Kentucky Route Zero is more like poetry, and as poetry it has a story to tell between the lines. The narrative starts when Conway, a truck driver, stops by a darkened gas station (Equus Oils) somewhere in Kentucky to get directions. He needs to make a delivery to an address which he cannot find, and is informed by the old man at the gas station that he needs to take the somewhat mysterious Route Zero to be able to make the delivery. Hence Conway starts his journey through the Kentucky night in search for the Zero.\n\nAlong the journey, Conway meets several characters with interesting and rich background stories. Examples of these are the cousins Shannon and Weaver Márquez that have lost contact with each other over the years, the young boy Ezra whose parents have disappeared and now lives with his unusual brother Julian, and the motorcycling musicians Johnny and Junebug. During the night, Conway also uncovers more and more details about a complicated story from many years ago involving the three then college students Joseph, Lula and Donald:\nIt’s something like a tragic love triangle, but much more complex. Some kind of tangled, painfully concave love polygon.\n\nOne of the main themes in Kentucky Route Zero is that of being too late, or to some extent not in phase with the present. It takes its form in the use of old electronic equipment, stepping into abandoned industrial sites, handling bureaucracy and lost love, and visiting museums. It is also reflected in the general gameplay, which is mostly the point-and-click style of old adventure games. The strongest example of this theme is shown in the Lower Depths bar in the most powerful scene in Act III of the game. That scene may actually be the most powerful one I have ever experienced in a computer game. The magic of that scene must be experienced in the game; it cannot possibly be described by me in words.\n\nThe atmospere in the game fits the story perfectly, both with its, somewhat angular, visual appearance and its almost perfect music score. The changes in the mood and the tone are often subtle but efficient. The writing is excellent, and the way that the character controlled by the player changes over time opens up for good variations in the way the story plays out. However, the last aspect of course also opens up for some confusion along the line.\n\nIs the game perfect? No, but I think it is very good.\nIs the experience perfect? No, but I really like it.\nI am looking forward to the final two acts of the drama.","June 7, 2015","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is still phenomenal and should not be missed.\n\nThe Great Recession, from which Boomers and Millenials still bear scars, sets the stage for Kentucky Route Zero.  Conway is a lone truck driver with nothing to his name but his aging dog, working one last delivery for an antique shop.  The delivery goes to an address he cannot find, which requires finding the enigmatic highway, Kentucky Route Zero, which is the only highway that goes *under* the state.  On the way he meets Shannon, a woman whose family has been ruined by the local coal mine closing down.  Together they find the highway.  And well, things get strange.\n\nBasic polygonal artwork is used to an incredible effect, combining fog, lighting and basic visual effects to create a dark, gloomy depiction of the deep south.  Music is miniumal and atmospheric, until bluegrass singers add to the mood at perfect moments.  There are no voices other than the singing, and dialog is entirely text based, telling a story combining fantastical Americana with crushing tales of the American Nightmare historical and modern.  A majority of the adult characters are crushed by debt and financial troubles, a recurring theme.\n\nThe story is five chapters, only three are available and the fourth is now being teased.  The team is only an indie studio of two, and this deserves support.  It is not long, and each chapter will leave you wanting more.

The idea is there, spooky story telling, smooth animations, and beautiful art, but every ten minutes or so, one of the game's files would run into a fatal error and crash, forcing me to restart my computer.  The game is (at the moment) seperated into two acts with five scenes in each one, there is no saving, if you quit while playing you must restart at the beginning of the scene, so when that fatal error that I was talking about happens, all of your progress in the scene is lost which is very frustrating.  However it's not THAT big of a negative because the scenes only take\naround five minutes to complete leading to a combined playtime of about one hour.  Now in my opinion a game plagued with a fatal bug, that is unable to save, and last about an hour... really isn't worth 25 dollars!  This game feels like a free flash game, in fact I am surprised it isn't.  You may notice that when purchasing you are buying the season's pass,  that is because there are three more acts planned to be released... and... oh wait... they were supposed to release Act III eight months ago and they haven't even explaned why the delay.  The developers are flat out gready and unreliable producing one of the most overpriced indie games I have seen on Steam.  I bought Kentucky Route Zero for the story, and yes they nailed the spooky atmosphere, but it really throws you into the middle of something without knowing what the heck is going on.  I have noticed many untied mysteries that are making the game (that I was expecting to be very good and profesional) more and more disapointing.  On the bright side when you are actually playing and not crashing, you can be sure to enjoy excellent sound design, and smoooth animations and art.  Unfortunately that is more or less the only thing you CAN enjoy.  For a free flash game that isn't plagued with a bug I give it 9/10.  For a $25 scam of a game I give it 2.5/10.","January 5, 2014","false","1.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

That and more is what I feel when playing it. Artish, but not only that. Beautifully and thoughtfully designed. No puzzling or anything that could be considered a challenge gameplay-wise, more of an interactive story. Lots of details and deep text lines and settings. Altering perspectives, surreal elements making you often question whether this is supposed to be real or some odd mythical tale told among friends sitting in front of a fireplace. It's not finished yet but I can already tell at this point that it's of one of the most unique, subtle and immersive games I've ever played.","July 4, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I wouldn't try to describe the story for two reasons:\n1. Story is affected by your choices\n2. It is open to interpretation\n\nI have seen this game described as lynch-esque. A statement I will have to agree with. I wouldn't be surprised to find out "Lost Highway" has been an inspiration to this game. This is actually more than just a game... It is an experience. Definitely, not for everyone. But if you are looking for one of the most absolutely stunning and breathtaking experinces you can get, get it right away. If you are looking for "action" or some mindblowing mechanics, you would probably want to stay away. But if you care for the story, and decide to dive into it, I can promise you, that playing this on my bed at 3 am, in a dark room, is just an experience I can hardly even begin to describe. Some scenes in particular are just beyond breathtaking... they are an experience on their own. Art wise and direction wise, the way the developers chose to emphasize certain things and dialogs, the way the story unfolds in different ways, to me, is not short of brilliant.\n\nIt plays out in a unique way, which, to me, reminded me of fever dreams I had. When your forehead is boiling at 38 degrees, and you stay at home, sleeping, in a doozy state, as your mind drifts apart, floating in abstract, unclear settings...\n\nIt is majestic, nostalgic, chilling, mesmerizing, breathtaking, and probably worth your time.\nThe only thing that keeps it from being featured on my Steam profile is the fact that it's not fully released yet, as 2 more chapters are slowly making their way into the game. But I can with a full heart say that at its current state, it is worth it - or at the very least feels worth it, for me.","August 12, 2015","true","6.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Act I and Act II give a taste... where Act III ups the ante. The series tantalates a true notion of gravitas. We are left in awe of a promise that I would not dare to follow. And here is were the "season pass" fails us. To promise a game with no transparency to its progress...lets all give a game the 'benefit of the doubt'. I truely hope this game breaks my now hightened expectiations of a game I payed for to deliver. What a burden to place on the makers. In a hopeful stance, I think this game will actually envigorate and push the envelope to a degree not seen.

You craft it and it happpens in the past, present, and future simultaneously. Brilliantly done. I put this down and picked it up to play it WHEN THE TIME SUITED. There is no need to rush through this game at all, in fact it's deliberately fast and slow when it needs to be, but to truely enjoy this game, play it when you feel between things or overwhlemed. It's a calming, intriguing experience. Yeah it has only 3 of the 5 Acts supposedly out, but to be honest, with a game like this, I kind of don't need closure because the experience is in the journey and the state thats achieved with the first 3 Acts.

If the episodes ever do become available for sale individually, then you should absolutely pick up what is available. But as it stands the episode releases are incredibly slow, and it will likely be a good few more years before the game is fully complete.\n\nPaying $25 for 3 episodes you could easily get through in a couple of hours is a bit much, even for as lovely of a game as it is.

I absolutely adore KR0, and I want to lend any of you that are on the fence some clarity on things people are saying, some advice, and lastly, my thoughts.\n\n1. Acts Taking A Long Time To Put Out - Yes, this is a thing that's happening, and we all really hate waiting. However, KR0 is detailed, complex, and very thorough, so I'd imagine it would take a very long time to produce something of its caliber. As well, Cardboard Computer supplies fans with material proving they're working hard on their Twitter, so follow them if you want to stay hyped.\n\n2. Pacing Within Episodes - I'm a really impatient person. That's just who I am. So, when I first played through, there were days when KR0 got on my nerves for being so wordy. What did I do? I closed the game, played something else, and then when I felt more patient and peaceful, I opened it back up and really enjoyed a complete, immersive experience.\n\n3. Things I Like - The music is pretty darn great. Three thumbs up out of two. Writing, of course, is poetic and enchanting. Atmosphere blends emotional response with underlying calmness. Characters are lovable as all heck. (Extra: Their names are all quite memorable, which makes things really nice and easy.) Art direction and emotion-based scenery choices are all really tasteful for the kind of story the game is telling.\n\n4. Things I Dislike - I have a natural distaste for point-and-click games. My index finger gets tired, the sound of the clicking gets on my nerves, and it just results in me not being able to play. However, the controller integration is complete, purposeful, and well done, which made *all* the difference.\n\nAll in all, if you need an atmosphere to hang out in, or if you need escape, enchantment, enlightening, Equus Oils, or giant eagles, then I'd suggest giving this game a look.

But the gameplay is also worthwhile. KRZ is a winding point-and-click adventure that plays out like an interactive fiction, full of mystery and intrigue. The game has a very melancholy tone, that might also be described as nostalgic or maybe even spiritual. The writing is superb. The characters in KRZ all have their own background story that reveals itself gradually throughout the episodes. If you want to take a journey inside yourself and simultaneously venture into another world that exists above and beyond you current reality, while still not being that different from reality at all, then this game will be a treat for you. Traveling the Zero itself reminds me of the cult film Donnie Darko, which is also a surreal story involving alternate realities - so if you like that movie, chances are you'll love this game.\n\nThe downside of this game is that the episodes are somewhat slow to be released - there are still two unreleased episodes in the works, and we will probably still be waiting a while for those. Overall, KRZ is unlike any other game I have ever played - it's refreshing, engaging, and oddly comforting. And I recommend it to everyone who enjoys an odd mystery.\n\nEDIT: I just realized while reading another review that you can also access the full songs from the soundtrack to this game within the install folder. It's included with the purchase of the game, which is great.","January 4, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I immediately liked the starkness and minimal use of colors.\nThen Steam had it on sale and so...\nIt wasn't until after I bought it that I realized it was unfinished.\nTwo acts of.. well at least three, I guess.\nBut that really didn't bother me, since I often don't finish games, myself.\n\nIt started off interesting enough (once we got a bug with the start up fixed.)\nI found it quirky.\nThen cryptic and bureaucratic,\nThen, confusing and preachy.\nBut I could tell it was trying to take me somewhere, like it wanted to show me something.\nSo I just kept clicking along, trying to keep up.\nI wanted to understand.\n\nAnd, that's pretty much it. I clicked and it led.. to the end of act 2, where it just sorta stopped and looked at me.\n\nThat's when I realized that, perhaps, it was lost, too.\n\n(please note! I didn't wanna give this a thumbs up or down.  But when I didn't choose, Steam automatically chose thumbs up... which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off a bit so I thumbed it down. Rage rate, I guess.. however, I stand by my words.)\n\n\nMay 18th, 2014\nPart 2\nI have just finished Act III of Kentucky Route Zero.\nActually, to be precise, I have just finished Acts I, II, and III, of Kentucky Route Zero.\nConsecutively.\nNow, you may be wondering, would these be the same Acts I and II that were written about, many months ago, up there, in Part 1?\nTo which, I would answer. "Yes?"\n\nWhen it was announced that Act III was about to begin and we should all return to our seats, I couldn't remember where mine was. And though, any old empty seat would've done nicely, the empty seats are hard to see, in the dark.\nMy only other option.. a completely new seat, in a completely new play-through, of Kentucky Route Zero: Acts I, II, and III.\nConsecutively.\nAnd so I sat down...\n\nAgain, it started off interesting enough.\nI found it cryptic.\nThen, bureaucratic and poetic.\nThen, melodic and preachy.\nThen, boring and misunderstood.\nThen compelling and.. clicking and stumbling and following.. to the end of Act III,  where it all just sorta stopped and looked up in amazement.\n\nThat's when I realized, that perhaps, we'd been found.\n\n(Please Note! I'd still rather not give this a thumbs up or down.  However, my 'rage rate' subsided months ago, and I've been sucking said thumb, ever since.  As retribution, for such childishness, I am turning one soggy thumb up, for KRZ: Acts I, II, III)\n(Please Note! When I edited in Part 2, it deleted any "was this review helpful' marks/comments.

Minor spoiler: lovely music show. Simple and marvelous. Truly divine gameplay.\n\nThis game is an adventure/exploration game with simple yet very stilysh graphics, no voiceover but plenty of atmosphere through music and the way it plays. Even if the technical aspects are simple, they exude lots of charm and style that really integrate well with the game´s goal.\n\nYour task is to find Route Zero and make a final deliver. During the game you are going to meet several persons and locations using your truck and a onscreen map to guide you. The way the game is drawn makes you feel like you are about to embark on a 60´s wild journey. Several things are stylized  beaultifully. Do no expect violence or quick time events or even puzzles per se. You are about to embark on a mind blowing experience.\n\nThis game is so unique that you play with the perspective of several different actors playing thorugh scenes. Expect anything to happen on this fabulous world (anything really), expect several wow moments, expect to think about the significance of what is going on the screen.\n\nGreat game to play alone in a quiet environment at night to enjoy the music and the game´s atmosphere. Whenever I started an episode I couldn´t stop it until its end.\n\nThe only downside I can tell is that this game is supposed to be released in five episodes however it took more than an entire year between episodes 2 and 3. I would have to warn you that you will be gambling if you buy this game.because we can never know if and when we are going to get all five episodes released.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (NO):\nI would like to start by saying that even though this game looks simple, it has a distinct artistic feeling to it and it is quite fun to play and sometimes you may even think you are high on some kind of drug. This is a point and click episodic game with plenty of atmosphere and no voice over.\nI cannot recommend this game because you are going to pay for five episodes and only get two of them. I am waiting for episode 3 for more than an year and I have no clue when of even if it is ever going to be released. As I am most likely stuck with an incomplete game, even if the experience is very interesting, I simply cannot recommend it.","April 21, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It concerns only the first "Episode" and will be updated to include reflection covering the second.]\n\nKentucky Route Zero is a point-and-click adventure game, reminiscent of recent indie success, Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP. It’s presented in a flat-3D sort of style, and features an ambient-y, hymn-y, bluegrass-y soundtrack.\nFor the hour and a half after I turned out my light and sat down, I was absolutely glued to my monitor. I feel that going into details about this game would do anyone’s experience with it a disservice. Just know that it focuses a bit more on exploration than difficult puzzle solving, and from what I can tell, there’s no ‘wrong answer,’ despite having a lot of choices with some of the dialogue paths. So try to be honest with it and not worry about ‘losing.’ I know for sure that I missed at least some content on my first playthrough, so I’ll definitely be revisiting this first part of the game. I think it’s best to go into this one with as little specific expectations as possible.\nThe first Act of Kentucky Route Zero is a charming, unnerving, and at times stressful experience, and easily my first must-play game for 2013.\n\nAlso, there’s a tech-demo-turned-‘companion-piece’ available called Limits & Demonstrations floating around. It’s free, and acts as a pretty good introduction to the ‘vibe’ of Kentucky Route Zero, its gameplay, engine, and some of the internal ‘lore’ of the game world. It -might- take 10 minutes to get through, so there’s no reason not to check it out.","February 23, 2013","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These scientificially observed facts are called Scalzi's laws of robotics. A robot can only be one of those four things. Kentucky Route Zero is a game that explores what it might mean for the laws of robotics to be slightly relaxed (not unlike how Star Trek slightly relaxes the intergalactic speed limit), allowing a robot to be multiple types of robot at the same time.

But the gameplay is also worthwhile. KRZ is a winding point-and-click adventure that plays out like an interactive fiction, full of mystery and intrigue. The game has a very melancholy tone, that might also be described as nostalgic or maybe even spiritual. The writing is superb. The characters in KRZ all have their own background story that reveals itself gradually throughout the episodes. If you want to take a journey inside yourself and simultaneously venture into another world that exists above and beyond you current reality, while still not being that different from reality at all, then this game will be a treat for you. Traveling the Zero itself reminds me of the cult film Donnie Darko, which is also a surreal story involving alternate realities - so if you like that movie, chances are you'll love this game.\n\nThe downside of this game is that the episodes are somewhat slow to be released - there are still two unreleased episodes in the works, and we will probably still be waiting a while for those. Overall, KRZ is unlike any other game I have ever played - it's refreshing, engaging, and oddly comforting. And I recommend it to everyone who enjoys an odd mystery.\n\nEDIT: I just realized while reading another review that you can also access the full songs from the soundtrack to this game within the install folder.

You don't so much choose what's going to happen as you craft the characters past while going on this bizarre, amazing journey with them.  The visuals are stark and striking.  The regular soundtrack is equally stark, but subdued.  Where it stands out are the bluegrass songs that suddenly appear out of the blue, like the band playing in the shadows of the foreground in the first act, or the melancholy lone banjo in the forest of the second act.  The third act, in addition to an excellent bluegrass song includes a stunning and unique interactive song that really blew me away.

I immediately liked the starkness and minimal use of colors.\nThen Steam had it on sale and so...\nIt wasn't until after I bought it that I realized it was unfinished.\nTwo acts of.. well at least three, I guess.\nBut that really didn't bother me, since I often don't finish games, myself.\n\nIt started off interesting enough (once we got a bug with the start up fixed.)\nI found it quirky.\nThen cryptic and bureaucratic,\nThen, confusing and preachy.\nBut I could tell it was trying to take me somewhere, like it wanted to show me something.\nSo I just kept clicking along, trying to keep up.\nI wanted to understand.\n\nAnd, that's pretty much it. I clicked and it led.. to the end of act 2, where it just sorta stopped and looked at me.\n\nThat's when I realized that, perhaps, it was lost, too.\n\n(please note! I didn't wanna give this a thumbs up or down.  But when I didn't choose, Steam automatically chose thumbs up... which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off a bit so I thumbed it down. Rage rate, I guess.. however, I stand by my words.)\n\n\nMay 18th, 2014\nPart 2\nI have just finished Act III of Kentucky Route Zero.\nActually, to be precise, I have just finished Acts I, II, and III, of Kentucky Route Zero.\nConsecutively.\nNow, you may be wondering, would these be the same Acts I and II that were written about, many months ago, up there, in Part 1?\nTo which, I would answer. "Yes?"\n\nWhen it was announced that Act III was about to begin and we should all return to our seats, I couldn't remember where mine was. And though, any old empty seat would've done nicely, the empty seats are hard to see, in the dark.\nMy only other option.. a completely new seat, in a completely new play-through, of Kentucky Route Zero: Acts I, II, and III.\nConsecutively.\nAnd so I sat down...\n\nAgain, it started off interesting enough.\nI found it cryptic.\nThen, bureaucratic and poetic.\nThen, melodic and preachy.\nThen, boring and misunderstood.\nThen compelling and.. clicking and stumbling and following.. to the end of Act III,  where it all just sorta stopped and looked up in amazement.\n\nThat's when I realized, that perhaps, we'd been found.\n\n(Please Note! I'd still rather not give this a thumbs up or down.  However, my 'rage rate' subsided months ago, and I've been sucking said thumb, ever since.  As retribution, for such childishness, I am turning one soggy thumb up, for KRZ: Acts I, II, III)\n(Please Note! When I edited in Part 2, it deleted any "was this review helpful' marks/comments.  This is something done, automatically, by the system and not me, just so's you know.)","January 23, 2014","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people claim it's "not a game" because it doesn't have puzzles like a traditional adventure game, but that sells this game short.  The makers definitely don't care what your pre-concieved notions of a "game" might be, but the interactivity is very high but in ways I've never seen before.  You don't so much choose what's going to happen as you craft the characters past while going on this bizarre, amazing journey with them.  The visuals are stark and striking.  The regular soundtrack is equally stark, but subdued.  Where it stands out are the bluegrass songs that suddenly appear out of the blue, like the band playing in the shadows of the foreground in the first act, or the melancholy lone banjo in the forest of the second act.  The third act, in addition to an excellent bluegrass song includes a stunning and unique interactive song that really blew me away.

A mysterious "Lynchian" world that I can't wait to dig-in further.\n\nThe art direction has a unique, fascinating, style. Crafted using simple 3D assets and glorified with a smart usage of lighting, camera depths and "layers".\n\nThe story is driven with smart-written dialogs that invite you to wonder what are the motivations and backstories of each of those characters.\n\n<Chapter I> Great introduction to the main character, and his dog. Sometimes wondering if this is all "real" or part of a "dream", you keep moving forward in this sort of "ghost story". Maybe none of the previous guesses is right, and the main character is just high on LSD. But something odd is going on, and you want to know what is it.\n\n<Chapter II> The story keeps growing up your interest. The Museum and Forest scenes are brilliant, both visually and script-wise. The fact that these scenes are built from the point of view of other characters, adds an unbelievable depth to the personality of your main character.\n\n<Chapter III> The worst chapter so far. It's sort of boring, as you never understand where are you leading to. Or what's your objective. Too much text, too few awesome visuals. I hope this is just the prelude for an amazing Chapter IV. Where I'll be able to understand what happened in the 3rd. Get back on my excitement for this game.","February 28, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, not much really *happens* in the game: it takes place on a summer night in rural Kentucky.\n\nWell, that's a lie. It takes place in some kind of Kentucky not at all like the real Kentucky. It's a Kentucky that I really, sorely wish I could visit, because this place is amazing. Everything about this world is something you can get lost in. It's as real as real can be, but *magical* at the same time. Neil Gaiman kinda stuff.

It's gloriously weird and wonderful.\n\nTo me, which makes the game so appealing, there is this enduring creepiness about everything in the game; the fact that the day always seems to stand at the edge of dusk contributes to that fact.  This creepiness lies on a balance teetering toward understanding, pushes you on to learn more about the Zero, and continue onward.\n\nAnyway, despite this somewhat pretentious-sounding rambling, Cardboard Computer has a winner here.

The makers definitely don't care what your pre-concieved notions of a "game" might be, but the interactivity is very high but in ways I've never seen before.  You don't so much choose what's going to happen as you craft the characters past while going on this bizarre, amazing journey with them.  The visuals are stark and striking.  The regular soundtrack is equally stark, but subdued.  Where it stands out are the bluegrass songs that suddenly appear out of the blue, like the band playing in the shadows of the foreground in the first act, or the melancholy lone banjo in the forest of the second act.  The third act, in addition to an excellent bluegrass song includes a stunning and unique interactive song that really blew me away.

This makes the descriptions of the different truck stops much more immediate to me, but they are well-crafted on their own.\n\nI'm a big fan of this game, definitely recommend it.\n\nI finished playing Act III. The mood of this game is so intense! I'm somewhere between 'deeply unsettled' and 'terrified'. I absolutely recommend playing the free interquels you can find on the developer's site kentuckyroutezero.com . They add context to the game's plot and characters, but The Entertainment especially is also a very interesting experience on its own.\n\nI know some people have complaints about the slow development schedule, but Cardboard Computer isn't a big dev like Telltale. A game that I'm so enthralled with like Zero is hard to wait for, but Act III blew me away and I'm willing to wait for that kind of quality.\n\nThe third interquel came out recently and it is just as avant-garde as the second. It takes the form of a phone number, and has already revealed many secrets. It even inspired me to take a trip to my local state park.","July 28, 2013","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I believe it's been classified as an interactive narrative rather than a game. Interaction is based around moving the main character within the scenes and opening dialogue with others. The dialogue will change based on which response you choose, however you cannot truly alter the outcomes of each segment.\n\nThe strong points within this story are the art direction and audio by far, it's quite fantastic. I feel the largest drawback with this game as it continues development is the absence of puzzles, even simple ones. I think there was just one in the very beginning, you had to retrieve an item for an old man. This allowed interaction between the main character and the environment, which is almost completely missing now.\n\nI can't really describe the experience of this, for most I suspect it will mystify and be quite eerie....maybe even sad at points. I enjoy that it's designed that way because there are so few games or interactive narratives that are. If you were to ask me what to expect from this, I don't know what to say....you're in for a great surprise.","June 15, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A mysterious "Lynchian" world that I can't wait to dig-in further.\n\nThe art direction has a unique, fascinating, style. Crafted using simple 3D assets and glorified with a smart usage of lighting, camera depths and "layers".\n\nThe story is driven with smart-written dialogs that invite you to wonder what are the motivations and backstories of each of those characters.\n\n<Chapter I> Great introduction to the main character, and his dog. Sometimes wondering if this is all "real" or part of a "dream", you keep moving forward in this sort of "ghost story". Maybe none of the previous guesses is right, and the main character is just high on LSD. But something odd is going on, and you want to know what is it.\n\n<Chapter II> The story keeps growing up your interest. The Museum and Forest scenes are brilliant, both visually and script-wise. The fact that these scenes are built from the point of view of other characters, adds an unbelievable depth to the personality of your main character.\n\n<Chapter III> The worst chapter so far. It's sort of boring, as you never understand where are you leading to. Or what's your objective. Too much text, too few awesome visuals. I hope this is just the prelude for an amazing Chapter IV.

Its unique and iconic art direction, coupled with a narrative that is intriguing and fresh, makes it a game unlike any other.\n\nLike To the Moon, and like Thirty Flights of Loving, Kentucky Route Zero places significant emphasis on plot and storytelling, and the result is a first act that leaves the player reflecting on all the surreal events that just happened and what they mean. Questions of reality and subjectivity are posed by the game, and the one thing the player can conclude at the end of Act I is that there are no hard and fast answers to them; at least, there are none that present themselves within this act. There isn't much in the way of actual gameplay either, although the point-and-click elements play a large role in fleshing out the character of Conrad; the story is told mainly from his point of view.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is not for everyone; that much is certain. Its strange narrative, point-and-click mechanics and lack of any sort of traditional gameplay makes it appear intimidating at first glance. Yet the game is so well-made, with such detail in its presentation and sound design, that it proves impossible not to be swept up in its magical, surreal tale.

Throughout the first two chapters (those that are released now) there is a range of imagery that is hauntingly beautiful. Seriously, the art direction in KRZ is something that should be noted by game designers everywhere. Thinking back there are some vistas that still pull an emotional response out of me weeks after playing the game.\n\nAs for gameplay, the overly cumbersome adventure game machinations have thankfully been left out of KRZ. There are no ridiculous item-combining puzzles to slog through, and no detailed logbooks to track lengthy bait and switch quests. KRZ welcomes you in with its stunning atmosphere, and leaves you to your need to explore. The game subtly bends its lore to your will, through dialogue choices that rewrite certain details of the world you are exploring.\n\nWhen all put together, there are only a few hours of gameplay in the package right now.

The experience, however, is second to none. It's short, Act I is about an hour and a half long, and that's what I've played so far plus a brief portion of Act II. The attention to detail is impecable and you'll stumble across something and wonder how it wasn't obvious it was there the entire time. It's a point and click, and it's exploration driven but it's not about exploring the game as much as it is about exploring who you are within the game.\n\nAgain, it's hard to explain about spoiling the magic, so lets just say the game progresses in a way unlike any other story driven game I've played and it makes you feel not just an observer of the game, but an integral part of the story. This is one of the rare titles that has been around for a while but the deepest I've seen it discounted is 50% and that alone intrigued me to pick it up without knowing more than it's critically aclaimed. Up to this point I can say I'm not disappointed with my purchase and I can only see it becoming more worth it as the game unfolds.\n\nFinally, this is a game richer than a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.

One part existentialist play, one part art piece, and one part point-and-click adventure, it's incredible how much this one game manages to pack in without being too much to handle. Every part of the game is in-depth and interesting from the conversations, the interactive "sets", and the characters themselves. The minimalist art design and the vague, often melancholy/mysterious dialogue compliment each other perfectly giving the game its signature feel which is really undescribable. Upon multiple playthroughs, one finds that the different conversation choices available can drastically change the experience and mood of the game; not from the technical standpoint but more the emotional experience of the player.\nWhile not a fast or necessarily exciting game gameplay-wise, various types of interesting and fun gameplay are introduced early on and continue throughout the different acts of KRZ. Examples of these gameplay styles being the character-oriented gameplay, travel gameplay, and perhaps the most fascinating of all, traveling on the Zero. These gameplay styles tie into the story which is exciting in its complexity and immersiveness, new sub-plots are constantly introduced keeping the game fresh. The often loose ends of these sub-plots, mentioned briefly perhaps in a passing conversation, give the characters depth and mystery.\nI find myself lost within the world of KRZ every time I play and am almost tempted to drive out on the highways featured within the game (highways I know well) to see if I can find the Zero and explore it myself.\n10/10\n\nThe additional "mini games" free for download, Limits and Demonstrations and The Entertainment, are both equally as intriguing as KRZ itself. While very fast to play, they provide small pieces of possibly important exposition which can be found referenced within KRZ if the player pays attention. The blending of storytelling throughout various games/time periods is genius. Both of these free games contain the same gameplay mechanics of KRZ so they are easy to jump right into after playing the main game. Definitely worth downloading and playing if you have a few minutes and want to expand your knowledge of the KRZ universe.\nThe script for The Entertainment is available for purchase in paperback for a very low price. I bought it and love having a piece of the KRZ universe that I can hold in my hands and read. Really fascinating.","December 15, 2013","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More a story than a game, it's about exploration and thoughtful consideration of events as they unfold. Creepy moments serve to keep you interested, which is important because there are no puzzles, no conflict and only the barest thread of a narrative. That means it's not everybody's cup of tea.\n\nThe only tension is whether your decisions and dialogue choices have really made any difference. For example, I think one of my decisions caused my character to develop a limp when he otherwise might not have. Who knows, I'll have to play it again.\n\nSo to sum up: beautiful game/story, not for everyone, well worth the sale price, concerned how long between chapters.","January 4, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While most of the time atmosphere in games is equated to "spoopy dark hallways", KY0 uses solid, washed out colors and wide camera angles to make its world seem desolate and distant.\n\nThis aesthetic lends a lot of emotional weight to the game's story about the mudane lives of people dealing with poverty. The writing is excellent, especially that of the dialogue. All of the conversation is very mellow, but hints very effectively at the unsaid ways the characters feel. The dialogue trees are also done excellently. They're not about checking off little variables and affecting the game later, they allow you to make little decisions about what kind of people the characters are. It's more like being a part of the storytelling than choosing a path.\n\nUnlike many other "story-focused games", KY0 has a sense of brevity. The pacing is excellent, 3 hours went by faster than a couple minutes of RPG exposition. Nothing feels cliche and every line is well-thought out. I don't think I've ever seen a game be more poigniant.\n\nThis is usually where I'd say that you shouldn't get this is you're looking for a traditional game, but that's not true. You should at least try it, it's more than just a fun waste of time. The $25 price-point is a little steep, though. As of writing the game is on sale for $12.50, but that's only for a day and a half. Another thing to note is that KY0 has only has 2 of a planned 5 acts completed, and there's no guarantee the next 3 will maintain this level of quality. Still, I definately recommend it.","January 4, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rarely does one find a method of storytelling as intricate and articulate as this one, even within novels or written works, and here in Kentucky Route Zero I believe we have found a masterpiece in the art of world construction. Not only does it play off of the decisions one makes, but it also leaves room for the player to wonder what exactly they missed. The game, I feel, is not so much drawn on by what one does, but what one might have missed. A stunning work of creative non-ficiton in gaming form. Let there be more works like this to recreate the image of gaming at large, drawing the stereotype away from violence and chaotic, negative influences, and towards the infinite possibilities of both art creativity that game design creates.","May 13, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only thing you have to know is that it's not a conventional game. It's more like a surreal interactive storytelling experience.\n\nWe start the game with the objective of delivering something (we don't know what) to someone (we don't know who). The only problem is that we are lost and that we need to find the "Zero". So basically, the desire line of the game is about finding a way. And we soon realize that the objective is not about the delivery anymore, but just about finding ways. And you have to agree to wander off with the people that you meet on the road in order to find your way again. And it gets very strange.\n\nThis game is interesting because of the advanced narrative, the master storytelling and the unique experience that it provides. It is beautiful visually, yet very simple. The soundtrack creates a warm and dreamy atmosphere.\n\nYou will definitely get caught in the universe of this game.\n\nI'm not a hardcore gamer and when I play to a game, it's not about performance or achievements. It's about storytelling, visuals and characters. I like to be part of something different than my own reality. And this game is all about that, so I was very pleased.\n\nI can't wait for the next episodes to come out!\n\nPRO:\n- We meet characters and we feel like we really share an adventure with them.\n\nCON:\n- Our choices never seem to have real consequences on the game, other than building our own perception of what we're doing (which I guess is the point of the game). So far, we have the feeling that we are progressing, but we don't know if it's towards a resolution, because the mystery only gets thicker. And I wonder how it will unfold. The risk with a surreal narrative is that an abstract adventure could lead to an abstract conclusion. But there is no need to speculate as the rest of the game is yet to be released!\n\nAnd I am definitely hooked. 9/10\n\n","January 6, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes that robot is wearing a dress and rides a motorcycle with another robot. Sometimes that robot plays the keytar and likes to sing in dive bars. Sometimes that robot knows the entire history and future of the world in which you live. Sometimes that robot is Lieutenant Commander Data. These scientificially observed facts are called Scalzi's laws of robotics. A robot can only be one of those four things. Kentucky Route Zero is a game that explores what it might mean for the laws of robotics to be slightly relaxed (not unlike how Star Trek slightly relaxes the intergalactic speed limit), allowing a robot to be multiple types of robot at the same time. That's right, in Kentucky Route Zero, Lieutenant Commander Data puts on a dress, picks up a keytar and plans your destiny from his dive bar.

Not in a thrilling/jumping out of your seat way, but it may pique your curiosity and inspire you to wonder whether you are experiencing exposition or subtext.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Big_Dad_Gamer/recommended/231200/","Big_Dad_Gamer","BigDadGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Big_Dad_Gamer/","233 products in account","It's strange how sometimes playing a game relates so deeply with your current situation that it feels as though it was made specifically for you at that moment. You get a pit in your stomach and when you stop playing you see the world in a whole new light. Perspective changes and you just feel as though a weight has been lifted off of you when you turn your attention away from the screen after that last pivotal plot point.\n\nPersonally I am going through an extended transition from previous Military experience, then school, and now a professional career with a family, life can be pretty confusing. That confusion has nothing on Kentucky Route Zero by developer Cardboard Computer. There are words that can describe the game: surreal, strange, odd, uncanny, bizarre. You can describe the things that happen in the story by sequence, but completing the ideas as to how or why these things happen is impossible.\n\nThe game itself isn't so much a game as a series of events that captures you and allows you to shape the adventure and it's contents as a concept of your own design. The events are all going to happen regardless of whether or not you make certain choices, the only thing that may change are dialogue options and responses. You even begin to have conversations with yourself through multiple characters gradually. This is interesting because now both sides of the conversation have different possibilities, and somehow the conversations seem less mechanical even if they are with yourself.\n\nGoing back to describing the game, there are words to describe it, but each of those words seem to have connotations that don't fully encompass the ideas portrayed. The feeling is fuller, than those words can describe. It's very odd, and I don't want to give any of it away as a spoiler.\n\nThings that are strange and unbelievable happen and the characters seem to take it with a grain of salt. Things like traveling on an inter-dimensional highway with arbitrary markers made of everyday items, replacing a leg with a metal skeleton prosthesis (and not reacting), taking a shot with a skeleton with a tape recorder, flying on a giant eagle that moves houses daily. These are all taken by the characters as something completely acceptable if a bit odd. No explanation of why these things are happening, just that they do.\n\n\n\nThere is no time or place to explore why these things happen, so taking them with stride is forced on the player as well as the characters. You can only move forward and there are no places to take breaks to look for answers. So you derive the answers from events as they move along, and accept what doesn't make sense, and just move along. Eventually events in the story that didn't make sense are after the fact, and become a part of the plot. So even surreal happenings can become important regardless of how illogical or insane they seem at first.\n\nThe entire interface is a point and click adventure, but there are only so many things you can point and click on and they are all labeled for convenience and to keep the story moving at a reasonable pace. This doesn't detract from the experience, as the game itself is surreal enough to keep you entertained. If anything it keeps things interesting as you always want to move forward to see what strange happenings are next.\n\nThe strange is the spectacle. And the glass through which you look is your own mind. The experience is engrossing.\n\nYou'll like this game if: You enjoy M.C. Escher and Picasso, and want to play a game designed by them. Strictly for those though that enjoy being told a story, and not necessarily molding it.\n\nMy review blog where I review games that I play from my steam library is here: http://bigdadgamer.blogspot.com/","November 27, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Throughout the first two chapters (those that are released now) there is a range of imagery that is hauntingly beautiful. Seriously, the art direction in KRZ is something that should be noted by game designers everywhere. Thinking back there are some vistas that still pull an emotional response out of me weeks after playing the game.\n\nAs for gameplay, the overly cumbersome adventure game machinations have thankfully been left out of KRZ. There are no ridiculous item-combining puzzles to slog through, and no detailed logbooks to track lengthy bait and switch quests. KRZ welcomes you in with its stunning atmosphere, and leaves you to your need to explore. The game subtly bends its lore to your will, through dialogue choices that rewrite certain details of the world you are exploring.\n\nWhen all put together, there are only a few hours of gameplay in the package right now. I eagerly await coming chapters, but it may be steep for anyone who is unsure if the game sounds right for them. However, if you are a fan of adventure games, indie games that dare to do something different or just plain want to be enthralled by an experience, buy in now.","November 25, 2013","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surreal, artisticaly mature and aware, thought provoking...that one sounds too serious, more like thought-allowing and -encouraging?\nOne of those rare games where everything it does is so good, the only gripe you can have is that it relies on an existing game design template, and either some inherrent flaw or just the age of it; and the reason you're ♥♥♥♥♥ing about that is just cause there's nothing else to complain about.","January 20, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kentucky Route Zero creates one of the most unique, ethereal, dream-like and inspirational games I’ve ever played. Every scene is so totally mind-bending, atmospheric, filled with wonder and encapsulates what games as a medium are capable of doing. Jake and Tamas at Cardboard Computer might be extra-dimensional creatures pulling new concepts from another time and place. And if so, I love them for it.","March 4, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A secret highway under Kentucky?  I wasn't sure what to expect but I figured what the heck.\n\nThe world of Kentucky Route Zero is beautiful and mysterious, full of odd characters and dark, derelict places.  The dialogue is all in text form and that seems to help the ambience.  The gameplay is point and click like the old adventure games however there is not much beyond that.  There are no puzzles to solve or minigames as far as I can tell.  It boils down to an interactive story, albeit one that is told very well.\n\nOverall I am torn about this.  The art and music are wonderful but the gameplay itself is very shallow.  If the price is right it might be worth checking out.","March 4, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
