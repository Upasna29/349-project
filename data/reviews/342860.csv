While many have attested that this game is very similar, I can tell you that a lot of the tiles used in this game as well as the monsters are EXACT copies. However, there are some differences.\n\nIn this game, you play as 3 characters, all of whom have different strengths and weaknesses. They move along a set of tiles like a board game in a turn-based strategy RPG style. The story in this game is very light with no real purpose.\n\nHaving said that, I absolutely recommend this game to any board game fanatics or Dungeons and Dragons fans out there that wish they could play solo. The levels are fast-paced, fun, and the abilities and attacks are very chance-based, similar to rolling dice.\n\nI absolutely loved my playthrough of this game and I hope a sequel comes out at some point!","February 3, 2015","true","4.4"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","34","35","0","0"

Essentially, you control 3 heroes and are tasked with clearing a level.  Afterwards, you can use the money you've earned to buy equipment, spells, and some other goodies.  If you're looking for an in-depth and complex dungeon crawler, this is most certainly not it.  If games like Dungeons of Dredmor tend to overwhelm you with too many available options, then this might be more your speed.  In the end, $5 isn't a bad price for what you're getting here, though other games certainly do the genre a bit more justice.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVzmzu5NkA","January 21, 2015","true","0.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","1"

Art is pretty good, particularly the portraits on the board - the rest of the game isn't much to write home about.\n\nThe UI is clunky / slow, there is not much in way of story or mission briefings and the game tried to alter / re-invent what HeroQuest did but failed by adding various random events that make you lose HP because "bad dice rolls". HeroQuest was random, but never this random. Rolling how much HP are restored for example or randomly lose all APs or losing a turn entirely are pretty common in Dark Quest. Needless to say: not very fun.\n\nThe game itself is pretty much the same as it has always been - uncover areas and funnel enemies into small areas and narrow tunnels to avoid getting overrun. It gets old pretty quickly and seemingly was designed with heal potion-spam in mind - which probably has something to do with IAP on the mobile version of this.\n\nGood for 15 minutes of nostalgia, not much worth after those 15 minutes are over.","July 31, 2015","false","3.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/342860/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1580 products in account","Dark Quest, for better or for worse, is an indie clone of HeroQuest, both in aesthetics and gameplay. Unfortunately, it's hampered by incredibly poor writing, a clumsy UI, a painful bug that made the game significantly harder and more awkward, and a failure to measure up to the 1989 boardgame in almost every way.\n\nSince it's the core of the gameplay, there's no real getting around it - Dark Quest is HeroQuest in many ways. However, many of the relevant numbers are hidden from the player, you are only given control of three heroes instead of four, the fairly wide variety of magic spells for the Wizard (and Elf, who isn't in this game) from the board game is mostly missing, items are all purchased or looted consumables instead of HeroQuest's variety of purchasable equipment, mostly-found consumables, and found artifacts, and there's only eight (or nine? I'm honestly unsure, because the game is bad at communicating things and I wasn't writing it down...) quests instead of the original HeroQuest's twelve. Also there's a turn limit on each quest, but it's so generous that I never felt I was in risk of hitting it, so that's kind of a non-point.\n\nSeveral of these differences I mentioned are related to the clumsy UI, which makes selecting heroes who aren't on the same screen as each other awkward (unless there's a hotkey for it that I'm missing), as you need to scroll over to and click on them, and frequently gives little information - item/spell descriptions are there and useful, but knowing any stats other than BP for heroes and monsters is impossible except by guesswork. Similarly, how traps are detected was never entirely clear to me even by the end of the game - moving the dwarf "near" them seemed to detect them after his move, but it wasn't always clear what determined whether or not he was "near" enough for it to work. When buying things in town, you are also not told what your inventory looks like slot-wise, in terms of whether you have any empty slots, just whether or not you have any of those items and, after attempting to purchase an item, perhaps that you didn't have any item slots and your purchase was cancelled.\n\nMoving to the square you want and taking the action you want are also frequently mutually exclusive - for instance, you can't very easily retreat while casting spells, because while you get to move and act in the same turn, they have to be done in a single order. This also sometimes makes picking up loot / smashing barrels / otherwise checking for treasure awkward, because you have to click on the square beyond the one you want to end up in.  Doing things like sorting your inventory and transferring items between heroes is also not possible, nor does the game have real configuration options for doing things like changing the volume, just turning it on or off. Also, while you can quickly click through most windows to speed up game play, you're stuck at the "roll the skull of fate" screen for a good few seconds before it becomes enabled to click on, slowing down the game notably whenever it randomly happens. Ultimately, you'll spend almost as much time fighting the UI as having fun fighting Azkallor's minions.\n\nThe bug I mentioned was simple, but rather terrible - you couldn't use any items that came after a blank slot in your inventory. Given that you couldn't move items around in your inventory, nor trade items between heroes, this put you in the awkward position of using the last item in an inventory slot disabling your access to any items in later slots for the rest of the quest. There seemed to be a related bug where the description of items in your inventory would also be wrong, with the description of the item your mouse was over belonging to a different item in your inventory. If you knew what your items did, of course, this wasn't a problem, just awkward.\n\nAs far as the poor writing goes, the story in this game is obviously not the draw, much as it wasn't for HeroQuest, but the in-game English script was incredibly badly written, featuring many typographical errors, grammatical errors, wrong capitalizations, et cetera. It was fairly distracting, and the game really could have used an editing pass.\n\nIn the end, I actually had some fun with Dark Quest because it was a take on a good game design, and it reminded me of the fun times I had playing the original HeroQuest board game as a kid. However, it just didn't compare, and not because I was blinded by nostalgia - a straight adaptation of the board game would have been a better game, and almost none of the changes were, in my opinion, for the better. It's also rather short and without much replay value, as I completed all of the quests included in the game in around two and a half hours of play. So, unfortunately, I can't really recommend purchasing it - but I can say that I'm at least tentatively interested in Dark Quest II, because I can see a lot of ways for the designers to get to a good game from here, and hope the designers manage it.","March 14, 2015","false","2.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","1"

In it, you play as three characters (Warrior, Dwarf, and Wizard) seeking to make your way through a series of dungeons to complete a set of quests which are posed to you. Along the way, you need to deal with traps, secret doors, and collecting gold to upgrade your equipment/spells back in town.\n\nThe game is quite short, taking roughly 3 hours to 100%. Combat is largely random, and there are other random events which can lead to damage to your characters, which can occasionally feel a little imbalanced because some runs you won't be touched, while others you end up getting into dire straits rather quickly.\n\nIt's moderately fun, but in my case it's likely at least partially due to nostalgia from enjoying Hero Quest itself. Consider the gameplay, and the length of the game, and choose a price point which seems appropriate to you.","July 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A simple character sheet would go a really long way here.\n- As with above, seems items/spells don't really grow in strength, you can just buy more. All of them are consumable (even armor, swords, etc.; all are one-shots)\n- Small bugs - (E.g. item icons may not match actual item selected)\n- Random "skull of fate" occasionally interrupts. Lose 20 gold, or one HP. Mildly annoying.\n\nA patch or two should clear some of these right up, and if this goes Workshop, this will be a _monster_.

Unfortunately, this game is just not fun.\n\nBad:\n-The interface is clunky and not adjusted to PC at all.\n-Gameplay is shallow, repetitive, and consistently meh.\n-random elements don't really carry over form a boardgame perspective; especially when the interface and gameplay is already bad\n-Combat devolves into a game of drinking potions\n-Story is toilet paper thin; It's basically "Kill bad wizard...for reasons"\n\n\nGood:\n-Sound and music is nice and gives a good reactive feel to combat\n-Art is done well. Probably the best part of the game","December 26, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It might be more fun on the go on a tablet than at home on a PC.  Interface is a little weird (it's hard to tell when a click is going to use up an action, or when it might end your turn.  It's hard to tell what things are actions (drinking a potion counts, but picking up gold doesn't?)\n\nNot unpleasant by any means, but there's not much depth here, and the game relies too much on randomness.","April 22","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
