There I found a green label greatest hits game called Final Fantasy VII. The blonde man on the cover holding a giant sword tore away at my curiosity. So my allowance was spent on this mysterious game I had yet to hear about. Not very long after beating it, I realized I was in love. "Where has this game been all my life?" I asked myself. A few weeks later, after saving up my allowances for a NEW psx title, I returned to the same local Wal-Mart and began browsing the sliding door glass case. "Hmm...Gran Turismo sure looks fun...Tomb Raider....maybe...", but there at the bottom in the left hand corner it sat. Final Fantasy VIII. I must've screeched from excitement. Though none of these characters on the case looked familiar..."So the games don't connect then?" I pondered...In a rush to get the game, I flagged the worker down to open the case. Game in hand, I opened the lid of my Psx, removed Dark Stone, and placed in Disc 1...Never has a game brought as much excitement as seeing this sequel that day. It was the best, is the best, and will forever be the best. Now I am no longer a child, at 25 I have 2 children of my own and hope one day they too find their "FFVIII"...","December 12, 2014","true","34.7"," 450 of 473 people (95%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","95","450","473","68","25"

Particularly makes battles and traversing the world map seem much smoother!\n- Various scenes will load much faster, ie; card battles and the startup screen, which is a big quality of life difference!\n- 360 degree movement doesn't work by default, only 8 direction. I'm not sure if this can be modded.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I personally prefer the original PS1 version, but if you don't have access to it, this version is not a bad option either.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aSusurrus/recommended/39150/","aSusurrus","Susurrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aSusurrus/","809 products in account","Edit: Update to the title on 20th June 2014 added more cheats - no fixes to any of the technical issues.\n\nBefore I get started, Yes I know about the mods to fix it. We shouldn't have to mod the game to get content Square Enix claimed was in the game.\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII (Yes, 7) was released on Steam a little while ago. And while many were happy, many were disappointed. Square Enix released the game with awful audio. Entire vocals were missing from some, for example, the infamous "One Winged Angel" BGM, and the audio in general sounded very subdued.\n\nA modder, Assimi, went out of his way to patch the BGM to the quality it should be. Many months came and went, and eventually, one day, Square Enix released a patch, which upgraded the audio to a better quality.\n\nWe then hear FINAL FANTASY VIII will be coming to Steam, with what Square Enix claimed - PlayStation Quality Audio! Superb! They won't make the same mistake twice! Surely? Especially not after such a statement...\n\nWe were wrong.\n\nFINAL FANTASY VIII Steam Edition is an almost identical copy of the original FINAL FANTASY VIII PC Port, except this time with added layers of DRM, cheats, and ruined FMVs, along side all the issues of the original port.\n\nSo all the issues:\n\n1) Background music uses low quality midi.\n2) Sound effects uses low quality audio (Quetzalcoatls roar sticks out the most).\n3) Limited to 8-way movement, rather than the 360 movement on PS1\n4) Still uses B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 button prompts if using a Gamepad.\n5) FMVs have been giving a horrible filter to "upscale" them. This blur removes a tonne of detail from the FMVs.\n6) Linear Filtering simply blurs all the textures, and makes the world map look disgusting.\n\nSo let's go through these 1 by 1. Links to any mods mentioned will be put at the bottom of the review.\n\nIssue 1) Background Music. This is horrible. My main problem here is Square Enix LIED to us. When they announced FF8 Steam Edition they shouted "PLAYSTATION QUALITY AUDIO!" from the rooftops. They did not deliver. Here's a comparison:\n\nSteam Edition:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93tFd5jeFbU\n\nPlayStation Version:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eU0tRBHnE0\n\nIf you're using any decent speakers, you can hear the massive difference. My speakers cost me about £10, and I'm not even an audiophile (hence the £10 speakers) and I can tell the massive difference in quality.\n\nThankfully - Thanks to DLPB of the QHIMM forums this can be fixed and modded out (and the BGM can be changed to whatever songs you want, just make sure they're .OGG and looped correctly). But. It shouldn't need to be in the first place. Square Enix claimed the game has PS Audio. It doesn't.\n\nIssue 2) Similar to issue 1. Unfortunately here I don't have a comparison. But again - SE Claimed PS Quality Audio. They did not deliver.\n\nIssue 3) 8 way movement. If you're on KB+M This is absolutely fine since you're inherently limited to 8 way. However many people, with this being a PlayStation game, would play with a gamepad, and if you do, think again about using that wonderful analog stick for 360 movement.\n\nIssue 4) So you'd expect, with this being a PlayStation game to use X Square Triangle Circle right, or maybe they updated it to ABXY? Unfortunately not. The game uses the possibly ancient Dinput, because forget updating the game to a more modern form of input, right? Way too much effort.\n\nIssue 5) So instead of doing a proper job of editing the FMVs too look decent at high-res, like the 1080p standard, or like me, 1440p, Square Enix applied a filter to the entirety of every cutscene. It's a blur filter. It blurs the FMVs to remove the "blockiness" that would occur from upscaling and especially when in motion. Instead of putting in effort to do this, carefully applying filters when and where necersarry, they made it global. Destroying massive amounts of detail in the progress.\n\nFortunately, someone on the Steam Discussion forums applied a better filter, though still not perfect.\n\nIssue 6) Linear Filtering is 50/50. It looks okay. In combat, it looks good. Applied to character models, it looks good. Applied to the world map? Oh my.\n\nJust look at this mess: http://i.imgur.com/p7QGH2w.png\nCompared with it turned off: http://i.imgur.com/pA9jlED.png\n\n--------\nSo. What's better about the Steam release? Well the improved hardware compatability is nice. Chocobo World is included as it was with the original release too, so if you never got a chance to play and have the benefits of that, that's a bonus. You also get achievements if you're into those.\n\nCheats. More controversial. The cheats this time aren't as bad as FINAL FANTASY VII. Why? It's just magic. And that's a non-issue if you read up on how to use the card game mechanics and refining to get spells very quickly, and very early. Indeed, you can get many powerful spells for junction via card refining very early on that aren't even included in the cheat. All it really does is remove some of the grind... Which I guess is okay.\n\nAnd well slightly improved graphics due to the higher character model polygons.\n\nBut that's about it. I would not recommend this in it's current state. This is simply a re-release of the old PC port, with very minimal effort put in to actually updating it.\n\nMy recommendation would go out to purchasing a PlayStation copy of the game and playing it that way. You can get it for cheaper than Steam on the PlayStation store.\n--------\nRoses and Wine BGM Mod: http://steamcommunity.com/app/39150/discussions/0/666828126495993258/\n\nFMV Replacement Mod: http://steamcommunity.com/app/39150/discussions/0/666828126807201587/?tscn=1386758049#p1\n\nShoutout to Assimi, the FF7 BGM Modder: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004345221/","December 5, 2013","false","29.9"," 6,059 of 7,527 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","059","7","0","281"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/woodaba/recommended/39150/","woodaba","Punished "Venom" Woodaba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/woodaba/","451 products in account","The black sheep of the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy VIII is a game that divides opinion to this very day. Is it good? Is it bad? Does it make a lick of sense? Is Squall a sexy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? No one entirely agrees on an answer to any of these questions (except for the last one, the answer of which is YES), but I have my own take it. FFVIII is perhaps the most underappreciated games in the entire series. Much like how FFVII deconstructed JRPGs that existed up to that point, FFVIII deconstructs the wave of RPGs that followed in Final Fantasy VII's wake, mocking their tropes and characters, while at the same time telling a very unique story. FFVIII follows Squall Leonheart, a student at Balamb Garden, a military academy that trains SeeDs, a mercenary force designed for one purpose: to hunt down and destroy Sorcerresses. Squall is probably my favorite lead character in a Final Fantasy game, and that has one clear reason: he's realistic. Unlike Cloud or Zidane, he isn't a teenager who can somehow fight the forces of darkness without sweat: he's a flawed person, broken by a crappy childhood and a dehumanising education that taught him how to kill. In essence, he behaves how a real person would in his situation. Over the course of the game, we're treated to a near-constant internal monologue that tells us about the struggles he faces internally and how he deals with them. He's a great lead. The rest of the cast is more mixed, with high points being Irvine, who often reflects Squall, and Laguna, who's chipper attitude is a nice respite from the grim tones of Squall, and low points being the annoying and fairly useless Zell, the bland and boring Quistis, and the game's dumb villain, Ultimecia. The plot itself is also a bit of a mixed bag, with some really good moments offset by some really dumb ones. The battle system is a clear departure from the rest of the series too. Rather than levelling up your characters to build stats, instead, stats are built by "junctioning" magic to various stats to increase their parameters. This is a great system, one ripe for experimentation, hampered by one thing: Drawing. Magic works like items in FF8: once you use a charge, it's gone. The only way to get magic early on is by painstakingly drawing magic from enemies: an incredibly tedious and boring prospect. It's rectified later once you get access to card refinement, but it's still a hassle. Speaking of card refinement. this game comes with a very entertaining trading card diversion called Triple Triad, and it's a blast. Simple, quick, yet endlessly addictive.\n\nSo, that's Final Fantasy VIII. Honestly, I love it, and it remains one of my favorites of the series. However, it's a very flawed game, so chances are, you may not like it. However, approach it with an open mind, and I think you'll enjoy what lies in store.","October 20, 2014","true","36.8"," 262 of 291 people (90%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","90","262","291","20","6"

If you take the time to search for opinions on the internet, you'll find a myriad of opinions ranging from one extreme to the other.\n\nAt it's heart though, I've found the game enjoyable, replayable - and the few aspects I do not like are swept under the rug.\n\nAs with most FF games, it relies on turn-based combat, but don't let that fool you. It is possible (and quite easy when you get the hang of it) to finish the game without levelling any of your characters at all. There are side quests aplenty, including the Triple Triad card game, which is fun for the most part, and the chocobo forest mini game.\n\nThe story is quite in-depth, so while I don't recommend it for the very young, based on this, it is still age and gender friendly - there is romance, comedy, plot twists, and a story and world so rich you might just not want to leave it.\n\nThe art style might take some getting used to, but the menu, and how magic and summons integrate with characters, may be the biggest hurdle for new players. Simply put - I didn't use magic. Summons are "junctioned" to characters to grant them abilities, not the least of which is the ability to link collected magicks to your stats, giving them a significant boost. This is the primary method of getting stronger. As you level, so too do the enemies, meaning you can't outlevel them. It is a unique system among FF games, but somehow it works, and works well with practice.\n\nIf you're already familiar with FF games, you might have already decided whether or not to get this game, but if you haven't, it's definitely worth a look-see.","April 7, 2015","true","162.6"," 141 of 155 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","141","155","2","4"

Sadly I was incredibly dissapointed in the poor job Square Enix had done in porting the game to Steam.\n\nFirst problem, I had to navigate a menu that after refusing my Facebook account, forced me to sign up to Square Enix's website. A pain, but a minor one I would have forgotten.\n\nSecond problem, which damns the game and makes it unplayable, the sound. This appears petty, but the lack of the PS1 soundtrack, one of the games defining features, is lost with the MIDI versions which seriously takes away from the games atmosphere. This is especially damning when you consider how dated the games graphics are, which whilst not a problem on its own, the poor sound artifically ages the game and damages the experience. FF7 received a number of Mods and even an offical patch to fix the sound problem alone, I'd say its worth holding out for one of these until you buy.\n\nIt is a shame really, as the core gameplay is fantastic, the depth of the RPG mechanics still intact and there is a lot to pick apart in the story, though the lack of a good soundtrack (Which hopefully will be improved in the coming weeks) really does lessen the quality of the package. Hold off buying this until Square Enix or some modder updates the soundtrack, at which point I would actually recommend picking this up.","December 5, 2013","false","1.8"," 468 of 627 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","468","627","0","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alrightsally/recommended/39150/","alrightsally","Alright Sally","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alrightsally/","663 products in account","Thinking all the time, never saying a word. Looking miserable, wearing awful black clothes. Being rude to people, mood swings.\n\nRemember when you where a teenager? Perhaps you are one, and that is why Final Fantasy VIII is a hidden gem, concealed by the fact, hype and fans of 7 & 9.\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII is in many ways like other FF's, its set in a huge explorable world upon which, a situation arises, threatening its existence, companions are gathered along the journey to prevent it. But what 8 has done is extraordinary although it has to be said, unappreciated. This fantasy is through the eyes of a teenager, Squall, dubbed a Leonardo Dicaprio look-alike misery guts. Which is without doubt true, and possibly a strong reason why so many detest this game, living-reliving the life of a teenager in a world that is the closest to this one than any other FF game beyond 7. Effectively taken place in a Garden (school/college) where the students are trained to be become functioning members of an elite group of soldiers known as SEED. Ok not exactly a clever or exciting plot at first glance but this is only the beginning of something overlooked. Everything about it has that youthful learning element to it, such as the SEED tests as a means of gaining regular income, testing your knowledge of enemies, magic and general surroundings, you participate in field exams where you are graded accordingly on time, battles, attitude, spirit etc. oh and you're not aloud to buy a porn mag because you're to young.\n\nLike all successful square games, it begins slow but picks up the pace by new events, addictive mini games and tugs on your heart strings with a puppy love storyline. Clearly, gamers have taken one look at the indifferent main character they must control and shake their fist in disgust that they aren't a mysterious mercenary, fun loving optimist athlete or a womanizing thief with a tail. I'll admit there are moments in the dialogue where you get annoyed at the ignorance of said character, such phrases like "go talk to a wall" are aimed at someone spilling their emotional guts and "whatever" occurs repeatedly followed by "....." making Squall an essentially unresponsive cold jerk.. what he wants you to think.. however the time I played this, I was of a similar age, disposition and could defend 'some' of his actions. As time wears on though, more light is shed as to why your guy seems so hormone ridden, a past frequently visited in game that should be cherished to understand. Ahh but Square likes messing with you and cant resist a sub-plot, cue Laguna (main), Kiros & Ward, three laughable soldiers in the Galbadien Army (who later become a threat to SEED) running around like headless chickens on a journey of old, with Laguna the exact opposite of Squall - a moronic happy-go-lucky journalist. This change of setting and character can be greeted with relief or reluctance as it occurs when things are about to get interesting.\n\nBattles are both improved and altered with the addition of a new "Draw" system, abstracting magic from creatures and specific points in the world, and simpler nice touches like summoning times with button bashing and chance (due to low health) involved with limit breaks. GF's or Guardian Forces (that's summons, eidolons, aons to you an me) are introduced in a brilliant new way, instead of merely stumbling across them all the time, you must battle them or draw them from powerful boss's. All of which is overawed by this games surroundings. When a place has a name like Fisherman's Horizon you know its gunna be weird.. in a good way. Towns like Deling resemble London with an array of shops and structures like Big Ben. Dollet seems like an old French town with cobble roads and 18th century architecture, even the score fits thanks to the genius that is Nobuo Uematsu. I could write a thesis on how spectacular the soundtrack is but I'll just say look at the soundtrack itself for reviews. Such is the realism of the setting but don't be fooled, around the 3rd disc you'll stumble across the city of Esthar, a gigantic technological wonder the size of a continent.. then you wake up as a writer in a rustic village called Windhill, magic. Shame that such an innovative, well designed game is largely considered poor, when really its similar to all the others. It still has the apocalyptic doom threat, it still has a global scourge of an adventure if you're into doing things properly. There's the giant airship that takes you there. SPACE, 7 went into space for a few minutes, 8 goes there for a while and conjures up some of the most cinematic and thrilling events that square couldn't come up with on earth, so much so they put in a song with vocals and as you know that's a special almost rare treat. Plus you can play cards with cactuars on em!\n\nStunning FMV's accompany the key moments that all culminate into an epic journey of self discovery and destiny. It sounds cheesy but I implore you, give it a chance, this game is superb.","November 2, 2014","true","66.8"," 93 of 105 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","93","105","6","3"

This is an absolutely fantastic game with such a gripping story. Okay, it doesn't have the graphics that modern games do but they have certainly done a pretty decent job at improving what already existed to make it look pretty good. The only downside to this steam addition is the soundtrack being in MIDI, but that is easily fixed with the Roses & Wine mod. You can even have custom game music and load up The Black Mages for battles if you so wish. If you've never played a Final Fantasy game, I would certainly recommend this one to wet your taste buds. It has everything a good RPG should have; a turn based battle system, gripping story and characters you get emotionally attached to (well, except Selphie in my opinion but I accept that some people do like her). If you don't already own this game, you need to buy it right this second.","June 15, 2014","true","86.4"," 65 of 70 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","65","70","0","1"

This review will be a juxtaposition of the PS1 version and the Steam version.\n\nI guess I'll start with a few pros:\n\n+You can simultaneously play Chocobo World while playing FF8. Chocobo World was not offered on the console version of FF8, so I thought this was a nice addition to the game.\n+There are much faster loading screens. I think this was one of the most notable things seeing as how I would spend 50% of my time on the console version just staring at a black loading screen between transitions.\n+Cloud Saving - No, not referring to FF7, but this is a nice way to save your progress without having to deal with memory cards. You will always have your non-corrupt Squall wherever you go.\n\nNow, for some cons:\n\n-MIDI files are messed up. If you're a big FF fan, you will know that the music plays a big role in the series. The fact that the MIDI files sound like garbage just tells us that Square Enix did not give a **** about the PC port. Thankfully, there is a mod/fix for this, so it's not that big of a deal.\n-If the Square Enix servers are down, then you're not able to play your offline single player game. I'm not sure if this is primarily because of the cloud server, but it's annoying.\n-You need a Square Enix account to play. This can be problematic because.. well, a lot of people experience all sorts of problems. Some have problems navigating the site, while others are still waiting for their email confirmation.\n-This is the PC version, but that doesn't mean that the keyboard controls will be great. If you want to fully enjoy the PC experience, I would recommend a controller for your PC. I bought one for about 20$.\n\nI actually did not swap out the music, did not have (too) many problems with accessing my account and still managed to almost get 200 hours into the game.\n\nAll in all, despite a handful of annoying flaws, I like the PC port. Am I adamant on strongly recommending this game? No. In fact, I would ONLY recommend buying this if you have played a previous version of FF8 and/or if it's on sale.\n\nIf you are new to the Final Fantasy series, I would not recommend this as you will probably be dismayed by the frustrating flaws of the steam version. This could potentially just leave a bad taste on your tongue overall for FF8, too.\n\nTL;DR - Buy if you're a veteran and/or if it's on sale; skip if you're new to the game.","October 3, 2015","true","196.7"," 95 of 119 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","95","119","5","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haelstrom/recommended/39150/","haelstrom","Horodus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haelstrom/","393 products in account","Originally released on the Playstation and then ported to the PC, the Steam copy of Final Fantasy VIII is a fairly cheap way to access one of the PS1 era classics while also getting to use the Pocket Station game Chocobo World (a mini-game that didn't come included with non-PS1 versions of Final Fantasy VIII outside of Japan, which can give items in FFVIII.)\n\nI'll get right to the negatives, not just of this port, but of Final Fantasy VIII.\n\n[ CONS ]\nThese are pure problems.\n\n-MIDI music. There's guides on Steam for how to fix this, but the fact remains a fresh install will see lower quality music in various situations than in the PS1 version.\n\n-Square Enix DRM on the launcher. If their servers go down for maintenance, you can't play your single player game. That's stupid.\n\n-If you already have Final Fantasy VIII, Chocobo World's really going to be your only major draw to this, since cloud saves don't justify the above DRM.\n\n-Final Fantasy VIII's story requires a lot of work on you, the player's part to make it decent. This seems to stem from odd narrative choices and mistranslations, but the fact remains you might find yourself disappointed with a world where child soldiers are led by Evil Robin Williams to battle a Double Witch. YMMV.\n\n-Gamepad support is iffy. Sometimes, if your gamepad disconnects for any reason, even if you reconnect it, you're stuck using the keyboard until you close out and re-open the game.\n\n[ MIXED ]\nMiddle of the road.\n\n+/-The magic system in this game is polarizing. Essentially, you use a command called Draw to take some magic from what you're fighting. Then you can equip that magic onto your stats via a feature called Junctioning. You can also get this magic from other sources, like converting items (cards come to mind). I personally don't get the hate for it, the system's pretty simple and lets you inch out whatever level scaled opponents you're facing with minimal thought involved, but note a lot of people don't like it.\n\n+/-With the relatively young age of the main protagonists, the ... Gunblades, and the odd direction the story tends to go in - while there's a unique identity to the world of this game, it can feel like a high school drama with magic and gun swords thrown into it sometimes.\n\n+/-It has a better story than Final Fantasy XIII. But that's not saying much.\n\n+/-Hard to relate with the romance build up between Squall and Rinoa (two main characters), but I'm sure there's fans for that.\n\n[ PROS ]\nWhere the game does well.\n\n+If you don't have Final Fantasy VIII and are a Steam addict, it takes three seconds to fix that Midi issue above. Square Enix sales happen a lot too, so the game's usually dirt cheap.\n\n+Triple Triad. When the world is on the brink of destruction, play card games.\n\n+You can cheat. Cheat a lot. Use the launcher to give yourself a ton of drawn magic, or use the hidden Function Keys to cheat in all kinds of things. While no Final Fantasy game is hard, this can be very useful for speed running or getting yourself up to a certain point in the game if desired.\n\n+Lots of Steam community material on where and how to mod Final Fantasy VIII into a better looking, better playing game is available.\n\n+Final Fantasy music. Always good.\n\n+Guardian Forces (this game's summons) actually level up and unlock you new abilities. This and the square button mashing damage bump when you summon them in battle makes them a lot more interesting than Final Fantasy VII's cutscene spam.\n\n+Everything concerning Chocobos, be it the Tamagotchi style Chocobo World or the overworld chocobo mining, is enjoyable.\n\n+You serve under Robin Williams, Evil Headmaster Military King who trains children to use experimental demon magic, casually hands students he wants to see die lamps that transport them to hell to fight Satan without telling them what it does. It is implied he banged the main antagonist while possessing a minor protagonist, so he was in bed with a Triple Witch. Furthermore, when the actual owner of the Garden (think flying military base) gets mad that he tried to have a political leader -murdered and fails during an already tenuous war- and attempts to placate said understandably angry nation, Headmaster Robin Williams has the appropriate response in mind after stomping off from the well mannered NORG, his lips profusely wet from screaming.\n\n"CHILDREN? FIGHT TO THE DEATH"\n\nDid I mention there's a dating hangout area for the students of this Garden, and so he has Tyrannosaurus Rex(multiple) stocked there for "training purposes?"\n\nThe guy's a menace. Play this game so you can discover how Robin Williams nearly doomed the world.","May 15, 2015","true","5.6"," 73 of 87 people (84%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","84","73","87","64","0"

But, I'm going to give this a good review anyways, and try to be as unbiased as possible.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n-An interesting "Junction System" that allows customization of characters stats through their "Guardian Force" (who in the previous games were merely summonable monsters).\n\n-While the graphics aren't great by today's standards, they're definitely a step up from the PS1 version! There's new resolutions to choose from (and you can play in widescreen! Woot!) and the character models are significantly less pixelated than before!\n\n-A Fantastic story, like seriously. Even though I haven't beat it yet, this is really a cool story that I'm really enjoying.\n\n-Good characters that I've remembered throughout my entire life of gaming. Squall is just so great, and wow his gunblade is so cool!\n\n-The combat is really fun! Honestly one of my favorite things to do in this game is just waddle around on the map and fight monsters. There's just such a good variety, with such good design, plus I'm partial to turn-based combat.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-The music. Okay, the music in this game is amazing, but the quality is not. Square used the original "midi" files from the old PC release rather than the good files from the PS1 release, however, there is a community mod out there that replaces the files and makes it all better!\n\n\n\nSo there!

Personally, I find Chocobo World boring; however, Boko the Chicobo can find items (ranked A through D), which can be useful to your saved game once you finish your first Chocobo Forest (Final Fantasy VIII 'Disc 2').  Also, leveling up Boko to certain levels and meeting certain event requirements in Chocobo World can allow Boko to use powerful attacks in FF8's main story with Gysahl Green.\n\nKeep in mind that the Steam version of Final Fantasy VIII is far from a remake; therefore, the graphics, sound, and game play are still on par with the Playstation version released in 1999.","November 8, 2015","true","132.1"," 66 of 83 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","66","83","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlinkRape/recommended/39150/","BlinkRape","Blink","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlinkRape/","402 products in account","This is a very mixed bag.   First of all I recommend purchasing this release purely for the fact it is available legally, and will run without any major issues,  no hacks/mods/patches etc needed.\n\nHowever,  I feel like the quality of this release is sub-par, compared even to the FF7 release.   FF8 was made for the PC -after- the technical failure that was the Final Fantasy VII PC version.  One of its features was higher resolution Full Motion Videos, and it did indeed deliver on this.   But I don't ever remember them looking as bad as they do in this release.   Whereas the  FF7 videos scaled up to 720p surprisingly well for their age.    Also some videos have very clearly show deinterlacing artifacts, which is puzzling  for something that should have been progressive from the start.      Not only did they do some kind of deinterlacing on some (or all?) parts of some videos,  but they did a ♥♥♥♥ poor job, using cheap blend deinterlacing which can clearly be seen in some scenes.\n\nI was secondly unimpressed with the background art.   Now we know in FF7,  they were rendered in low-res and the artwork was lost or unavailable to render again at that that point in time;   did they truly make the same mistake again with FF8?    I don't have the original PC version to compare with, so I don't know.   But  some of the background art arguably looks worse than even FF7 did in some areas.   At best it looks about the same;  a pixelated mess.\n\nThe most offensive act however, is one again, the MUSIC.   Square got blasted for the crappy MIDI renders they released with FF7 both originally,  and then again just recently.   They had the audacity to include the audio in OGG format;  audio of  rendered MIDI.   The finally got a clue and just recently patched the REAL  Playstation Soundtrack back into the game.\n\nSo why the hell did they not do the same for FF8?   OK it clearly appears to use a slightly more non-standard  format for its MIDI music (and that's what it is.... General MIDI) but could they seriously  NOT  patch in the  OGG support like they did for FF7?   Could they not have applied fan-made  PSF hacks and included the original Playstation Music Files  and instrument samples?\n\nThat is just a glaring slap in the face.   But I suppose we should be grateful that they released it on Steam from the start this time,  instead of lying to customers  that it would only ever be in the Square-Enix store, like they did with FF7.....\n\nOne other minor annoyances is they appears to have changed the Overture.   The sequence of images is not only ugly and grainy (like the original PC release) but they appear to have changed the sequence and omitted one or two images, throwing off the timing,  so you are sitting at the white FF8 Logo/Title  while the Overture actually finishes.","December 5, 2013","true","37.5"," 71 of 97 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","71","97","0","7"

It is quite confusing to someone who's never played it before for the first time.\n\nThe game uses a GF system (Guardian Force = aka Infinite Use Summons in Battle with outside of battle skills)\nNow you need GF's equipped on a character to use basic actions like using Summons, Drawing Magic from Monsters or using items.\n\nIt's important to realize that there is NO MP at all in this game. Think of Magic like Items. Only way to gain magic is from draw points on the world or Draw it from Monsters in combat.\n\nWith Magic you can Junction it onto your characters to give them a boost in Stats to greatly increase their capabilities, like putting Fire on STR to boost Damage, or stack Cure onto HP to give your characters a boost in Max Health.\n\nThe more of a certain Magic you have while Junctioned onto a stat, the greater the bonus. So you'll get more STR bonuses from 100x Fire rather than just having 15x Fire. The same goes for the Level of Magic too. So you'll get even more bonuses to stats for Junctioning Higher Level Magic onto your Stats rather than Low Magics. (Like Cure vs Curage. Curaga gives much more to bonuses)\n\nNow everyone should take note that the Limit Breaks in this game are different. You don't get a limit Meter. As such it can be abused to hell if you really want it to, just leave your characters in Low (Yellow) HP and watch your Limit Breaks wreck everything for you, making the game considerably easier.\n\nThis is a game EVERY JRPG player should experience once in their life. The music is top tier. Boss battles are blood pumping with the music, the story is pretty good and the Superbosses are really fun. Not to mention Squalls and Irving's limit breaks at endgame can completely wreck any boss in a matter of seconds.\n\nTo sum it all up. This is by far my favourite Final Fantasy, besides Tactics of course.\n\nGET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54r8t_5ayto","December 16, 2013","true","39.2"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","43","52","0","4"

The forest textures in the overworld also look entirely like garbage and i dont see any reason they couldnt at least attempt to fix them.\n\nThis link shows a screencap of the forest:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/marusame00/screenshot/721997070252044906\n\nONE Positive is the cutscenes look damn good, im positive they re rendered them or did something as they look VERY nice, on the downside the models are semi nice looking but CLASH with the entirely unmodified 2D backgrounds, it would help if they at least applied a softening filter to 2D backgrounds like emulators can do.\n\nAll in all this gets a 2.5/5 its a butchered port, nothing more, and they didnt even release it with a sound patch which they KNOW from the FF7 debacle to be an issue. This is their SECOND time releasing this and id hope they would of learned their lesson but they didnt.","December 5, 2013","false","9.0"," 246 of 387 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","246","387","0","13"

Seriously, just play the PS1 version if you really need to play FF8 again.\n\nThe music in this version is PC MIDI, which causes the entire OST to sound off in comparison to the original. Square said that they would update this version with the original OST, but they never did. There are music mods, but I couldn't get most of them to work, and the one I did get to work didn't even have the songs set to properly loop. Amazing.\n\nOn top of that, this version has very jittery looking eight way digital movement that feels terrible, while the PS1 version had analog support. There are also some issues, especially with sound effects, that aren't present in the original PS1 version.\n\nThe only benefits from this version are the higher resolution UI, FMVs, and better quality models, but that's about it. I guess achievements too, if that's your thing.\n\nKeep in mind that this version also adds optional microtransactions for whatever reason.

Everything looks like it was put through a blur or blend filter. The forests look horrible the towns look horrible, the world map looks horrible now.\n\n2. Monsters: They don't really look any different from the origional, ****they also don't level up as you do (like in the origional). Why would you change a feature that allows casual players to play through at their own pace while still making random battles worthwhile, into something where people are going to be equipping Enc-None for 90% of the game. The point of that system was to make the game for everyone, if you wanted to play hardcore, you level grinded at the start and the battles became harder, enemies got new moves and so on. Now, nothing changes.****\n\n**EDIT***\nThe normal monsters do level up equal to Squall's level, the Bosses/GF's don't seem to. Diablo was 7 levels lower than my whole party and Ifrit was 4 levels lower. I didn't check any other boss so far.\n\n3. Controls: The keyboard equivilant of 'select' is default set to the J key while the "Square" button is set to S. So when using the boost command on your summon, you end up crossing your arms to hold J and mash the S key to boost your summons. Not a horrible thing, but for people who are right handed, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n4. Sounds: While I don't mind the normal sounds of the game, memorable although lower quality due to being original PC MIDI files. You summon Quexelotl (lightening bird) and while it look pretty the sound is horrible, listen to the origional compared to it and you will be horrified. (haven't noticed the same with other summons (yet).\n\n5. Official description of game: Really, Galbadia didn't declare war on Dollet, it attacked it in order to take the Comm. Tower. Squall and Siefer are not a part of Dollet nor is their 'Training Facility' Balamb Garden, as the name might suggest it is located elsewhere (on another continent). The person who wrote this part should be fired for not even playing the game, how can you screw up something that is explained within half an hour of gameplay.\n\nOverall, I recommend buying the game from the playstation store. Either via a ps3 or PSP (any version) or if you don't have that then I'm sorry but this lackluster game is the closest you'll get to the origional.\n\nFInal comment and biased opinion: This is the crap that happens when Square Enix gets a hold of a SquareSoft origional, please don't support this utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because it's obvious that they don't care about you, only your wallet.","December 13, 2013","false","53.6"," 49 of 73 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","49","73","0","10"

While Final Fantasy VII was salvaged by having a fairly simple implementation on the Playstation One, Final Fantasy VIII has a significant problem when compared to it's alternate platform.\n\nLet's put it simply, the PC version of Final Fantasy VIII was terrible. It looks terrible, it sounds terrible. Music shipped with this release is an unexcusably terrible cacophany of MIDI instruments that lack in detail that made the Playstation One release as great as it was. Despite the potential for better hardware, the game looks fairly terrible when on the field and in certain 3D environments. Texture tiling is rampant in the overworld, whereas the Playstation One version managed to avoid that alltogether.\n\nI love being able to play VIII on the PC, but it comes with the sheer bitter taste of knowing that what I'm seeing is nowhere near as good as it was on the first platform I played the game on. Even with it being as old as it is, it's a damned shame that the PC version of this game had it's artwork stripped bare of what made it look and sound so good.\n\nThat's not even getting into the playability part. With everything in the game being referenced as "Button 1" through whatever, it's maddening to try and map them. While you can fumble your way through the launcher's configuration, do NOT try to mess with the configuration inside the game, else you will get your controls all sorts of messed up and you won't be able to restore it. This is where even giving me the Playstation's references would have been helpful, but in this case it just failed hard, which resulted in me having to restart my game in order to get the controls back in order.\n\nIt can be done better, it has done better. For those with access to Amazon, or Playstation Network, consider finding a Playstation copy instead.","December 7, 2013","false","3.0"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","35","50","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/papuwaa/recommended/39150/","papuwaa","Papuwaa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/papuwaa/","266 products in account","(no spoiler review) Final Fantasy VIII:  A pretty good RPG with some really interesting mechanics. It is now the highest number FF game I've beat, so you can tell I'm behind in the series. Even though I only just beat it, I actually owned and played FF VIII the year it came out, but got so addicted to Triple Triad that I never progressed the main story more than a few hours; so it felt really good to go back and finally beat it.\n\nA lot of the game systems threw me off at first.  Understanding Junctioning and GFs took me a really long time to figure out. Once I got used to the system, I really liked it. It was addicting to level up by GFs to get new abilities and stats on them, especially when it meant I could open up a stat to junction magic onto, which made the characters much more powerful.\n\nHowever, as the game progressed, the attaching gfs and abilities to each character became probably my biggest complaint about the game. The reason for this is that every friggin' 10 minutes your party either splits off, or certain characters become unavailable, or you switch between parties, and every single time you have to switch junctions, abilities and magic to your new group (and if it affects their hp then you have to waste cure magic to bring their hp up). This drove me crazy and really disrupted the flow of the game.\n\nI highly enjoyed the Steam version of FFVIII. I read a bunch of complaints about the Steam version, but the only one that I thought was valid was that all the music was in midi format, which made it all sound horrible. Luckily, someone created a mod that replaced all the midi music files with non-midi ones, so once I installed that, I got all the regular music back again. Another bonus of the Steam version is that the game comes with a lot of cheats. They have some pretty heavy ones, like always have full health, or always do 9999 damage. The only "cheat" I indulged in was the amazing high-speed mode. By pressing F1, you could activate high-speed mode which sped everything up by a factor of five. I found this to be a great QoL feature that I used mainly during the game's ridiculously long summon sequences, grinding regular battles, and parts that I had to repeat due to me dying and reloading a save. This feature, along with the Half-Encounter/No-Encounter abilities one of my GFs learned, made it so I could cut through overly long segments and random encounters if I didn't want to deal with them.\n\nAs for the story and characters, overall I thought they were good. The story got really complicated and weird towards the end, but I liked it. I had to research some stuff during the game and afterward, because the game didn't explain many things that the characters would talk about and reference, which was frustrating. I know a lot of people found Squall too moody, and he was very moody, but I really enjoyed the arc of his character. I think my two favorite characters were Quistis and Zell. I also really enjoyed Laguna, Ward and Kiros.\n","November 22, 2015","true","25.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"

Sure, the junction system takes some getting used too (especially if you're used to the traditional MP system) and continually drawing magic from enemies can, and will get tedious, (have your GFs learn them refining abilities!)  not to mention the teen drama style story might not be up everyone's ally, but in all fairness, FF8 is a solid game with a ton of nostagia surrounding it, for me anyway.  The smooth looking Steam version is very appealing to the eyes, but the stock midi format music kind of kills the trip down memory lane for me. I mean come on! FF8 has, in my opinion, one of the best soundtracks in the Final Fantasy collection. I can understand making the game smaller in size, but the music is a key factor in the whole Final Fantasy experience.  (Nobuo Uematsu is a game music GENIUS!)  But fear not friends, get the Roses and Wine mod for oust the midis and replace them with the original PS1 music, or add some of the different songs that come included, I recomend the orchestrated Balamb Garden, Blue Fields, Boss music and Battle themes. The replacement Winhill flashback music is a good break from the original music box version too.

It's also a downgrade from the original version. The music is lower quality. To even start up the game is awkward. I also keep getting some notification in the top left corner during battle which has something to do with Steam and achievements. It's still a great game. But poor ports like this should be frowned upon. Oh and you also have to create a Square Enix account to even play this game.\n\nSquare is an awful company. Late 90s Square is the greatest company of all time; they put out the following games in a between 1997 and 2001:\n\nFinal Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy Tactics, Xenogears, Final Fantasy 8, Final Fantasy 9, and Final Fantasy X. Let me put it another way. In less than 5 years, old Square put out 6 of the greatest games ever made. I'm also not counting other fan favorites like Chrono Cross, Parasite Eve, and Vagrant Story. This company was a serious beast. After the release of FF12 (which was mediocre), it took the company 7 years to come out with FF13. FF13 is one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of playing.\n\nNew Square is garbage and only their Eidos brand puts out good products. Square itself develops trash and creates terrible ports of amazing games. How many version of FF4 are there now?\n\nIt's really hard for me to recommend this game. If you have no other way of playing this game, you should probably go ahead and buy it. Just know that it's not meant to be like this. I'm ashamed to even give this version a recommendation.\n\nAn aside -- don't purchase Square games on Steam. Not even great Square games. Square is just looking to churn out half-♥♥♥♥♥ ports to Steam users.","October 19, 2014","false","36.8"," 119 of 210 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","119","210","5","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tigercatbrandon/recommended/39150/","tigercatbrandon","TigerCatBrandon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tigercatbrandon/","984 products in account","When I was a teen, placing in my PlayStation for the first time, I knew I would be a gamer for life.  This wasn't Sonic jumping on robot creatures or the pixelated curiosities that were the original Final Fantasy's on the NES.... This was a heartwarming journey weaving an epic and timeless tale of the human spirit.\n\nI collect and play Final Fantasy games, and this one is my classic favorite.  The story and characters are more realistic than the previous games starting a trend in the series.  It hurts to relive the pixelated limits of 5th generating gaming, but if you can look past (as we all had to back then), you will see a beautiful 3D rendered world featuring elements from modern architecture, classic fantasy, sci fi, and steam punk.  This was one of the first multi-million dollar game productions, and it shows.  I'd love to see high-res versions of these backgrounds.\n\nThe magic draw system is tedious to play as a completionist, but it is a fun diversion for adventurers because with every enemy encounter, there is an opportunity to draw something unique you can use in gameplay.  Also, each of your party is setup like a blank slate and you strengthen them with magic you've drawn.  So, unlike other RPGs, you can create your own jobs using any of your favorite characters.  And the backgrounds, Enemies and GFs are artistically rendered, and it's easy to feel a sense belonging to this world.  For newcomers to classic RPGs, think of a large open world game like Skyrim or Fallout 3 with quests, but with a turn-based battle system.\n\nPro draw tips: Make every character able to draw and Mag-J if you can.  Find one weak enemy, draw with each character and hold down the confirm button.  I use Xpadder to toggle-hold it down.  If you have to draw from a stronger enemy, you can put one person on cure-duty, and I like to make Selphie weak on attack (no or weak Str-J and low level) and give her mug and put Stop on Status-J.  This is a good setup for the draw, and also a weak attack can help you bring their hp low without killing so you can finish them off by turning them into a card (which is refinable and also gains AP).  In the beginning of the game, I find galbadian soldiers (which have 4 spells) and Fish from Balamb are strong early draws.  When you convert a Fastitocalon fish to a card and refine it, you get 20 Water which is a midrange attack spell and a powerhouse on Str- J early in the game and defeating them yields 3 AP each which I think is even more lucrative for grinding than the famous cactaurs.\n\nAlso, there is a chance to play the game non-violently which should appeal to some including women and girls who may also appreciate the game's romantic undertones.  Most of the enimies are not evil minions.. They are more like nature's creatures in this fantasy world.  Gaining experience from killing is not really rewarded because the enimies gain xp as you do.  However, you can non-violently draw magic.  I have a combo team: One freezes the enemy and steals items with a weak whip attack, a second draws magic, and the third heals any damage recieved.  You can also gain the coveted AP (used for building abilities for the Guardian Forces which are like spirit-assistants in battle) by turning enimies into cards (which I like to imagine is like keeping them as a pet).\n\nNot that this release isn't without problems.  To me, the most noticable omission is analog controls.  They were a great improvement over FF 7 and brought the more realistic characters to life.  Also, it's a shame the face lift didn't make the cards in the in-game card game, Tripple Triad, higher resolution.  I also didn't like the control customizations which don't support the triggers or the D-Pad on the X360 controller; although the extra buttons are really needed.  I used Xpadder to keyboard emulate to fix that and emulating the keyboard's "confirm" key because the gamepad one doesn't work everywhere. Unfortunately, this means setting up both gamepad and kb controls in the game's settings.  I wish I could just disable gamepad support in the menu and do full keyboard emulation.  That way, I could keep it all in one place.\n\nIn fact, first, the fact that it wasn't exactly the same as my mint condition Play Station 1 version infuriated me.  However, when I took my rose colored nostalgia glasses off for a moment, I can appreciate that it has HD 3D (although they had to preserve the original lo res background images).. and there are things you can do to achieve a more original look including lowering game resolution and checking the "original graphics" box in the settings.  Also, the high resolution character and GF profile pictures are a nice touch.  I found the MIDI music an acceptable with those nostalgic melodies, but I hear you can community patch it with original sound.  I imagine they had copyright issues with sony requiring them to use PC-MIDI effects.  Modern games tend to have a lot less music, so appreciate the themed soundtrack that accompanys you throughout your journey.\n\nThank you, Square, for bringing these Final fantasy games to Steam.  I hope everyone interested chips in and rewards Square with a little fresh support for these efforts.  Not everyone can collect classic consoles like I do, and very few FF fans can collect every console every FF game was originally released on.  Even for a console collector, it can be more convenient and practical to download from steam and avoid using outdated hardware (I admit: my PS 1 joysticks are getting a bit stiff d: )  Also, we have a chance to share the classics with the younger generation.  But trust me, if you can overlook the outdated graphics, the near-futuristic sci fi and fantasy atmosphere will feel modern and timeless.","December 23, 2014","true","20.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Talk to fans of the franchise and you will generally find that opinion is neatly divided on both gameplay elements and storyline. The easy to abuse Junctioning system and J-drama high-school esq plot will not appeal to everyone, but are worth experiencing if you are in anyway a fan of Final Fantasy or jrpgs. The music however is like having an entire casio keyboard ground up then forced roughly into your ear canal. Whilst the recent HD remake of Final Fantasy X had its score rearranged and brought up too our refined modern standards, with this game Square Enix seems to have taken the opposite approach and ‘de-made’ its soundtrack back to era before the original game was even created. The original PC release of FF8 featured the same MIDI chip tunes used here, possible to save space, however in 2014 I would expect the quality to be at least that of the console version from 15 years ago. Unfortunately I consider this to be a fatal issue. One of the key attractions of the Final Fantasy series has always been its music. It’s a core aspect of every game in the series and one which Square Enix’s marketing department defiantly recognises. So if you are going to go to the trouble of adding these extra features (the Japan only ‘Chocobo World’ mini-game is fully welcome) is it not worth polishing up one of the games major selling points whilst you are at it? It’s like putting sprinkles on a cupcake but not bothering to brush off the ants. In my mind the addition of an achievement system is not enough to outweigh ear wrenchingly poor music in any game, especially Final Fantasy. Unless you really really like achievements or have had your ears shaved off by a murderous barber, seek this game elsewhere.","July 22, 2014","false","1.2"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

Hmm.\n\n//Story\nI think the story is probably the most important aspect of a Final Fantasy game. The story in FF8 is, well, weird. It starts off simple enough, you are a student in a military school on your way to your first assignment. After a while things become very weird, almost dreamlike, introducing characters from different timelines and so on. This is probably one of the cons for many people, because the story doesn't really make sense. But if you read into some of the theories circulating the web (*cough* Squall Is Dead *cough*), the story starts to make sense and in my opinion becomes much more enjoyanble!\n\n//Characters\nThis game has a list of lovely characters. Well, some might think the main protagonist is a bit Emo and not fit as a party-leader. And that's the beauty of it, he ISN'T fit as a party leader, he doesn't even WANT to be that, he sort of was just put in that situation and has to deal with his social anxiety and peoples problems that he can't even get his head around. In my opinion that makes this game so beautiful, because Squall reminds me of me and my personal struggles I've had. Squall seems very hounest and almost autistic in his behaviour, that makes him very real and not so much a "cliché hero" character.\n\n//Gameplay\nWell, mostly you're stuck in cutscenes and dialogues (as sadly is the case with most FF games).\nThe battle system is simple enough, with a gimmick, you can get a Crit attack with Squalls Gunblade if you time the attack correctly (only Squall, not the other party members). Something I almost wish they would implement on ALL characters, as it actually feels pretty satisfying.\n\nThe other thing that is a heap of a mess before you really get into it, is the Junction system. Basically you Equip a GF (Guardian Force (Esper / Aeon)) in your mind, that GF in turn gives you certain Stat slots in your mind, where you can equip magic, that you gather from monsters using Draw (confused yet?). All I can say is that, it took me a 3rd playthrough as a kid before I actually fully grasped the system. That being said, I actually LOVE it now, it gives alot of customizability and you can fine-tune characters a bit more than most FF games.\n\n//Music\nDefenitely one of Nobuos finest masterpieces, it suits the game very well and has several memorable pieces that sticks to me to this day, nearly 20 years later!\n\n//Other\nTriple Triad is a card game in FF8 that is really good!\n\nI've played through this game more than 10 times (both PC and PS1 versions) and I'd defenitely recommend it if you have the patience, and like JRPGs in general. If not, I guess it's ok to pass, as I totally understand that this game isn't for everyone.","February 27","true","37.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It's got a really different battle system and a weird story.\n\nFinal Fantasy 8 does away with MP and replaces it with the Draw ability! This ability makes it so you have to 'draw' magic from your opponents or from specific areas in the world in order to use that magic. Magic is now treated like an item, you can only use as many 'fire' spells as you have stocked. In order to use magic (or any ability that isn't 'attack') you have to junction GFs. These GFs are the equivilant of Eidolons from the other Final Fantasy games and can be summoned during a fight. It can be a real pain to grind on enemies to obtain magic, but fortunately, the Steam version includes a 'magic booster' which gives you 100 of a few spells.\n\nNow onto the story. Squall is... a strange character to say the least. If you thought Cloud Strife was dull, you're in for a surprise. Squall is silent, calculating, and has more internal dialogue then external. He has issues relying on people which becomes quite apparent throughout the game. The plot of the story is weird and confusing and has led to may theories on what actually happens during the game. The beginning is a lot more normal however. You are Squall Lionheart. You are a SeeD (pretty much a mercenary) in training and are about to perform in an exam to become fully ranked. You have a rival (kind of like pokemon) and you have a love interest later in the game. After the first disk, things that border the ridiculous start to happen, although they can be completely 100% explained.\n\nI liked this game because the farther you got into the game, the more you found yourself enjoying it. This game has, in my opinion, one of the hardest final boss encounters in Final Fantasy. The ending's pretty dope too.","November 22, 2014","true","81.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Younger gamers might find the aforementioned topics quite boring, as I did back in the day, but as I grew up I understood why the developers chose to enrich their product with such thematology.\n\n+Content: A game suitable for both young and mature audiences.\n\n+Music: Don't take my word for it; just listen to the complete soundtrack\n(uploaded on youtube by TantrisOST)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6kAwpgW29M\n\n+Tradition: Many well known figures and themes of the Final Fantasy universe make their appearance in Final Fantasy VIII: Prepare to fight Malboros and Tonberries, summon Shiva and Ifrit, cast Reflect and Ultima and ride chocobos. Also, many artists already involved in previous installments are back: Yusuke Naora, Kazushige Nojima, and composer Nobuo Uematsu.\n\n+Team spirit: Create teams of three characters (from a total of six) and face challenging foes in a turn based battle-system. Experienced Final Fantasy players will tread on familiar ground while newcomers will adapt gradually thanks to the game's instructional early stages.\n\n+Not another grinding fest: Final Fantasy VIII introduced the juctioning system with which you may team up with various summoning entities and enhance your stats, abilities and defences.

Most items will be dropped from slained monsters or they can be crafted by collecting various ingredients with the help of your summoned creatures.\n\n+Along came Behemoth: Enemies level up as you do. It's your choice where and when to increase your level of experience as well as how to fortify your team in order to overcome enemies who change attack pattern as your levels go up.\n\n+Characters, NPCs, companions with interesting background and distinctive personalities. Most of them answer to the principles of japanese manga and anime culture; if you have played any other Final Fantasy game you know what to expect; and that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n+Environment: Both urban and rural. You can visit cities, ports, schools as well as beaches, deserts and the infamous chocobo forests; by renting a car, riding a chocobo or exploring on foot!\n\n+Chicobo: The famous pocketstation game Chocobo World which accompanied the original title is back! Train your little chocobo to the highest level, slain enemies and transfer all acquired loot to your main saved game in order to aid your team with powerful items.\n\n+Rich background: Despite starting the game "in medias res", the complex background of the game will be revealead to players piece by piece as they progress. Visit the in-game Information section often to learn new things about the world you are exploring.\n\n+Controls: Customizable in-game settings, controller support.\n\n+For seasoned adventurers and newcomers: You can level your characters up to the maximum or stay at  a low level and depend on your juctions and individual skills only.\n\nWeaknesses\n-Problematic PC port: This port suffers from a few issues which can be fixed with various mods or community unofficial patches. The two major problems can be found on the sound and graphics department:     Despite the fact that characters, spells, summons and vehicles are graphically enhanced , the background remains in low resolution. Click  here for an example.\n\nAs for the sound, the main issue is its bad quality. You can fix this problem by downloading a mod called Roses and Wine. Consult the Steam guide section  for links. SquareEnix could have spent more time improving their product.\n\n-Juctioning: Ironically, one of Final Fantasy VIII's best features is at the same time one of its flaws. Juctioning can make your team almost invincible and it's quite simple to comprehend as long as you have spent time on the tutorial understanding how the system works. Unfortunately, while the game extricates the players from many hours of useless killing, they must still draw spells from various enemies at large quantities for maximum junctioning effect. This can be time consuming as well.\n\n-Spam this sword: Although the juctioning system gives a lot of choises as to how you wish to develop your team, in the end you might end up saving your acquired spells and magic for stat enhancement only and just spam the attack command to dispatch your enemies. This issue might frustrate or disappoint some players who prefer to play with mixed teams (fighters and mages) or the older fans of the series who prefer variety and strategies during boss fights.\n\n-Smithing: Final Fantasy VIII features limited character costumization. Your characters' appearance cannot be changed since you do not have access to armor or other protective equipment. The only item you can actually costumize is each character's weapon. Ironically, weapon enhancement is not advisable until the latest stages of the game due to the the fact that enhanced weapons feature negligible upgrades compared to the initial weapons equipped on each character. Long story short, upgrade your weapon to their ultimate forms only.\n\nNeutral ground\n±Price: Preferably buy it during a sale.\n\n±Permanently missable content: Meticulous players who enjoy searching every nook and cranny of the world, won't have serious problems finding most items in the game. But for the rest of you, it might be a good idea to consult a detailed guide if you want a perfect run with all the achievements unlocked on one playthrough.\n\nMy rating4/5\nFinal Fantasy VIII was cursed to grow under the shadow of its predecessor. Up to this day, many gamers form an opinion about this game without having played it themselves. It might not be as flashy or fancy as VII or IX but thanks to its thematology, soundtrack and juction system it deserves a spot among the greatest games of its genre. Concerning the issues I mentioned on the “Weaknesses” section, try consulting Steam guides on how to surpass the low quality sound or graphic issues you may have.","May 31, 2015","true","109.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","8"

If we could use a star system here on Steam that would certainly cost this purchase a star. It doesn't take away from the game itself, though. I had no technical issues with the installation, account sign-up, or the game itself.\n\nFF8 is an underrated title in the series. I see a lot of people saying it was the beginning of quality downturn for the series, and I mostly disagree. The "draw" system for acquiring spells is a bit monotonous at times, but that's the only flaw that could have been thought out better. I may not like every feature of the game, but I chalk all of my other issues up to simple taste preference. You can't please everyone.\n\nWhere this game fares well is storytelling, and that's really what these games are known for. Relatable characters on journeys that pull you into the game, and almost make you feel as though you have a personal stake in defeating the antagonist(s). The length of the cut scenes may seem a little excessive at times, but I enjoyed the vast majority of them.\n\nThe mini-game is card-based, for those concerned with making this game last as long as possible. It isn't as repeatable long-term as Chocobos from FF7, but on the plus side you can start playing cards a lot sooner in the game, and most rare cards are attainable even if you choose to skip the task (or miss it) originally. Like I said, it's not as fun as breeding and racing Chocobo from 7, but they were never going to top that for my enjoyment anyway.\n\nOverall it was well worth the purchase. I have the original discs for PS, so I waited until I saw a nice sale on it.. but for those who are looking to play for the first time, or play again and no longer have it on Playstation, I think it's worth the full price.","December 15, 2015","true","111.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

No bugs and everything seems to work fine, though the graphics I wish would look a little less blurry/fuzzy when adjusted for my monitor. The only negative thing though that really stuck out I would say it's the music. I can stand this more because I actually first played this on the PC version, but the old MIDI music is a bit annoying (though I'm sure it was not easy to program). It becomes glaringly obvious during some of the more complicated pieces of music that represent shifts in the story, and it takes me away from the game more than I would like it to. I would guess though that they will get around to updating the music soon enough, since they did the same for ff7, so I will probably not play any more of this until then, as music is very important to me in the Final Fantasy series. I mean, the Final Fantasy series is essentially a melodrama plus an RPG, and in melodrama music is half of the entertainment.","December 14, 2013","true","384.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I hadn't played it for SO many years. It was one of the first games that piqued my interest in the RPG genre. I definitely didn't regret it.  Have been a fan ever since and the Final Fantasy series would still have to be my favourite, this game being number one. Totally recommend it to people who love a great story featuring so many different genres and elements. The characters, witty dialogue, as well as their development throughout the game are exceptional(Although Rinoa was slightly annoying this time round, all these years later). The slightly touched up character graphics featured in the PC version are really nice and far less pixelated. I found the battle system in this game to be rather unique and the game isn't very grindy. You can basically level as you please, most monsters/encounters level up with you. You can also turn random battles off after obtaining a specific GF (summon) and learning a certain skill .The card  mini-game known as Triple Triad would have to be one of my favourite aspects of the game also, it's a very fun and sometimes an extremely challenging mini game. Funnily enough after winning almost every card I still haven't become bored of it! Gotta win em all. >=o  The controls in the game are a little klunky, but nothing to really complain about.","April 25","true","159.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Why is this you ask ? Mainly due to its draw and junction system.\n\nMagic exsists in the title only by drawing from enemies useing the gf abilities such as life magic refine and or draw points scattered everywhere in the world. why dont people like this sytem? let me explain\n\nMost people think you have to draw 100 of each magic to become extreamly powerful when that is not the case. you can infact refine powerful magic  from items early on in the game if you learn the right abilities. The junction system works like the equipment system. Basically you can junction magic to your base stat. Heres an exzample\n\nJunction curaga >hp = 8000 base hp 1500  From that you should get the general idea  you can be at an extreamly low level (which is reccomended) and still beat the game. Monsters level up with you so lets say your strongest character is level 17 monsters will also be at level 17 including bosses. Some saymonsters level up with squall thats not the case.\n\nThere are items that increase your base stat with out leveling a lot of people that i know that play this game grind out those item so they have max hp as well as a 255 (max) base strength stat ect. I would not go that far its easier just to junction.\n\nyou do not gain gil in this game through battles instead you are given gil based on how many steps you take on a regular occurance. How much you get will be determained by your seed rank highest rank= a. I am not sure howmany steps it is but i am pretty sure it is based on that.\n\nTriple triad ....\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6pitTGz3tk\n\ngot that song in your head yet  ?  No  ?  Well you will. Playing cards in this game is almost a must. Each card in the game refines in to an item with the card mod ability. Some items you get can refine in to really good magic. Others refine into items you may need. If you played ff9 efore you played this then you should know how the card game works its fairly simalier and easy to learn. The only thing that sucks are the same and sameplus , random rules .\n\nPRO TIP : Save your game before playing any card games. You do not want to loose your stronger cards such as gf and or character cards. you can win them back but its faster if you save and reset. This is where 50% of my time was put  :P  that and i am doing a playthrough on youtube\n\nShameless self promoting begings now !

(Rather than completely redesign all interfaces the decision was made to alter the controls to a keyboard system simmilar to many emulators making some key combinations a bit challenging.)

And it really is worth playing; it's the black sheep of the Playstation FF games, but that makes it interesting. It's broken, has an even more ridiculous plot than usual, dungeons are very often literally copy-pasted together, and the ever-present card game brings the pace to a crawl. But, it also has a great cast, interesting changes to the typical FF ruleset, the card game is fun, and the settings are varied and beautiful while creating a more consistent universe than its immediate predecessor.\n\nTHAT SAID...\n\nIf you have a Playstation/PS2 hooked up to a CRT TV/XRGB-type scaler, or an emulator with a good CRT TV simulation mode, you will have a vastly better experience. The game is designed around the limitations of the Playstation, and the PC version makes no attempt to hide the "strings", such as they are.  The backgrounds are 320x240 scaled up with nearest neighbour scaling, while the characters are rendered for native resolution and filtered, and it creates a distracting mismatch - only exascerbated by "crowd scenes" where the crowds are baked into the backgrounds, designed to match up with low resolution Playstation models but completely out of place with the smooth, detailed characters.\n\nIt's actually kind of fascinating to get a the behind-the-curtain perspective on the game like this, it gives you an appreciation for the craft and cleverness of the developers - but it takes you out of the game, looks like crap, and that sucks.  Games designed for low resolutions should be played in low resolutions.\n\nAlso, by default, the music uses awful general MIDI versions of the soundtrack.  There are mods to fix this, but it's kind of unacceptable to put out a rerelease of a game praised for it's music with a general MIDI soundtrack in the year 2014.  My god, you don't have to fit it on 4 CDs anymore, you can distribute it with a recorded soundtrack!\n\nI recommend it because it's good, but the presentation is awful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kacom/recommended/39150/","kacom","ランチちゃん","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kacom/","92 products in account","FF8 is a good game. For those new to FF this would be an odd start. Each FF has a little gimmick within their gameplay. FF8 introduces a "junction" system which can be confusing at first. In actuality it's pretty lame, but a cool concept. In previous FFs magic would drain MP, but in FF8 magic is drawn(upto100) from various points in game, and from monsters. All while requiring a GF(gaurdian force) to be "junctioned" to that character. In order to actually buff your characters, junctioning magic is required. Unlike in other FFs leveling hardly boosts stats. It is required to draw a lot of one spell just to buff a character efficiently. What makes plain leveling useless is the fact that enemies are level'd according to the party's average level. People have beaten the game low level'd with proper junctions alone.\nAlso... you can find yourself mashing GF summons early on... which means watching a cutscene, damaging enemy, and continuing fight. Not only is combat a bit dull compared to other installments, there doesn't seem to be much enemy variety. The final area's random encounters are monsters that you fight throughout the game. Although the little summon cutscenes are pretty great for 1999.\nOther than the combat the game plays like a novel. A very nice story, and smooth character developement. Even with a story that is all over the place, literally, it is shown beautifully. Oh, there is also extra things like "Triple Triad". It's a card game played with cards collected while progressing. There's a whole bunch of other things involving the cards, but no need to mention it. Just more things to do rather than blowing through the story. Never bothered playing any card matches(or using cards) in my playthrough.\nLike I said in the first sentence... FF8 IS a good game. IMO not the best FF, but definitely better than some of the  recent releases.\n\nON THE SUBJECT OF THIS PARTICULAR PORT: It has some issues.\nThe sound isn't on point\nTakes a bit too much space. Apparently not compressed well.\nSquare Enix has an annoying requirement of making an account for their servers. Bad enough it's on the steam DRM. Feels even more distant.... BUUT it doesn't intrude much and y'all can still play offline, I believe.\n","March 1, 2015","true","57.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Though considered by some to be a flop, I see FF VIII as one of the greatest stories in the series. With very well developed characters and hours of cut scenes, FF VIII delivers an epic and emotional ride. While the magic and combat system is a little quirky and easy to exploit, over all the game delivers on most fronts. At no point in the game does the story feel contrived or boring, keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole way.

It's nice to earn achievements along the way, plus the Steam version allows you to play Chocobo World, a mini-game not previously available in the US.  This version of the game does have a few downsides, however.  As many mention, the default music is subpar compared to the PSX version, so you would have to find a mod with the proper music files and install them.  Also, while the character models are cleaner looking than the PSX version, the backgrounds all seem to be a little lower quality.  They seem a bit more pixelated than I remember, which just stands out that much more against the various characters.  I've also noticed a few NPCs pixelating very badly at times.  First it was a nameless girl in the classroom at the beginning of the game, and shortly after Headmaster Cid turned into an unrecognizable blob of colored squares.  It doesn't seem to happen often, and I haven't noticed it happening to the various party characters.\n\nThis version has some flaws, but if you enjoyed playing the game in the past this is still worth snagging here on Steam, especially if you can catch it on a good sale.","December 29, 2014","true","33.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Many of the common Final Fantasy creatures return which are also known as Espers, Summons, or however each game in the series differentiates between them such as Ifrit or Shiva.\n\nOne of the shining qualities of this game is of course in my opinion the music which is done by Nobuo Uematsu.\n\nFor those new to the game: I'd suggest playing this for the story and the music.

And you know what? Holy cow is this just goofy as hell. Of course, we should all be willing to admit that cliches are what FF is all about, and that's not a bad thing. It's just that VIII attempts to be a deconstruction and the story is frequently tripping and falling on its own "and now a twist!" approach that gets a tad bit tired by the "disc 2" segment. That being said, I do enjoy the  settings as they're consistently well-rendered and imaginitive. I'd expect nothing less of the team from this era.\n\nThe characters? Pretty damn bland. There's a certain backstory that ties in importantly, but it doesn't really explain why (with the exception of a couple) these characters are all so ridiculous. Only Squall, the mainest of main characters, has a degree of depth and even then it falls into borderline-woe-is-me nonsense. The models are certainly worth snickering at (to be fair, that's the age showing).\n\nAs for the gameplay itself - it's pretty fun! It's also pretty easy to manipulate if you know what approach to take with the juncitoning system. Putting the right spell on the right stat makes things so quickly breakable that it blew my mind how much trouble I had as a kid. Still, it's fun trying in mix and match what element you're going to smack what enemy with. And that Eden summon never gets old. Stuff like this is why I've avoided strategy guides ever since I turned 14. It's going to be fun if you don't know exactly what item does what function.\n\nIn summation, this is certainly a game that can be fun to play if you've never played it before...

This game suffers being in the shadow of FFVII which in the time was a masterpiece. This game excels itself and I actually prefer this game to FFVII. One thing that FFVIII excelled over FFVII is the lead character.IMHO Squall is a much better protagonist than Cloud and he's one of the best of the series. You know what he's always thinking, and he's actually human compared to the other lead characters in the series. Throughout the game you can see his conflict in life caused by his troubled childhood. He wants to be alone because he's lost so much, he's not tough, deep inside he's weak and he cant accept losing anyone important to him, which is why he prefers to be alone, so he never has to lose anyone. The plot has many holes, but the overall story and the characters more than make up for it. The battle system is nothing like the other FFs. Drawing system to stock magic is a nuisance, and frankly it deters me from using magic completely, only for the sake of junctioning. The junctioning system has always divided opinion, but it is easily mastered if you put some effort into it and I really enjoy experimenting with each character's stat.Overall, this is a great game but the port is quite poor. The music for some reason is ported poorly and that is the main highlight of this game so if you do pick this game up,do something about it.","January 2, 2015","true","77.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Linkkicksu/recommended/39150/","Linkkicksu","Linkkicksu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Linkkicksu/","189 products in account","An (almost) direct port of one of the greatest PS1 games.\nI'll break this up into three sections:\n\nOverall gameplay:\nFinal Fantasy 8 continues the trend of the ATB gauge but with a few alterations:\nMagic is no longer reliant on MP, but is stocked like an item by drawing it from either draw points hidden around the world, or from enemies.\nThe 'junctioning' system is an unusual beast:\nIt requires you to equip a summon (called Guardian Forces or GFs for short.)\nJunctioning a GF allows your character to use more commands than just 'attack', such as items, magic, and the 'GF' command that allows you to call upon a junctioned GF to aid you in battle.\nJunctioning also allows you to allocate magic to stats.\nFor instance, you can increase your physical or magical damage by junctioning a fire or thunder spell to that stat.\n\nWeapons aren't purchased or acquired frequently, but require you instead to find weapon magazines which will list parts needed to remodel your current weapon into a more powerful model.\nWeapons also allow for more limit breaks for your characters.\nMost limit breaks are semi-controlable, allowing you to use certain inputs to boost damage or the like.\n\nSummary- Very enjoyable, but the junctioning and magic drawing system may be daunting to those who aren't used to it.\n\nStory:\nYou are a student at the military academy - Balamb Garden\nEarly in the game, you learn of the tyrannical president of the neighbouring region - Galbadia - and his plans for domination and war.\nAs the story progresses, you find that it goes much deeper than a president gone mad with power, and will fight to save the integrity of the world as you know it.\nThe main character; Squall, is a steriotypical loner. However, his dullness is counterbalanced by the colourful cast of allies that fight at his side.\n\nSummary- Interesting story, good characters, will get you very engrossed... Until you get stuck and need to go grind, typical of most RPGs.\n\nPort Quality -\nIf you're like me, and love your old favourite games, you would want them to be just as enjoyable as you remember.\nThis is where there are a few hitches -\nIf you've played the game before, the first noticeable difference will be the music quality.\nIt has been very dulled down from the original PS1 version.\nThis can be easily fixed with a mod, but shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.\nThe next is SFX.\nFor the most part, the SFX is the same, however, much of it has again been stripped and dulled down, most noticeable with the summoning animation of Quezacoatl.\nUnfortunately, I can't find a fix for this and have had to just grit my teeth and bear with it.\nMy final gripe is that even though there is controller support, there is no omni-directional movement, making navigation difficult because you can only move in four different directionss, and the in-game tool-tips don't change their text if you have re-assigned the buttons.\nFor instance, if you have re-assigned 'B1' and 'B2', the game text will still read what the default setting was.\n\nSummary- Overall port quality is poor.\nThe graphics and gameplay have remained consistant, but there are many issues.\nThese wouldn't be such an issue if they weren't so prominant.\n\nOverall, I'd give this a game a 7/10.\nIt is very, very enjoyable, despite its faults.","January 4, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After playing 7 and 8 for the first time on the PS3, I was so impressed by how these old games made me fall in love with its worlds and characters, it proved to me that AAA graphics, Sound design and even voice acting doesnt make a great game. By todays standards, these game are dated. When i first played FF VII last year I laughed at the terrible graphic, cheesey music and blocky characters. after destroying the first Mako reactor, I was hooked: The pre-rendered backgrounds looked beautiful, The music was emotional, and combat was rewarding and fun, the blocky characters still look bad. In short terms, I no longer look at these games based on their graphic's or age. FF VII is one great game, even by todays standards. theres a reason why everyone calls it the best. which brings me to FF VIII. Just like VII it was an excellent game. Not as mind blowing as VII, but still great. Playing the mini card game Triple-Triad was a blast. Can you believe it? I was playing a game......within a game (that was actually fun). Yes these games where so good, I decided to throw my money into Gabe's face and buy them both on Steam. FF VII = perfect PC port. HD graphic's, same music from PSX and achievements. The same could be said about FF VIII, everything is great, but the MUSIC!. Seriously, what the hell am i listening to? everything is a note too high or too low, it sound awful compared to PSX music. Its a real shame, because if you've already played the thing on PlayStation, then the music will stick out like a sore thumb. Apart from the sound issue, this is a great game to play. I just hope SquareEnix release Final Fantasy 9 on steam to make yet another game that much better. Just dont touch the sound.

Escellent in fact, but nothing is without flaws. Thank fully this game doesn't have too many of them. First lets look at some purchase perks. The game comes with baked in cheats, mods, acheivements, and chocobo world. To thouse who've played the original Chocobo World on it's own should be enough to want to purchase this remake as previously the only way to play it, and take advantage of the unique to the game items, were through cheats/hacks, or having a playstation pocket, and a playstation that could read it, so for this content alone you might be getting your money's worth. Next square enix has included acheivements. I don't have to tell you how achievements (or trophies if you think with a playstation mindset) didn't became mainstream until around 2005, so they are new and it gives you something to do along the way while playing, although there is plenty to do without them. The mods, are great. most importantly, the speed mod is great. If you've ever been pressed for time and not a lot of time for sitting through un-skippable cutscenes, or watching about 3-4 mins of traversing a map it definately comes in handy. Lastly the cheats. The game comes with some cheats built in such as the 100 spell cheat where you can draw a spell, and either press the cheat button, or save the game and run the cheat and you will have 100 of that spell. I haven't actually used any of the cheats, because I don't want to deprive myself of the bits of grinding here and there, but It's there if you need it.\n\nGameplay\nLots to love here. This game gives you options. No you will not have a different ending, but you have options to give yourself a different playthrough. The game levels itself up as you do, so you can play it a stratight shoot, or you can withold your level and work on crafting and farming items. You can grab the first magic that comes to mind, or you can be selective to carry the best magics. A lot of people will drill that the stat's suffer from using your stronger spells, but it's perception. I think of it as it expends energy to use the stronger spells making you weaker with use. With no GF challenges, or other self made playing challenges you can replay the game and have a whole different experience.\n\nThe cons\nYou've heard the positives now here are a few sour spots. The music. As you may have heard plenty beofre the musing isn't the best. It's heavily synthesized and sounds like a fan did all the music in their favorite mid player. It's the same as it was in the original game but with the concerts put out, most have grown acusomed to the higher level of music. It's a minor setback, one that could have been corrected by square enix much like the visual updates. The magic system. It is unique, and has a lot of give and take, but just as much as I applaud the using mgic drains your stats idea, the magic just isn't that strong. There aren't that many powerful spells, and because of it you're likely not to try creating any mages, or see your characters have much in differentiating stats. The controls for this port are bad, you can change your controls, but I haven't found out how to succesfully setup a controller, even with an xbox controller and support for them in the game. Even worse you can't turn off (or I haven't found out how to) controller controls and as you use your keyboard. In any dialogue that involves the controls the control controls display until you press, and/or hold down your keyboard keys. it's very frustrating.\n\nConclusion\nAs the title imples the game is defeinately a great buy due to the many perks, and how they way outweigh the cons.  If you want a very engrosing story, amazing cutscenes, music you will catch yourself humming to, Interesting gamign mechanics that offer plenty of replayability and hours upon hours of standard gameplay. Plenty of secrets, so much that you may need a guide or two to find them all. Lastly, the mini games chocobo world, and triple triad are good enough to be spinoffs of their own, and are beneficial, albeit optional, to the game. If you've been on the fence about it, or you have wanted to try it previously but haven't yet pick this one up or regret it.","March 16, 2015","true","102.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This game suffers being in the shadow of FFVII which in the time was a masterpiece. This game excels itself and I actually prefer this game to FFVII. One thing that FFVIII excelled over FFVII is the lead character.IMHO Squall is a much better protagonist than Cloud and he's one of the best of the series. You know what he's always thinking, and he's actually human compared to the other lead characters in the series. Throughout the game you can see his conflict in life caused by his troubled childhood. He wants to be alone because he's lost so much, he's not tough, deep inside he's weak and he cant accept losing anyone important to him, which is why he prefers to be alone, so he never has to lose anyone. The plot has many holes, but the overall story and the characters more than make up for it. The battle system is nothing like the other FFs. Drawing system to stock magic is a nuisance, and frankly it deters me from using magic completely, only for the sake of junctioning. The junctioning system has always divided opinion, but it is easily mastered if you put some effort into it and I really enjoy experimenting with each character's stat.Overall, this is a great game but the port is quite poor. The music for some reason is ported poorly and that is the main highlight of this game so if you do pick this game up,do something about it.","January 2, 2015","true","77.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Linkkicksu/recommended/39150/","Linkkicksu","Linkkicksu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Linkkicksu/","189 products in account","An (almost) direct port of one of the greatest PS1 games.\nI'll break this up into three sections:\n\nOverall gameplay:\nFinal Fantasy 8 continues the trend of the ATB gauge but with a few alterations:\nMagic is no longer reliant on MP, but is stocked like an item by drawing it from either draw points hidden around the world, or from enemies.\nThe 'junctioning' system is an unusual beast:\nIt requires you to equip a summon (called Guardian Forces or GFs for short.)\nJunctioning a GF allows your character to use more commands than just 'attack', such as items, magic, and the 'GF' command that allows you to call upon a junctioned GF to aid you in battle.\nJunctioning also allows you to allocate magic to stats.\nFor instance, you can increase your physical or magical damage by junctioning a fire or thunder spell to that stat.\n\nWeapons aren't purchased or acquired frequently, but require you instead to find weapon magazines which will list parts needed to remodel your current weapon into a more powerful model.\nWeapons also allow for more limit breaks for your characters.\nMost limit breaks are semi-controlable, allowing you to use certain inputs to boost damage or the like.\n\nSummary- Very enjoyable, but the junctioning and magic drawing system may be daunting to those who aren't used to it.\n\nStory:\nYou are a student at the military academy - Balamb Garden\nEarly in the game, you learn of the tyrannical president of the neighbouring region - Galbadia - and his plans for domination and war.\nAs the story progresses, you find that it goes much deeper than a president gone mad with power, and will fight to save the integrity of the world as you know it.\nThe main character; Squall, is a steriotypical loner. However, his dullness is counterbalanced by the colourful cast of allies that fight at his side.\n\nSummary- Interesting story, good characters, will get you very engrossed... Until you get stuck and need to go grind, typical of most RPGs.\n\nPort Quality -\nIf you're like me, and love your old favourite games, you would want them to be just as enjoyable as you remember.\nThis is where there are a few hitches -\nIf you've played the game before, the first noticeable difference will be the music quality.\nIt has been very dulled down from the original PS1 version.\nThis can be easily fixed with a mod, but shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.\nThe next is SFX.\nFor the most part, the SFX is the same, however, much of it has again been stripped and dulled down, most noticeable with the summoning animation of Quezacoatl.\nUnfortunately, I can't find a fix for this and have had to just grit my teeth and bear with it.\nMy final gripe is that even though there is controller support, there is no omni-directional movement, making navigation difficult because you can only move in four different directionss, and the in-game tool-tips don't change their text if you have re-assigned the buttons.\nFor instance, if you have re-assigned 'B1' and 'B2', the game text will still read what the default setting was.\n\nSummary- Overall port quality is poor.\nThe graphics and gameplay have remained consistant, but there are many issues.\nThese wouldn't be such an issue if they weren't so prominant.\n\nOverall, I'd give this a game a 7/10.\nIt is very, very enjoyable, despite its faults.","January 4, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The music and score are legendary, brought to you by Nobuo same guy who made 7 and 10.

After playing 7 and 8 for the first time on the PS3, I was so impressed by how these old games made me fall in love with its worlds and characters, it proved to me that AAA graphics, Sound design and even voice acting doesnt make a great game. By todays standards, these game are dated. When i first played FF VII last year I laughed at the terrible graphic, cheesey music and blocky characters. after destroying the first Mako reactor, I was hooked: The pre-rendered backgrounds looked beautiful, The music was emotional, and combat was rewarding and fun, the blocky characters still look bad. In short terms, I no longer look at these games based on their graphic's or age. FF VII is one great game, even by todays standards. theres a reason why everyone calls it the best. which brings me to FF VIII. Just like VII it was an excellent game. Not as mind blowing as VII, but still great. Playing the mini card game Triple-Triad was a blast. Can you believe it? I was playing a game......within a game (that was actually fun). Yes these games where so good, I decided to throw my money into Gabe's face and buy them both on Steam. FF VII = perfect PC port. HD graphic's, same music from PSX and achievements. The same could be said about FF VIII, everything is great, but the MUSIC!. Seriously, what the hell am i listening to? everything is a note too high or too low, it sound awful compared to PSX music. Its a real shame, because if you've already played the thing on PlayStation, then the music will stick out like a sore thumb. Apart from the sound issue, this is a great game to play. I just hope SquareEnix release Final Fantasy 9 on steam to make yet another game that much better. Just dont touch the sound.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EMDream/recommended/39150/","EMDream","EMDream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EMDream/","111 products in account","Final Fantasy VIII\n\nRPG-Developed by SquareSoft / Square Enix\nYear 1999/2000\n\nThe Story  8/10\nYou are Squall Leonhart an orphan and SeeD of Balamb Garden. SeeD is a mercenary group trained to fight the sorceress. You awake in the hospital wing after your training session with your fellow student Seifer. As your progress you go on your final exam to become a SeeD and be deployed around the whole world. Your first mission helping out a resistance faction. Sets you on a course that will change the entire world.\n\nGrahpics 7/10\nThe graphic are better than Final Fantasy 7 fewer blocky textures. More movies they transition seemlessly between gameplay. The way monsters die is cool. Some will turn of stone or explode. Most just fall over and die I like that more than them turning red and dissappering like in Final Fantasy 7.  There are graphics mods that will improve the game if you can install them.\n\nMusic 0/10  after JunkyBiggs music mod 10/10\n\nThe music on this release of the game is poor... not of worry though it's a simple fix after you install the game just replace the muisc files with the converted ones thanks to JunkyBiggs. It takes less then 1 mintue to do this. Just look in the Guides section you will find his and many of music mods there.\n\nThe music in the game is amazing all the songs "Eyes on Me" The Man with the Machine Gun" those are my favorites. The opening theme "Liberi Fatali"  The battle theme "Don’t Be Afraid" and the nice "Waltz For The Moon" all amazing. The songs all fit and game and fit what you are doing at the time.\n\n\nGameplay 10/10\n\nThe gameplay I love as it makes you have to think about what you are doing. In Final Fantasy 8 the monsters all level along with your party, Their level is ramdonly decided as a few levels higher or lower than your average current partys level. If you had say Squall at level 100 and Zell at lvl 8 than monsters you run into would be from lv60-80.\n\nSummons or Guardian Forces / GF\n\nThe GF play a major rule as they allow you to junction. The Junction system allows you to junction magic to your stats to makes yourself more powerful. Monsters do not level with your GF. It's really the base of the game it's easy to figure out and the in game tutorials explain it very well. The animations for the GF can become repetitive over time. Otherwise I really like this system myself it's fun and allows you to play the whole game without leveling at all.\n\nMoney / Gil\n\nYou are paid in this game based on your SeeD rank. Your SeeD rank is really based off of how many monsters you kill. There are a few other times in the story where doing your job right will up your rank but, not many. What I didn't like about this is that your rank falls after a short time. There are tests you can take to up your rank they as well. Making money becomes very, very easy once you get GF tonberry. So don't worry about money after you get him and train him you will never run out of funds.\n\nChocobo World\n\nMake sure you start using this as soon as you get boko from your first forest. Boko will make getting items very easy. Do not start chocobo world while Boko is set to Home. You will gltich the game and have to start over with a new boko. Just remeber to close chocobo world bring him home get his items and send him back before opening it agian. I'll save you some time the best ID is in fact "211" use the do over button till you get ID 211 it'll make the game much easier as boko will be a total pwnage machine.\n\nThe Card Game Triple Triad\n\nI found triple Triad to be fun not challanging though. You are providing with cards of insane power by the time you get the GF brothers. Don't mix rules as they are very hard to get back to normal. The game is played on a 3x3 size board. You and your npc opponent start by selecting 5 cards and using the number rating and rules to flip and cards placed down. It's very simple and enjoying as long as you don't mess up and rule system. I'll say this again do not ever mix rules!\n\nChocobo Forests\n\nI didn't like how they used chocobos in this final fantasy. After 7 had such fun with them all you can do in this one is ride them around the map. I would have liked to have had another race track or something along those lines sadly chocobos fall short in this game. I give the Chocobo Quest in this game a 3/10 it was boring.\n\nI give this game a 8/10\n\nI recommend you play it if you love RPGs","September 12, 2014","true","170.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/satanshost666/recommended/39150/","satanshost666","Lucy Fur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/satanshost666/","393 products in account","This is still one of my favorite Final Fantasy games, and the PC benefits over the PS1 are pretty nice. I love the ability to speed up the cinematics to 60 fps, which make the scenes look fantastic, although everything is moving at twice the speed, thus making it a much shorter cutscene, which is the closest thing to being able to skip it. But if you've already sunk hundreds of hours into it before, then it's definitely worth checking out, especially when it's on sale. If you havent played it before, its still definitely worth the money. The cutscenes still look good (for the time they were released, especially) and the overall game doesn't look too shabby compared to others from its time. The ability to summon GFs  (basically pets) and unlock loads of skills for then as well as everyone in the party is awesome. The magic/GF/Ability junction feature is also one of my favorite implemented systems, making it much easier to help overcome more powerful opponents once you've gotten used to utilizing it. Only downside to that is that you constantly need to stock magic in order to keep your stats as buffed as possible, which can take awhile and becomes a bit tedious. But overall, the mechanics are very smooth and simple. The story is very well done too. It's enough of a driving factor to keep people who may not like grinding very much to stay interested, although there's no journal or anything of that nature to keep you focused on where to go next, which may become a problem if you decide to stop playing for a while and resume later. That's one of my only real problems with this game. Most adventure/open world games have some sort of journal or objective list in case you forget where you're supposed to go next, or at least who to talk to. That aside, I'd still highly recommend this game to just about anyone who loves the old school RPG style of game play with some unique mechanics and a good storyline.\n\nTL;DR Buy this game. It's a great part of the FF series.","February 12","true","34.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

This felt like a very weird system, having to gather and collect spells just to cast them later, as well as how slow you'd gather the spells. I later learned that the higher your magic stat, the faster your magic gathering would become, and I also learned that magic generally wouldn't be used a lot in normal combat anyways, so you'd rarely touch your huge pile of magic spells unless a boss or healing.\n\nWhat really makes me like this system is equipping the spells to your stats, since the more magic you have of that type you're attaching to a specific stat (maximum 100 stack of any spell), the higher boost that stat would recieve. It also takes into account what kind of magic is being placed onto the stat, so placing something like... haste onto your speed stat would give it a massive boost. Casting spells equipped to your stats would cause that stat to lower, due to a smaller stack being there now, so you might end up finding a use for many spells you'd never even give the chance in other FF games.\n\nI've personally only played FF4, 5, 6, and 7 (as well as this game), but I find this manages to be my second favourite, even beating out games I have a nostalgic feeling for. A well-written and interesting story, wonderful soundtrack (even though I think this port has a different one, but I haven't heard the original), and a cast of characters I ended up warming up to the same as the protagonist.

We would come back home after school and progress slowly through the game. I remember how much we struggled with Mobile Type 8 the first time around  when we thought GFs were the way to go. FF8 was the first FF I played and it is my favorite. I have played every single FF game since FFIII and have always enjoyed the series (not so much the MMO variants). I have lost count how many times I beat this game on the PS2 and later using epsxe. I had save files where I literally maxed every stat on all characters. While I did not go quite that crazy this time around, playing FF8 on steam was a lot of fun. I took it much slower this time due to work and other obligations, but the game brought back a lot of old memories. The only aspect of FF8 I wish was different is how easy all aspects of the game (including Omega weapon) are once you have some tricks down. I enjoyed trying the various kick a** combos I had tried in the past. Squall/Rinoa/Zell (or Irvine) make the absolute best team. Nothing beats Rinoa's Angel Wing if she is junctioned properly with 255 magic and only Meteor and curative/support spells she won't cast while in Angel Wing (well unless you can guarantee Squall's Renzokuken goes Lion Heart everytime). And Irvine or Zell make great support. Or the triple Squall/Irvine/Zell combo is awesome too with more control (since Rinoa control is lost with Angel Wing limit) but less damage. Or even lesser damage combos with Quistis (great for non-boss mobs or even just utility) and Selphie. Playing around with various character combos was a blast :) While FF8 is not the most popular FF, it is definitely my favorite.","February 15, 2015","true","54.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It doesn't measure up to what Square Enix promised (audio quality is a massive issue; .MIDI music, poor sound effects) but overall it does play well. If you're wanting to jump into Final Fantasy, however, don't let this be your introduction to the series. The battle system in this particular title is one of the most complicated in the series and is not newbie friendly. So if you're not used to turn based RPGs, or even Final Fantasy in general, I would reccomend starting with 7 (which is also on Steam for a similar price). This is a good game but does not upscale to higher resolutions very well at all. It looks its best at 800x600, which is sad. It's a lazy port, but it plays well and is still a lot of fun.","January 14, 2014","true","46.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I must say the designers (or whoever prepared this version) did a really nice job making the controls computer-friendly.\n\nAs for the game itself, I love it. It's a great addition to the Final Fantasy series and allows you to tailor your characters any way you want. None of them have a predisposition for a type of activity (black magic, white magic, thief), so it's up to you to decide which stats they gain.\n\nI'm also impressed how well the graphics have held up. I suppose the resurgance of 8-bit homage games have helped, but it's always easy to tell how the characters are feeling.

Graphically it's mildly better, the audio sounds mildly worse (although I believe there are mods to get the psx audio installed,) and they have added cheating to help deal with the magic grinding.\n\nTo anyone who has not played an PSX generation Final Fantasy (7, 8, 9) they're all worth the time to play through and generally all have their own faults.  FF8 is generally very easy to beat, but does require substantial grinding, so the built in "Magic Boost" is a nice touch to make the game a bit less of a chore.\n\nIn general, if you like JRPGs, give this one a shot.  For all of its plot holes and grinding, it's a game that offers quite a few hours of play for not a whole lot of money.  For me, its a trip down memory lane, one of my favorite childhood video games, and a reminder of what an emo kid I was back in 1999.","December 12, 2013","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LunarLotus/recommended/39150/","LunarLotus","Luna Luck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LunarLotus/","456 products in account","I think this game was well made for it's time. It has its ups and downs but the pros seem to outweight the cons for me.\n\nFirstly, graphics were pretty much "make everything as 3D as possible" and was a nice step up from simply having characters move around on a set background. One could easily tell from even simple places that they tried to put as much detail as possible into things.\n\nThe cutscenes were rather nice for their time and if you pay attention near the end of Disc 1 (the parade) you'll notice the dance being done is very similar to Michael Jackson's Thriller dance. Another moment of hilarious in hindsight is a phrase Selphie tried to get going. "Booyaka!", guess which WWE wrestler would make that his catchphrase a couple of years later?\n\nThe battle system was different and kept the game at a challenging level, almost everything (save for a few bosses with levelc caps) leveled up as you did. This could be good or bad depending on how skilled of a player you are. If you play it well enough you can pretty much level up quickly right after obtaining Siren (Life-RF skill yourself Zombies + Life/Full-Life and go fight some T-Rexuar).\n\nWhile keeping a low level is generally advised to keep the game easy, going to over level 40 as early as disc 1 can prove helpful by getting some of the best skills in the game to junction to your characters making the rest of the game a cakeqalk (Junction either 100 Quakes or Ultima to Attack and say good-bye to difficulty~).\n\nThe music was excellent. Most of the music would fit the mood, although sometimes cheerful music would continue to play during times where it suddenly became very unfitting (nothing new there actually). The battle and boss music is what has always stuck out the most to me though, it always made me feel pumped and excited to keep playing the game.\n\nThe GFs were also another fun factor, some had really humorous attack animations (Tonberry, Cactuar, or the Brothers) while others could be downright frightening or strange (Eden, Doomtrain, or Diabolos (imagine a giant dark matter sphere crushing you into nothing!)). The junctions and abilities they give are incredibly helpful. However I tended to always need to make one of them forget SumMagic 10% to add a more needed ability such as HP-J or the coveted and rare Ability - x4 (Rosetta Stones are very hard to come by and unless you can find more than the one at Ultimecia's Castle, only the person with Bahamut will get the full benefit).\n\nOverall, I think this game was great for it's time and while the Romance theme is a bit strong, the game managed to remain fun to me then and still does now. 8.5/10, would recommend to others.","April 6, 2014","true","77.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is turn based, and it comes in the format of somewhat of a romantic novel between a Soldier and a Faction Leader. I Highly reccomend that You take your time reading and please for your own sake DO NOT RUSH, you will miss out on a breath taking story and its world; And i do mean this DO NOT RUSH.\n\nThis is my favorite Final Fantasy in the series, and yes i played 9, 10 , and reasonably 7 [i will get back to it].\n\nAnyway here it goes:\n\nThe Graphics.. don't give a damn about it, this isnt a remake is re-release of the game. Still love the original one on PS1\n\nThe Audio: It was very interesting to hear the MIDI structure Nobuo Uematsu put together, I was able to tell how he approached the themes, and where he could have possibly had trouble playing. [ Check out EDEA's Theme i believe is called sucession of witches, or the sucessor. Also check out Balamb's theme you would hear a  dissonant sound from both themes. So from musician to musician it was very exiting to hear what the next track would sound like in MIDI :D. Though I like the MIDI version in its own way, the orchestrated versions of the OST is by far better, and i mean waaaaay better.\n\n[b]The Gameplay:[/b] Turn based, OR NOT really. There is  ATB which is Active Time battle and you can basically bump this all the way up and it wont feel turn based. what this does is that it makes the battle waiting faster, and as you level up so do your sorroundings so it will be even faster! The magic in this game is not learned as an ability but drawn from Draw points and or monsters, and they do not take away any magic power, or MP, but they are stored in Quantities. To some this might be an abomination BUT to me this feels a bit interesting and maybe, challenging, because you will then learn not to waste magic, lets say you have for instance 10 curagas or 5 Meltdowns....ehheheh. you best use them wisely. I also love the Junction system because this gives the characters and the GFs more uniqueness, enough said.\n\n[b]One con[/b], and this is a big one for me, I DO NOT LIKE THE MAGIC BOOSTER, i think that takes away from the game, and also encourages people to cheat, which in my opinion  is a bad thing to do, because it takes away from the experience & who would want to cheat with such a good game? this turns off people.\n\n[b]On a side note[/b] if they were to do more Final Fantasy remakes' they should add an option that Filters the graphics of these games, they arent demanding anyways, to give them different tones.. that would be very very very cool.\n\nI will highly reccomend this game , dont worry about what people say about this title, everyone has their own taste,\n\n[b]10/10 - Personally[/b]\n.. Oh yeah & PLEASE IF YOU ARE A FF NEWBIEGO PLAY CLASICS LIKE THIS FIRST.","July 15, 2014","true","68.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've never been a huge fan of final fantasy with 8 being the only one in the series that I've beaten. To put it simply I love this game and it pairs up with Dragon Quest 8, another game by Square Enix that i absolutely love. I'll start off by saying Squall has to be one of the best characters I've seen in a long time and the character development of Squall over the course of FF8 is nothing short of spectacular. The love story is brilliant and anybody whos beaten the game and seen the ending you know how amazing it is. The reason I like Squall so much is that I can relate to him and being able to relate to the main protagonist of any game is a good thing. My favortie scene would have to be Squall and Rinoa on the ragnorak with the eyes on me theme song for the game playing. Truly beautiful scene.

I liked. You can't compare with Final Fantasy VII, but still worth playing. Sadly, it lacks of real markable characters. There are some interesting fellas, but nothing too much special. Squall saves the game. His own conflits are very interesting. Kinda remind me a little of Cloud Strike. There is a nice romance (a little corny but I can live with that), an amazing soundtrack and a lot of cool missions.\n\n- The villains are useless, Seifer (Squall's rival) is useless, the mini-games are lame and I think they should have shown the secondary characters a little more on CG's. Plus, when I was fighting the last boss, the game ran pretty slow during almost half of the battle. Like lagging. I dunno if there's something related to the music mod that I installed.

This game is turn based, and it comes in the format of somewhat of a romantic novel between a Soldier and a Faction Leader. I Highly reccomend that You take your time reading and please for your own sake DO NOT RUSH, you will miss out on a breath taking story and its world; And i do mean this DO NOT RUSH.\n\nThis is my favorite Final Fantasy in the series, and yes i played 9, 10 , and reasonably 7 [i will get back to it].\n\nAnyway here it goes:\n\nThe Graphics.. don't give a damn about it, this isnt a remake is re-release of the game. Still love the original one on PS1\n\nThe Audio: It was very interesting to hear the MIDI structure Nobuo Uematsu put together, I was able to tell how he approached the themes, and where he could have possibly had trouble playing. [ Check out EDEA's Theme i believe is called sucession of witches, or the sucessor. Also check out Balamb's theme you would hear a  dissonant sound from both themes. So from musician to musician it was very exiting to hear what the next track would sound like in MIDI :D. Though I like the MIDI version in its own way, the orchestrated versions of the OST is by far better, and i mean waaaaay better.\n\n[b]The Gameplay:[/b] Turn based, OR NOT really. There is  ATB which is Active Time battle and you can basically bump this all the way up and it wont feel turn based. what this does is that it makes the battle waiting faster, and as you level up so do your sorroundings so it will be even faster! The magic in this game is not learned as an ability but drawn from Draw points and or monsters, and they do not take away any magic power, or MP, but they are stored in Quantities. To some this might be an abomination BUT to me this feels a bit interesting and maybe, challenging, because you will then learn not to waste magic, lets say you have for instance 10 curagas or 5 Meltdowns....ehheheh. you best use them wisely. I also love the Junction system because this gives the characters and the GFs more uniqueness, enough said.\n\n[b]One con[/b], and this is a big one for me, I DO NOT LIKE THE MAGIC BOOSTER, i think that takes away from the game, and also encourages people to cheat, which in my opinion  is a bad thing to do, because it takes away from the experience & who would want to cheat with such a good game? this turns off people.\n\n[b]On a side note[/b] if they were to do more Final Fantasy remakes' they should add an option that Filters the graphics of these games, they arent demanding anyways, to give them different tones.. that would be very very very cool.\n\nI will highly reccomend this game , dont worry about what people say about this title, everyone has their own taste,\n\n[b]10/10 - Personally[/b]\n.. Oh yeah & PLEASE IF YOU ARE A FF NEWBIEGO PLAY CLASICS LIKE THIS FIRST.","July 15, 2014","true","68.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics have been improved upon, I'd say more but for those of you who played this when it was brand new, I will save the description so that you can see for youself.  A personal favorite of mine of all of the final fantasy story lines.  Game play seems a little simplified from the original game play version in that commands for the gunblade as well as other small functions in the game and it is enough of an improvement that it makes the game much kinder to a first time final fantasy player.\n\nFinal Fantasy is hard to get wrong, especially the originals but if you're new to the final fantasy experience I would recommend getting into it with these older versions as learning how the game works in these versions is easier and allows you to learn quickly when moving on to the newer versions of the game (you dont feel as lost when you know what you're doing).\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII's story line is one of the more light hearted ones so if you're looking for one that is feel good, this is one of the few.  I would recommend this game to any one and especially to RPG fans out there.  If you have not played it yet you really are missing out.

It is a re-release with very little changes, and some slight graphical upgrades, but only slight. Par for the course for Square Enix. Square Enix, you are reading this, please for the love of GabeN give these old ps1 titles a proper re-texture job please. Love them for their mechanics and story, but holy Cid could these use an update.\n\nNow if only they would release IX and X International on the PC. They can keep X-2 on the consoles though.  Square, if you do this, you have instant access to my wallet. Shameful i know, but there you have it.\n\nAll in all, i give the game a 4/5. It's not my favorite of the series, but it is good none the less, and definitely worth the purchase if you have not played the games before. That being said. Square enix REALLY needs to start thinking about their customers who have already bought all the other versions, even the original PC releases of 7 and 8. For us, this is almost a worthless purchase other than to say we have it legally on PC. Why do i say that? Well, mostly because all of these ps1 title re-rereleases can be played on an emulator, and sometimes with better resolution and even sometimes some extra texture filters. These are things that not even Square enix bothers to deliver on.\n\nSo, is this game worth a purchase. Sure. But understand that you really aren't getting much more than a quick re-release of an old game that already is playable in some other way, and in some cases, at even better quality. AND without having to log on to some server.........\n\nJust saiyan......","March 24, 2015","true","79.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Especially "contrived finish" which just makes you play the game in a totally different way. Such cool! WOW! But I guess some people can't be bothered with trophies.\n2) The Hi Speed (F1) option. Makes traveling back and forth a lot less tedious. I love it.\n3) Nostalgia. Yes, the game is as good as you remember.\n\nReasons not to:\n1) The port is TERRIBLE. Espcially for music. Don't despair! Mods make up for it. I only grabbed the Music Replacement mod (Roses&Wine) and the mood was set, but if you want, there's a lot of graphics enhancers/texture replacement and whatnot. They make it equal or better than PS1 version. And Achievements still work!\n2) Buttons are very hard to set and remember on a controller ("enter code: B4 B2 B3 B4" yaaaay).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/39150/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Final Fantasy 8 is another classic from Square and it's wonderful to finally see it on Steam.\n\nThe only problem is...this port is pretty lazy.  The first thing you'll notice is the music quality is garbage.  Square Enix decided to use the MIDI soundtrack files instead of the original Playstation tracks so from the first second you start up the game you'll notice the sloppiness of the PC version.  Luckily this is a pretty easy fix.  Just download the original Playstation soundtrack files and replace what's already in there - it doesn't even break achievement support.  That said, that just goes to show how really lazy this port to Steam was if they couldn't even be bothered fixing the audio quality for their target audience.\n\nAnother huge issue for me is the controller support is pretty subpar.  Instead of full integration with an Xbox / Playstation controller they use the "B1", "B2", "B3", etc. system.  Normally this wouldn't be a huge issue, but there are many times in the game that this type of controller support is extremely aggravating.  For example, Zell's limit break is all about hitting the proper buttons on your gamepad, but if they're labeled arbitrarily it doesn't work out so well.  The Timber mission also has you pressing buttons and entering codes and when you can't correlate those codes back to controller buttons it adds a level of aggravation.  You also can't map the D-PAD or triggers, so you're forced to walk around with the Joystick.\n\nIn addition to the above controller issue, there's an integrated launcher that requires you to use the mouse to enter the game instead of just taking you to the title when you start from the Steam client, and before you can actually start or continue a game you need to press the "B1" on the keyboard one final time before an attached controller will accept input - if you're playing on a couch (like I do) this involves a lot of switching between controllers until you finally get into the game - to make this worse, if your controller disconnects for any reason (let it sit idle too long) then you need to quit and restart the game before you can use that input option again.  In addition to the above, mapping the controls is both a mixture of in-launcher, and in the config menu of the game itself.  I found myself struggling with getting the controls right by messing in the config menu, quitting, adjusting in the launcher, and then tooling around in the config menu again for over an hour before I had it right.\n\nGranted, Square Enix put "Partial Controller Support" for this title, but it doesn't seem like it would take too long to fix the controller support (and replace the sound files in the installer).\n\nI'm recommending FF8 because it's a good game, I'm pleased to see it come to PC, and the MIDI file type is an easy fix - but really Square Enix, step up your game with these ports or I'll stick to emulation.","September 21, 2014","true","44.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics, in a different style, seem to have aged terribly on our HD monitors today. But this can take little away from the beautifully crafted world and pretty interesting (if rather unnecessarily confusing) storyline. Cards are still a blast to play and remain one of the best side-games to this day. Final Fantasy VIII is well worth another look on PC, although the mods are neither as plentiful nor as comprehensive as those for VII, this is perhaps also due to the fact that it was released much more recently. If you're looking solely for a nostalgia trip to 90s Final Fantasy, the 8th installment of the series is a very, very solid title, but I'd still always recommend its predecessor. 9/10.\n","August 13, 2014","true","70.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love the plot here, world  from this part and especialy characters. I like Squall much more than Cloud from predecessor. I like how Squall's change is show right from start until very end. From a lonely type who doesn't share his feelings with others to opposite. Well, yes. This is the easiest "Final Fantasy" but that never spoiled me fun from playing, especially that this one has the best mini-game from the series: Triple Triad. ("Final Fantasy IX" has similiar mini-game, but here was first.) Drawing magic from the enemies may not be the best part of game, but still, it's okay.  I remember when I played this many years ago on PSX, that time graphics was fantastic in this game, especially the FMV cutscenes, which looks great even now. And I can't forget about this fantastic music in game! So, if you're a "Final Fantasy" fan or you never played this and you like j-rpg games, this is one of the must have titles.\n\nPros:\nStory\nCharacters\nMusic\nTriple Triad\nGraphics ( of course it was, and I like it even now.)\nOne of the hardest bossess in "Final Fantasy" series - Omega Weapon\nCons:\nDraw system ( which is not that bad, but not the best either)\nToo easy difficulty level.\nMy rating: 10/10\nA classic in the j-rpg games.","July 24, 2014","true","81.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is not a port of the PSX version, but of the PC version, the visuals are a bit different and the Music is not nearly as good as the original Playstation version. If you have a Psp,Vita,Ps3, or even a Playstation you're better off getting the real Final Fantasy 8 experience there.

I found the game enjoyable doing runs of both those styles.\n\nAlso of all the "minigames" Final Fantasy has given us over the years, Triple Triad is still my favorite... I honestly would have payed the price of this game just to play Triple Triad on my PC.\n\nSo all in all I would definitely recomend this game to fans of the series, and doubly so to those who might have been on the fence because of angry opinions they may have heard... try it, if nothing else you will enjoy the card game.\n\n","December 5, 2013","true","31.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Though there are some tough enemies which you dont have to kill but u will feel great after defeating them.\n\nAgain the battlesystem is quite goood. You should speed it up in the menu though then u wont have to wait ages for each character to have a go. Magic isnt used by junctioning special materia to your character like in FF7. Here u have to collect the spells. U can either draw them from enemies or refine them (quickest way is refining them). U will have access to the open world pretty fast and can go exploring. Story takes place in pretty calm and colourful world. You can use magic for the battles and have the possibilty to summon Monsters to help you out.\n\nYou are a soldier of SeeD a special force who fights against witches. Yeah... witches... but luckily not the medieval witches :D They r just mean rly mean women with exceptional power who always want more... (sounds familiar?).\n\nMain focus, next to saving the world, is the rather complicated relation between the main character and one of his clients. Yes! This is an epic lovestory :D\n\nThe characters can be annyoing from time to time but after long speeches u will be rewarded with awesome cutscenes :D\n\nAll in all I enjoyed playing the game after 15 years and it is the second best RPG Squaresoft (Square Enix) has developed :D","March 29, 2014","true","114.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

The soundtrack is good, but it's no FFVII, and the cheap midi sounds are jarring when compared to the PS1 version. The pre-rendered backgrounds have very low resolution, and the characters stand out starkly against the world around them. The greater articulation and realism given to the character models is a blessing and a curse - their gestures are much more varied and identifiable, but the stylised actions and humour of the characters clashes with the life-like designs. The cuteness of FFVII's characters allowed a sense of humour and slapstick that doesn't comfortably carry over into this more realistic design, and leaves some moments feeling awkward, as if the designers couldn't quite meet the goal they were aiming for.\n\nIn contrast to FFVII, the game world opens up almost immediately, and rewards the player generously in terms of money. The 'Junction' system of battle is quite confusing to begin with, and may be prohibitively overwhelming for those with little patience, but once one learns the ins and outs of the system, the variation it allows makes the FFVII system feel like button-mashing child's play. The abolition of 'magic points', in favour of 'drawing' spells from the enemy and the environment is a refreshing change, and makes the battles feel less restrictive as you can more-or-less cast away to your heart's content, rather than constantly worrying about refilling the MP bar.\n\nOne feature I don't quite like is effectively making the summoned Guardians a default attack - watching their stunningly cinematic (and lengthy) attacks is fun for the first few times, but gets really tedious after a while, to the point that I could set one attack for each character, and then surf the web while all the cinematics played.\n\nAll in all, the gameplay is a noticable improvement over FFVII, although it comes a distant second in terms of audio-visual quality. Hopefully these issues are addressed at some point, but who knows. It doesn't kill the game for me, and FFVIII is much easier to pick up and play than its predecessor, but they are both worthy additions to the series, and were iconic games of their time.","December 13, 2013","true","22.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rasdaan/recommended/39150/","Rasdaan","Rasdaan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rasdaan/","234 products in account","The gameplay is pretty good. To make your characters stronger you use a junction system where you will equip magic to your stats. Drawing magic from monsters can take quite a bit of time, but you can use your GF (Guardian Force) to create spells out of items from your inventory. And then there is the awful card game that I never play.... Disc 3 is my favorite part of the game because that is when you can travel through the entire world, finding all the GF's and by far the best time to level up your characters.\n\nThe story is horrible. After disc 1 the whole thing falls apart. Luckily there are some fanmade theories that make more meaning into the story, such as the "Squall is dead theory" but as my brother says: "I dont believe in that theory because I doubt they were capable of telling a decent story."","December 30, 2014","true","43.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The Final Fantasy series has been around since the dawn of the gamer age and many RPGs have been modeled after the success of this series. Final Fantasy VIII is no exception. It is to this day a masterpiece that  captures the imagination and brings one into an epic and unique universe.\n\nPros:\nGreat gameplay - The junction system allows for magic and summons to effect the stats your characters have depending on how strong and what type of magic is placed into which stat slot. There is an open world to explore, which can allow access to towns and secret locations. This feature was removed from Final Fantasy X onwards.\n\nUnique Story - When this game was on the Playstation 1 it was 4 discs long. The game starts off with a cut scene followed by putting you straight into the action where you must complete a trial to obtain your third (you gain the first 2 from the computer room) Guardian Force. The game does an excellent job at character development and allows you to literally read what the protagonist, Squall is thinking.\n\nCons:\nDated graphics: While its true this is an old game, the graphics are still respectable and wont burn your eye lids off looking at.\n\nNo voice acting: You have to be ready to read a lot of text because theres no voice acting.\n\n\nConclusion:\nOverall this game is a GEM and must have for anyone who enjoys Final Fantasy or classic RPG's.","June 16, 2015","true","80.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has some pretty glaring flaws. First of all, you can't change the controls in-game (only in the pre-game menu). Secondly, the pre-game menu has a very big CHEAT HERE!!!! sign that allows you to bypass all kinds of things you'd normally have to earn yourself (money, spell inventory, etc.). Thirdly, the music they included are the awful MIDI files that are terribly low quality. You can fix this (one of the top-rated posts includes the link), but it's a needless hassle. On the plus side, the graphics look pretty good and the game includes ChocoWorld, which we PSX users never got. So like I said, it's a mixed bag. If you still have this on the PC with ChocoWorld, there's absolutely no reason to get the Steam release. If, however, you had it on PSX and would like to play ChocoWorld and use the items/characters from that side game in the main game, you might be interested in picking this up when it goes on sale.","September 27, 2014","true","3.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I don't really much care for 8's system though.. instead of just getting pow wacked enough they changed it to "yellow hp" then you just get it. Each limit break has its own gimmick to and nothing is more frustrating then finally pulling off a limit only to miss the triggers.. Also you can 'boost' your guardian forces to do extra damage but in a game as grindy as this one.. it adds alot of extra work as lazy as that sounds. As far as story goes its pretty awesome! Characters are pretty sweet to! Aside from the usual bland main character and in this one equally as meh love interest and rival... But the support cast is alot of fun!

The characters are fun, different and the story is immersive, allowing you freedom to choose how you boost your stats and what abilities you can use with the unique Junction system. Recommended to all who love the Final Fantasy series, or for those who enjoy the JRPG genre :3. While the PC version's music leaves a lot to be desired, there is an easy fix found in the FFVIII Steam forums called Roses and Wine. A simple way to retrieve the beautiful Playstation version music fans remember and newbies will appreciate.","June 19, 2014","true","156.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While this is largely due to the huge amount of nostalgia I have for the game that I spent just about every weekend of my childhood playing, FF8 is a game I still find myself playing to completion nearly 6 times a year. The Steam version is something i've been waiting for for some time, being someone who uses their PC more than any console. The remastered version does include some much needed brightness and sharpness to the every character model in the game, as well as redone portraits for the party members and guardian forces. However, the remastered version isnt without flaws. The music is not the original PS1 quality music, and is largely replaced by shoddier midi files that are less that are far from perfect, especially when compared to Nobuo's epics. The other drawback is that the Overworld looks just absolutely terrible. I'm not sure why the overworld looks as bad as it does, but it's pretty unforgivable, fortunatly you wont be spending too much time there. Fortunatly, both of these porting issues can be addressed through mods. The new addition also features a "Magic Booster" to help players struggling with the content, however I would advise against it, as half of the fun of playing the first time comes from clever use of "Junctions" which i'll go more into later.\n\nNow to review the actual game itself, as I said, Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite game ever made, however, i'm well aware of it's flaws. The game revolves around a "Draw" system, requiring character to absorb magic from enemies. After "Drawing" magic, the player can then use it to cast the spells stocked or to "Junction" it in various ways. The junction system allows the player to improve stats, everything from strength and speed, to more complicated stats like elemental resistance and status inflicting attacks are done through the junction system. The more magic stocked, the more potent the effect, and every magic has different stats with different attributes, so expiramenting around can be quite fun. However this comes at a price, drawing magic can feel quite tedious at times, and the junction system can feel a bit overwhelming to new players. But if you stick with it, it can feel quite rewarding to min-max and tweak characters to their roles.\n\nNext up are the "Guardian Forces", which are the various iconic Final Fantasy summons, but used in conjunction with the "Junction" system. GFs at their core, are powerful elemental attacks or party-wide buffs that take time to cast (but which bond with characters based on the frequency used, allowing faster cast times). But the GF's also level up and gain abilities, these abilities are then slotted into characters using the above mentioned "Junction" system. For instance, training Ifrit to give +60% strength, in addition to a very large amount of fire magic junctioned into strength, will tremendously boost a characters damaging abilities. Other abilities, such as Tonberry's "Junk Shop" allow the player to use a weapon shop from any point in the world. The GF abilities are fun and diverse, as they should be. Clever use of junctioned magic and capitalizing on enemy weaknesses is crucial to beating FF8's diverse boss encounters.\n\nThe story of FF8, is VERY JRPG, so be prepared for fur/feathers/romance/schools/other cliches'. If any of that bothers you, it might be time to turn away, as this is a Final Fantasy game, and story is kind of a big deal. Focusing on the theme of love, Final Fantasy VIII follows the mercenary Squall and his fellow soldiers of SeeD. While I personally enjoyed the story, and still do to this day, don't expect anything groundbreaking on the levels of games like Bioshock Infinite, you're playing a JRPG, and it's VERY apparent.\n\nEven with all of it's flaws, Final Fantasy VIII is still my favorite game ever made, and if you were on the fence about picking it up, I hope you found this review helpful. It has my undoubtable seal of approval, though I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.","December 12, 2013","true","78.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a great port. My only complaints are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MIDI music and the slightly awkward controls (which is just how it has to be as a result of being on a keyboard.)\n\nAs for the super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MIDI music, just download the mod Wine and Roses, and you'll be listening to Black Mages versions of the music even better than the original PS1 quality.\n\nThe junction system is very confusing at first, but its actually really sweet when you figure it out. Drawing does become tedious, but its almost unnecessary if you play Triple Triad and teach your GFs the abilities to "Refine" magic early. The CGI cutscenes that merge with the prerendered backgrounds are really one of the coolest things about FF7 and FF8, and they're especially awesome here (see the Parade sequence in particular.)\n\nThe story gets slightly convoluted, but nothing compared to the crazy nonsense that FF7 goes into (I also like FF7 so chill). The Laguna sequences make this game really stand out, and really make the world feel connected.\n\nOverall, FF8 has always been one of my favorite games, and is quite possibly my favorite FF game.. I'd reccommend it in a heartbeat, but you're doing the game a disservice if you don't install a mod to fix the trashy MIDI music.","January 3, 2014","true","50.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am glad I added this to my collection.\n\nAfter reading some reviews, I was concerned that this version was bad, but it seems that some of the complaints were a little misplaced in my opinion.\n\n\n\nSound\nSo here is the weird thing, everything sounds like the familiar way it is supposed be. Wav, midi, and old PS1 style. No HD Remastered sound effects or music, this is a good thing to me in this case. If you have problems, you may need to update drivers or your midi set. The orginal PC game had to install Yamaha Extensive MIDI sound library just to get the sounds to work (needless to say, you do not have to go through that trouble anymore).\n\n\n\nGraphics\nI have not tried the orginal mode, but I can clearly see what is going on. Some people might not know how bad a game designed for 4:3 CRT TVs look like on a 1080p screen, but overall this is a lot better than when it was orginally released. However there are some spots that look silly. You will know them when you see them. Take a deep breath and just keep playing\n\nBut the biggest suprise for me, is the overall FMV quality. I am very pleased with this because the FMV in the orginal PC release is more choppy on the recommend 800x600 (for the time).\n\n\n\nControls\nI would recommend using a controller, but it is optional. The direction movement is only 8 ways, true to its orginal version. If this puts you off, then this is not the game for you.\n\n\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who would enjoy an old jrpg from the 1990s. If you are worried about HD grapics and remaster music, then this game is not for you.\n\nAlso you will need a facebook account or a square/enix to sign in once before playing this. So make sure you have internet access the first time you start this. After that, you should be good.","January 8, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only complaints are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MIDI music and the slightly awkward controls (which is just how it has to be as a result of being on a keyboard.)\n\nAs for the super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MIDI music, just download the mod Wine and Roses, and you'll be listening to Black Mages versions of the music even better than the original PS1 quality.\n\nThe junction system is very confusing at first, but its actually really sweet when you figure it out. Drawing does become tedious, but its almost unnecessary if you play Triple Triad and teach your GFs the abilities to "Refine" magic early. The CGI cutscenes that merge with the prerendered backgrounds are really one of the coolest things about FF7 and FF8, and they're especially awesome here (see the Parade sequence in particular.)\n\nThe story gets slightly convoluted, but nothing compared to the crazy nonsense that FF7 goes into (I also like FF7 so chill). The Laguna sequences make this game really stand out, and really make the world feel connected.\n\nOverall, FF8 has always been one of my favorite games, and is quite possibly my favorite FF game.. I'd reccommend it in a heartbeat, but you're doing the game a disservice if you don't install a mod to fix the trashy MIDI music.","January 3, 2014","true","50.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am glad I added this to my collection.\n\nAfter reading some reviews, I was concerned that this version was bad, but it seems that some of the complaints were a little misplaced in my opinion.\n\n\n\nSound\nSo here is the weird thing, everything sounds like the familiar way it is supposed be. Wav, midi, and old PS1 style. No HD Remastered sound effects or music, this is a good thing to me in this case. If you have problems, you may need to update drivers or your midi set. The orginal PC game had to install Yamaha Extensive MIDI sound library just to get the sounds to work (needless to say, you do not have to go through that trouble anymore).\n\n\n\nGraphics\nI have not tried the orginal mode, but I can clearly see what is going on. Some people might not know how bad a game designed for 4:3 CRT TVs look like on a 1080p screen, but overall this is a lot better than when it was orginally released. However there are some spots that look silly. You will know them when you see them. Take a deep breath and just keep playing\n\nBut the biggest suprise for me, is the overall FMV quality. I am very pleased with this because the FMV in the orginal PC release is more choppy on the recommend 800x600 (for the time).\n\n\n\nControls\nI would recommend using a controller, but it is optional. The direction movement is only 8 ways, true to its orginal version. If this puts you off, then this is not the game for you.\n\n\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who would enjoy an old jrpg from the 1990s. If you are worried about HD grapics and remaster music, then this game is not for you.\n\nAlso you will need a facebook account or a square/enix to sign in once before playing this. So make sure you have internet access the first time you start this. After that, you should be good.","January 8, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The soundtrack is probably the best of any game i've ever played, the gameplay was exactly what you'd expect of an FF game with a battle and junction system that is one of the best in the series but above all that the story is what makes this such a standout in the series, i haven't found many RPG's outside this era where i actually gave more than half a ♥♥♥♥ about the story or the plethora of poorly developed one dimensional characters that came with them.\n\nThis version is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the MIDI music. The DRM is not an issue as you just need register once for a SQE account and you can play offline, mod, cheat and generally do whatever you want afterwards. It also looks a hell of a lot better than the original PC (and PSX) release, the backgrounds obviously aren't improved but the character models, attack, GF and spell animations are all greatly improved by the increased resolution support.\n\nI played this when it was first relased on steam and at the time there weren't alot of mods available besides Roses&Wine which is a must for improving the audio but some of the mods that are available now make the game look a hell of a lot better and i'll definately be using them next time.","March 29, 2014","true","41.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters, more modern/realistic tone, romance centric plot, Nobuo Uematsu's music (man with the machine gun? force your way? the extreme?) and a heavy dose of nostalgia earn it that. So you would think I was excited when I heard that it was coming to Steam - and I was - until I heard it was just a port of the original PC release.\n\nThe MIDI music in this game is a DOWNGRADE of the music on the Playstation 1. The menus are... ugly and look really weird. I don't mean to be that person, but the graphics aren't doing so well either. Gamepad support isn't all there. You need a Square Enix account to play the game. And before I find something else to complain about, if you have a similar experience as me, you might have incompatibility issues with more recent Windows releases, or the Steam overlay/achievements.\n\nBut hey, it has Chocobo World. That's nifty.\n\nJust buy the original game, whether that's on the PS1, PS3, or PSP. If you absolutely have to have it on PC, look into mods to fix the music and menus, at the very least.","December 29, 2015","false","139.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jenniphurr/recommended/39150/","Jenniphurr","Jenniphurr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jenniphurr/","328 products in account","Let me just get this out of the way, this game is fantastic. In fact I rate it higher than that other Final Fantasy that seems to get more attention. Maybe you agree with me or maybe you disagree but let me at least give you a couple of reasons that you shouldn't shy away from this gem. This game is unique and it is that same uniqueness that makes this game shine. Forget all the bad stuff people say about this game. Lets instead focus on the good that this game does.\n\nFinal Fantasy 8 did some wonderful things that no other FF title did. One of the most basic of JRPG principles, grinding battles. Well in short you don't need to really fight anything. I mean you can level up your charactors but there really isn't any real incentive to do it. For starters you are a student and you take a test early in the game. This test determines you pay or salary. Plus if you don't do so hot on the test you don't get a high salary. You can retake the test to do better and get paid more as well. So no need to really grind mobs for money as you get paid at regular intervals just like a job. I believe this is a plus as it allows for me to explore the world and without the need to stop and fight over and over. Also note, that bosses do not give out EXP at all. So theoretically, you could go thru the game at the starting level if you really wanted to.\n\nSo lets talk about the leveling system in the game, another plus to FF8's formula. The game uses a scaling system, which means the higher level you are the mobs scale to always give a challange of sorts. Which in every other game is a bad. I truely despise level scaling. It defeats the purpose of leveling to get stronger but this game bring a happy medium to play. FF8 intruduces the "Junction System". This entails a few things. One you "draw" magic from a couple of places. You can also "draw" from special points that refresh every so often to aquire more. You can "draw" from mobs as well. Now you can use these spells in battle which is fine, but let me say this game isn't really about magic as the other Final Fantasys. If there was a "grind" in the game its from drawing magic to aquire enough of it. So what is the point of magic if you don't really want to use them against mobs? Well as I was saying earlier, FF8 uses a "Junction System". This allows you to "Junction" magic to your main attributes. Your Hp, Mp, Att, etc. Doing this augments your abilites and makes you pretty damn strong. This is also how you overcome the level scaling to make your character stronger. You can level up but remember, mobs scale with you so this allows you to overcome this "handicap". If there is a "grind" in FF8, this is it. Which if you ask me, its far better "drawing" for magic than spending more time to grind for EXP for hours on end. I also told you that you could beat the game at the starting level. Which sounds bad but honestly beating the game at a lower level is way easier than a high level. Using the Final Battle as a reference, without spoiling, beating it at a low level was hard but certianly not difficult. But i will say beating it at max level was one of the most challenging battles I have ever done in a game before. It took me close to 2 hours to beat that battle. With the active battle and max level I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Note that it took me many of times to even succeed in doing this. It was simply a rewarding feat to acomplish. I can also atest to this being the hardest boss I have fought from any of the other Final Fantasy titles.\n\nSome tweaks have been done to the actual battle system. The main charactor uses a weapon called a gunblade. In battle you can attack like you normally would with no problems. But it has another feature that allows for it to do more damage. If you press a certain button at the precise time, you will pull the trigger and shoot as you attack. This effectively adds more damage to your normal attack. It uses a turn base battle system that is active, which means you have to think fast on your feet. No planning your attack like chess for the best move, you have to be quick and do something or just keep getting attacked over and over. Some might see that as a turn off which I can understand just be aware its there. Summons are back in this game as well. They will be mighty helpful. They also learn abilites as well. Most noteworthy is the "boost" ablity. This allows you to push a button repeatedly to amplifiy the damage done. Its a nice to be able to do that but after the bazillionth time it will get old. Still to this day I would have like to have a final ablitiy to just do max damage without that button mashing marathon. Also the animations for the summons are top notch for its time. Truely amazing but some are really long and overdone, would have been nice to be able to skip them. Annoying yes, dealbreaker no.\n\nProbaly the most agreeable positive about FF8 is its included "card game". Triple Traid is its name and it is crazy fun that I am suprised was never given its own game. It sorta starts out slow but as you collect more cards you really start being sucked into it grasp. I personally have logged into FF8 just to play the card game and nothing else. So simple, but yet so much depth and strategy. Traveling to new areas brings about new rules to the game. Some of these rules are good and some downright brutal. Also there are "rare" cards to win from certain people. Some you might only have one chance to aquire so maybe using a guide isn't a bad idea in this area.\n\nTo talk about the story would ruin alot of it. I won't mention it but I'll hit on a few high points. I kinda throws you right into the middle of everything and you'll feel like you understand what's going on. Then you'll go from knowing what going on to not having the slighest clue. That formula happens multiple times in this game. But each time it happens the story gets deeper and more seems to be happening. It gets dangerously close to being to long. When I first played this on the Playstation 1, I was  wondering what was on disk 4 for the longest time. Even when I was at the end of disk 3 I felt like I had done so much I couldn't believe there was still a whole other disk to run though. Although in hindsight, disk 4 felt almost out of place and to this day I still believe it was only that way because the amount of data on a cd-rom wasn't enough to do it the way it should have been. I works but only like hitting a foul ball 1 foot away from being a home run.\n\nOther worthy mentions are the locations. The cities are big and give a feeling of being alive. The music sets a nice tone to the atmosphere. Still some of my favorite music in the series, not that any really stand out but they fit the games vibe. They are rendered backgrounds but still beautiful to look at. Throughout the world you can use roads to navigate around. You also gain access to cars to drive around the overworld. These greatly help speed up travel times. There are a few other ways of travel but I don't want to spoil any crazy details. Although I will say the "airship" in this game is the freaking best of all the FF games.\n\nWhat else is there in FF8? Quite a bit more if you ask me. For one it feels more like a world than past Final Fantasy titles. Or maybe I should say a little more grown up. This game as a whole seems more mature. But its overall experiance that makes it shine. The story goes up and down. There are high points and low points. But you are doing yourself a disservice if you pass on this up. Final Fantasy 8 knows its not like the rest of the series and its proud of that fact. If you give it a chance, you might be pleastantly surprised that you wished played it sooner.","December 5, 2013","true","111.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/39150/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 90%Final Fantasy VIII was the point where the series reached a whole new level, thanks to small changes like the focus on the romantic story elements and the more realistic character design. The Steam edition includes a few additional features over the old PC release, making it one of the best ports of the game so far, recommended for old fans or newcomers who would like to experience one of the gems of the golden age of Final Fantasy.\n\nLong version:Final Fantasy VIII was sort of a trailblazer when it came out. This was the first Final Fantasy game where we said goodbye to the traditional NES/SNES era cartoonish characters in favour of a more realistic design, and where the romance plot-- which is normally a secondary or tertiary storyline in similar games-- is promoted to be in the focus.\nThis won’t turn FFVIII into a romance/dating game, far from it: your main task is still to save the world/universe from the ridiculous-haired main villain. To do so you’ll have to gather friends and allies, explore much of the planet, and of course slowly discover a rich backstory told in two separate timelines, which will eventually (with a little guess work) uncover one of the most confusing, yet best-written stories of the genre.\n\nGameplay-wise FFVIII is a bit of an odd one out in the series with the large amount of gameplay changes it features. Although a lot could be said about these, the length of a Steam review simply cannot hold this much information, so let’s just say that some of them, like the expanded Limit Breaks, are favourably looked upon and work well; while others, like the junction system, were met with great opposition and never returned in later games.\n\nThe Steam version can be considered a well enough port of the original PlayStation release, with a bunch of really nice technical features, including better display compatibility and more user-friendly controlling. Sadly, like the Steam version of Final Fantasy VII, it features a subpar version of the original PSX music tracks, the same ones that were used in the original PC version.\n\nOverall, the Steam Edition is Final Fantasy VIII may not be the HD remake lot of people still want, but it is a good port of an excellent game, well worth of owning and playing, even if you have the original PSX disc somewhere.","October 8, 2014","true","53.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Improved character models are good, more so than VII's, and comes with the pocketstation game chocobo world if you want to make your already overpowered characters absurdly more so by wiping and re-customizing all your GFs with the items you can net yourself in that.\nMajor drawback of this port is that unlike VII, they didn't fix the music so you're stuck with lower quality MIDI versions unless you mod it. As far as I know they haven't fixed this and likely don't plan to, so mods to the rescue.","May 12","true","30.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And not having to download an OpenGl hotfix to run 1920x1080x32 is a nice feature. I haven't tried the new graphics mode yet (because I'm a purist!) but I'm sure they inclide higher-res textures and some neat particle effects.\n\n\nThere are a couple rather small things I'm sure will be fixed in the new future\nStrangely enough, and even with controller support, the game will not recognize the D-pad on my controller, so I still have to use a pinnical profile to use the D-pad (which feels natural for this game). Even weirder (and kind of annoyingly) there is NO controller support for out-of-game menus, like the startup menu, or the pre-game start menu so you're forced to use the keyboard.

Already owning a copy of FF8 for the PS1, I know how well the game should play out. As per usual playing this on a different platform doesn't always result in better performance.\n\nSoon as I dive into FF8 I notice the audio is unbelievably sub par for even the PS1's FF8 version. The music isn't anywhere near the same quality as it was on the PS1, it still sounds more midi then orchestral. Some SFX are even buggy! For example: The SFX for summoning Quetzalcoatl isn't even the correct one, you notice the sound is off because the SFX playing for Quetzalcoatl is actually the SFX that's supposed to be used for Phoenix Pinion.\n\nThe 90's trend of pre-rendered 3D backgrounds is back and have not been improved so expect alot of jaggy edges. The cinimatics still look quite the same but at least seem to have been improved to look nice, although the trailer looks much nicer, the ingame isn't quite the same.\n\nGranted as I'm writing this I have only been as far as just recently beating Ifrit. After finding minor inconsistencies I'm quite afraid I'll find more broken things along the path.\n\nThis game isn't without its positives, you do have the full game so the hassle of changing discs is out the window. The player models have been significantly improved making them look much sharper. The game comes with steam achievments. It also comes with magic boost, what this does is it gives all your current characters have automatically obtained predefined magic stocks to their inventory. This ability can be used on any save file as many times as you want.\n\nAlso packaged in this release is Chocobo World so If you had that PS1 copy of FF8 and had only herd about Chocobo World and never had a chance to play it, then here it is.\n\nAlthought I may sound harsh towards this I still loved playing this or obviously I wouldn't have given it a thumbs up. It's great to be able to play this game once again.\n\nTo be clear, this is more of a re-release so don't expect it to be full HD.","December 5, 2013","true","21.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

However, it is also incredibly convoluted and filled with many plot holes.  If you finished listening to some NPC's explanation about what is going on and still have no clue who's side they are on, then the story is too convoluted for its own good.  The one redeeming quality is that the main characters are well-defined.  You could easily identify with the main character, Squall.\n\nGraphics – 4/5 -> 80%\n\nThe graphics are much improved over the horrible graphics of the previous game.  Some parts of the game still have rough edges, like a few of the character models, but for the most part, you shouldn't really notice any problems (at least for graphics of its time).  In particular, the FMVs look spectacular and flow smoothly with the rest of the game.\n\nSound – 5/5 -> 100%\n\nNone of the music or sound effects felt out of place.  Of particular note is the boss theme music which provided an appropriate adrenaline rush.\n\nControls – 9/10 -> 90%\n\nEven if you have a problem with the default controls, it is possible to redefine them, and none of the extra ways the main controls were used for “minigames” felt awkward or misused.  The only problem I experienced was that the overworld was incredibly disorienting to navigate without the map open.\n\nResources – 5/5 -> 100%\n\nUnlike the Playstation version, this version of FFVIII comes with Chocobo World without the need for a Pocketstation.  This provides an extra source for items beyond the main game.  Even if you choose not to abuse Chocobo World, FFVIII provides plenty of ways to keep your stats in tip-top shape.\n\nOne interesting resource system in this game is the SeeD rank.  Depending on your rank, you will be paid a certain amount as you walk around the world.  The higher your rank, the more you are paid.  There are a variety of ways to increase your rank, including monster kills and several sidequests.  This ensures you don't have to always face monsters to grind for gold if you don't want to.\n\nPlayer Growth – 3/5 -> 60%\n\nFFVIII's unique system is the Junctioning system.  Summon spirits are called Guardian Forces, or GF, which can be linked to particular characters to give them new abilities.  GFs can be taught new abilities for your characters to use as well as slots for particular stats in order to boost them with magic.\n\nIn addition, enemies level with you, in order to attempt to balance the game.  However, the game is not very well balanced for both newcomers and veterans alike, as leveling up too much tends to make the game more difficult, and it is possible to obtain late game magic spells at the beginning in order to boost your stats ridiculously high.\n\nLearnability – 4/5 -> 80%\n\nThe game regularly provides the option to view a tutorial on various game mechanics.  Unfortunately, it can be rather invasive when you are given a chance later in the game to view a tutorial of a concept you have already been taught.\n\nOne feature of note is the SeeD Test.  In addition to increasing your SeeD rank, tests also provide a way to test your knowledge of the game mechanics.  The tests can prove to be a nice refresher if you forget anything, since you can view them at any time.\n\nDifficulty - 12/15 -> 80%\n\nThe game initially provides a nice blend of challenging gameplay.  However, it does not provide enough challenging end-game content.  There is a super boss, but it is easy to defeat compared to other Final Fantasy games with super bosses.\n\nEntertainment – 38/40 -> 95%\n\nWhile the game is not very challenging overall, the Junction system still makes the gameplay very enjoyable.\n\nReplay value – 3/5 -> 60%\n\nAs with most single player games, there is not much incentive to play the game again, especially if the story hurts your head.  However, the Junction system provides many different ways to approach boss fights.  It can be interesting to experiment with different approaches and create your own challenge runs.\n\nTotal – 84/100 -> 84%\n\nI would recommend at least giving the game a try if you have never played this game before on the Playstation.  It is very fun to experiment with the Junction system and different magic spells.  If you have played the Playstation version and you are a completionist, you might still want to buy the PC version for the inclusion of Chocobo World.","March 2","true","411.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

As a matter of fact, if they're letting some sub-standard music get in the way of the game, they probably don't even like the game to begin with and should be disregarded entirely.\n\nFirst of all: the music isn't that bad. It's not bad at all, in fact, and certainly not enough to make people NOT reccomend the game. It has a retro feel to it, which, for any other game, people would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ing over because #RETROISAWESOMELOL.\n\nSecond of all: yes, there is a second layer of DRM. Squeenix's login thing. I haven't had issues with my internet in long enough to accurately remember whether or not you actually NEED a constant stable connection, but I seem to recall that with FF7, you could play offline just fine as long as you had an account, which isn't difficult to create (and fake, if you so desire).\n\nThe game itself remains one of Final Fantasy's most underrated titles. People ♥♥♥♥♥ed about the need to "grind" magic for the "unintuitive" junction system, but how is it any worse than grinding hundreds of millions of XP in any other title? I find the Junction system is laid out very simply and is easy-to-use. But then, I have at least two functioning brain cells to fire neural impulses between, so it wouldn't have taken me much effort to figure out even if I didn't understand it at first.\n\nThe characters are deep and relatable, to an extent (I mean, how well can you actually relate to a bunch of teenagers who were riased to be elite mercenaries during their childhood). The story is engaging, if somewhat generic, but they genuinely tried to mix it up. The love interest plot developes naturally, though it gets somewhat rushed at one point late in the game when Female Love Interest (tm) goes into a coma and Male Love Interest (tm) who had previously been pushing her away constantly suddenly and abruptly realizes how much he needs her. Overall, it's a very good game. I look forward to when Squeenix releases FF9 for the PC *coughcough*hinthint*cough*getonityoulosers*cough*.","December 5, 2013","true","79.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Played this in 1999 with my brother when I was around 7! If you never played this game, you wouldn't believe how rich the story was, and how wide the range of the conflicts really are. Game is set in the future, but somehow post-apocalyptic after what happened in Centra around 4000 years ago, a Lunar Cry, where in current time people rebuild Centra into what is called a Garden. Relationships in this game are two of the most contributing factors, while others include politics, war, sorcery, and just massive destructions.\n\nThe game's background arts look ethereally.. poetic. It is just simply stunning. They're all 3D environment, just rendered into 2D and made it into a background where the 3D low-poly (characters) move accross the 3D space that have been motion-tracked to the background. The designs are mostly steampunk (architectural elements of Greek and French) combined with futuristic elements (try to observe the 3D models, colors, sounds, and advanced technology in the game).\n\nBest battle system of all time. Indescribably cool. Junctioning GFs and Magic, draw, limit breaks, elements, statuses, real-time turnbased, weapon forging, student exams, and tons of other stuff. Just get the game and play it. And play its card-game, it's fun as hell.","June 13, 2015","true","53.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

Putting that aside, the nostalgia alone was something for me not to pass up. If you want a cutting edge game, this is not for you.

The tecture quality is better for in battle effects like drawing magic, and areas are no longer fuzzy. Also the PC version came with Chocobo World! Which the steam version also has. Chocobo World is this cute little 8 bit game that uses mostly FF7 music and your chocobo auto battles enemies, when winning a fight a 3x3 grid shows up and a random spot in that grid fills in. Keep killing enemies until you fill out a row and you level up. Find your Cactaur friend in game and he gives you items you obtain in FF8 at the chocobo forest.

I know I have played through this game at least 3 times for the original PS version. I did lots of grinding to get all the items and collectables and I spent well over 400 hours on the PS one version.\n\nThe graphics were top of the line for its age and the gameplay (although much easier than other Final Fantasy games) has amazing playability with lots of in game collectables. The steam achievements are a nice addition to the game because it allows the player (especially new ones) to gauge their progress in the game. I personally already have them all and it took me about 100 hours to do it (again, I already bet the game multiple times and know all the secrets).\n\nThis is personally my all time favorite game due to having:\n*Great story line (good plot points with lots of inside jokes)\n*Amazing cut scenes\n*LOTS of playability\n*The best mini-game ever  (Triple Triad card game) (that's my opinion)\n*Simple design character builds  (Positive and Negative - I would have liked to have had the ability to equip different types of armor to my characters for customized builds and appearance, but with the magic junctioning system it would have made the game mechanics A LOT more complicated)\n\nI highly recommend this game. By far my favorite game to date.","July 20, 2014","true","109.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With FF8, you have a somewhat unlikeable punk kid protagonist that, through the 4 discs of the game, developes and starts becoming a man.\n\nFF8 had the least amount of plot twists I feel. You have the main goal through most of the game: Kill the Sorceress!\n8 has an awesome love story, a very likeable cast of characters, and amazing graphics for its time. I still get goosebumps watching the intro scene.\n\nThere's some definite flaws with this port, but this will probably always be my favorite of the series and my favorite childhood game as well. I read a review earlier recommending this to younger audiences, couldn't agree more.

Sorry to say that the PC port of this game is absolutely horrendous. It's not worth the purchase even on a deep discount.\nThe foremost problem is the controls: the button/key labels in-game are indicated using B1, B2, ... B10. Sure, you get shown the button meanings when the game boots, but it's not very useful when you can't remember the key combination for 'escape from battle' (required for the plot in the first game mission) and the in-game comments are useless. Also, don't bother with the controller support for this game. I attempted to use my wired 360 controller and found that the left and right triggers and the directional pad aren't detected -- you can't specify them in the custom configuration screen. (Also, there goes Zell's limit break.) On an aesthetic note, you should probably just mute the game instead of trying to tolerate the lo-fi, MIDI quality music. It's a shame, because the Dollet music mission is one of my favorites. Also, 'Magic Boost'? Seriously? Drawing magic was a HORRENDOUS idea to begin with, but Magic Boost is pretty much game breaking if you use it early on (it gives you 100 of the fire/thunder/blizzard, fira/blizzara/thundara, firaga/blizzaga/thundaga, all the status effect spells, and a few others... but fortunately it doesn't give you 100 of the top-tier spells like ultima, aura, etc) The game wasn't hard, there's no need for this kind of cheat.","January 1, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I played FF 7 some time ago and actually liked it.\n\nFINAL FANTASY VIII plays very much like an interactive novel. While it is technically an open world game, this world is pretty much empty aside from the storyline. If you know that something like that will bother you, there is no reason to read on.\n\nYou will only like this game, if you like its story:\nAt the beginning of the game you are a young elite mercenary, who is just about to finish his final tests to become a full fledged member. This guy is antisozial, lacks understanding of his own emotions and has trust issues. The story is pretty much a coming of age story, with topics like taking on responsibility, friendship, first love, etc.. I would say the story is mostly aimed at 12 - 15 year olds. While it is certainly not an award-winning story it is not too bad either and it is always hard to treat those topics without getting too cheesy.\n\nI actually like the graphics and have the impression that the game aged pretty well. Sadly the port is not well made. If you decide to pick it up, i would advice you to get the roses and wine mod. This mod introduces better music and volume control for the music. And you will absolutley want this volume control after a few hours X).\n\nNow we come to the gameplay (running around and fighting) which is simple no fun. I will not go into detail. I am sure that this has already been discussed "in great detail aka with much swearing" somewhere else.\n\nI felt pretty OP from the start. The battle system is laborious, while not being complex. This is the biggest game design sin for me. It's a little bit like the game gives you a hundred buttons you can use and a big red one that says press me. Why press all the other buttons if the big one does the trick. The draw system makes this game extremly grindheavy and slow paced.\n\nWhat actually really infuriated me during gamplay was the way the game spams you with absolutly powerless and meaningless enemies. I would say 90% of all battles fall under this categorie. In the most extreme cases the enemies are so weak, that you could let the battle go one for 20 mins without doing anything and still win. If you played pokemon just imagine a game that constantly nags you with fighting safcons. This, combined with the fact that you often run around aimlessly, can aggravate even the most patient person. (I think the only reason why these enemies do exist is as refueling stations. Yes you actually heal yourself up by fighting them.)\n\nThe last thing I have to say about this game is, that it does a pretty bad job at communicating what you can interact with. While I expect that some people will call this exploration, I think people should not have to go around clicking at and bumping into things in their spare time. This behavior is normally reserved to insects (flys and windows).\n\nI played this game only till the end of disc 2, so everything i wrote here does not inlclude the following chapters. All the issues i described here were present from minute one. I only played so far because i thought the game might get better at later stages. It did not up to that point.\n\nI can understand everyone that likes the game. The presentation is pretty much spot on, the gf animations are pretty cool and the story is not bad either. But the actuall gameplay isn't even mediocre. For me gameplay trumps everything else, so i give this game a thumbs down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 6","false","38.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/39150/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","inb4 fanboys mark this review as unhelpful because I didn't give it a 10/10.\n\nBear in mind that I am reviewing this game from the 2015 point of view, having not played it back in its day, and I have zero nostalgia for it.\n\nGiving a review for this game is extremely difficult. It has a lot of interesting systems that make it one of the most interesting Final Fantasy games in the series. On the other hand, everything that is good and interesting about the game is opposed by a nearly equal ammount of convoluted or just plain terrible design decisions that will frustrate a modern player to no end. Some of this stuff may have been able to fly on the PS1 back in 1999, but in 2015, this stuff can grate your nerves. So let me try to point out the good and bad.\n\nDRAW SYSTEM - THE GOOD: The draw system refers to the fact that characters don't have personal magic on them at all times. Instead, magic is reduced to consummable items (e.g. to cast Blizzaga, you will need to use 1 blizzaga item). To get more spell items, you have to "draw" them (i.e. steal them) from enemies. The number you get is random. Sometimes you get zero or one, but a lot of times you'll get 5 or 6 at once. Each enemy has a menu of spells you can steal from. More useful and powerful spells can only be stolen from mini-bosses, bosses, and rare enemies. Once you've stolen the spell items, you can use them in combat or you can fuse them to specific stats to boost a character's parameters, like boosting fire def, or adding fire to their attack, or increasing HP or vitality, etc. You have the option to either steal the enemy's spell (add it to your inventory) which just gives you the item and ends your turn, or you can cast the enemy's own spell at the enemy party immediately.\n\nDRAW SYSTEM - THE BAD: As much as all of the above is interesting, you may find it frustrating that spells are essentially just items. You may also find it frustrating that, in order to stock up on specific spells (especially more rare ones), you just waste a lot of turns usings your characters to steal, steal, steal, etc etc 100 times. Stealing the spells is primarily useful for boosting parameters. The guardians (who we'll discuss in a moment) are so powerful that actually using the spells in combat is only sometimes---but rarely---useful.\n\nGUARDIAN SYSTEM - THE GOOD: The game calls them "guardian forces" for some reason, but let's call them what they really are: summons. So this game decides to make summons front and center. You collect new summons as you go through the game, which can be assigned to any character. Every summon has its one powerful spell it can cast, but if you grow each summon (like a pokemon!) it can become more powerful, boost the parameters of the ally using it, give the user more skills/abilities, or allow the user to summon it into battle more quickly. The summons are powerful, and you will want to use them a lot.\n\nGUARDIAN SYSTEM - THE BAD: The summons are so powerful that you will want to use them almost exclusively. Physical attacks and magic attacks are, on average, so pathetic compared to summoning that you will only end up using physical/magic attacks "just for fun", or in the rare circumstances when you need to beat some enemy's gimmick. (basic attacks get better over time, but do you really want to wait 60 hours for them to get better?) What about elemental weaknesses? Yeah, enemies have them, but if its a choice between casting firaga or summoning Ifrit on them, what are you going to do? You'll spam Ifrit. Managing the guardian forces is also laborious. It's about as exciting as meticulously shifting all of your materia gems around in FF7, only it involves an even more convoluted system of sub-screens, and sub-sub-screens, and even sub-sub-sub-screens. If I were new to RPGs, I would have quit this game out of frustration just on account of its dogpiled menus. Also, even though the game has TONS of summons to find, you will absolutely miss the vast majority of them unless someone tells you in advance that most of them can only be stolen from bosses (via the "draw" command) or under special circumstances. You essentially need a strategy guide opened up as you play, if you don't wanna miss a ton of them. Also, the summon animations are sooo long. They are painfully long. And since they are the focus of the game, you have to sit dumbly and watch them a lot. This is slightly improved when they level up enough to learn "boost", which allows you to play a button tapping mini-game to pass the time during the animation and raise the attack power of the summon, but 1) you'll have to check a strategy guide to learn how boost works, because the game can't be arsed to explain it; 2) they are sooo long though.\n\nCHARACTERS - GOOD: In-game character models look much better than the dopey FF7 ones, although their faces do look kinda pinched and weird. Squall always looks cross-eyed, but I accept that because it amuses me. The characters and story get more attention and are overall more appealing than FF7 in my opinion.\n\nCHARACTERS - BAD: A lot of cliche (but that's typical of JRPGs). Squall is a stereotypical angsty and brooding I-hate-everything-and-have-a-bad-attitude-leave-me-alone-and-get-out-of-my-room emo teenage boy type. At least at first. As a teenage boy I would have thought he was the coolest. As a grown man, I find him immature and irritating. He gets better. Oh, and as much as other FF8 fans have told me they like the segments, you also will have your game and story progress continually interrupted by a "Biggs and Wedge" sequence, where you have to play through a complete dungeon and story sequence as some characters you don't know. After you play a lot of them, they will start to tie into the main story more and make more sense, but for a long time they are complete non-sequiturs. Who are these people? Why do I care? Can this just be over so I can go back to Squall and friends? What is the point of this? Maybe you'll dig it, but these felt like disruptions (or interruptions) to me, so I didn't care for them.\n\nOTHER - BAD: Convoluted menus. Fails to explain some game features completely or gives very poor explanations of other features (there is a tutorial/guide available, but its helpfulness varies). While the draw/guardian (aka steal/summon) systems are interesting in a lot of out-of-combat ways, they also make the inside-combat part of the game feel lopsided and weird. Plus they require an inordinate amount of fiddling in menus---as bad as fiddling with materia gems or worse (but, hey, some people love all of that fiddling, so if that's you, have fun). The game also some very bad dungeons in it, such as one dungeon consisting of 15 copy-pasted floors of the exact same doughnut-shaped room you have to run completely around (i.e. poor design trick used to make you trip more random encounters while not caring enough to make the dungeon any more interesting). The game is also a completely clutz when it comes to save points. Don't be surprised if you are made to sit through 30-minutes of unskippable story sequences and then ambushed with a boss fight you had no way of knowing was coming. No saves. If you die or forget to steal the guardian force, prepare to do that entire 30-minute boring story sequence again. This doesn't just happen once. It is a repeat problem. The game tends to suck at save point placement in general.\n\nSteam only allows thumbs up or thumbs down, when what I'd like is a pair of shrugging shoulders that says "mixed feelings". You might like it! But for me personally, in 2015, the number of tiny annoyances, deliberate inconveniences, and questionable or convoluted design choices just adds up to me banging my head against the wall a little bit too often. Like the world's cutest dog that also won't stop sh***ing on the floor, it is a thing I feel compelled to love with all my heart but equally as often feel compelled to drop off on the side of the road.","March 14, 2015","false","36.8"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","49","22","45","6","0"

Yup, nevermind the fact that they should re-relase with REMASTERED music for today's standards, they released it with worse sound that the PSOne version.\n\nDo not buy this crap.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Detrial/recommended/39150/","Detrial","Detrial","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Detrial/","383 products in account","Quite possibly one of the greatest stories of all time. The artwork and CGI of the Final Fantasy games during the late 90's was some of the best displayed in a video game during that time. This game was confusing, surprising, and captivating from beginning to end. There are secrets around every corner, not quite as much as Final Fantasy VII, but even more so when you consider the content provided with the card system and spell system. Some complain that the spell system is confusing, but a simple google search for a guide or video explination will solve confusion issues these days. The graphics upgrade provided with the PC version is really only an upgrade of the 3d modeling in the game. Fight scenes look a bit cleaner but it is clearly apparent that no improvement was made in regards to textures or higher texture sampling for the higher resolution options. This actually creates a very ugly full screen appearance when traveling through areas in towns. I am completely confused at Japan's approach to PC remakes of their console games. The lack of video options and the requirement for a launcher brings me back to 1998 when I was playing 'Redneck Rampage' on my Pentium III. If you really MUST have this game for PC like me, or if you insist on experiencing this game for the story, get it. Otherwise skip it.","December 10, 2013","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/folcro/recommended/39150/","folcro","Folcro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/folcro/","562 products in account","I have a strange relationship with this game.\n\nThe junction system is amazing; its QTE scenes drive me up a wall. I fell in love with the characters, when they weren't being bland obnoxious plot devices. Its story is grand and beautiful; the romance can choke a horse. It is the game that sparked my passion for storytelling; it is a game that rouses my passion for critique.\n\nThis was the first Final Fantasy I played (I would later find it difficult to get into its predecessor). While VII's opening scene was mysterious and atmospheric, you could feel here in VIII how personal the story set out to be, even though you knew nothing about these two men or what their beef with one another was about. At the moment, it didn't matter--- you felt immersed in characters who each wanted something badly enough to entertain the hell out of us to get it.\n\nThe graphics in the cut scenes and environments were cutting edge, barely manageable on the original Playstation console (for those unaware, the original copy of the game was laid out on four beautifully covered compact discs). They were employed conservatively, providing emotion through character's facial expressions at the right moments, even though no voice acting was ever used. This brought the characters to life in a way I hadn't seen before. And being a dumb kid (I was eleven), these kinds of visuals helped my imagination stir. Manipulative? If you think so, I won't get you started on the music, another element applied with deadly precision to suck me deeper into this world.\n\nThe story centered around people young enough to be in school but old enough for me to look up to. It opens gently and welcoming with a local, homey sort of feel. You're on a small island with your school on one side and a cozy little town on the other. Some forest, a little cave with fiery monsters but you don't have to go there yet, a beach and the loveliest music from the streets of Balamb to the halls of Balamb Garden. Even the world map's score injects the mystery of exploration into the experience.\n\nPages of gameplay exposition nobody wants to read and everybody skips is clumsily slapped on in globs at several points when it should have been woven into the exploration that the atmosphere demanded. Setting the first quest on a timer was also uncharacteristically uninviting (especially for a younger kid--- I always hated timers, no matter how forgiving, which to be fair, this really was).\n\nThe story kicks off with a battle that's sort of explained but not really. All you know is that you're being dropped into a city-state that's fighting occupation from the neighboring empire.\n\nThis is where my main criticism of the game begins.\n\nOne can argue that a younger guy (the protagonist is 17) is not going to be well-versed in politics or little skirmishes waging on the other side of the world. But Squall doesn't seem to know a thing about the world he's studying to protect. It's like he beamed in right before the start of the game. I think a lot of my confusion could have been assuaged had my main character some intellectual binding to the world in which he grew up. He's always expressing himself to the audience in thought, which was a good way of developing his outlook on things from one situation to the next--- subtle hints on his opinions concerning the expansive Galbadian Empire would have provided some desperately-needed grounding. It's not a very big world--- two superpowers and three sparsely-populated independent continents which exist mostly for the side quests. A few cities. Maybe this was the game's way of highlighting the story's elements, but it seemed that all the key global events could be processed by the equivalent of a high school senior.\n\nWhile it could be said that Squall knew all of these things, but didn't care enough to ruminate on them, some of the technical exposition leading up to the event could have been chopped down and garnished with the overall state of things. But then again, much of that would have been obvious to the people of this world. If it was only the opening mission that did this, maybe I could have blamed myself for not keeping up with the database, if there was such a thing pertaining to Galbadia's occupation of Dollet, but the story gets very complex very fast, and could have been tied up better (who the hell is Rinoa supposed to be again?)\n\nHaving said that, once you get a grip on things--- the complicated politics, different cultures, the relationships and histories of nations, the inception of Garden, the threat of the sorceress--- the world was fascinating and remarkably well constructed. If you play through several times, you will see how consistent and sensible everything is. It's like the writers had a brilliant tome detailing everything about this world and pulled only pieces from it to write the game. This is not inherently a bad thing, but in this case there needed to be more.\n\nIf such a tome exists, and I believe it does, it needs to be found. Because of all the entries in this franchise, it is the eighth installment which will benefit the most from not only a remake, but a reimagining.\n\nThat is why I love this game as much as I do: I see it for what it could have been. My imagination stole from it so much more than what was given.\n\nThe characters were so different from one another, their interactions felt alive (of course, this has almost always been the case with Final Fantasy). They were funny, they were annoying, they were scary, they were sympathetic or any combination of these. They had desires, likes and dislikes, dreams, ambitions, opinions (I would have liked some more gray in the moral compass though). There were some characters who needed work, and I think their overarching development of friendship could have been done better than filling in the empty spaces with that ham-fisted "it turns out we all grew up together" subplot. Individual scenes were fleshed out well and the imagination is taken by the hand to do a lot of the work on its own, which can be a bad thing just as often as a good thing (both, in this story). Looking back, there are many things I thought I remembered about these people that simply were not there. It goes back to my initial thought that important content was removed from the game in the final cut (considering the four discs as it was, it wouldn't surprise me).\n\nScenes that should have been more detailed to capture the weight of the situation were squeezed into these incessant, contrived QTE sequences that are a disservice to the narrative and the gameplay. It was really bad. And the game just kept throwing them at me. And playing this game with a keyboard made them exponentially worse. Now I'm forced to stop and think about how cheap they are instead of glossing over them with a controller.\n\nI think Final Fantasy VIII was robbed by its own ambition. In the wake of Final Fntasy VII, the developers set out to push a new world into beautiful complexity with a story that flowed smoothly around every corner of it. But they also wanted to push the boundaries of CGI, binding the audience to the characters, making us feel what this grand world was putting these young people through in the first game featuring anatomically-accurate characters. I strongly believe there is a lot to this game that we have never seen, and perhaps this could have been the biggest, most powerful game of the generation and of the series had it been made a few years later. All of the potential for this I saw in dark seems of this brilliant world.\n\nIt may never have that remake for a number of reasons... not the least of which being Square Enix. But I can't blame them. I am in the extreme minority, calling VIII the Final Fantasy I loved the most (though IX came very close). There may not be a strong enough market for a Leviathan developer to put the time and creativity into rebuilding an old, faintly-praised project from the ground up. Anything can happen. Until then, I'll keep my e","September 6, 2015","true","45.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

People constantly complain about the music and.. It could be better. It is the original music, but it gets the job done all the same.\n\nMost games i play, i tend to try not to take a guide to play it with me.. This game and FF7 are the exceptions. The game itself is huge and fun to play, although it does get repetitive after some time. There are secrets in the game which you cannot find until the very end of it, so its important to know where those are and how to access them, although they are not needed.\n\nThe leveling system in this game is unique. The creatures level with you. You can get to level 100, like the traditional Final Fantasy games allow, however you could also defeat the end boss @ level 20. It's like that. There is no need for grinding and will allow you to experience the story without need for the grind.\n\nThe story is great. Many say it doesn't make much sense, but thats because there are elements of it that you need to explore for yourself. Those elements will not reveal themselves to you, you need to search for them! Or use your guide.\n\nOverall, i would recommend this game, if for nothing else, the nostalgia value it brings.

A strained love story. Weak charicatured party members. And yet it's the Final Fantasy I've put the most time into (so far). The junction system is just too good; it deserves the hours you spend hunting monsters, making and collecting cards, refining items and magic, so at the end you are a literal dimension shifting kiling machine. The Triple Triad card game is just icing on the cake and so addictive, and Chocobo World is even a nice addition for picking up rare items. The ending does make everything worthwhile, and though at times I was left frustrated, ultimately this game was an excellent experience.","August 10, 2015","true","114.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beardiman/recommended/39150/","beardiman","Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beardiman/","614 products in account","Warning: Review is not proofread, as I am a lazy human being.\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII is a somewhat underdog classic in the Final Fantasy franchise. It was controversial in it's release for being vastly different then any Final Fantasy, or for that matter, RPG on the Playstation platform. Though critically acclaimed, alot of fans felt that the game derived too far from it's traditional JRPG roots. This is somewhat of a comical criticism in comparision to modern Final Fantasys, but at the time, the game had a shocking effect primarily for it's less cartoonish appearance, it's different take on equipment and item systems, and of course, who can forget the controversial junction system. The story as well, recieved much criticism for being overly melodramatic and at times feeling complete. The characters can come across as quite hokey at times as well.\n\nAll this to say, that this is probably my favorite Final Fantasy game. I played it shortly after finishing FFVII, and while I do echo the esteem afforded to FFVII, FFVIII reached me in a way that game failed to. I found at the time, I could relate very much to the game's main protagonist Squall and his journey to venture outside of himself and into this bigger world of responsiblity. In a sense, it was a story for me as an adolescent, trying to make sense of love and the world. Sure, it does have a bit of a hokey love story element, but the thing that gripped me the most about this game was Squall's inner mental dialogue, and of course the unforgettable world in which the game takes place. I have to say it, I love the world of FF8. It is very much less steampunk and more sci fi, but its full of beautiful villages and vistas, and the people who inhabit this world are interesting. The story may feel uneven, but there was definite intention here to bring a lively world that spoke more then what the actual plot could, and I love the plot. The music is written by FF veteren Nobuo Uematsu, and it is as expectedly incredible. Every song fits so well with the environment; Nobuo has a rare talent of telling a story within a story. More could be said about Nubuo, and much has, but for the sake of room and time, just take my word for it.\n\nConcerning this version: this version of FF8 is wihin the same sort of rerelease as the FFVII rerelease. Keyword here is rerelease, NOT REMAKE. I can't emphasize that well enough. This is a RERELEASE. If you buy this game expecting a fully fledge HD remake, you will be disappointed, and you should be, because this is what SQUARE has made clear since the beginning. That said, for a rerelease this ain't bad considering that unlike FF7, the PC version of FF8 was considered somewhat inferior to the PS port. This was because at the time, the release was buggy and there were certain elements that made the game feel more like a port and less like a pc game. Much of that is retained in this version, but now we have the added benefit of actually being able to customize the game's graphics to your native resolution without the burden of modding. That is essentially what you are paying for here. The cinematics are fine, and cleaned up. The actual ing game graphics look nice, and you can see now clearly just how smooth this game was designed to run. The animations are much smoother this time around. Because of the clearer graphics however, you will notice some inconsistent fragments (pixelated people and backgrounds) that were not intended to be seen with a modern screen resolution. But I find this to be not a deal breaker. Also the music is sadly, the original chopped up midi from the pc release. Hopefully Square will patch in the glorious PS original score at some point.\n\nSo in summary, FF8 is a flawed but still great game and one of my personal favorites. If you are expecting something more then a release of a game that is more then 10 years old, you will be disappointed. If you are like me though, and have fond memories of the game from your childhood, then you may find yourself surprised just how well things translate.","December 5, 2013","true","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's for that reason alone that this is playable.\nWatch the video on the store page. The FMVs do NOT look anywhere near that good in game as the footage they've used is enhanced video that they chose not to put into the game for some reason.\nSome of the textures have seen mild improvement over the PSX version however, they must have outsourced the job to EA as it is incredibly halfássed as can be seen in this screenshot.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491167562\nI mean just look at that contrast between Quistis and Cid. He's a 16-bit pixel sprite! And this is by no means an isolated incident. The game is full of sloppy work like this.\nAnd then there's the controller support which frankly leaves a lot to be desired. All prompts are replaced with generic B1, B2, B3 prompts. Considering that no controller in existence labels its buttons this way you'll need to write down the corresponding PSX / XBOX configurations or you'll find things like Zell's limit break unusable.\n\nThat said, it's FF8 on PC. What other options do you have? Even though I looked after my PSX, it can't play my original FF8 discs without skipping/crashing when the FMVs play so yeah... it's playable, but Squeenix should be ashamed of themselves for doing this to a classic game.\n\nRecommended but only for lack of a better option.\n\nYou used to be better than this, Squaresoft...","July 30, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","8"

In this port, the original music has been replaced with very grating MIDI tunes that just sound wrong. Also, parts of the game have been "polished" to look cleaner (such as characters and backgrounds) but it's still mixed with old graphics, so it looks a mess. As you walk around, the new clean characters disappear for no reason, or are standing next to an untouched character. It's just so odd. Why not release the game with original music and cut scenes?\n\nIf this was your only way to play the game, I'd still advise you get it on sale. I loved the PS1 version, and have played ports on other consoles that are enjoyable. Sadly, this release wasn't for me.","January 4","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nikumuchi/recommended/39150/","nikumuchi","NikuMuchi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nikumuchi/","146 products in account","You probably heard about this game before, so I'll go into the details about this version first.\n\nThis is basically the PC port from 1999. That means it has poor quality midi music. I recommend installing the playstation music pack, which is provided in the guide section. You can turn on graphical enhancements, which I find awful. They mess up the textures so you see the geometry clipping or floating, which are seamless in the original version. You'll have achievements, too. They are a little uninspired and seem just mandatory for the most part.\n\nYou can't just start the game and lay back on your couch with your gamepad - like with big picture. You absolutly need to put in some keyboard commands first. I find this annoying at the beginning of every session. Also, the in-game button prompts don't use the Xbox (or psx) names and that's confusing. If you're told to quickly press the B3 button, you'll know why.\n\nYou have theoretically unlimited save files, which is nice. And you can play the built-in pocketstation game Chocobo World. That feature was useless in Europe back in the day, because the pocketstation was only released in Japan. But that minigame is not that good. For the most part it plays itself and you just have to hit enter every couple of minutes, so it continues. Now think about how long it takes to reach LV 99 there. That's just preposterous.\n\nThe game itself is highly unconventional, which can be curse or blessing. You can't deny it has top-notch production value and incredible presentation, thanks to the pre-rendered backgrounds. That's always Squeenix' strong point. The thing with "changing the formular" is, that it feels like done for its own sake. Elements of typical jrpgs like character levels, money, magic, equipment and so forth don't have that much of a pay-off as if they were changed just for the hell of it. It is extremly complex and begs you to first familiarize with it. There is a lot of depth to the micro-management but it is overwhelming for a beginner. Plus, the menu interface is unappealing to look at, though you spend a lot of time arranging your stuff. It is best you don't even start to wrap your head around the meaning of all of this or you'll go crazy how "gamey" and nonsensical the entire system is.\n\nOne thing I can't just easily criticize is the music. I know tastes are different and you can't just call it good or bad. But from a quality point of view I think the music is a little uninspired and underwritten. I get the role of these jazzy tunes in this more realistic universe. The composition uses much more natural sounding instruments and percussion, but it sounds way more flat and shallow than other works of Uematsu.\n\nI don't mind the card game. Not at all. Sometimes it's unpredictable and frustrating and it takes long to complete but for the most part I find it intriguing. If you don't, ignore it. You can just transform the cards you get without playing into items and will be fine.\n\nThen there's the drawing. You can finish the game with no problems without ever drawing magic. But I agree that it's initially counter-intuitive. Here's why. When you are introduced to this feature, you have nothing stocked yet the urge to be as good as possible. You can already see the ceiling. The more you have, the better you are. The only thing standing in the way is your investment. You will have to have the dicipline to say "I may not be maxed out right now, but eventually I will be. Let's move on for now!" Don't let it bug you. The game is balanced well enough.\n\nYou can be forgiving with the mechanics but I think we'll all agree that the story is the weakest part. It is just contrived and incoherent and it doesn't know where it's going with all its set pieces. Plus there are plot holes and deus ex machina which are a sign of poor and lazy writing. It is pretty cheesy and schmaltzy, too.\n\nBottom line, this is a real Frankenstein's monster. It is impressive, elaborate and stuffy but still an abomination you're puzzled about it even lives. It has much love to give but will always be a manifestation of ambition gone wild.","April 16","true","73.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've beaten this game many times, played it over and over and always enjoyed it. The story is original, and as with most Final Fantasy games, incredibly unique. The characters are memorable.. ones you'll love or hate, really quickly. The gameplay is smooth, and well-done. The only downsides are the draw system, and with this particular PC port, the music. I had a hard time playing it, coming from prior editions of it, simply because the music was midi, rather than the normal soundtrack. That was a huge downside to me, considering the music in the game is phenominal.","June 20, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have finished it so many times I lost count years ago. So you can imagine how disappointed I was once my first cd of the original game got destroyed by accident.\n\nThis game still holds up quite well, graphics are better then they were in the original (though not as good as modern day games) and the music is not that bad either (could be better but I can live with it).\n\nWhat brings me to the conclusion to not recomend this game is one fatal bug. A bug that seems to be connected with syncing achivements to the servers (which in my opinion are useless anyways). This bug describes itself as crashing the game. It can happen anywhere, in combat, between loading screens or just while walking on the field. This is especially bad when you do not have saving points anywhere you like and cannot save when you want and as often as you wish. This is such a drawback that I cannot recommend this game until this mayor bug has been fixed. MEanwhile I recommend playing Final Fantasy VII (7). This bug is not there even though there are achivements in that as well. I do not understand why but I just know that this bug is really annoying and kills the game..... for now.\n\nI am too stubborn to give up because I want to finish this game again, I just love it that much, but for those who are curious as to wheather or not to try this game then you should wait until this bug has been fixed.

X was my favorite, I spent a lot of time giving Tidus all the skills possible.  But for this Final Fantasy VIII I am very disappointed in Square Enix.  Cause I have 6 hours and 26 minutes in the game.  An There's a T Rex west of the city.  I have been fighting non stop to level up cause the game gives me errors "An Unknown exception was occurred."  every time I get Ifrit and try to meet Seifer.  Plus now I am finding more an more an more errors.  Example I am atm Quistis lv 36 1601 hp.  Squall lv 35 1671 hp.  Quezacotl lv 59 4340 hp.  Shiva lv 62 4392 hp.  I go and fight T Rex and after using GF to summon my two pets.  No matter what I am insta killed by T Rex, given a game over and the same error as always.  I think this game was poorly designed, created, produced and should really be redone correctly cause it ruins the image of other wise great Final Fantasy Games.  I think anyone who purchased this game from Steam should get a refund and a apology.   So if you intend to buy this, I advice you even with all the errors don't waste your money.","January 24, 2015","false","36.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have played the heck out of FFs 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 14, and loved every one. I really, REALLY want to like 8. Square decided they wanted to do something different. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it came crashing down in this instance.\n\nSide note: Credit where it's due, this game has a great soundtrack. The boss theme and Man With the Machine Gun are just two tracks I enjoy having stuck in my head. Nobuo Uematsu has never disappointed.\n\nAnyway. Lets go down the list of reasons this game doesn't want me to like it.\n\n-The Draw system: Lets be fair; I was prepared to tolerate the draw system. Magic is a limited resource in all RPGs, and frankly, this seemed considerably less limiting. In itself, I don't mind the system of "draw magic, cast it later". It's everything attached to the system I don't like.\n\n-The leveling system: FF8 is the only FF game to implement enemies with levels themselves. Your characters can level up as you adventure -- that's just standard for an RPG -- but unique to FF8, the enemies you encounter have their levels set to roughly match yours. Long story short, this means that leveling up is actually detrimental, because the enemies level up too. Oblivion is another game that does this (and it's one of the few flaws with an otherwise dang-near-perfect game), which causes players to just never level up because doing so would be stupid. Leveling up is a key component of any FF game, but it's butchered in FF8.\n\n-The junction system: Good God, talk about complex character customization. I won't go into all the details, but this is one of the main reasons I just can't enjoy this game. You can boost a character's stats by "junctioning" magic to that stat. This boosts it by a value that's unique per spell, per stat, multiplied by the number of casts you have of that magic. You can stock up to 100 of each spell. Here's where my big problem comes in; you stock this magic up by "drawing" it from enemies. It's a combat action on its own that does nothing to the enemy, and gives you an average of 5.5 casts of the spell you drew. That means when you find a new spell to draw, you need to draw about 18 times to get a full stock of 100. PER CHARACTER. Of which there are six. I probably spent over an hour just drawing up a full stock of about six different spells for about four different characters. Just...no. That's just ridiculous. To the PC version's credit, it comes with a "magic booster" that lets you get a full stock of a whole bunch of spells for all characters any time you want, but that feels like cheating. It's giving you a bunch of spells much earlier than you could otherwise access them. I just can't feel right by cheating in such a way.\n\nThere are several different ways they could have made this system suck less. Capping at 10 instead of 100, for example. That still doesn't change the fact that the junction system as a whole is easily the most convoluted RPG system that exists.\n\n-Lack of character identity: FF7 had this issue too; your characters' combat abilities are defined primarily by the way you've set up their junction system (or materia in 7). You can set up Squall as a bruiser and Rinoa as a mage, then swap their junction setups and have them both perform the other role just fine. This limits the personality that the characters show -- and the issue is only compounded by the immense amount of time you'll spend in combat just spamming draw. This sounds nitpicky, but other FFs reinforce their characters through their combat options. In FF6, Edgar felt like the machinist because he was the only one that could use an autocrossbow. Sabin felt like the brawler because he was the only one that could suplex a freaking train. Shadow felt like the ninja because he was the only one that could hurl a shuriken. All those varying combat options reinforced their character.\n\n-Renzokuken: My last little nitpick that makes the game an absolute joke. Squall's limit break lets him smack an enemy upwards of five times, each for standard attack damage, and the only requirement to use it is to be low on HP. Theoretically, you could make mincemeat out of the entire game just by keeping Squall's HP low and spamming his limit break on anything that moves. Honestly, Square, what was wrong with FF7's limit break system? That worked just fine, and would have easily suited Squall's insane limit break.\n\nSo yeah. I really, really wanted to like this game. I gave it several chances. I just...can't. On the other hand, FF7 is available on Steam, go grab that! And/Or the remake coming soon!","September 9, 2015","false","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It holds a huge sentimental value to me and I bet to many others. It can still be enjoyable for newer generations, but the gameplay didn't transition well into this decade and Square Enix didn't care to enhance the game properly. For those unaware, this is a re-release of the 2000 port of the original released for the PlayStation. It doesn't improve much, if at all, over the first port and it can be a huge let down for people used to the PS2 gameplay mechanics onwards. For those familiar with the storytelling of FFX and above, VIII might also feel lacking in that department as the world feels very shallow with little history. None of this, however, means is not worth it. The player, epsecially if new, just has to dive into with an open mind and understand that yes, it's a very dated game. Modding the game (check the guides for a list of mods) can help with the experience and bring a twist to the nostalgia seekers.\n\nA note on the DRM: Is not REALLY a DRM. Steam DOES NOT require your to have a Square Enix account to save your progress and register achievement progress. The Square Enix account is optional and the lack of it won't get in the way of your game progress. The problem with this is that the launcher is constantly reminding the player to login, but you don't HAVE to. If you already have a Square Enix account linked to your Steam account, you won't even notice this, not in VIII, not in other Square Enix games that make use of their social network.","April 10","true","86.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thankfully the game is easily modded to insert the original PS soundtrack.\n\nOn the positive side of things, the game has built in 'cheats' if you're not one for grinding and acquiring spells and such yourself. I didn't use those, but I took full advantage of the Fast-Forward button, making it easy to exploit the card game for early weapons, draw magic from monsters, and skip quickly through scenes I've watched a half dozen times in the past. Oh, and the Pocketstation content, Chocobo World, is built-in, so you can get the few items that were unavailable in the North American console version.\n\nIf you haven't played FF8, but are a fan of JRPGs, or enjoyed the game in the past and are iffy on replaying it, I'd strongly recommend it. Works well with the Dualshock 4, grinding is an afterthought, and after you fix the god-awful music, it'll be just as it felt on the PS1.\n\nEasily a 10/10 game.

I love the Draw ability but I hate that you’re punished with lower stats for using magic you’ve Drawn and Junctioned.  (Maybe percentages would have been better?)  I love upgrading weapons instead of buying/finding new ones but hate the lack of armor and the fact that monsters level with you.  I love refining magic and items from other items and making lower magics combine into bigger items, but turning monsters into cards to turn into items was somewhat tedious.  I love the music and the character designs, but by GOD I want to slap each and every one of them.\nThe plot runs all over the place and reminds me of those assignments in writing class where you write a paragraph and pass it to your left.

It just feels disjointed and thrown together.\nAs an older teen/young adult I felt Squall was a whiney, unsympathetic character.  Quistis was manipulative, Selphie cute and cliche yet harmless, Zell had SOME character development, and Irvine?  Screw him.

Which at the time they only had midi format, and that would be used for the pc port of Final Fantasy 8.\n\nSo, at the end it isn't anyones fault, and is illegal to port the original ,music to the pc port due to the music and other aspects of Final Fanatasy were owned by sony and other parties at the time so they didn't have the right to use the matierials. And also needed to use a program that generated music that the computer was able to use.\n\nThe score itself was legal.\n\nOdd...\n\nAnd downloading, or patching the original music to this port can be what some say illigal.\nKeep that in thought friends!\n\nThe game is pretty much broken, the enemies change with your level, or better said,  the game makes a lame attempt to ballence your parties level with whatever your fighting... But the bosses don't really ballence at all.\nEither they are weak, or over powered ...\n\nThe battle system is really badly put together in this game and you can be really cheap..\nBut that is just me and my anger to the drawing sytem and spending more time with my magic then the game itself, making up the hours lost in the game.. without drawign magic, this game would only be a good two disks long... but that is all filler my friends...\n\nIf you are looking for a challange, look ellswere!\n\nNow when it comes up to the textures of the game, you have the option of switching between the "new and improved" smudge fest.\nOR\nThe original pc rendered enviroments, due to the playstation and the pc being different beasts.\nThe well known wounderfull pre-rendered enviroments are so fuzzy it hurts your eyes to look at it.\nEverything is horibly meshed together.\n\nGodly awful.... it makes you cry\n\nWell, ill tell you this, the graphic setting for my game, anyways it is a bit on the crazy side and really only matters to the party and some enviroments are on the original setting.\nTo me.. imperfections in any game is what made it one of a kind...\n\nWith the grapics, and the way i enjoyed it on the playstation is what made this game a lot more easier to enjoy and a lot more fun to play since what makes the game is the problems they have...\n\nThey made squall and all the others look so .. smooth that it has no ballence to the backgrounds and the textures are so screwed up it was even hard to make out what was orginaly their and unatual.\n\nIt is different then the playstation settings and ill tell you why.\nWell, when making a port you have to change a few things due to legal dues... and some tech issues...\n\nYou have to, yes it is a have in many games in the past.\nThey have to re-render the game so it can at least run of whatever system you maybe playing it on.\nFor example, have you played recent games?\nNotice that some games do not play well of certain consoles, anyways they are released on them?\nThat is due to the team not re-writing the code for the other system, yes it is very important!!!!!\n\nI am pleased to say, they did a good job on this port at least knowing they had to do exactly that.\n\nBut in short...their isn't anything new, it is old and worn down to the bone..\nTheir isn't anything really added, and nothing has been enhanced...\n\nIts just the pc port..... And that is really it......\n\nNow, when it comes up to the key mapping in this game....\nThe controlls for the keyboard  are really bad.....with some of the envirements and what key to press, you have too and i mean, HAVE too study the screen with the keyboad outlay for a good two min.\nBe carefull you don't go crazy!\n\nAnother lame joke of mine.\n\nDid you know, back in the day, people sat down and played games for hours just to find something at least wrong with it, like a cheat, crack, glitch and such just forth the shear enjoyment...\n\nWhat happaned to those days?!\nTo those people?!\nTo... oh whatever!\n\nNow, with the new and improved games of this centrary i don't see why people complain about games.... *besides companies being lazy and releasing an old pc port and calling it new to bang out a few bucks from their fans...* Yeah.. thats it..\n\nBut now, its all smoothed out and made for idiots that want what i call this the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of all iedos butt babies... eww\n\nPlease, if this is the first time you are playing this game and you see this on steam, save your money and time.\n\nGo on a great adventure and find it on the playstation 1, the  gameplay is smoother, the music is godly a lot better, and the graphics are classic and the enviroments make sence with the layouts and  your polygon and boxy body!\n\nIf you do buy this game, read this..\n\nBuy a controller, it will make this game and some others you may have purchaced that have the compadibillity to use a gamepad controller..\n\n\nAny ways i call this game the ultimate quest for sloppy seconds.\n\nHot and sloppy out of the oven!!!!\n\nThe story makes not an ouce of sence...\n\nBut at the end of it all it all boils down to this..\n\nThis game is a top of the line must play!\n\nTheir are plenty of redeamable and wounderfull parts in the game, and the graphics still awe me till this day.\nEverything about this game is timeless and i do recomend this game, just go buy it on the playstation. Stop your achivements on steam and feel more rewarded.\n\nYou know, the playstation is a realy wonderful system, and so is the playstation 2.... honor the systems by playing the games that were made of the systems on the systems!\n\nI think ports like this one are more usefull if it is for a game that the system is no longer found, sold, and made.... its not helpful to those who don't know...\n\nThe playstation, ps2 is the mother, the father.. and cradle of some of the best jrpg, rpg games known to man... Go and get one and not only will you able to play the great ff8, but games like the Lunar games, Growlanser, Legend of Legia. Suikodien, Parasite Eve... you get the drift..\n\nDo it the right way and you will feel more rewarded!\n\nBut keep an open mind!\n\nEvery game is always worth playing.\n\nJust so you all know, i clocked in the hours to make sure i made the right statements.. and wanted to be hounest and not just bash a game... i have played this game plenty of times over.. and all i can say... is this..\nIts okay... not amazing, not great!\nBut okay.","January 2, 2014","false","60.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","15"

Squall, who I promptly renamed, has the emotional capacity of a rock for the entire first disc. However, he actually develops as a character later in the game; including a funny moment when Rinoa (renamed Rhino) carefully explains that he needs to convey his thoughts aloud or the others won't understand him. That said, many of the side characters are forgettable, including Zell, who enjoys hot dogs and punching things. The game's love story almost works, but Squall spends most of his time oblivious to Rhino's desperate attempts to be noticed. Very cringeworthy. Around disc 4, the game takes a hit of acid and drops us into time compression, which kind of looks like a Salvadore Dali painting. Entertaining, but batshit crazy.\n\nI go back and forth on the gameplay. Triple Triad is excellent, but its distribution of rules around the world is crippling. Junctioning scratches my itch of watching numbers get higher, but the way information is visually presented is rough at best, and I found myself wishing for a more modern UI. The world map is huge, but largely void of content--especially compared to FFIX, which is full of glorious treasures. Guardian Forces are fun to hunt down for their unlockable abiliies, but the summons themselves don't do nearly as much damage as a normal attack, and they're unskippable. Yep. Maybe there's a mod for that.\n\nThe music is excellent as always (thanks Uematsu), however the game defaults to ear-splitting midi unless you make a point of downloading the original tracks like I did. The 1999 graphics obviously aren't great, although many of the full motion videos are still quite entertaining, especially when you're able to control a 3-D character in many of the ridiculous battle scenes, such as when the enormous floating "garden" schools collide.\n\nDo I recommend this game? No, but that didn't stop me from playing it through. I expected a ♥♥♥♥ show, and that is what I got.

A brief foray into the community hub makes it clear that this is not an isolated incident, and is rather something that keeps. on. happening.\n\nUnlike most of the internet, I don't have a problem with DRM. I'm not convinced it works, but it's not my money being lost to piracy, so if a company feels differently and wants to attack pirates this way then more power to them. However, when your DRM renders legitimate, paying customers physically unable to play your game then you've crossed the line into immoral practice.\n\nI have bought, and will now return, a game which cannot be played. It is not because of my computer or errors on my end, and it is not a problem unique to me.

If you liked FFVIII and just wanted a port of it, then I can say I haven't had any issues with how it runs...although there was some stuttering in the ending cutscene.\n\nI really couldn't get into this game. I couldn't stand the characters from the get go, and on top of that the battle system is tedious as hell. Not only is there level grinding, but you have to actually manage your magic/stats inbetween characters on a very frequent basis. Repeatedly drawing magic from enemies over and over to make your units more powerful and if you actually use the magic you have pooled your characters become weaker again. It actively discourages the usage of magic which is so obnoxious. Everyone is also incredibly varied in terms of what stats you can assign magic to, so that's another thing that adds to the frustration. Overall I just felt like the battle system was too restrictive and unnecessarily complex. I don't mind if things are complicated if they can lead to battles where you really had to think, but honestly you just had to junction magic correctly and then just spam normal attacks, limit breaks, or summons. There's little to no variety required when fighting. To give you an example of how unvaried it is, I fought through every boss and enemy in the game solely by using summons over and over again until I got to the final boss...then I just spammed Zell's limit break to kill it. It was incredibly boring.\n\nOn the note of the game being boring, my 160 or so hours of playtime for this game is a gross exaggeration. The reason it's there is because of how many times I'd fallen asleep trying to force myself to finish it.","May 6","false","167.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexandervrs/recommended/39150/","alexandervrs","alexandervrs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexandervrs/","110 products in account","I am basing this review on both port & game quality.\n\nFirst, the port is very poorly made, there is no real attention to detail. Some examples include:\n\n* The game minimizes itself when it starts and you have to re-focus the window.\n\n* The game blocks you from using a gamepad right away and requires you to press a key in the beginning to proceed, bad UX.\n\n* The battle transitions look terrible compared to the PS1 version.\n\n* The game uses midi files for music when it is easily modded to play high quality OGG music. They were just lazy with this and it really takes a toll on the game's atmosphere if you don't use a mod for it.\n\n* There is a constant distracting message "achievements synchronized with server" every time you draw magic from enemies, just because there's an achievement for it, but you can't turn this message off.\n\n* When you have to do button prompts (there's a few quicktime events), the gamepad buttons appear as B1/B2/B3/B4 rather than icons, which can get confusing visually, if the event requires swift response.\n\n* After you finish the game, you get a black screen, the devs made no effort to reset the game data and return you back to title screen, you have to manually exit the game via Alt+F4. It shows that they were not willing to do changes for better UX on the target platform.\n\n\nNow for the game itself,\n\nThe environments look great for its time, but the game suffers from a "short area" syndrome. There are many times that you'll enter a specific area that an interesting background/area caters only for plot and gives you no chance to explore. It is first apparent when you enter shops, you are greeted with the shop menu rather than an extra screen, so you can admire the aesthetics, which older games did, and this seems rather lazy.\nThere's also the opposite happening sometimes, like with the few sidequests, the game will start describing the area/scene with plain text instead of providing some more interesting visuals.\n\nThe dungeons are very few, with very little screens in them, often repeated and the game justifies it that it's a "maze" (Tomb of the Unknown King / Sewers) but feel rather linear. In one of them, you battle enemies every single step you make, and the dungeon screens repeat, making it extremely tedious & feeling like padding. There's no real sense of progress or reward.\n\nThe World Map looks interesting at first glance, but you'd have explored the 1st half by Disc 1, on Disc 2 you'd be running around past locations and a few new small ones. And by Disc 3 you'd finally reach the other Continent only to be disappointed that the place is nothing but a seemingly huge city with nothing interesting to do in it, and a few tiny dungeons that serve just for plot and an item.\n\nOne huge downside is that once you enter Disc 4, the game blocks you from going back to any city. It tries to justify it with plot (and probably PS1 CD limitations back in the day to fit those large cutscenes), but that really takes out of the close-endgame aspect. In previous Final Fantasy titles, you are free to revisit past locations, find new secrets in them, do sidequests and other interesting things (battle challenges, play minigames, chocobo breeding etc.).\n\nAs such, there is not much exploration to be done. Forget field treasure chests with valuable items like in the previous games. There is only around 5-6 Items to be found, instead there are some Draw Points here and there that you can mine magic in set intervals, but nothing that feels truly rewarding.\n\nSide quests are very few, you have your extra GF sidequest, a treasure hunt, a "find the UFO" quest, and a cute but tedious tamagochi-like Chocobo minigame. Most of them are really not interesting and feel forced so that "the game could have sidequests".\n\n\nThe game has gameplay pacing issues. Enemies now level up along with you which is an interesting concept, but not executed very well and often nullifies any grinding done to improve your characters' stats as the enemy level will always stay higher. On the flip side it is very easy to break the game by stocking up magic and junctioning them to your characters for big stat boosts.\nAnother issue is that the game does not guide you well through gameplay, a hint of this is that the very first shops in the game already offer you items that you won't need for a good while, like the item "Soft" that cures petrification status, which doesn't happen until much later in the game. A worse, more apparent problem is that the game relies on lengthy tutorials to try and explain its mechanics rather than putting the player under tests.\n\nA major battle system change, which I am personally not a big fan of, was that now Magic are expendable and act like one-use Items (they do not require MP to use). As such, there is a lot of grinding to steal Magic from enemies that you end up junctioning to your characters and don't really want to expend. However it is now entirely possible to just spam GF (The game's Summons) and win every battle as there's no need for MP for them either. This change was unnecessary and breaks the balance/strategy with resource (MP/Item Stock) management as the player feels like he has infinite amount of resources for a battle, as long as they just grind for Magic.\n\nMoney is not earned through battles. You can sell item drops/steals from monsters, but they don't sell for much til you reach Disc 3 portion of the game. The game relies on a Salary system which is based on your party's rank (how many battles you do, story choices, written tests), which leads the player not caring about buying any items from shops much having to wait all this time to get paid.\n\nThere is also a nice distraction minigame in the form of a Card game, named Triple Triad, which I have nothing bad to say about the game itself, but it is very easy to accidentally spread the "Random" rule around regions, which makes your cards in your hand random & kinda omits the fun factor, making the minigame frustrating.\n\n\nAs for the story, it's a pretty basic one, even for Final Fantasy standards it appears to look rather bland, and really a shame as the previous 2 titles had rather complex & interesting ones.\nThe game's story starts off really slow, then picks up a little, then by Disc 2, it nosedives into boredom. Then it tries to do a twist which is really predictable and doesn't really do much to keep your interest. The villain's motive for being evil is also generic and without real purpose/context other than "I am evil by nature, so I must kill you all". By Disc 4, the game stops trying and it is just "lets just kill the bad guy and go home".\n\nThe protagonist is totally non-relatable and one-dimensional. The romance, which the main story revolves around, between him and his interest also seems rather forced at times. The other characters often do some dumb stuff/decisions throughout the story, which you wish the game gave you the option of choice being an RPG and all.\nThe protagonist's adversary also has no real-or-just closure, which seems lazy and all that time in the beginning spent to establish his character feels like a total waste of time.\n\n\nWhen the game first came out, it was hailed as an eyecandy & tech miracle. And for its time, it was. Great detailed graphics, great soundtrack. But the game really suffers from too much experimentation. There were some gameplay/storytelling formulas the previous game, FFVII, established that should not have been changed.\nFortunately, the next iteration of the Final Fantasy series, FFIX, reverted all these poor design choices for the better.\n\nI sadly, cannot recommend this port to anyone looking to either start with Final Fantasy or looking to play the next classic Final Fantasy.\nGet this game only if you want it on your collection or for nostalgia reasons, otherwise there are much better JRPGs/FFs on Steam.","June 2","false","22.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"
