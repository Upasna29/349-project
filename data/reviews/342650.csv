I like to call them youtube fodder, they're great when you scale up the difficulty and are able to produce reality bending feats of skill for the video replays, but in general they play to a pretty limited audience. The question is - is this one going to be specifically any better than say Super Hexagon (one of the biggest names in this area) or the more brutal Velocibox?\n\nThe problem of good graphics.\nThe game -looks- pretty, with graphics running at a smooth clip, with a smooth palette of colours and vivid backgrounds, there's an almost ephemeral quality to proceedings as you glide along the "rail" towards your goal, avoiding various obstacles, both static and mobile, and you've the ability to rotate in ninety degree increments along the rail, as well as jump and shoot certain types of obstacle to remove them. Herein lies both the biggest twist in Fermi's path, and the major step towards originality in this area, and the problems which in turn, prevent it from escaping the shadow of games like Velocibox and Super Hexagon.\n\nWhen you twist and turn, oh the colours, they pretty... don't look at the light! (I can't help it, it's so beaaautiful...)\nThe problem with Fermi's Path, and note, it's something that is subjective, but it's the kind of problem that will be a problem, for anyone who intends to play at speed, is that due to the nature of the game (rotating around a central rail) and the graphical nature of the game, with lots of different colours and effects going on, considering this is intended as a reaction game, there's too much visual information, and at times the rail will obscure the obstacles and route coming up by virtue of the fact the route will be on the *opposite side of the rail* or off by ninety degrees. At low speeds this is quite easy to cope with, but as the game ramps up into twitch territory, this quickly dips into unforgivable sin territory.\n\nPlaying a twitch game where you do not have perfect information about what's coming up in the not too dim and distant is the cardinal sin of the twitch game world. In "The path mode" you have the ability to memorise the route by rote, but in randomly generated levels, no such luck.\n\nGood looking, but ultimately lacking...\nAs a diversion from the more hardcore twitch games, it certainly fills a hole. It has great graphics, and as a way to unwind from the tougher games or even as a way to "warm up" before a session of Velocibox, I could definitely see it serving a role. However, as a twitch game in it's own right, there's several issues that simply mean that compared to the likes of Super Hexagon and Velocibox, well, there's simply better options on the table. This is good, but there is better.\n\nVerdict : Wishlist it, worth considering if you're a big fan of twitch games and need a more sedate option to unwind with","May 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","47","57","5","10"

(because FYI, the music gets more layers as your combo gets higher)\n\nthe game also as power ups, which is good, except that they're never explained to you, so you're just picking them up hoping the game will show you what it does at some point.\n\nfinaly, the game as a level editor, and it could've been made so much easier than it currently is, it just looks so daunting and difficult to use right now.\nthere's also the fact that you can only use the musics in the game (and they can't change that because they would have to drop the workshop integration due to the copyright issues that could come out of this), but as I've said, they're just a bunch of mess after a while.\n\n\n\n\n\nso all in all, if you've been eyeballing this game for a while and every gameplay videos you've seen from this game look awesome, buy it, but wait until it's on sale, because I don't think this is worth more than 5 bucks as it currently stands.\nif you didn't know about this game before, I'd say pass, there are better games like this one out there.\n\nFinal Rating: 5/10","October 19, 2015","false","1.4"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

It's very difficult to assess right distances for your movement on that monotonous pathway you travel, there are no landmarks to judge it. Sometimes when the path bends you can't even see the upcoming obstacles, so you'll have to memorize the pre-made levels by heart.
