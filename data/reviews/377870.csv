"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solrahlx/recommended/377870/","solrahlx","Rayge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solrahlx/","1604 products in account","I'm just going to start off by saying I have nothing but praise for this game. With that said I know most STEAM users are going to look at the price point for this and think, "They've GOT to be out of their minds!" No they aren't This game is packed with so much content that I don't think there's a single game of its kind that can topple. I'll even say that you couldn't even combine 3 or 4 games together to get the amount of content that this game has to offer fans of the genre.\n\nAesthetically this game brings a simple and clean presentation to the table. The UI for ship combat is clean and simple to understand without too much info bombarding the player while they are struggling to keep their ship from a fiery demise. The 3D models are low in the polygon department, yet beautifully designed. Everything from simple cannon fodder enemies to the enormous bosses look great.\n\nWhen it comes to blasting things into the next dimension this game brings it home. Every stage I've played so far in CS mode feels satisfying to navigate through while serving a healthy dose of destruction to everything in your wake. The slew of ship models in the game keep everything feeling fresh. Each ship brings something different to the table, be it bombs, options (bits), firing patterns, lasers, devastating counter lasers... You're going to have a different experience trying each one.\n\nAreas feel a bit easy at first, but the difficulty steadily increases with each one you go to. And there's 200 of them in this mode. You'll be forced to learn enemy formation patterns, stage layouts, and boss attack patterns. Also, don't worry about encountering the same boss two or three times. While sometimes bosses look the same, their attack patterns sure as heck are not. Nothing I've encountered so far has felt unfair to me and every death I've had in an area has brought me closer to success on my next go around. This game does a great job of being difficult without being frustrating.\n\nThe music is another thing in this game that really caught me off guard. The soundtrack and sound design for this game is just superb. Everything feels new yet very nostalgic. It's as if I've been transported over 20 years back to the past to enjoy some of the older games from back in my youth. It's something that just feels great to experience while going through the game. With that said, the music still sounds fresh and sound effects are of a better quality than what us older people had from back in the day.\n\nThe thing that boggles my mind with the game is that I haven't even touch AC mode which contains 3 other modes within it and the original aspect ratio of the arcade version which will allow PC players to enjoy an authentic quarter crunching experience. There's one mode (Chronicle I believe) that has 3000 stages that are unlocked by the community. Each "cabinet" is like its own little universe which players can pick before starting AC mode. The further you and players in that cabinet get through Chronicles the more worlds you unlock. It adds a VERY lite MMO aspect to the game which will keep this game fresh far a good long while.\n\nBut for me, I'm content with trying to survive through CS mode. I don't see myself finishing that anytime soon since I'm on the less skilled side of the spectrum when it comes to Shoot'em Ups. Like I've stated in the beginning, your money will not go to waste on this game is you're a fan of the genre and have been waiting for a content heavy shmup to come across the STEAM store. PC has been getting a RIDICULOUS amount of fantastic shooters in the last two years and DARIUSBURST has easily sky rocketed to the top 3 in my opinion. This is a top shelf experience and a title that deserves to be in every shmup fan's catalogue.\n","December 3, 2015","true","99.2"," 145 of 170 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","145","170","4","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bVork/recommended/377870/","bVork","bVork","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bVork/","1310 products in account","The best and most shmup you can buy on Steam.\n\nIt's hard to explain how huge this game is. Do you want a lengthy single-player campaign that will take you many hours to complete? CS mode is that. Do you want a classic Darius experience with multiple routes? It has two of those modes: Original and Original EX. Do you want a huge selection of different challenges? Chronicle mode has hundreds and hundreds of challenges with thousands of stages. Even if you aren't the type who plays arcade games repeatedly in order to get higher scores, there's still enough here to occupy you for hundreds of hours.\n\nAnd how is this gigantic game? In a word: incredible. Dariusburst takes a different tack than many modern bullet hell shooters and instead goes for what I'd call popcorn hell. Huge swarms of tiny enemies and asteroids are everywhere. The bosses are huge, have a large variety of attacks, and are exhilarating to fight. Don't think it's just swarms and bosses, though: there are plenty of bullet-firing medium sized enemies and stage walls to contend with, too. Dariusburst is very much its own thing and doesn't cleanly fit into any of the shmup archetypes.\n\nThe scoring system is relatively simple, with a multiplier that ticks up when you destroy waves of enemies and gets reduced when you get hit. Kill an entire enemy wave and the you get a score bonus multiplied by your current multiplier. Kill the final enemy of a wave with your rechargeable laser or bomb and you get that same bonus multiplied by 16. This means the best scoring tactic is to kill everything and try to eliminate the final enemy of each wave with your laser/bomb. This is easier said than done, so there's a lot of depth here in figuring out the ideal movement and timing for killing enemy waves. Bosses fire their own lasers and if you time it right, you can fire your own laser into that laser (like in G-Darius) and counter it for massive damage and large amounts of points if you kill the boss with the resulting counterburst.\n\nThe art design is great. It doesn't push a lot of polygons (this is an enhanced port of an arcade game based on a PSP game, after all) but the art more than makes up for it. Backgrounds can be astonishingly beautiful and the boss designs are great. There are also a large number of references to previous Darius games that are cool to pick out. Sound effects are well done. Nothing to write home about (apart from the wonderful boss alert siren), but they get the job done. The music is incredible. The "Freedom" song in the trailer is love-it-or-hate-it (I'm in the latter camp) but it's easily the least good of a long and lengthy soundtrack. The way the soundtrack is perfectly synchronized in the arcade modes is awe-inspiring.\n\nThere's only two real flaws with this game. The huge number of modes and missions means that high scores are scattered across a bunch of leaderboards rather than being concentrated and more competitive. Second, there's no practice mode for individual stages and bosses in AC mode. Some of the bosses (looking at YOU, Phantom Castle) have some really mean attacks and it would be nice to be able to practice them in AC mode without going through a series of stages beforehand. CS mode lets you select individual stages, so you can sort of use it for practice, but the aspect ratio is so different that it's not really the same thing as the AC mode boss fights.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game enough. The price may be high but it is totally worth it given both the length and quality of Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours.","December 5, 2015","true","18.8"," 68 of 78 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","68","78","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElOhTeeBee/recommended/377870/","ElOhTeeBee","ElOhTeeBee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElOhTeeBee/","436 products in account","Oh, DARIUSBURST. You come so close, and yet you falter mere steps away from the finish line.\n\nMany people will look at the price tag and think twice about it, but if your concern is lack of content, you shouldn't worry. DARIUSBURST is a game that is absolutely stuffed to the gills. There's a full recreation of the Arcade mode in 32:9 (with dual-monitor support!), including Original (choose three stages from a total of twelve in the traditional Darius split map), Original EX (Original but harder), Chronicle (thousands of stages, unlocked collaboratively with other players), and Event (currently unused). There's also a new mode, similar to Chronicle meant for home play on a 16:9 monitor by a single player. There are dozens of enemies and bosses, most if not all of the latter having one or more variants with different attacks. There are eight ships to choose from in arcade and a ninth in CS, all of which have dramatically differing capabilities.\n\nAs far as actually playing it goes, DARIUSBURST doesn't disappoint either. The controls are responsive, the ships don't feel too fast or slow as you dodge between volleys of fire and take down enemies, and the battles are all delightfully flashy and impressive in a way that makes it fun to watch despite the average graphics. It's really a great game.\n\nAnd yet, there's a big red thumbs down at the top of this review. And it's there for a reason. DARIUSBURST doesn't lack for content, and it doesn't lack for gameplay, but that's not all that's important to a game. What DARIUSBURST is ultimately missing to make it woth the full price tag is polish. It's an overall gread experience, that is nonetheless missing things - both minor little pleasantries and arguably key features.\n\nThere's no replay functionality whatsoever.\n\nThere's no stage practice option beyond finding a Chronicle course that starts with the stage you want to practice.\n\nWhen playing AC mode on a single monitor, it's letterboxed... with bland black rectangles, as opposed to some of the series' gorgeous art assets.\n\nWithout multiple controllers, there's no way to pick the color of your ship.\n\nThere's no online multiplayer, when many of the stages in Chronicle cannot be entered at all without a team of two or more.\n\nThe arcade loading screens, meant to inform the player about their ship and the bosses, are inexplicably left untranslated from Japanese.\n\nThose are all features that other shmups, cheaper shmups, have provided in the past. Yet DARIUSBURST, a fully-priced retail release, lacks them.\n\nAnd that's why, ultimately, I cannot click the "Yes" button and recommend it. If there were a Mixed option in addition to Yes and No, I'd cheerfully pick that one, because there's a lot here to like. But if it's got to be one of the two...\n\nDARIUSBURST would be worthwhile at $30. It'd be a bargain at $20. But at $50, I can't recommend it to anyone who would be on the fence and decide to read some reviews. Wait for a good sale, and THEN get it and have a great time.","December 21, 2015","false","20.2"," 135 of 200 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","135","200","7","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowhaxor/recommended/377870/","shadowhaxor","Shadowhaxor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowhaxor/","202 products in account","There was a time where if you had mentioned to me that you either had access to DariusBurst Another Chronicle, either via an arcade cabinet or by playing it on an iOS device, I would have given you a weird look. And not just any weird look, but the look that I wanted to steal your soul type of look as I really wanted a chance to try the game, just for once in my life. And with no access to either an iOS device or a Japanese PlayStation Portable, I was forced to merely watch videos of the game in action on Youtube. That is until recently when Degica stated they were porting the game over to not just the PlayStation Vita, but also the PlayStation 4 and the real shocker, the PC. That’s all I needed to hear to get my shmup spirits lifted. Besides Darius, my other favorite shmups, Gradius and Thunderforce, were dead and buried, never to see the day of light again. And while Darius was still being carried on, its existence was always out of my reach, that is until now.   “Shoot-’em-up: a fast-moving story or movie, of which gunfire is a dominant feature. Also known as a shmup” DBCS is technically two games in one, which I believe was done to not only bring home that arcade experience but also to build upon it. Within the game, you have the ability to chose between DariusBurst Another Chronicle or AC mode, which includes all of the original arcade modes and original arcade screen ratio (perfect for dual screen or wide-format monitors and DariusBurst Chronicle Saviors or CS mode, which is the updated version of the game. And while you’re free to choose either mode, there are a few differences. In AC mode you have access to the original arcade game modes; Original, Original EX Mode, Chronicle Mode and Event Mode. Original (Easy, Normal and Hard) is what I call the starter zone while Original EX Mode is a tougher version, tailor made for shmup experts (Expect, Extreme and Exceed) . You know, the same people that are able to single credit an entire game.\n\nChronicle mode however is what stands out here as you are presented with several different missions and objectives to complete, as the systems are broken up into several areas. And speaking of those objectives, they range anywhere from completing an area with just one credit, completing an area with multiple players, playing with a specific set of equipment and so forth. It’s a definite time sink that’s for sure. Thankfully you’re not the only one who’s doing this, as everyone around the world who plays this game can also contribute to the AC progression via cabinets.  And just like it sounds, a cabinet is like a global progression save. For example, say everyone from a specific arcade was able to beat several areas, such as one of the specific multiplayer objectives. That objective would then contribute to unlocking more areas in the AC mode’s game, and everyone who is accessing that cabinet can benefit and contribute to that going forward. This allows access to literally hundreds of new levels and even exclusive AC mode only bosses that you likely wouldn’t unlock on your own.  And for those wondering, yes this is basically the NESYS  / NESiCAxLive Network being emulated at home. Oh, and when I mention hundreds of levels, I actually meant thousands! Yes, Taito is boasting that Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours’s AC mode will include over 3000 total stages. So you’ll be playing this for quite some time. No matter how you choose to play the game; Xbox 360, Xbox One, Dual Shock 4, Arcade Stick, as several other not very known controllers, you’ll be happy to know that the game supports just about every gamepad and joystick. I can attest to that myself as I’ve tested over 10 different configurations and were able to play the game with all of them.  And yes, you can even play with the keyboard, if you want to that is. I don’t see why, but at least that option is available.\n\nHowever in CS mode, the game changes. Similar to the chronicle mode in AC, this is mode is also laid out in a manner that you have set paths to take, after first area is completed that is. And unlike AC mode where you can chose the next stage, once you start the area you’re stuck on until it’s completed. You’re also handicapped to an extent as you will find that some missions will not allow power ups to drop as well as restrict you to a specific ship. However you won’t go into a mission blind as the overlay will tell you from the start what your ship will be, power up status, how many zones make up the area, and stage make-up.  Another difference is that while you play CS mode, you accumulate points based on how well you do in the zones you play through. Eventually after accumulating enough points you can trade them in for a new ship which you can then outfit with lasers, bombs and shielding. Using this tactic, you’re no longer forced to use the preset ship, which will make certain levels that may have seemed impossible before a total cake walk with the new ship. However there’s also a down side to this and every time you use that powered up ship, you will consume however many number of points you put into upgrading it. So you’ll have to track how much you have or if you start running low, to take off some of that added power or simply use the preset ship. It’s a nice method to keep you from overpowering your way to the end of the game. Via every transition in CS mode, you’re provided pieces of the on-going story that you’re currently taking place in. And while CS mode isn’t as expansive as AC mode as it pales in comparison of possible stages (200+ vs 3000), it’s still a fun addition and more up-to-date take on the Darius shooter. Also worth noting that CS mode is a single player affair while AC mode will allow up to 4 players.\n\nYou want ships? Well you won’t be disappeared here, especially if you’re familiar with the Darius games as there’s a handful of them playable in-game; Gaiden, Assault, Next, Legend, Formula, Origin, Second, Genesis and one ship that isn’t related to the Darius universe, the Murakumo, which is a CS exclusive ship btw. Apparently that ship hails from an older Taito game, one that I can’t quite figure out. And while it’s not directly related to the Darius ships of legend, the Murakumo is clearly a fantastic ship in its own right and is fun to play with, assuming you can afford the points required to pick it up. Fans of G-Darius may be slightly disappointed with the Genesis Silver Hawk as it does not feature it’s capture ball. It’s not a huge deal and it doesn’t detract from the game, but it would have been nice to see it included. Even still, there are subtle differences between the ships, so each one is unique in that retrospect. If you’ve ever played a Darius title, then you should be familiar on how the game functions. You pick your ship and off you go, pretty straight forward stuff. Thankfully the controls of the game are very responsive, and while playing the game I didn’t have any issues as I dodge the incoming fire. That said, if I died it was due to me slipping up instead of the game.\n\nRead the entire review here - http://www.theouterhaven.net/2015/11/61199/","December 3, 2015","true","16.5"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","38","50","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infinitypig/recommended/377870/","infinitypig","Piglett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infinitypig/","311 products in account","For fair disclosure, I was part of the closed beta testing team for Dariusburst CS.\n\nAn absolutely solid game, well worth the asking price involved. Having first hand experience with a DBAC arcade cabinet, I would've paid twice as much as this for the AC mode alone, regardless of the content of the CS mode.\n\nDariusburst Chronicle Saviours is a full conversion of one of the more successful recent arcade machines made, both in Japan and the west as well. The cab had 2 big widescreens plugged next to each other in 32:9 ratio, and the Steam version supports the same configuration - Put two widescreens together, and it'll run in Dual Screen mode. It's an absolutely INCREDIBLE spectacle for anyone even remotely into shmups, with the only thing missing being the subwoofer under your seat literally shaking you on boss warnings.\n\nOriginal and Original EX modes are your standard arcade runs - Pick a route, play 3 stages, chase high scores. For the score chasers among everyone, this is going to be where you'll be spending most of your time. Original mode contains Easy, Normal and Hard routes, with Original EX containing Expert, Extreme, and Exceed difficulties. The balance between all the stages is very, very well done.\n\nChronicle Mode is almost like an online social mission mode based mode, with a gigantic map full of different planets and several different missions. Each planet is represented by a hex grid, and every hex represents a run of stages or bosses with clear conditions and rules. Completing this mission and meeting these conditions will liberate that area, unlocking all the missions around it. The interesting thing here, is that you are working together with everybody else online set to the same cabinet number as you, so you're working in a joint effort to unlock and complete Chronicle Mode together, not just yourself.\n\nThe CS mode is the home conversion exclusive mode, with gameplay designed for a single screen for people that don't have dual screen setups. This contains new stages, music, new bosses, a new ship, unique rules, storyline and a LOT of music / sound from the older Darius games in the series. For people looking for a progression based game with a start and an ending (and a game that fills the whole screen instead of letterboxe 32:9) then CS mode is where you'll want to be playing.\n\nUltimately it's a HUGE game, pretty much suitable for shmup players of all skills levels. There's something for the hardcore and something for the casual audience too.","December 4, 2015","true","114.9"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","30","40","0","0"

Oh wow, where do I start?\n\nYou might have looked at the price point and went, "oh my god, that's high!” Believe me, I was like you too when I found out about it. I mainly bought this for its Arcade port of DARIUSBURST Another Chronicle, considering how hard it is to find the real cabinet version of the arcade game plus tons of new added content, I’d say it’s a really good buy.\n\nThe game is fun, it’s separated into two parts, CS Mode which is the new single player content made exclusively for this game and AC Mode, which is the arcade port of Another Chronicle. You have 9 (or was it 8?) different ships to choose from and some of them are from the older Darius games which was a pleasant surprise for me. (They even changes the music to older Darius music if you play as them in CS Mode, neat). The boss fights are great and the game boasts a pretty darn awesome soundtrack too, but I think a lot of us can agree the “freedom” song on the trailer is kinda meh.\n\nThe amount of levels you can play in this game is hugeeeeee! Mainly in CS Mode and Chronicle Mode in AC Mode. But a little warning. Sure, the game has tons of content but there's some repetition here and there and maybe some tweaks between the levels. Something like, "beat these levels and bosses with this ship". I think that might also be the case with Chronicle mode in AC Mode but I haven't really touched it yet during the time this review was written. But still, I enjoyed every second of it. And it really helps to get better for beating AC mode with 1 credit. Hey, on the bright sight, most of other shmups just have around 5 or 6 levels and this one have waaaay more than that. Fun!\n\nIf you’re a shmup fan, you definitely should get this but maybe when it's on sale, because honestly I still think it's a little bit pricey. But either way, this is the biggest shmup game I’ve ever played and I had a lot of fun with it, I hope when you bought this, you too will have fun with it :3","December 29, 2015","true","30.9"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","1"

It's still close to Positive rather than Negative anyway.\n\nPresentation\n\nThe presentation is top-notch. Transitions, particles, animations, models are all greatly done and the game runs at 60+ FPS. It still looks like a PS3 game and it's not something you would call not something you would call "current generation", but you don't play shoot'em'ups for "cutting edge graphics developments and ultra realistic shaders".\nIt's also very well optimized, no framerate drops and some people say they can play it on old laptops.\n\nMusic\n\nI absolutely love it. The music is probably why Dariusburst regarded as an "offbeat" shooter, because truth to be said, that's the main thing which distinguishes it from thousands of other shooters. Avantgardish upbeat jazzy tunes with a touch of bizarre vocals, ambientish piece with opera-like female vocals, etc. One of the levels even had the original track from an early SNES Darius game, in all its 16-bit glory.\nSome of tracks really stick with you. Worth listening to outside of the game, that's for sure.\n\nStory\n\nWhat story?\n\nGameplay\n\nThe movement of your ship is very fluid, controls are responsive, bullets on the screen have different colors, shapes and overall are recognizable. More details in the mode reviews below.\n\nAC Mode\n\nI couldn't play this mode for long because of the aspect ratio on a single monitor. It really hurts the experience for me and distracts from gameplay (and the text becomes barely readable).\nAll I can say from what I've seen that it's a port of an arcade game, classic Darius campaign with multiple routes for you to choose from. The enemies and levels are the same ones you see in CS mode. It features three modes in itself and has local co-op support (up to 4 players). It worth noting that there's an option for Unlimited Lives right from the start, very useful for people who play shoot'em'ups rather casually and want to see all content in the game or players who just gave up on trying to beat it.\n\nIf you have a dual monitor setup, go for it. It looks fantastic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSFxpEta1b4\n\nLoading screen with boss fight hints wasn't translated at all. Overall it feels like a very direct port from arcade. As the result, you can make a dedicated “arcade like” cabinet just for this game (if you a hardcore fan).\n\nCS Mode Review\n\nYou're given a special preset for your ship before you start a level. Instead of "coins", you have a number of hits you can take before it's Game Over. I believe the number changes with the ship preset, but it's about 30 for the standard one. 26 hits for Life 1, and then 3-4 hits for the rest of them (you usually have 3-4 lives per area).\nFirst levels are a walk in the park, but just by Level 5 or so the difficulty goes up and by Levels 9 and 10 it's already pretty tough and requires many thing to memorize.\nDon't let these first levels fool you, Dariusburst Chronicles is a hardcore and tough game.\n\n“3000+ levels” is listed as the main feature of the game, but for me it's a one huge fault.\nEverything feels like it was randomly generated, no zone has its own face. What's worse, is what bosses are also always the same and they repeat all the time. You complete one level, beat the boss and then you meet the same boss on the very next one. And then again. And again, and again and again. They all have different variations which change their attack patterns a bit, but they still all the same and have the same battle music.\nStandard enemy appearances are no different, you see the same patterns with the same enemies, same obstacles, same “surprise” enemy attacks. You almost cry in happiness when you see something new in the next area you play, be it a new music track or just a different background. It's recycled to no end and this is what made me to leave the game without willing to play it further. It should be noted that people who say “wow, it's so full of content, hundreds of  levels” are the same ones who enjoy endless grinding in JRPGs because “wow, I spent so many time on these battles, this 1000+ hour RPG is a great value for my money and developers surely didn't use any cheap tricks to make the game longer!”\n\nBut hey, there's still the AC mode. I just wish to have a dual monitor setup to play it properly.\nThe price of 50$ is pretty high, especially since it's a digital release. Lowering it to 20-25$ would be a better solution, in my opinion.\n\nSasha Darko for Game Obscura\nReview key provided by the publisher","January 31","true","6.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/headcrabrape/recommended/377870/","headcrabrape","Diebuster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/headcrabrape/","77 products in account","Ignored by the majority of the western gamers, beloved by a niche & reviled by others, the Darius series has always been a bizarre one... in more ways than one. Mechanically, it's in a specific place between "mainstream shmup everyone and their grandmothers has played" and "turbo-hardcore bullet-curtain bonanza where the projectiles are many, the screen is busy and the ships are all piloted by girls or guys that all embody a specific anime fetish". Darius is accessible enough that the everyman may happen to give it a shot, but maybe not inaccessible enough for some members of the hardcore shmup community. As a result, you'll find that even the most beloved older entries in this series get reviews that complain about them being "too tough" or "unfair", despite the difficulty being much more beginner-friendly than the average Cave game.\n\nThis is largely because Darius, unlike many other shooters of its kind where one hit means death, has an upgradable shield system; that way, the difficulty ramps up to crazy levels, but even low-level players can feel like they can achieve things. In that regard, this game's the best in the series; while not "hand-holding", both Arcade and Chronicle Saviours modes put effort into guiding you towards high-level play, not through tutorials but through masterfully executed pacing. The first few CS missions, anyone could beat but it will just keep ramping up more and more, until you're fighting screen-filling monstrosities with barely any health. This format, however, is a double-edged sword; on one hand, CS mode's length creates a perfect learning curve. On the other hand, it sometimes loses the adventurous, over-the-top feeling of playing Gaiden or G; level assets and base designs for bosses are often blatantly recycled. The levels can feel like they were created (extremely well, but still) with a level creator and you will find yourself playing increasingly difficult versions of what is basically the same stage. Even including the recycling, though, DBCS still has far more content AND more solid, player-friendly mechanics than many of its rival shmups (I'm looking at you, Ikaruga stage 2) that I don't feel the price is hugely unwarranted. I paid 35 for it, and chances are it'll go down for good as time goes on; if the game grabs you in a particular way or if you're a really hardcore scrolling shmup fan, the price shouldn't bother you. Otherwise wait for a sale. I recommend checking out the second Taito arcade game collection on PS2; it has both Gaiden and G in it. My main reason for purchasing this was to support the series for what it represents as a whole moreso than to own this specific game.\n\nThe bosses have more specific, memorable patterns than ones found in more Cave-inspired games, where the bosses can kind of mesh together. I don't remember specific bullet patterns in Crimzon Clover that well, but the attacks of the Stare or Fossil-types in Darius will always stay with me.\n\nThe biggest difference between my view and that of the gaming mainstream lies in what many believe to add to a game's "content" or its "bang for their buck"; I don't really care if I can watch Flash cartoons on TV, watch real-life stand-up comic acts and be immersed in a "living, breathing world"; I don't need the oh-so-important "quiet time" and "pacing" of pushing a block onto a switch. I just want a game with non-stop, carefully-crafted, solid mechanics and design and DBCS does a great job at that. Those that think shmups are "easy to make" and thus should be ten bucks by default simply haven't thought deeply about what goes into a well-crafted game.\n\nThe art direction beyond the boss designs is possibly my biggest issue; the levels, while still full of enemies flying around in beautifully planned out routes like mechanical shoals, look pretty bland compared to the sheer beauty of G and Gaiden's settings. The bosses make up for this, though, being well-designed by famous anime mecha designers with the foresight of a stylishly blocky aesthetic not held back by hardware limitations (remember that Darius Burst started as a PSP game).\n\nA common issue people have with this series is its music. From its very beginnings back in 1986, if you reached the iconically-designed, Go Nagai-esque King Fossil in the original Darius, your battle was accompanied by a melody that just... didn't sound quite right. For nearly three decades this tradition has been kept, this very game being heavily marketed using the level theme of the beginning of its Chronicle Saviours mode: a jazzy track with vocals that just feel... a tad off. This is because, from the get-go, Darius set out to create its own unique identity among the flood of shoot-em-ups of its era; a STRANGE identity. Surreal visuals, bizarre music written to inspire a variety of emotions; from relaxation, to getting high off your ♥♥♥, to a psychotic fit; and, above all else, a marine theme and a difficulty to match that make you feel like you are mere bait in a massive space-ecosystem of mechanical sea life. It's a type of game with genuine artistic merit that is never acknowledged as such.\n\nJust as Darius Gaiden, back in 1994, had its soundtrack panned by game magazines of the time ("[like] some fat bint warbling away like an Old Spice advert" so does Chronicle Saviours' most popular English upload have a comment section flooded with "wtf is this garbage music" comments. The gaming community doesn't seem very accepting of music that gets across emotions that go beyond what is typical, but the bizarre nature of Zuntata's music for Darius is obviously not a result of incompetent songwrighting; the falsettos have their carefully-controlled purpose. It's not Trout Mask Replica-level, but it still helps contribute hugely to this series' sense of identity.\n\nSo, long story short; a unique and fun game, part of a fun and unique series. If you're not quite sure if this is your thing, try Gaiden and G first and see what impact they have on you and if you think it's too expensive, just wait until the next sale.","April 19","true","73.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

Yes, Darius Gaiden and G-Darius had actual PC ports so I'm hoping that maybe one day we'll see those also showing up on Steam.\n\nWith that cleared, let's take a look at the game: quantity seems to be the keyword here (and with the asking price, no wonder!) The game features the full arcade version (with Original and Original EX modes as well as the MASSIVE Chronicle mode with planets and areas to liberate in a networking effort with other players across the world) and with its original aspect ratio.\n\nOn top of all the arcade goodness, there is also a more console-styled mode called Chronicle Saviours, featuring a full blown galaxy map full of planets and missions. This mode fits in one screen but unfortunately looks considerably worse than the arcade counterpart. It's also a fairly grindy mode compared to the arcade version, with over 200 stages but only so many different bosses (I think it's 40 bosses but that includes their variations, some of them pretty notable).\n\nGraphics-wise, the game looks nice but it's not a powerhouse by any means. On the bright side, you can run this even on a toaster of a laptop and it'll still run fine.\n\nOverall music, presentation, ship variety, boss design and mechanics are fantastic, although the "counterburst"/burst mechanic timings are incredibly hard to master but so rewarding when you manage to pull them off. (Thankfully, Chronicle Saviours mode has the Murakumo and Genesis ships, which allow you to counterburst at will!) The one big complaint I have is that mastering the no damage art is going to be beyond the skills of most.\n\nTo wrap things up, it's paradise time for shmup fans and unbelievable that such a title made it to PC. At the same time, a testimony of future proofing so I can't wait to see this running on dual monster 80" screens or something.\n\nThis is going to be a title you can come back every once in a while years on for "just a couple more shots"!","December 13, 2015","true","59.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

You beat it and then you either never play again or you play it again in case you missed the "True Final Boss".\n\nThe Darius Series was probably most well known for its branching paths, which gives it far more replayability than other games. You play a level and you choose between 2 levels, and you choose again, and again, you get the idea.\n\nThis one in particular is a bit different because it lets you choose 3 different starting levels, which branch out into different levels. There are 12 levels in Another Chronicle Mode and 12 DIFFERENT levels in Another Chronicle EX for a grand total of 24 levels in the AC Mode.\n\nSadly each Another Chronicle (and ACEX) Run ends quicker than the previous games because you only play 3/12 stages (G-Darius let you play 5/15 stages and Darius Gaiden let you play 7/28 stages, but you started on the same first level unlike DariusBurst CS), but the levels are excellently designed.\n\nBut none of this matters if the game is unfun, right? Well it's a very fun game. It's also difficult to beat if you're not credit-feeding the entire game. The scoring system probably isn't as complex as your average Cave bullet hell (which I think might actually be complex for the sake of complexity) but the scoring system is complex enough to allow for a meaningful leaderboard.\n\nBased on all of this alone, this game is definitely a bit more expensive but it's well worth the asking price.\n\nThis doesn't even get into the two extra modes added into this release though.\n\nThe two extra modes, Chronicle Mode (It's found in the AC Mode Menu) and Chronicle Saviours Mode (It's the CS Mode right under AC Mode.).\n\nChronicle Mode is a... different online mode that spans some 3000+ levels. As you and players work to clear these, more levels get unlocked for everyone (provided you're also online). Chances are you won't beat this without seriously investing your time into it regardless of skill.\n\nChronicle Saviours Mode is the single player campaign (200+ levels too!). They're more like missions where you accomplish certain tasks, sometimes with limitations imposed on you (like no powerup drops). The main draw of this mode is the ability to customize your ship. After each mission you obtain points, and those points go towards ships and upgrades. There are also 3 exclusive ships in this mode that cannot be played with in AC Mode.\n\nEach mission has a "preset" ship, and most customization options will be locked off towards the beginning simply because purchasing a ship chassis is really really expensive.\n\nThis game with its some 3224+ levels total is an insane value and by the numbers already justifies the pricing.\nWho knows, maybe some of these levels are rehashes or remixes of others? But I think the game is fun enough to warrent playing over and over again.\n\n\nALSO On an interesting note, they brought back the whole double monitor setup from the first 2 Darius games (for AC Mode). Shame they couldn't do the same for CS Mode or even provide the option for single or double monitor modes for both modes without any letterboxing.\n\n100% Buy it.

You'd be wrong in this case. It doesn't look like there's much here and yet I don't see myself exploring all of it for at least a few years right off the bat. You have several versions of a full size arcade game (complete with head injury warning!) and a new mode with 3000 (!) areas that spans the entire history of the Darius franchise including all the previous game's ships and nice snippets of story to flesh things out as you go. Beyond that there are some new ships with radical designs going as far as to add an omni directional controllable laser turret as a game mechanic. It has platitudes of options including the ability to remap buttons for each individual playable ship and more pedestrian ones like ship stocks. Also worth mentioning: this is the only shooter on Steam that not only recognized my gamepad instantly, it also configured every ship in a completely sensible way without my interference.\n\nThere is no online option aside from sharing cabinets which is both kind of cool and a bit strange, but If you have friends locally you're in luck! This has local multiplayer with FOUR simultaneous players at a time and the gameplay is suitably hectic as even under that amount of stress the game doesn't suffer from slow-down of any kind. The game is responsive and suitably optimized. That's not to say the visuals are tame either as some will actually bend your mind with the complexity of the on-screen action.\n\nA magical soundtrack accompanies the face-melting action and serves as the perfect cap to an awe-inspiring game.\n\nFew games, let alone shooting games can hope to approach the majesty of this product and almost none treat their fans with such a level of respect and service. If you love shooters you already own this. If you are a general gamer you should think really hard about checking it out.\n\nIf you are a Taito fan - welcome home.","December 4, 2015","true","29.2"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

Smoothness without fault, it just feels like this has been nurtured and cared for on build and post release. Indeed, good to see fixes for the PC edition coming regularly and little updates here and there; another sign this is a product that is deeply loved by the developers. Having the 32:9 display is a great feature too and is still impressive and imposing on a single screen of decent size in arcade mode.\n\nIndeed, when going into the big game content and playing the massive story mode, the resolution fills the screen - and comes as quite a shock (unless you're fortunate enough to actually have 2 x 16:9 displays at work - which are natively catered for as well, don't you know!). Awesome.\n\nAs a result, it is a game that should be loved by players too. Side scrolling shooters don't come along with this scale of content and abundance of quality often (if at all, and particularly on PC).\n\nSound is also truly fantastic; do yourselves a favour and treat yourself to a listen at high volume, with a serious sound system. Incredible quality, music and sound effects abound; just the initial menu ambience is enough to get the pulse racing before jumping in to a game with some exquisite soundtracks, great effects only to have your seat soiled by the WOAH! BOSS COMING WARNING SOUND!!! Dramatic in style, dazzling in quality, beautifully paced and executed. A crowning achievement.\n\nDB:CS is a truly sensational experience for one; chaotic, tactical and exciting in local multiplayer as well (up to 4!). Different ships provide different abilities, plenty to suit all sorts of players with pickups that need careful consideration in places too. Tactical play on pickups for multiplayer scenarios is required as there is a finite time limit on each pickup once the first player collects. Again, an extra dimension to a challenging game and format.\n\nReally great fun, excellent difficulty curve too and with a great swathe of bosses and enemy patterns, this is a game that should be picked up and loved - and I, for one, absolutely love it.\n\nSimply put, I can't recommend it enough.

But when I play shmups, I kind of drift into a hypnotic state, and I appreciate the subtle differences of having so many stages, even if many of them have the same bosses.

AC mode plays letterboxed on systems with a single display, but players with large, high-resolution displays, especially if they're the ultra-wide 21:9 variety, should not find this to be a problem. (For reference, the actual arcade cabinet has two 32-inch 1360x768 panels placed side-by-side, and therefore runs at 2720x768.)\nNew CS mode provides a single-player campaign that is fun and challenging without feeling overwhelmingly difficult (as many would find with the arcade game). CS mode plays on a single display, at a native 21:9 with letterboxing for 16:9 users (again, at up to 1440p), with a HUD layout that is essentially identical to the one used in the original 2009 PSP version of Dariusburst.\nGraphics aren't particularly detailed, but the game runs at an extremely stable 60 fps on my GTX 780M even when spanning two 1080p displays. On Intel HD Graphics 4600, it runs mostly smoothly but may slow down noticeably during intense scenes, most notably on the "WARNING!!" screen. (If you're like me and you have a laptop with NVIDIA Optimus, be sure to set the game to use the dedicated GPU for best performance, and you may also want to disable DPI scaling in the Windows compatibility settings for the game executable.)\nThe soundtrack, composed by Taito's house band Zuntata, is absolutely amazing. It's a haunting yet beautiful experience and it would be great if it was available for purchase at Google Play or as DLC for this game. The game even has classic pieces from older Darius games; an example is the Autahata area in the CS mode campaign, which uses the "tuna sashimi" music from the opening of Darius II (Sagaia) along with matching sound bites and Second Silver-Hawk as the preset ship.\nFor those of you who are confused by the virtual cabinet system, I'll explain why it exists and how it works. On the actual Dariusburst Another Chronicle arcade game, Chronicle mode progress is stored in the arcade cabinet itself, allowing different players who play on that cabinet to work together to complete and unlock levels as well as compete with each other to see who can complete the most levels. To replicate this experience with the home version of the game, a series of virtual cabinets is provided, and players around the world share these cabinets, each with its own Chronicle mode progress, just as if they were playing on the same physical arcade cabinets. You may either play on the randomly-selected cabinet, or choose any one of the (128 as of this writing) virtual cabinets to play on.\n\nThe price tag may seem a bit high even with the large amount of content, but if you're a fan of arcade shmups and have been waiting for something new, this is the game you're looking for. Recommended.","March 17","true","23.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I know people who ruined themselves by buying ROMs for the NeoGEo which were five times more expensive - just to have the real "arcade feeling" at home. Condidering this, the price tag for Dariusburst does not seem as "outrageous" as some claim.\n\nI spent a lot of time with shooters - but DARISBURST is the most epic I experienced. It's more than the sum of it's parts, it's got a special feeling of its own. The frantic action and the soundtrack draw you into this abstract adventure. I never did drugs, but I think DARIOBURST comes very close to it.\n\nOne of the things that I did not like with most other Japanese shooters is the fact that most of them are so short and repetitive. DARIOBURST however gives you endless levels, customations and bosses. You are on an epic mission to... save the world or just go on. You don't buy some levels, but a galaxy full of challenges.\n","December 4, 2015","true","7.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The gameplay mechanics are very solid and enjoyable.\n\nBut it falls short in one area which makes the game bland to me, feel free to read on if you want to know.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are there, the dev's nailed everything that a shump should have and more, but for me it was the music that I did not like.  I know this is very picky of me believe it or not.  If the soundtrack is not good then I won't enjoy the game as much, to me it feels like I'm just moving, dodging, and shooting in Dariusburst; I wasn't engaged it the combat.  Compared to other shump's that I own and play, the games maybe not be as good, but the soundtrack is just awesome and I'm just totally absorbed into the game.\n\nThe other thing which is very minor that I didn't like is that some nodes/maps in a specific mode can't be played unless you're playing with another player.  Thing is, that node/map can be completed by other players who are playing co-op and finish it.  This concept is new to me and is a little bit weird, I feel like this mechanic should not be in place, but it is what it is.\n\nOverall this is a very fun game, like I said earlier, the devs nailed all of the gameplay mechanics and is very satisfying to play.  Definitely pick this up if you don't really mind about the soundtrack or if you love old-school shump's.\n","December 4, 2015","true","1.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

And if I play in CS mode, its 16:9(1920x1080). The game is pretty awesome, at first I was like I can't believe I just spent that much for a shmup. Graphics are pretty decent 8/10, but not so sure about the sounds and music, maybe 6/10 for CS, but AC mode is much much better, 7.5/10, but sound and music are standard  Darius Arcade sound and music, its definitely got its own style thats for sure. The replayability is really good for a shmup, keep grinding, keep upgrading. So much of the same though, bosses look and act the same, just different names, its like deja vu..... LOL Most importantly the developers are listening to feed back, when I first got the game, AC mode played in this tiny little box in the center of my screen, 1920x540 of my 2560x1080, everyone with an ultrawide whined about it, and hey watcha know, the developer listened.

It's a simple system that adds a lot of depth to the battles, particularly with the bosses who are widely varied and full of destructable parts and many different patterns. There are also plenty of player ships to choose from, some forgoing the burst laser entirely for different special weapon systems or raw firepower.\nThere are two main game modes to choose from here: AC and CS. AC is a straight recreation of the arcade cabinet, with the original arcade mode, a remixed harder arcade mode, and the special server-wide challenge mode where all players join together to try and complete various short missions, such as time attacks, preventing enemies from passing you, or completing missions with specific ship setups.\nCS is the "story mode", though that's a loose description given that the story is nothing but a few lines of text every several stages. More similar to AC's challenge mode, CS gives you many different smaller stages to work through, but at a much easier initial difficulty, and preset ships and configurations to play them with.\nIf you want the interesting and longer-lasting stages, you'll want the original arcade mode. If you want pure challenges, then you'll want AC's challenge mode or CS mode instead. Since AC is a straight port of the arcade machine though, you'll also want to be equipped with a dual-monitor setup for the 32:9 aspect ratio it was made for or suffer a seriously letterboxed game window on one monitor.\n\nDariusburst CS comes at a premium price, but it's also a premium game. There's a massive amount of content and it can hardly be compared to the PSP original with how much has been expanded and improved. Just be sure that you're aware that the challenge and CS stages aren't going to leave much of an impression compared to the more elaborate arcade mode.","December 4, 2015","true","10.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

Later on I went on to play G-Darius and then didn't really touch it again until now.\n\nAny fans of the SHMUP genre should pick this up, and I myself have been trying hard to spread this news around to all of my friends to get it as well. It's a MUST HAVE for your Steam Library. This game features over +3000 stages (no, this is not an exageration), 47 Bosses, and over a dozen ships (5 currently DLC, which are also worth the money!) each with their own characteristics, weapons, and abilities that adds an amazing amount of replay value never before seen in ANY SHMUP game since R-Type Final.\n\nMy hope is that with the release of the SEGA SHMUP Franchise ships available, Taito will hopefully gain exclusive rights to include the legendary fighters, the Vic Viper of Gradius fame, and the R-9 Arrowhead of R-Type fame respectively into this game. If they do, this game will earn a perfect 10 in my book.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Great SHMUP Mechanics\n-Tight controls\n-Fairly leanant difficulty curve so any person can pick up the game and play\n-4-Player Co-op offers shared power-up pick ups, which has never been done before\n-Great Boss Fights\n-+3000 Stages!! Can you beat them all?\n-Varied Silver Hawk Ships from the earlier games complete with their weapons and abilities\n\nCONS:\n\n-The Harder Stages (EX Mode) will really test your patience\n-4-Player Co-op is only for local play, so make sure to grab extra controllers\n-Considering there are 3000 stages, some might start to feel "samey", considering there are 47 bosses spreaded amongst them, and not all of them appear in every Game Mode.\n\n\nOverall, this game will keep you entertained for hours, and it's a great way to introduce any newcomers into the SHMUP franchise and prepare them for the much harder bullet hell games that are currently for sale on Steam.

I first played the cabinet in Taiwan and couldn't get enough of it; I made my friends play it with me every time because IMO where this game really shines is in ship diversity and multiplayer.  Every ship is unique in some way--there is truly something for everyone--and some ships can do team attacks with each other, how cool is that?  Also the powerups that float across the screen can be grabbed by everyone as long as they get it before it fades.  Other reviewers have touched on gameplay already so I won't get into that.  If you really want to see gameplay, I highly suggest watching some videos - you get a good feel for how the mechanics work and most likely if you think it looks really fun to play just from watching alone, it will be an even better experience when you're the one behind the wheel.\n\nNow, is this worth the pricetag?  I've logged 24 hours so far and that's just from playing AC mode.  I barely touched Chronicle and haven't played EX at all aside from just messing around for a few minutes to see what it was.  There is so much replayability in this game due to the different ships, routes, and modes, that you will be entertained for a very long time.  If you are a min/maxer and/or completionist, I imagine you could easily sink over 100 hours playing this game.  If you love shmups and think this game looks fun, I personally think the price is worth it.  I have sunk much more than $50 playing this game in arcades alone so for me this is a bargain, lol.\n\nAs for difficulty, the nice thing about this game is you can personalize your difficulty setting.  There are 3 starting zones (easy, medium, hard) and from there they branch into 2 zones each (easy-bottom and medium-top zones overlap, as do medium-bottom and hard-top), and those into another 2 zones (zones overlap again), etc.\n..................[H] (easiest path)\n............[D]<\nEASY....[A]<.....[ I]\n............[E]<\nNORMAL [ B]<.....[J]\n............[F]<\nHARD....[C]<.....[K]\n............[G]<\n..................[L] (hardest path)Top zones are always easier than bottoms ones, so it follows that if you always choose the top zone then you are choosing the easiest route, and if you always choose bottom zones then you are choosing the hardest route.  So if you start off in the medium zone but think it's too difficult, at the next zone you can choose the top zone which will bring you back into the easy route.  That being said, I can 1credit this game on the hardest path until the last boss, but I have yet to get past the stage 4 opening boss in ikaruga on the easiest difficulty, lol...","April 7","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has beautiful visuals (besides a few flat textures), a gigantic and amazing soundtrack, spanning 30 years of Darius history, nine different playable ships to choose from, 3097 stages to unlock with friends and strangers alike (no online multiplayer, but a cloud system in which players from all around the world cooperate to "save the galaxy") and 200 more to complete on your own, more than forty exciting bosses... The list goes on.\nPlay it in dual-screen with three more friends, I'm sure you will enjoy it.\n\nBuy it now, as there is nothing to dislike here. Come on, click the green button at the top of the page. Ignore the price. JUST DO IT, as that overused meme guy says.","December 4, 2015","true","51.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mustafar1703/recommended/377870/","Mustafar1703","Mustafa1703","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mustafar1703/","218 products in account","Im writing this review, in hopes that it will garner the attention of people, who are either in the progress of deciding on whether they want to purchase this game or not, as well as hoping that it will get the attention of people, who have so far not heard of either this game, or the franchise as a whole. Most of this review includes what this game includes. For the 'review' review, scroll further below if you wish to skip what Darius Burst is all about.\n\nDarius Burst: Chronicle Saviours is so far the newest entry in the Darius series by Taito, and making it the first home console/PC port after almost 17 years, with G-Darius having been the predecessor.  So far though, DBCS is so far the 4th iteration of the Darius Burst series, having first started on the psp as a japanese only release, and then having been preceded by 2 arcade-only versions, namely Another Chronicles, and Chronicles EX.\n\nDarius Burst: Chronicle Saviours contains 2 differing gamemodes, one which is the afformentioned Chronicles Ex, and the other being the newly added mode exlusive to CS, namely called CS mode.\n\nChronicles EX mode is a perfect copy port of the Arcade version, Chronicle EX. Chronicle EX is pretty much how one would imagine playing an arcade game, minus having to spend the extra expenses whenever wanting to play it. You start of by choosing one of 4 modes, with the first 2 being Chronicles and Chronicles EX. Those 2 are the standard mode, where you select your ship, and then choose from a wide range of routes, which increase in difficulty as you progress downward. The multiple route choice provides plenty of replayabilty, and most of them contain a variety of unique bosses, each with their own way of fighting.\n\nBoth start of with the progression through each pre-selected areas, as you blast your way through hordes of enemies, who attempt to blast you to space dust in return, while collecting powerups from defeated enemies, to strenghten your main weapon, missles and shield. This concludes with the aformentioned boss, who needs to be defeated to progress.\n\nFrom the afformentioned ship selection, one is able to choose from 9 differing ships, each with their own unique playstyle, and most coming with somehting called a burst weapon. The burst weapon is considered your trump card, allowing you to either use it offensively to blast away huge hordes of enemies, or defensively, to protect yourself from barrages of laser fire. Most are unique to each ship, and require a different strategy to be used efficently.\n\nFollowing this is the challenge mode, which simply consists of over 3000 pre-set routes, each with their own challenges, such as lack of powerups, or a shield. The unique gimick of it this time is that players around the world help eachother unlock the challenges, allowing you most likely to play most of them in due time at any given order. You are still able to complete them all yourself, which will show seperate indicators on whether it is unlocked, and whether you have already completed it.\n\nMoving on from the classic arcade mode is the brand new CS mode. CS mode can be considered the story mode, as it tries to piece together the story that began from the original psp version of the game, and tries to finally wrap it all up. CS mode includes a variety of new bosses that are exclusive to it only, as well as up to almsot 200 missions, which are all abotu defeating the Belzer army, which are the Gigantic Cyborg Sealife.\n\nNow, for people who are avid fans of the SCHMUP, this game can be considered recommendable. Compared to many previous games of the same genre, the amount of levels, as well as unique bosses is mind boggling. The amount of routes as well add to the replayability, and if you are one who loves games with an arcade feel to it, then this game is a great choice.\n\nCriticism, however, is not devoid of this game. For once, the game currently lacks online multiplayer, which I am hoping will be added in a later update. This is due one of the features of this game being the 4 player multiplayer. This is required too for some of the challenges in EX mode to be completed, or even be playable, although the single player challenges far outnumber the multiplayer ones.\n\nAlot of the translation work has not been done yet for Chronicle EX mode, with alot of the starter text still being in their native japanese language. The multiple endings at the end of each route however, do have their text translated, which is a plus indeed. CS mode however, is fully translated.\n\nCS mode so far has proved to be enjoyable, but the story aspect seems to fall a bit flat, with most of the story being told in a overview through the level select screen, and additional text simply telling you why exactly you are moving onto the next zone.\n\nAs many people have complained, the price for a game of this genre seems a bit on the high end, which makes it a bit problematic. Darius Burst is a very enjoyable game, but people are less likely to try it when the price is as high as this. This includes people who are have played SCHMUPS before, or even previous Darius games, so this makes me especially sad. The price range can be justified though, given the game was released worldwide alongside japan, as well as having all these additional features, and plenty of translations, so I recommend people here to atleast spread the word of the game, and to watch some gameplay on youtube, to hopefully encourage others to atleast give this game a shot.\n\nAs a final verdict, there have been more challenging games of this genre, but Darius Burst: Chronicle Saviours is a hard to miss entry in both SCHMUPS and the Darius franchise, providing one with plenty of ships from throughout the series, tons of challenges, unique bosses by the load, and even including the entire soundtrack from the franchise, all the way back to the first Darius game in 1986. If you are willing to help the SCHMUP genre gain higher ground again, as well as being willing to spend a bit extra for something fun, then this game is indeed highly recommended.","December 4, 2015","true","71.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sixonethousand/recommended/377870/","sixonethousand","PlasticMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sixonethousand/","88 products in account","Taito's long-running Darius series continues in Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours, the largest Darius game to date. For quite some time, I've really wanted to play Dariusburst Another Chronicle, but hardly any arcade cabinets of that game have been installed outside of Japan. After five years, the rest of the world can finally savor this faithful port of Dariusburst Another Chronicle EX at home, known as AC Mode in the main menu. The 32:9 aspect ratio is preserved to give players the double-wide gameplay its stages are designed around.\n\nAnother interesting feature of AC Mode is the ability to select a virtual cabinet from the options. Back at the arcade, there were more than 1,000 stages in Another Chronicle's Chronicle Mode that many players could collaboratively complete. Since Chronicle Saviours is intended for playing at home, one player could never go through all 3,000 stages which have been included in this game. As such, the collaborative arcade experience is mimiced with virtual cabinets. Players around the world who belong to a certain virtual cabinet (17, for example, which is what I'm on) can collaborate on completing the Chronicle Mode stages in the same manner they would on a public arcade cabinet.\n\nDariusburst Chronicle Saviours also introduces CS Mode, a single-player campaign which narrates the Darius storyline as you play. CS Mode is designed to fill standard 16:9 displays so everything can be seen more clearly, should you not have two identical monitors connected to your computer. Progression in this mode differs from the traditional Darius zone branching, as it has linear missions that can be selected on a map comparable to that of AC's Chronicle Mode. Branching is not totally absent, though. After completing certain missions, the paths may fork out, allowing you to play later stages in different orders.\n\nAs always, Taito's in-house band Zuntata has composed the soundtrack for this game. Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours continues the tradition of odd yet captivating music that has become a staple of the Darius series. As you're playing, you may notice the stage design follows certain cues in the music. Pyramid has been working closely with Zuntata, and this style of reverse development is prevalent in Darius II and onward, so it doesn't come as a surprise; it just continues this awesome idea.\n\nDariusburst Chronicle Saviours is a beautiful shooter that's very fun to play, and I can highly recommend it to anyone - especially due to its beginner-friendliness for newcomers to the shoot 'em up genre. The Silver Hawk ship can be equipped with a shield that may be able to withstand plenty of hits depending on the circumstances, and AC Mode provides an Infinite Ships Entry mode that allows players to waste as many ships as needed without being interrupted by a continue prompt. Scores will not count in this entry mode, though. Give it a shot! You'll be given a long, long road to follow for your money.","December 4, 2015","true","85.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

In contrast to more traditional "five stages and done" arcade games, the original arcade release of Dariusburst: Another Chronicle EX (DBCS's "AC Mode") contains 24 stages ranging from very easy to very hard, eight unique player ships, and a separate "Chronicle Mode" where players can collaboratively chip away at a massive selection of thousands of stages.\n\nThis alone would be enough to keep a player occupied for a very long time, especially one who was interested in delving into the game's scoring system with each of the eight different ships, each of which generally plays much differently than the rest. However, Chronicle Saviours also includes a completely separate "CS Mode" which, while somewhat similar to Chronicle Mode, more or less functions as the game's "story mode." CS Mode includes a variety of special challenges, stages, and bosses not found in the original arcade release, and with a map of over 200 stages to unlock, it will keep you busy for quite a while if you're interested in fully completing it.\n\nGraphically, it's not likely to knock anyone's socks off on a technical level, but the audiovisual presentation still manages to impress from time to time. Many of the bosses -- especially the largest ones -- create quite a spectacle, and the game's soundtrack is generally excellent. There are still a handful of noticeable flaws: controller mapping is a bit inflexible, and "AC Mode" is a straight port with no added functionality -- meaning no practice mode, no replay functionality, and no extras like an "all stages" mode.\n\nWhile I would recommend this game without hesitation to fans of the shooter genre who are able to get lasting enjoyment out of these games, it may obviously be a bit of a harder sell for a casual player who's just looking for a couple evenings' worth of credit feeding. Even then, though, four-player co-op with friends on a super-widescreen setup can still be a recipe for a pretty good time.","December 14, 2015","true","25.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's the typical Darius arcade mode with branching stages, then there's the mission-based chronicle mode. Missions are just series of stages and bosses, with occasional rules or limitations or preset ship designs. But they aren't kidding when they say there are well over a thousand of these.\n\nThe virtual arcade cabinets are an interesting design choice for online play. Each cabinet shares the unlocked stages across all players, so cabinet 0001 would probably be a good one to compete for global high scores or just access the fully-unlocked Chronicle mode, while you (and friends) could probably pick a later cabinet if you want one to yourself. There's also a CS mode which is basically a combination of Chronicle mode and the story-based arcade stages.\n\nMechanically, this game is as tight as any other Darius. Sometimes you're crushing waves of enemies, but when you do enter bullet hell with depleted shields, it can get harrowing. Ships operate based on the game they originated from, which is a nice touch.\n\nI won't lie; this is an expensive game for the genre. But the developers really made the extra effort to create a true-to-life port of the arcade game you would get from buying the thousand-dollar cabinet. My only knocks against it are the lack of online co-op and the catch-22 of trying to emulate the arcade screen resolution if you aren't using multiple monitors. But there's always room for updates.","December 30, 2015","true","19.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The lasers sound like lasers, the explosions sound like explosions, not much to say.\n\nThe music is great, and it has such a large variety of it(A shame you don't get to have the sound track, even if you buy the delux edition).\n\nIt has the right level of difficulty, some parts can be easy, some levels and bosses can be tough, its enough to engage you, with only 2 rediculous boss types.\n\nThe ships are numerous, about 9 of them, and of those 9, 8 of them are fun There is a good variety there as well. Each ship, though they mostly have pretty similar missiles/bombs, and basic shots, they differ with their burst beam mechanics which is hard to explain in text.\n\nThere are a total of 16 different boss types, and each boss type can have 1-3 variants on average, with the exception of the "jaw" boss, which has about 5 variants. Each boss type can be similar or very different from each other, the game manages to stay fresh with this kind of variety.\n\nThe level design can range from moving around empty space, to going through enemy bases which requires menuvering through tight spaces. Its kind of odd to explain, but while the game manages to throw a large variety of different levels at you(and sometimes the exact same ones), each level is modular in its design. Expect it to be a little repetative, though the game will always occasionally give you a new level type. In CS mode, each zone is basically a set of levels and bosses, the "area select" screen shot above shows an example, you will have 2 leves, a boss, a level, then the last boss of that zone. there are 185 different zones in CS mode. (possibly more, the more you beat the more you unlock)\n\nIt is also worth noting that the game also comes with the Arcade version, Another Chronicle, which if you have duel monitors the game is in ultra wide screen. But if you have a single monitor, then...well, the image gets compressed if you will, its very wierd looking, but Chronicle Savior mode(PC mode basically) is full screen. The arcade differs in a few ways to CS mode.\n\nThere are only minor problems with the game:\n- your ship moves pretty slowly, especially in AC mode. (becuse the screen its twice wider if that makes any sense)\n- Some weapons can only have 3 bullets on screen, as in you fire three bullets, and if they miss your target, you can't fire any more until they hit something else or go off screen, why they designed it this way confuses me, because the gaiden has no limit to how many projectiles it can fire.(and oddly enough does the least ammount of damage)\n-Your hit boxs is pretty big, its basically the entire ship.\n- No online multiplayer, only local.","March 16","true","83.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The dual monitor support of the Steam release works great, looks amazing and runs as smoothly as anyone could hope for even on the most modest of set ups.\n\nThe added content for  the port (The Chronicle Saviours mode) is where I've spent a lot of my time with the pre-release version of the game and there's great quality content there to back up and compliment the already huge amount of content offered in the arcade mode (AC mode). This mode is single screen only and as such doesn't have the letterboxing the arcade mode has when played on a single screen.\n\nSome of the OST may not appeal to all (the track 'Freedom' from the trailers has attracted some criticism :P) but in general it matches the high standard set by previous entries in the series. In fact the game uses and remixes various tracks (as well as ships and sound effects) from across the Darius series which is a nice touch.\n\nThe price point is fair in my opinion, £23.99 (UK price) is very little for what you get in return. I've seen people baulk a little at the price when compared to others in the genre e.g. (Ikaruga and Mushihimesama) but you have to consider that those games had already had a myriad of home ports before finally arriving on Steam. This is the first time we have a port of Dariusburst (outside the 2009 PSP release) and with the  specifically  added content for this version I really feel the price is justified.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.","December 4, 2015","true","30.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excitehype/recommended/377870/","excitehype","Excitehype","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excitehype/","363 products in account","Full Review for DARIUSBURST: Chronicle Saviours (PC, PS4, PSVita) was originally published on Excitehype[excitehype.com]\nFor many hardcore arcade/SHMUP fans, Another Chronicle EX is the main selling point of Chronicle Saviours. It comes complete with 4 player local co-op on the PS4 and Steam versions and contains 9 ships for you and your friends to choose from all with different abilities and...i kid you not, over 3000 stages with various difficulties for those that like their bullet hell SHMUPS with an extra bit of insanity. One sweet feature exclusive to the Steam version of the game is the ability to utilize ultra wide monitors as well as multiple monitors so you can get that real arcade cab experience from your own home.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nD8fWpQz58w\n\nBut going back to the stages and difficulty, the game allows you to basically choose your own path based on a difficulty and after each stage, you have the option to go down one of two paths for a different experience each time you play with some stages being harder than others. I started out on normal and went the safest route possible and still ended up using a ton of continues just to get through that course. So just note, this game is no walk in the park as one should expect with a Japanese Arcade Shoot Em Up. If I had the chance to play this in the arcade, i'm pretty sure it would take most of my cash.\n\nHowever, Another Chronicle EX isn't the only thing Chronicle Saviours has to offer as it also includes a Single Player Campaign, CS Mode, which comes complete with a brand new story. CS Mode is a bit like AC EX but not. The first noticeable thing is that the game is in full screen/window unlike AC EX which stayed true to it's widescreen arcade counterpart but gameplay wish both games as very similar. The only thing thats truly changed is the fact that you chose campaign missions instead of choosing your own path and you also have the ability to customize your ship with different weapons once you unlock them so you can setup your ship to your liking. CS Mode is a nice addition to the game providing even more ways to play the game, especially if you wanna just go it solo and you can battle your friends and others on the ranking leaderboard for the best score and times.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxeF3IptUiw\n\nAnother plus to Dariusburst CS is the awesome soundtrack by Taito Sound Team, Zuntata (which also worked on the previous entries in the series) who provide this crazy electronic jazz fusion complete with haunting moments which feels just right for crusing through space filled with deadly bullet helling aliens, asteroids and ginormous ships ready to do you in.\n\nWhile Chronicle Savious has a ton of positives, it does have a few downsides which include no online multiplayer. Sure it's not needed for this sort of game since local co-op gives you more of an authentic arcade feel by buddying up with your friends on the couch. But in this day and age, it should have been considered as online multiplayer would only help the game for those who can't always gather up a friend or even 4 to help assist with completing the most difficult of stages.\n\nAnother thing is Dariusburst's pricing, the game is being looked at as a full retail release with the PS4 and Steam versions priced at $59.99 and the Vita $39.99. The game is great, don't get me wrong but I felt at best that this title was valued around $20-$30. I mean that is the nature of most digital arcade titles outside of Japan. People expect for a $60 price tag an indepth AAA title and I think the price will make a lot of people pass on the title until it goes on sale sadly. But all in all, Dariusburst is a great game for those who love arcade shooters and local co-op, we would just recommend waiting for the price to drop a bit before giving this one a go. However, if you are impatient for the games you love, dive right in, the water is fine.","December 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

I picked this up because it looked like an awesome, content-filled, shooter.\n\nAnd, for the most part, it is. But the major caveat is that AC mode plays in a crazy widescreen format (designed for multiple monitors, or screens, I guess...). I've not figured out if there is a way to make the screen actually fit my monitor but, had I known that a major portion of the game was like this, I would have reconsidered my purchase.\n\nI can't really recommend a purchase because, for the price, this is too big a problem.

Strange mix, but an amazing one. It's Darius.\n\nThere are basically two modes: AC (arcade mode, with dual screen) and CS (the new one, single screen). In AC you can do the classic mode, with multiple difficulty and paths, the EX mode, for japanese pros, and the Chronicle mode. This last one offer thousands of levels, with pre-configured ships and an objective to fulfil (use 1 coin, play in 4 players coop, etc..).\nSC mode, instead, offer a proper campaign, with a story that spans about all the Darius Chronology.\n\nIf you're a old fan of G-Darius, like myself, you'll probably be disappointed that there are no capture balls anymore, but at least the "counter beams" mechanic is back (although it works a little differently, now you have to time it correctly RIGHT before being hit by the beam).\n\nThis is a MUST BUY for every shmup lover, it has an impressive amount of content, even for that price tag at the release (around 30-35€). Having it on Steam is a blast.\n\nFor 144hz users:\nI've played it on a GTX970 on both single and dual screen and had no issues at all. Unfortunately, if you have an ASUS ROG PG278Q or a 144hz monitor, the game speed is tied up to the framerate, so i basically played 4 hours at something like 2.5x turbo speed (144fps instead of 60).

They are also pleasantly challenging and not flat out impossible even for someone like me who generally sucks at shoot 'em ups. I'm giving the game a 4/5, I do not see myself running out of stages to do any time soon.\n\nThere are two modes to choose from at the start menu. AC Mode, Another Chronicle, where you can play with friends through stages or go into chronicle where there a HUGE number of star systems to beat with different missions and rules to follow to achieve them. Then there's CS Mode, Chronicle Saviors, where you play through a single player campaign.\n\nI really like the music in this game, it has a very interesting and unique sound sometimes. The graphics in AC Mode are ok and then in CS Mode they are really improved. The controls are alright as well, but I prefer playing with my controller instead of hitting z, x, c, and v on my keyboard.\n\nI'm disappointed that the loading screens are in another language since I'm sure there's some useful information on there I just can't read it. Another thing that's a bit annoying is that in Chronicle Mode it is really hard to read the objectives for the areas. There's also no multi-player and some of those objectives require four players so you'll have to find some friends and controllers if you want to do those.\n\nI do wish there was an actual tutorial you can select that'll tell you everything, but if you leave it on the AC Mode title screen for about 30 seconds you'll get a random short video that'll tell you a couple useful tips.\n\nHave Fun Gamers!","January 30","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of talk about not having enough content to justify the price tag of $49.99. While I'm a fan of the series going back to Darius Gaiden I'd like to assure that in comparison to a lot of games released today you'll get plenty for your money. I'd like to get a few things off my chest first...\n\nA ton of gamers these days seem more than ready to put money on the newest release of "Call of Carbon Copy of the last game that you played a year ago III: A different color spectrum edition" for $59.99 that has much of the same gameplay from last years model but few new features for the genre. Yet sales are great year after year that send a message to developers to make more of the same. Whatever the game genre that is discussed it doesn't benefit from more of the same but instead creativity and originality.\n\nAlso keep in mind that in a digital age more and more games will be going towards a fully digital presentation as opposed to a retail package with disc, book, and case.\n\nDarius Burst has more than just side scrolling SHMUP excellence but it presents it in a wonderful package. Sure it's all digital but think about why it might cost that much:\nThe arcade machine at home (which is JUST AC mode in Darius Burst: CS) will run you around $10,000.00. I'll pay $49.99 instead.\nThe AC Chronicle mode has thosands of stages that are unlocked on virtual arcade cabinets with the help of thousands of players around the world.\nIf you can support it you can use dual monitors to span the game across both for the best arcade experience at home.\nThe CS Mode gives you tons of stages to challenge you in multiple ways.\nCS Mode allows you to purchase ships from past Darius games. Once purchased the game customizes the experience to that ship. Powerups and weapons take on the properties of that Darius release including in many cases the music too.\nYou can use points acquired in the CS mode to outfit your ships to tackle a specific challenge of if you prefer a specific weapon level. Having trouble with that 14 stage 1 credit run in CS mode? Pay for just enough armor to get you through or risk it all by just using the powerup throughout gameplay.\nTons of bosses and their variants await you.\nIt's almost like getting a few different Darius releases in one package.\nPlus Taito's in house band  Zuntata [zuntata.jp] and their ability to bring original music to the genre. If your a fan of the SHMUP genre do yourself a favor and pick up Darius Burst. It truly is worth the amount they're asking.","January 18","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This adds a nice lil replay value to everything, especially AC mode, as you can now replay the levels with the different ships to see how they work / if it makes the level any easier.\n\nHowever as many have probobly said before, the price for it is abit high (thankfully not TOO high like most modern-day console games. 60$ bucks for mario...my ♥♥♥).\n\nOh, and if you want to get the DLC Art booklet thingy, buy the package version for only 10$ more. Trust me, its not worth the 15$ individual price.","February 21","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being able to controll the Silver hawk from G-Darius and have a beam duel is still amazing.. actually it's more amazing than COOL is... Either way This game is full of content to keep you going for months Both the cabinet and the CS mode has at least over 200+ stages even if most are repeats with the same enemy.\n\nThey even treat you with music from the old games and sound effects. Darius Gaiden has the weirdest alarm sound when you encounter a boss. But I love it all.\n\nThis game is a must get, if you like 2D flying shoot em up then this game is for you!","January 15","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can choose how many points to spend for upgrading your unlocked ship (fire, bomb, shield) in every mission, but... if you fail the mission you lost the point for upgrades that you have spent, so be carefull.\nThe only flaw is the lack of "capture" function the was current in G Darius for PS one.\nI'm having a lot of fun this game :-)","January 15","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
