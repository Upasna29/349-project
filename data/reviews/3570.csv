"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gumbyjd/recommended/3570/","gumbyjd","Mr. J.D. Gumby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gumbyjd/","253 products in account","Sadly, this is a rather mediocre hidden object game that was developed by "SpinTop" rather than PopCap (who only published it) - wish I'd noticed that before purchasing as PopCap themselves make excellent games.\n\nThere is a simple story-framing piece of text at the start, then it's the same New York-themed screens (with like 10 objects to find in each) over and over and over, with each grouping of 2-8 (of the 25) screens separated by simple match 3, word find, jigsaw or rotation puzzle, with no actual story (unlike, say, Pirateville from MumboJumbo, where you have story setups for every screen you play).  Got about 12 "clues" (levels, out of 25) in before giving up in boredom, so I don't know if they bothered with anything other than a simple text outro once you find the will...\n\nIn short, not worth the effort or the price - and *always* check to make sure PopCap's the developer as well as the publisher before buying. :/\n\nEDIT: Oh, and worst of all, if you leave your mouse on an object while you're searching for others (to remind yourself where it is so you can get multiple in a row for a speed bonus), it will pop up a big panel, that you have to click away, once per scene telling you that you can use the hint button (no matter how many times you may have used that button in the past).  So incredibly annoying.","January 3, 2015","false","9.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherosh/recommended/3570/","cherosh","Tentacle-Kitty (Level 4)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherosh/","482 products in account","Another Mystery P.I. Game, another about 10 hours I dumped into a game of persistence and patience.\n\nAs with the Mystery P.I. games I finished before, "The Lottery Ticket" and "Lost in Los Angeles", the principle is this: you have a huge picture, and you'll have to find objects, which often are camouflaged in color and shape. Whether you play with or without time limit is pretty much irrelevant. If you have played Hidden Object games before, you'll be fast to find everything.\n\nThe story of an eccentric New York billionaire having hidden his fortune somewhere in NY City is a flavor to the game. It is not a very... gripping story. It pretty much gets glossed over. But it's nice.\n\nNot recommended unless it's massively reduced or purchased in a bundle.\n\nOne Mystery P.I. game from the Popcap bundle remaining for me. But I will play and review. I must be insane.\n\nPS: At least 2 hours are due to having the game running in the background.","January 22, 2015","false","11.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Like other "find the item" games from this company (Rosecliff Island, Amazing Adventures), this game delivers what it promises: a simple puzzle game that is fun.","January 24, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
