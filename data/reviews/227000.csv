I'm not a big fan of adventure games but I've played a few and enjoyed them greatly such as The Longest Journey and Syberia. I am, however, a big fan of good storytelling and in that aspect this game gets a perfect score. One can tell that a lot of love and attention to detail went into making this game: beautiful environments and wonderful music that fits and creates great atmosphere. There are different ways you can go about solving the puzzles. The main character is really interesting, the different themes are well developed and there are no clear good and evil cliches. The game is very reminescent of Planescape: Torment in terms of themes, music, atmosphere, and interesting character and sidekicks. I highly recommend this game, very very beautiful, you will be touched especially at the end. Perfect score 10/10","September 9, 2013","true","15.4"," 48 of 49 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","48","49","0","0"

It does suffer a bit from the puzzle adventure syndrome, that is, it's not always clear how to solve a problem with the stuff you have, even when you have everything that's needed. I know this is to be expected in a way but it still bothers me.\nThe old nerd in me suspected some of the details revealed in the final scenes right from the start but the game was compelling enough to just draw me in the atmospheric setting and make me concentrate on what was happening at a certain point. Hard to say the same about most games I've tried.\nThe music may be a bit repetitive in the long run but it really adds to the mood, it fits perfectly. So much so that I actually noticed, appreciated and left it on: in other games I usually have it on low volume or off entirely.\nThe graphics are retro, but in a good way. A shiny AAA engine would only marginally enhance the game. Some may even think that this old school style is actually better/more suited to this kind of game, can't say they are completely wrong.\nAgain, highly recommended, best game I've played in a long while.","August 30, 2015","true","5.6"," 44 of 44 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","44","44","0","2"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Primordia is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Wormwood Studios and made available on Steam through the Greenlight system.  It features a fully voice-acted cast with a retro graphical art style that pays homage to the classical age of gaming.\n\nThe story of Primordia takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where machines have taken over the world after the human race fought itself into extinction.  You follow the adventures of a self-aware android named Horatio Nullbuilt and his companion Crispin Horatiobuilt both residing inside a crashed ship called 'The UNNIIC'.  When a mysterious and powerful robot steals their power source, both Horatio and Crispin embark on a quest to seek out a new power source which eventually leads them to the mechanical city of Metropol.\n\nPROS:+ Good Retro Art Style\n+ Great character writing and developments\n+ Good story with an interesting back-story\n+ Atmospheric environment and world design\n+ Consequence-based choices that can affect the final outcome of the story\n+ Fully voice-acted characters\n+ Healthy game time of at least 6-8 hours depending on how quickly the player solves the puzzles\n+ Steam cloud support\n\nCONS:- No 'HD' or Widescreen Support, in which the game opts instead for a pitiful 320x200 resolution which, frankly speaking, makes my eyes hurt.\n- The game has a fetish for the color brown\n- Puzzles are sometimes irritatingly difficult\n- Does not expand much on the back-story which, in my opinion, is far more interesting than the main story\n- The game's humor is a hit and miss\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT POINT-AND-CLICK EXPERIENCE.  I Green-lit this game when it showed up in my Queue because I was very interested in its concept, setting, and back-story, and once it was released I purchased it and found a fun and absorbing point-and-click game with homage to the classical style of the genre.\n\nDespite  the resolution  locked in a  low 320x200 with an excessive use of brown that is stressful to the eyes, the art design is still pretty good which shows in the character and environment designs.  The puzzles can seriously be irritatingly difficult but satisfying to complete with some puzzles directly affecting the game's ending.\n\nOverall, Primordia is a great point-and-click adventure game that provides at least 6-8 hours’ worth of game time.  In addition, for only $10 (or your regional equivalent), it is definitely worth a look especially if you are a fan of the genre.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

I wanted to remember my childhood experience with such games, so I chose this game to do it with. It's a good game for its genre.\nI enjoyed the world, characters and story the game offered. It was quite entertaining. Solving the puzzles felt good and the story (though not character driven) evolved in a way that made sense.\nThere was only one major flaw in the game - a puzzle that required the player to know a different language! If you don't know that language, then be prepared to look it up ... so if you plan to play this game without cheating (like my plan was), then be prepared to be disappointed (or as in my case outraged) with this puzzle. Good luck with trying to have a good time with the game after that puzzle ... http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474516938 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470028951 Unlocked all achievements!","July 9, 2015","true","11.2"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","45","51","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/recommended/227000/","zeroxxx","zeroxxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/","2762 products in account","Primordia, a point and click adventure game that has quite good story with challenging puzzles. More or less like The Cat Lady... the good and the bad. To sum it up:\n\nPros:\n- Great/Mature story\n- Multiple endings\n- Challenging puzzles... to the point I required help from walkthrough *ahem*\n- Funny dialogues\n- Great voice actors\n- Decent price point\n\nBad:\n- Weak graphic engine, seriously. I even had a Developer helped me to get the game up and running.\n- Art isn't up to my standard.\n- A bit short game (approx 5 hours), but for 2.5 USD when discounted/on sale (or bundled), well... I guess  can't be helped.\n\nThe gameplay is just another point and click adventure. You pick up one object, deliver it to one character, get another item to unlock another area... rinse and repeat. You also are required to pay attention to hints collected. Not so much new invention in this aspect.\n\nStory, well, I can't say much without spoiling anything, but the story is interesting enough. In fact, I wouldn't have completed the game had the story been bad. It's like, again, The Cat Lady - light story in the beginning and developing slowly until the finale.\n\nSoundtrack is so-so, not that good but not that bad. Voice actors, however, are top notch. They really portray the characters well. Oh yes, don't forget about hilarious exchanges between Horatio and Chrispin throughout the game. More often than not I laughed on many occasions thanks to that funny Chrispin.\n\nOverall, Wormwood Studios, I think, have a success creating a good game for us all. Moreover, they are willing to interact and listen to their playerbase as well: see  here. I wish them luck with their future projects, too bad it won't be Primordia 2 (as has been said by the Developer himself).\n\nRecommended game.","July 31, 2014","true","55.4"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","44","53","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeytommo/recommended/227000/","monkeytommo","Monkey Tommo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeytommo/","764 products in account","Primordia is a game set in a world where ‘Man’ has mysteriously disappeared from the world. Man, also known as ‘The perfect machine’ were the builders from which sentient robots sprang into ‘life’. You play Horatio, a humanoid robot searching for his power core which was stolen by a ‘big robot with claws that shoots lasers’. You have a companion along the way, Crispin. He’s a cocky little robot, full of witty banter and useful advice (although, that advice can be hard to coax out of the little guy at times).\n\nBut I digress, back to the story. All I can say is, ‘Wow’. Ok, so it starts a little slow, but once you start learning about you character and his past the game really opens up. Playing as ‘Horatio Nullbuilt V.5’, your character has four versions of prior history of which the data has become fragmented and corrupted. You’ll meet robots along the way that seem to know you, but you haven’t much recollection of them! On top of the world that you are set exploring, this story mechanic really draws you in and makes you hungry for more. I remember thinking that if this game was a book, I’d read the hell out of it! It’d be one of those books that you can’t put down despite having to work early the next day! And in truth, I couldn’t put this game down. Thanks Wormwood Studios, my daughter finally gets to sleep, and instead of capitalising on this moment of rest that I could be having, I decide to turn on my PC and play a little more Primordia!\n\nThe music and sounds effects really help to bring this game to life. The background music can be haunting at times, and other times it can be so subtle to lift the mood of a scene that you hardly notice it has changed. The voices of the many robots that populate the world have a slight tinny, and sometimes electronic sound to them, each different from the last. Being how it’s set in a world of robots, Wormwood Studios could have simply hired the same vocal artist and applied filters to his/her voice, but they haven’t gone this route thankfully. Every robot you meet oozes personality, and the voice acting is top notch, adding real character and a human touch to these robots that were, at least in the past, touched by humanity.\n\nDespite all the things that make Primordia such a wonderful game, there are a couple of things that bugged me whilst playing through it. The first thing is the heads up display, or HUD for short. The HUD is located at the top of the screen, and when you drag your mouse up to the top it will pop down, allowing access to the various menu’s and inventory. Sometimes it can get in the way though, as it’s not located at the upper most pixel, and sometimes when you are on the lookout for that next pick-up, or you want to exit to another area, the HUD can slide down, thus breaking the immersion ever so slightly. It’s not a deal breaker by any means, but it can be a slight annoyance at times.\n\nThe second thing that got to me the whole time was the graphics. Don’t get me wrong here, I absolutely adore the art style. This game looks great, my problem is that it could have looked amazing. This game isn’t HD, you can set the resolution higher, but you then have to apply a filter to smooth out the jaggies as the game wasn’t designed to run at high resolutions! This results in the image being a little washed out when you play full screen. This wouldn’t be as noticeable on a smaller monitor, but on my 22” screen it was a slight issue.\n\nGripes aside, Primordia is a polished and lively world with a great story that compels you to finish the game. Clocking in at around 4-5 hours, it’s a journey so full of history and lore that you can’t help but be fascinated by it, the world they have created is really captivating. The central character and his companion guide you through this gritty world, and even though Crispin can be a little on the sarcastic side, you become attached to all you companions, and enemies.","November 26, 2013","true","2.3"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emberwake/recommended/227000/","emberwake","Emberwake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emberwake/","305 products in account","Primordia is a classic point and click adventure game, with gameplay reminiscent of Zork, King's Quest, or Monkey Island. You will gather, combine, and use items found throughout the world to solve problems, and you will be asked to solve the occasional riddle.\n\nYou take on the role of Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot who lives in the wasteland, salvaging parts to repair a derelict flying ship. The game begins when a strange robot cuts his way into the side of your ship, shoots you, and steals your vital power core. Without a power source to recharge your body you will surely die, so you and your companion (a floating, armless sidekick named Crispin Horatiobuilt) set out to recover your core, or at least to find a suitable replacement.\n\nThe game is divided into two major parts: first, you wander the wasteland searching for a power core, then eventually you leave the wasteland for a second location. Once you transition to the second area, you will no longer be able to access the wasteland portion of the game. Along the way, you will meet many strange robots, unravel mysteries about your world and your own past, and uncover a sinister plot.\n\nStorytelling is Primordia's greatest strength. Once the narrative picks up (beginning about halfway through the wasteland section), the story really engages the player. The cast of characters (most of which are found in the game's second area) are surprisingly well realized. Each has a distinct personality and a clear motivation. Your relationships with each of them feel genuine, and even your enemies feel well rounded.\n\nThe game's setting and art style combine with the well realized characters to create a compelling sense of place. Despite the low resolution environments and sprites, Primordia's world feels bigger than the screen it plays out on. Stellar voice acting and a droning ambient soundtrack put the finishing touches on a beautifully desolate world.\n\nFor all its strengths, though, Primordia's downfall is the gameplay. In the 80s and early 90s, point and click adventures were among the best represented genres in PC gaming. Since the rise of 3D graphics and the emergence of new styles of adventure game, they have retreated to the niche and indie markets. My memories of those old adventure games are pleasant, and it takes a game like Primordia to clear the fogged lenses of time. Simply put, even the best made adventure games tend to have puzzles whose solution only seemed apparent to the designer. And Primordia is far from the best made adventure game.\n\nThe first issue is that puzzles in Primordia often have nonsensical solutions, or worse, do not permit you to use the most obvious solution. One puzzle early on asked me to plug a pair of ventilation ducts. The first I plugged easily with a piece of scrap cut from a nearby structure, but despite there being three more identical pieces of scrap to cut from, the game would not permit me to do so, and instead demanded I locate an unrelated item that did not seem to fit (according to the visual representations in the game). And these logical disconnects are such frequent occurrances, you will soon find yourself simply trying to use every item in your inventory on each puzzle in the hope that a solution will present itself.\n\nThe second issue is the way the game arbitrarily cuts you off from certain areas, objectives, and even major plot threads. It is even possible to lock yourself out of "winning" the game (you can still complete the game and achieve one of the "bad" endings) through a blindly made choice in the first 30 minutes of play.\n\nLastly (and this is a small complaint), the inclusion of achievements seems to undermine the freedom built into the game's choices. When there are three ways to resolve a puzzle, but one awards an achievement, there is a real sense that there is a "right way" to play, stifling any sense of freedom the system might have otherwise provided.\n\nThese serious and frankly unforgivable design flaws sour what might have been an excellent game. Die hard point and click adventure fans will probably push right through, but if you are an average modern gamer with fond memories of classic adventure games, prepare to be reminded of all the bad mechanics that made those games such a frustrating experience.","October 4, 2015","false","8.5"," 106 of 165 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","106","165","5","22"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DazeOfWar/recommended/227000/","DazeOfWar","Daze The Bear Chieftain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DazeOfWar/","4588 products in account","A fun point & click adventure developed by Wormwood Studios. This is their only commercial release to date but they did do two games for Indie Speed Run 2013 called Like a Raisin in the Sun and Salt. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where all the humans are gone and you play a robot named Horatio Nullbuilt.  You have a broken down ship that you live in and another robot breaks in shoots you and steals your power core. Now you are on a mission to get it back.\n\nGameplay:\nIt plays just like a typical point & click adventure game. Finding objects to use and figure out puzzles to progress further in the game. Puzzles were a little challenging for me but were fun to figure out. They require some logic and can have multiple ways to figure them out. Choices you make in the game can change things later in the game. If you’ve played other adventure games then you’ll have no trouble playing this.\n\nStory:\nIt kept me interested and curious to dig deeper. It all starts out over a power core but there’s a deeper secret you can uncover if you make the right choices in the game. Great supporting cast which brought some comedy to the game. I really enjoyed the banter from Crispin your little sidekick throughout the game. There’s also seven different endings to the story if you care to see them all.\n\nVisuals & Sound:\nIt has retro style graphics with some great looking hand drawn rooms. They did a great job of showing you a dark and grim world. An easy to use interface, and great voice acting. You can also change it to text only if you are one who just wants to read it all.\n\nOverall:\nPrimordia was a fun and enjoyable game. The story was a little slow in the beginning but picks up a little ways in. I laughed at times and even felt a little sad at times. It’s well worth playing if you enjoy point & click adventure games or a good story and it won’t take you to long to beat.","April 13, 2015","true","23.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

During the first 20 minutes I was pushing myself to continue based only on the positive reputation of the title. I’m glad I stuck with it, because when it gets going it’s an admirable game. The world and the story has as much rigorous thought and attention put to it as you could ever demand of a title.\n\nMy only problem with the game (apart from the slow start) is the puzzles. I don’t mind slow paced games, or solving puzzles. But there’s something with the point-and-click form that makes me lose patience faster than 3d puzzle games like Portal or Antichamber. There’s always walkthroughs to help out players like me, but I don’t like going that route. There’s puzzles in Primordia where I have no idea how I would have ever solved them, like in my entire life, without looking up the solution. I want to see what happens next in the story, that’s my primary interest in these titles. But the designers thought otherwise, and because they thought this was a good idea, I’m not going to think ill of anyone who likes the puzzles. It’s just not for me. And I guess it’s “not really a problem” because faqs exist. But I wish there was something else that could be done with this type of game. Of all the point-and-click games I’ve played there’s only a couple where I haven’t hit a wall because of pixel hunting. Those moments always make me wonder what the point is.\n\nDespite that rambling second paragraph I would absolutely recommend Primordia to anyone who likes the look of it. It’s superb sci-fi, of the kind that’s not just rare in games, but rare anywhere. It treats its characters and the world with intelligence and respect. What made the first 20 minutes a bit dull was that I couldn't tell how ambitious it was going to be with the setting. I mean I've seen a ton of stories start out like this with lonely scavengers in the desert. But when it started dropping hints about what the game would really be about it made me increasingly excited. It takes a serious stab at exploring what life as a machine in a world run by machines would be like. What their religions and laws could be. Echoes of their human ancestors, now adapted for their style of thinking. And it does this without any attempt at dumbing it down for a wide audience. A gutsy thing to do, and it works.","June 23, 2015","true","4.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I liked it, but there came a time when i said enough was enough. I gave up on the game not because it's broken, no because the stories bad, and not because it's a bad game. I stopped because i couldn't stand some design choices made by the developer. If you don't have a problem with some of the issues i have with this game, then it might be a better game then i let on.\n\nThis game is good, the stories a bit so-so (i am not a sci-fi fan, so this may not be the case for you), but there is a depth to the world that makes exploration satisfying. For an adventure game (and a sci-fi), it's not bad. Adventure games are usually sold based on their stroy, or their atmosphere and world; this one falls squarely with the interesting world brand of adventure games. It takes a serious stance to its story, so if you wanted another monkey island-ish adventure game, keep looking. The visuals are solid, and what humor there is (mainly in the form of referenceses, such as the crowbar) isn't very satisfying, but it's harmless.\n\nWhere the game lost me is its choice on puzzle design. There comes a time when you have to do some tasks, like convince 2 robots to stop arguing. The problem i have with it is they don't give you the information for long, so you either have to write it down or memorize it. Only after writing it down can you try to solve the riddle. It's a bit backwards, where you have to work around outdated, missing, or omited mechanics to get to the puzzle before you've even had a chance to ponder it. There is a device that records important pieces of information, but what it deems as important can be hit or miss sometimes (such as the robot diologue riddles, where the riddles aren't written down).\n\nThe game also does a very poor job of giving hints if your stuck. This problem, and a few others, are indicitive of the genre. One such problem is having puzzles where you have to guess at what the developer wanted you to use to progress. An example would be ruining soup in some adventure game, where you have mud, shoe polish, and a rat. Only one will ruin the soup, despite all of them being viable in a realist sense.\n\nIn the end, this is an adventure game, so replayability is already low. I'd rather not waste my time reruning the same diologue trees over and over, which is what i found i had to do for the robot riddle puzzles. If I couldn't write fast enough (cus memorizing the jargen and name drops was not easy), i would have to guess and restart. There are i believe 5 riddles or so, so having to restart from the 4th on can be annoying to say the least. At this point, the game felt more like work then fun, so i gave up on it. I didn't want to put in that much effort for what i felt was not enough in return.\n\nYou are expected to bring a lot to the table to get through the game. Good memory, write stuff down, and replay the same section over if you experiment. You will find that trying to force your way through diologue puzzles is very time consuming. If you get stuck and fall back on this, you might feel inticed to cheat (as i was). When i feel like i have to resort to a walkthrough to make progress, the game begins to feels like a chore. It's not fun when you have to use a walkthrough for an adventure game, because relying on it really takes you out of the world. Personally, i call it quits at that point, as i did here\n\nTo reiterate, this is not a bad game. It's a game with a vision that i fell outside of. If you played a lot of old-school adventure games, or you're a sci-fi fan, you might find a lot to like. If you find you didn't like older adventure games (or Daedelic's brand of adventure games, like The Dark Eye or Memoria), or you gravitate towards newer games like the Telltale brand of adventure games, this game may not be to you're liking.\n\nIf an old-school sci-fi adventure game with some of the problems of older games, as well a bit unforgiving approach to game design (in that you will solve problems for yourself, without more help then the developer deems nessassary) sound good to you, then this might be a game you will enjoy.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf anyone should wonder why the developer of the game commented on this review (i was very suprised about it, personally), it's because he questioned some of my reasons for quiting, as well as questioning why i would post a review of a game i played so little of. After being initially ♥♥♥♥♥♥, i thought a lot about the review and realized how many assuptions i had taken as fact. I heavily edited the review after i thought about it, namely because the initial review didn't convey what i wanted it to; this game was not for me, for the reasons listed above, but it might be the game for you depending on your tastes.\n\nThe developer didn't harrass me (though initially i thought he had), and i am changing this review because i feel like it. Mark was a decent guy, and he responded more calmly and professionally then i thought he would. I made the changes i did because i was initially wrong, the developer earned my respect, and i had gone back over the review and found it unsatisfactory. If you think this makes my review less reliable, then so be it. You have been informed.","July 28, 2014","false","2.8"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","33","50","0","3"

Primordia has all the charm, class and witt of old point-and-click games and none of their problems and is a delightful story in a game that doesn't hold your hand. All in all, a short point-and-click adventure game with puzzle elements and some philosophical nods.\n\nHighlights\n* Some very cool little puzzles add a little bit of depth and side objective. One puzzle, for example, has you exploring an encyclopaedia style database of information via an information kiosk to try and unlock information pertaining to the current objective, and is a nice side-step distraction\n* Incredibly good game design, nothing is over or under designed and it takes all the good elements of old point-and-click games and none of the problems\n* Fantastic sound assets, voice acting and soundtrack\n\nMistakes\nFinding mistakes and problems with this game is difficult, though there are some minor and non specific design mistakes.\n\n* It can be finicky trying to find solutions to progress at times which can impact the pace of the story\n* The graphics are arguably too low-res or dark. For me, that adds to the appeal\n\nRecommendations\nPrimordia is listed at £6.99/9,99€/$9.99 which is fair for it's 6 hour+ story. There's also a short demo available for free[www.wormwoodstudios.com].\n\nGOG offers a copy of the soundtrack, a MAC version and some other small extras at a cheaper price and may be a better choice for some.\n\n* There are a number of interesting cutscenes and small story elements to discover, most of which are married with Achievements\n* Everyone who enjoys Primordia should take a few minutes to check out Wormwood Studios' other IP which includes 3 games; Like a Raisin in the Sun, Salt and Beacon, and a number of short stories, all of which are available for free from Wormwood Studios, hosted on The Escapist[www.wormwoodstudios.com].\n* Primordia has several possible endings\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/227000","May 28, 2015","true","13.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Instead the solutions are more like: search the house, find a mousetrap, ignore the mouse hole, find a ball inside of your neighbors vacuum cleaner and use the mousetrap to shoot the ball into the room for the cat to get up and chase.\n\nVery rewarding though!","April 27, 2014","true","14.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Besides being REALLY challenging and seemingly have multiple ways to solve a puzzle, it's story makes it an adventure, that is a joy to follow. The best part about it is the voice-acting and dialouge. The game is so well-written and so well told that when I started playing it, the only interruption that I allowed myself, was sleep.\n\nThe game is an exciting tale about two robots and their powercore. I would recommend it to everyone who likes point-n-click games (and even if you don't, this game might be a refreshing change of pace). It took me 10 hours to complete it, and I do not regret it!\n\nEDIT: After having played other PnC games, I returned to this a second time. It is now my definite favorite adventure game.

So, I spent an approximate total of three dollars on this game. Knowing what I know now I would buy this game at full price. Now, I know it looks like an older game, I envision this being playable on an older system, such as the original Playstation, but the graphics are a part of the feel, part of that grainy worn out look and environment. The story back drop is extremely enticing and will make you want to do some playable digging to find out more about the story and the characters. The puzzles are not as easy as they look and decision making trees offer differing outcomes to the story. As an added plus you get to know and love these characters and in some small way emotionally invest in them within a relatively short time. You’ll laugh at their jokes, good and bad, and you’ll care whether or not they succeed in their endeavors. Overall Primordia offers a very, very good post apocalyptic science fiction experience in a point/click format.

Feels like a spiritual successor of sorts to Beneath A Steel Sky, something I'm surprised more people didn't pick up on. Visually it all works and the music pleasantly chugs along - Along with some humour from Horatio and Crispin.\n\nHere's the problem though; Just as the game allows you to get more comfortable and eager to explore the story more, it stops becoming fun. The middle section of the game has some painful 'swap this for that' puzzle sequences that become a chore, and you are only driven to continue because of the story, and trust me, you will be looking at a walkthrough at some point, some of the puzzles are too obtuse.\n\nIt also ends far too soon - overall only having 2 main environments in the whole game is not that satisfying at all, and what could have been quite atmospheric starts to feel a little brownwashed. The character development was never built up long enough for me to feel any emotional connections with the characters, and there were some uninspired and cliched plot turns. Beneath A Steel Sky never varied too much in environment either but at least it stayed enjoyable right to the end. There are multiple paths in the game to take which will lead to different endings - but it really depends on whether you enjoyed the first run to want to do this, and I'm not entirely sure if I want to play this game again for a while. Shame there's no windowed mode either, can appreciate the Lucasarts style resolution/graphics decision but couldn't easily leave the window or tweak anything.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad game, trust me, it isn't - I would just suggest you wait for it to go on sale, as there's a chance you could be disappointed like I was.","July 21, 2014","false","7.0"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","3"

I really did, which is a rare occasion for me in this genre.\n\nI'm the kind of person who usually buys huge batches of cheap new indies and revamps of old adventure games, starts point-and-clickers excited but leaves them even before half-way, bored of the theme, disillusioned by the lack of immersion, redundant puzzles and all. Somehow it all gets diluted into a non-engaging mess. But this was not the case with Primordia; I played it through twice, once genuinely without any help, and then second time with a walkthrough / achievement guide to see what I had missed.\n\nI loved the dystopian atmosphere. The writing was excellent, as well as the characters. The graphics were surprisingly fitting - somehow the artists filled just the right amount of atmospheric detail in "cinematics", and the gameplay was fluent enough. Puzzles did involve every once in a while some actual thinking and not just random inventory combo-womboing, and once I even took pen and paper to solve a key puzzle. I must commend that the narration for Horatio, Crispin, as well some other key characters (without spoilers) were excellently done, which played a huge part on why the game was so immersive for me.\n\nOn the down-side, some of the puzzles were kinda redundant pixel searching, as one might expect. Luckily the hint system was just on the correct level for a guy like me, who doesn't like hunting for pixels for eternities, and might dismiss an "obvious" clue every here and then. I never felt stuck, and I always had a sense of progression in my first playthrough. Without spoiling too much, there isn't that much of difference in the endings or how your choices end up as consequences, but second playthrough (with a walkthrough) did reveal more of the lore and modest alternatives that I had missed. I must also admit that dystopia/sci-fi as a genre is probably my favorite (1984, Brave New World, Neuromancer, you name it), so I am biased to liking this game.\n\nOverall, I can highly recommend this excellent adventure-novel to anybody that can overcome the barrier of point-and-click, and instead enjoy a ride of well fitting retro graphics, excellent narrative, good writing, and a neatly packaged ~4-6h adventure in a single playthrough - all for a very modest price. I'll fly one day, and Crispin will be laughing at me.","February 12","true","7.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Their games have felt the most like the Sierra and Lucasarts adventures I grew up on - strong puzzles, interesting characters, and a goofy sense of humor.  Primordia is shorter than I expected, but it has a surprisingly deep and engrossing story - and I love the art style.  The puzzles are actually pretty tough, but if you pay attention to the dialogue there are always hints.  So, be prepared to try every dialogue option and every combination of inventory items, and keep a pen and paper handy.  Also, save often.  There are multiple ways to solve puzzles and some of those lock you out of endings/achievements.  I have a habit of reading walkthroughs for areas after I have completed them because I like to make sure I got everything.

So I gave it a try, and was blown away by how much I absolutely enjoyed it. It's your standard point-and-click; you collect items, open your inventory, and can combine items or use them on characters or objects in the world to progress. So there's little to mess up when it comes to controls, and Primordia succeeds there.\nThe game is set some ambiguous number of years in the future. The world is inhabited by robots, no sign of organic life anywhere. You play as Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot designed to build and repair. While aboard your ship, the Uniic, you are attacked by a strange robot and stripped of your ship's power core. Left without transportation and limited power keeping you running, you are left with no other option but to wander out into the world, trying to track down a power source, or as a last resort, enter the city of Metropol, "the city of glass and light." Not much is known about Metropol, other than there is supposedly unlimited power for everyone. Still, Horatio has his reserves about entering the city; despite his logic-driven robot nature, he doesn't trust the place.\nAs I mentioned, the art style was much of what first intrigued me, and it's prevalent throughout the game. It's designed to look very old-school and pixelated, but the amount of detail that can be projected by so few pixels is astounding, not to mention the general apocalyptic dystopian feel it gives off, which as a fan of Fallout, I enjoyed all too much.\nOverall this was one of those games that gave me that feel of reading a really good book; I'd sit down and play and not want to put it down until I found out what happened next. The only problems I had were a few vague or confusing puzzles, in which I had to resort to the old "try everything with everything on everything" play method common to point-and-click games. Aside from that, the game offers multiple endings, some far more underwhelming than others, which left me feeling a tad unsatisfied. Still, the game was extremely enjoyable, and one of the few games that I'd almost like to forget playing so I could enjoy it all over again.","September 13, 2013","true","5.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

First I still think the warning applies: it should be made clearer that it runs 640x400.** That's not a full screen size image in the video**. However I found it best to turn on x4 anti-aliasing, this is the best option.\n\nThis is a great story, nice main character and side kick, good voice acting, setting is interesting. I only got stuck a couple of times, and you know when you do in these games it's because you've missed something obvious or not so obvious on the screen. I'm not a fan of searching the screen for a clue and there is'nt  too much of that, but if you get stuck chances are it's that. The memorious puzzle was in fact a bit oblique to me, like I'd forgotten something in a trunk.\n\nI'd also say this is the type of game where even though the in game data collection works fine you will need a pen and paper for a couple of the code and logic puzzles but that's it. Mostly because getting it wrong the first time locks you out of achieving some of the achievements, though this does give you incentive to play again.\n\nIt has multiple endings so there's some replayability to it at the end.\nI'd compare the setting to Machinarium, but story style wise and feel more Beneth a steel sky. I happen to think those are two top games.\n\nTo dev: I dont think a sequel would be possible *right now* but maybe a prequel  would fit really well here. Do a Star Wars and make a trilogy and jump around the timeline.\nHaving read the Fallen pdf it did give me much more of a sense of story, I can see how things would be missing with out it. I'd put a link on the store page for download if it's not already there. Add the setting to right click change settings to the library entry.\n\nTop Rating\n\n=== old review\nI bought a bunch of point and clicks at the same time, and when I got this I really didnt realise it ran this size. It's too fiddly and post stamp size. I'm aware I can scale it up x4 but then it becomes quite hard to discern things in the picture, which is annoying.\nI don't have a problem with pixel art, and in some cases that's easier for finding things on screen rather than a high res style, but the art style here makes it too difficult to recognise things. I played through Techno Babylon no problem, which is at a larger resolution but something about that game has cleaner lines where as Primordia has a lot of detail. I'd compare this more to Machinarium style but pixelated.\nThis could really benefit the clarity it has at 640x400 at a larger frame. I know that won't be possible without remaking it, but that might actually be worth doing...\nAt the moment im in two minds about it and getting a refund.\nWhich is a pity because im pretty sure it is good.\nDepends if you can live with that size. edit: use 4x anti-aliasing, it goes a bit dream like looking but it's certainly better. cheers\n===","December 22, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

Despite the 'outdated' graphical appearance, the art was top-notch, as was the overall feel and atmosphere. But what really seperates fantastic point & click games from the mediocre ones, is the writing and the quality of the dialogue and plot in Primordia is absolutely stunning. Characters were also very likeable, in part due to the great voice acting.\n\nPlanescape: Torment is a major inspiration here; the initial hook of the story, Crispin/Morte, emphasis on the past, it's all here. Much like Torment, Primordia is filled with sad moments, funny moments, philosophical themes and one hell of a cathartic ending (at least the one I got).\nPuzzles were decent and quite logical, although at times the game had too many red herrings going on, which made some puzzles a bit difficult for me. Still, only in one puzzle I had to go to a walkthrough and check it out.\n\nAll in all, a very solid old school adventure game with insanely good story, one that I am unlikely to ever forget.","December 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

There are few negative things to say so I'll start there.\n\nCONSStarting with the only downsides I can think of, it was bothersome finding the right settings so the game would scale perfectly and look sharp on an HD display, but it worked fine once that was taken care of.\nGameplay is somewhat akin to classic point and click with character displacement handled like any old 2D RPG, but it sometimes isn't clear which items are to be interacted with, or even whether it is possible. This was sometimes annoying but can be considered inherent to the game genre.\nIt's too short. Don't get me wrong, the length of the game is appropriate but the mood and story are so enticing by the end you'll definitely be left wanting more.\n\nPROSThe art. I'll come out with a bit of an unpopular opinion by saying gameplay is not a good reason to buy this game. Its geatest asset is without a question the art. Not only is the style 100% distinctive from anything I've seen before, the devs actually pulled it off perfectly. While it resembles moody postapocalyptic or cyberpunk art commonly seen in high-res online, the low pixel count makes it particularly impressive. Combining intricate convoluted shapes with pixel-art is just something I didn't think was possible until playing Primordia. The dark and brown color tones used and occasional neon accents really set the atmosphere as a surrealist cyberpunk universe. I can't stress enough there is nothing else like this.\nOn top of the visual aspects, the soundtrack is just great. Maybe I wouldn't listen to the ambient sounds on their own but they really do a great job of accenting both the story and environment.\nLast comes the story. Oh boy. Not only was I surprised at every turn by a creative plot, but the character development is the cherry on the cake. Whoever wrote the story really knows how to blend humor, mystery, and tragedy in a story that never left me bored (except when I got stuck desperately looking for some object to interact with).\n\nI won't oversimplify by rating this game with a number, but I'll say this:\nSince I was about eight years old not a single day has gone by without me reading a novel. I have watched thousands of movies, played literally hudreds of games, and amidst all the classics, the worldwide hits, the big budget productions, all the various forms of entertainment, this comes out easily as one of the favorite stories of my lifetime. If you can sit through a few tedious puzzles and don't mind spending half an hour looking for items in a pile of trash, then I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Hell, even if you hate the gameplay it's affordable enough that you can buy it just to appreciate the art and ambience.","April 11","true","25.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

For anyone interested in order to get the game to run I simply had to alter the properties on Primordia.exe - under the compatibility tab tick the boxes 'reduced colour mode' (16bit), 'run in 640x480' and 'run as administrator'.  After doing that the game runs fine.\n\nSo the game itself\n\nAn old school style point and click adventure with some very interesting charcters, settings and concepts.  The dialogue is quite well written even if the jokes do on occasion fall a bit flat. Very much enjoyed my time exploring this little world and trying to figure out the puzzles.\n\nIts only downfall in my opinion is that it seemed rather short - given the setting and the plot setup I was expecting more content but what is here is still very good.\n\n8/10 - best of the genre I have played in a long time","April 15","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The characterization of the entire cast though, hinges on the environment they are thrust in.

The graphics are pixellated, but not in the sense often used by amateur indie designers as an obvious cost-cutting measure. This is pixel art at its finest: lovingly crafted details in every background and most characters show that the game's artist took their work extremely seriously. That effort paid off in spades.\n\nThe second thing you will probably notice about Primordia is that almost everything about it is bleak. This is not the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout, where things have gone to hell but black comedy keeps things from getting too dark. There is humor in the game, but it works in spite of the world being broken, not because of it. Humanity is extinct, its robotic creations and their creations in turn forming what qualifies for society in Primordia's shattered world. Energy is life, and power is running out.\n\n\nThe third thing you will notice is that often the game works in a far more logical way than others in its genre might lead you to expect. Early on you see a lantern on a high shelf your character cannot reach. The solution? Ask your hovering robot sidekick to push it down. There are a lot of moments like that in Primordia, where logic prevails over the typical adventure game "must be as drunk as the original designer to comprehend" school of puzzles.\n\n\nThat said, there are still moments where you may not figure out on your own. I had to look things up at least a couple times in my playthrough to advance. Not everyone will, and I would discourage players from reading up except as a last resort. The puzzles make up a huge chunk of the game. If they are not your thing, I would say the game is still worth playing with a guide for the atmosphere alone.","November 30, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That kept me trucking through more than anything else. The humor in particular is well done, and perfectly timed. I actually thought the art and graphical design was interesting, and didn't mind the "crudeness" of the animation, etc. If anything I felt like it added to the atmosphere and feel. The puzzles are well thought out, but can get maddeningly difficult if you forget to scribble down key information that isn't recorded by your logger at some points. I also enjoyed all the hidden homages tossed in that aren't thrown in your face. The ending seemed to come too quickly, but I was only disappointed that there wasn't more to do.\n\nI only wish that it was easier to adjust the scaling other than having to edit a file. Before doing that, it's often difficult to spot clues and changes in the environment. The music can get a bit repetitive as well.\n\nOther than that, this is a developer to keep an eye on if you're into this genre.","December 13, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hard to get through at times due to the fact that it is very challenging. If you’re looking for something that looks pretty and “next-gen” look elsewhere. Personally I adore the art style but others may not appreciate the graphics as much. The story is fast paced if not held back by trying to figure things out. I used a walkthrough and found it could be played through in 4 hours. A complete sci-fi romp, it will remind you of Darkseed, I Have No Mouth, and other point and click adventures of the good old days. The voice acting was sharp and the music was amazingly well done.

The graphics and music create an eerie setting. Upon entering the city of Metropol, I immediately felt a disease with everything around me. Every step taken is a direct threat to the big bad, for the mere fact you aren't obeying her every word from the get-go. The knowledge that the bad guy is watching your every move and is intelligent enough to start planning hundreds of steps ahead makes me shiver.\n\nThe puzzles are what you'd expect in a robot apocolypse: very technological, a strict sense of rules behind each one. All give off an extra feeling that speaks to me as "yep. Puzzles caused by robots alright."\n\nBy the end though, I didn't feel particularly emotionally affected. Which was weird because I did feel for the characters. I gasped at plot twists, I shivered at the Big Bad, and my heart felt like it was stepped on when spoiler stuff happened. But I suppose it was just brief moments of emotions rather than a lasting impact. Maybe apocolypse stuff isn't my thing. Maybe it was that the darkness of the plot sort of negated any victory. I won but it didn't feel like a win. Maybe that was the point.\n\nWhatever, I'm rambling. TL:DR: its a good game. Really. If you play point-and-clicks or apocolypse games are your thing, check it out.","December 3, 2014","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reyan62/recommended/227000/","reyan62","Reyan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reyan62/","247 products in account","This game has an excellent story and a unique and interesting setting filled with charmingly colorful characters.  It is thoughtful and meaningful, and addresses some serious theological and philosophical points, while remaining mysterious and exciting (most of the time).  However, I found the gameplay to be very lacking, in a number of ways.  I'm now going to complain about all the things I need to complain about, but do please recall that I actually enjoyed this game :)\n\nThe puzzles in this game were difficult, and not in a good way.  While many of them had "cool" solutions - which would be awesome in a movie, for example - they were often not cleanly solvable, in the sense that they were the only plausible solution and made everything "make sense" when you figured it out.  For me, a lot of the reason I want to play a puzzle game is for that awesome feeling of everything coming together when I figure it out.  This is not the sort of game that does that for me.  Here's a few of the problems that I saw:\n\n1. Trying to create a clever solution rather than a good puzzle.  The solutions to puzzles are often the sort of zany solutions that are fun to watch heroes think of in movies, but not reasonable to force the player to think of.  In other words, they don't feel like THE solution, just A solution (and yet in the confines of the game, they are THE solution).\n2. Tooooo many items.  Unlike a lot of games, in Primordia you almost never get an item taken out of your inventory when you are done using it.  By the end of the game, I have so much stuff in my inventory that the task of getting through a locked door has dozens of reasonable-sounding solutions - crowbar, plasma torch, signal transmitter to pick the lock, etc, etc - but only one of them is right (and it's probably none of the standard things I've learned how to do throughout the game, because that would be to easy).\n3. Generic, reusable items.  This is one of my pet peeves in puzzle games.  When you have a generic item like a hammer, there's a trillion and five ways that the player can think of to use this item.  Even if the game designer could think of all of those, allowing those solutions would make many of their puzzles too easy.  Anyway, this game is full of generic items that you use again and again throughout the game (but are never allowed to use when you think of it).\n4. Confusing items.  I had a whole bunch of electronic gadgets and doodads that it took me a long time to figure out how they worked - a signal transmitter, a decryption device, a memory reader, etc.  All of these could be used only in very specific circumstances (i.e. as far as I can tell, the memory reader can only be used to access memories from a severed robot head - which you encounter in this game a lot more than you would think!), but this information is never explicitly told to you (I never really figured out what the rules for the decryption device were).\n5. Just too much going on at once.  The game is basically divided into two parts.  During each part, you slowly unlock more areas, and then can travel freely between all areas that you have unlocked during that part, which by the end of each part results in a huge environment in which to look for a small number of remains tasks.\n\nThe end result of all of this was that I played the game with a walkthrough constantly ready.  And I do not regret it :)  Most of the things I had to get help on ("most" because I started getting lazy near the end), I think I would have felt frustrated rather than satisfied if I took the time to solve myself.\n\nThe interface is unfathomably archaic and unintuitive.  For example, the process of using an item - one of the most base necessities of a point and click game - requires (1) hovering near the top of the screen to open the tool bar, (2) selecting the inventory button to open your inventory, (3) selecting the item from the inventory, (4) clicking outside the inventory to close it, then finally (5) clicking on the thing in the world that you want to use the item on.  On all the interfaces mentioned, there are also many confusing and sometimes unnecessary/duplicate buttons.  The datachron (which automatically takes notes on things you have learned) has a horrific interface that looks something like an old school gameboy, with giant text on a tiny screen, and buttons (that you have to click with your mouse) for scolling up and down.  Similarly, the signal transmitter - on which you frequently need to set a 4-digit number to transmit - is pretty obnoxious, requiring you to click on the left and right sides of two dials (not even buttons that you can see, so it's hard to find the sweet spot to actually click on) - one to cycle through numbers, and one to cycle through DIGITS.  DIGITS.\n\nAll that being said, however, I think this game is definitely worth playing for the story alone, which like I said is fantastic.","September 10, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

We had a walkthrough since neither of us could understand English. Since then I have gone mostly to other genres but the adventuring spark were left in me somewhere. That’s why I have bought a great many point-and-click games but every time I play one the same thing happens: I click around for a while and get bored. They just don’t get a grip on me. That was until Primordia.\n\nThe player takes role of Horatio and his sidekick Crispin, who live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. What seems like a peaceful existence is interrupted when a robot crashes through their wall and steals a power core that is keeping the two alive. The game is a quest to find and get back the power core. The mood is melancholic and sad but is lighten up by Crispin’s surprisingly funny dialog. Every other character was also fascinating and had some personality to them.\n\nThis was the first ever adventure game that I completed without looking at a walkthrough. Most of the puzzles are logical in a sense that if you have an item that might fit it most likely does. Every solution made sense. The puzzles are quite varied: There are use-item-on-item puzzles but also drawing, memorization, code breaking and so on. I was surprised at how many different kind of obstacles the creators had thought out. It took 7 hours to complete the game, though length varies greatly depending on how fast you solve the puzzles. There appears to be different endings and outcomes since I only got half of the achievements on single playthrough.\n\nThe graphics in this are amazing. Everything is a post-apocalyptic bleak wasteland but the world that was destroyed has this art deco kind of style (think Bioshock) that is really nice. The game actually runs at the tiniest of resolutions but is stretched to full screen. Not a lot of pixels to work with but what has been achieved is wonderful. I’d love to see full resolution images of the art since it’s so great. This is also why the game probably runs on pretty much any potato as long as there is electricity. For some strange reason in one room, after certain thing happens, my fps dropped to single digits but it was solved after I got out of the room. You cannot die and there is no rush so it doesn’t matter. Even better than the visuals is the sound and music. I think the voice acting is great but, together with the art, it’s the music that shines the most.\n\nIf you have any interest in point-and-click Primordia is a must play, no doubt about that. For someone new to the genre it’s also a good place to start since it’s not as far-out weird with its puzzles as some games in the genre. I can only give a big recommend for this wonderful game!","January 6","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

Even though the characters in the game are robots they retain many human properties that makes them quite relatable. To add to this, their human traits are merged with some very interesting quirks based on what purposes they were coded for. This makes almost every character you meet really interesting and memorable, and also drives a lot humor in the game. In particular, the bond between the playable character Horatio and his creation and best friend Crispin is consistently entertaining thoughtout the whole game. It's not just the setting that's great though, the writing and story in general is fantastic, and the voice acting is amazing.\n\nThe gameplay draws really well from the setting too. Scavenging for spare parts and pieceing machines together might feel pretty familiar to anyone who has played an adventure game before, but because of the setting and design of the game all of this feels really organic and fluid. It helps that there are core items in the game aren't simply used once and then thrown away, but instead you are gathering an array of tools (Your friend Crispin being one of them!) that you will keep reusing throughout the whole game. There is still the odd puzzle that had solutions I wouldn't have thought of and got me turning to a guide, but I would put this down to my own impatience rather than design faults of the game. I never really took the time to think things out completely as I was too compelled to move forward with the story!\n\nLong story short, I would strongly recommend this game. The only negative thing I can think of is that I had a couple of very minor technical issues that were resolved easily. If you have any interest in point-and-click adventures or story-driven games in general I wouldn't hesitate to pick this one up.","March 11","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

In the far future, Man is no more and is worshiped as an ancient god that was the perfect machine that built the first robots (in the era called primodium). These manbuilt robots built more robots and they are now the only sentience that populates the post-apocalyptic world. The robots believe that Man will return once more to start a second primordium. Meanwhile, they go about "maintaining" the world and preach the gospel of man. Horatio Nullbuilt and his levitating companion Crispin Horatiobuilt are two such robots that live out in the dunes, far away from the robot city of Metropol. When a giant robot with lasers "takes" their power core, they are forced on an adventure that takes them to Metropol and uncovers everything from Horatio's past to the fate of the last humans.\n\nThe music sets the tone perfectly for this world. What struck me most was the intricacy with which this world was constructed: every little trinket of knowledge about this universe fits so seamlessly with every other tidbit. So, the writers did a fantastic job and obviously put a lot of thought into their work. The visuals, music and puzzles served to elevate that writing. If you love atmosphere and storytelling or if you loved the blackwell series or if you just enjoy wadjeteye games, this is a title that must be experienced.","April 11","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

To those who haven't, point and clicks are largely narrative-driven games based upon exploration and puzzles - and this game has all three in spades. Intriuging setting? Done. Tough, but (almost always) fair, puzzles? Done. A compelling narrative? Oh yeah. This game has all of two downsides - first, that clues are sprinkled into the dialogue, but there isn't a way to reexamine or replay it, so sometimes you're left guessing. Second, the game is short - but this is more of a nitpick than anything, because its actual length belies the completeness which the game concludes with. Ultimately, this is a great work by a talented team, and the only real reason you wouldn't like it is because you don't like point and click adventures.","July 28, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is enjoyable and I encountered zero bugs. The characters are well-developed and the occasional humor is pretty funny. Sounds awesome, right? Well, there's just one problem: I didn't have fun. As I played I felt more annoyed by the puzzles than I felt happy that I completed them. Because as soon as you fix a problem, PLOP new thing for you to fix! At first, Crispin's (your comedic companion) hints helped but when you get farther he seems to just tell you what you already know. The items you must obtain are typically in places that you wouldn't expect, and the hitboxes for them are typically small. This game just drives you to the point where you try to use every item on every object, even if it doesn't make sense, to see if that will work. I found myself sitting there trying to combine my crowbar with my memory pouch. What will that do? Nothing. But I HAD to try it because I've done everything else. And then it turns out all you had to do was something simple but there was no way you could have known about it. This game has so many amazing qualities; I wanted to like it so bad. But I just couldn't. It's just not fun. Overall, I just found this game more frustrating than satisfying. If you've got the ten bucks and you LOVE point and click puzzle adventures, go for it. You might like it. But for the average gamer, I cannot recommend this game.","June 16, 2014","false","9.7"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

What really draws you in is the unique story and interesting dialogue along with the sci-fi, post apocalyptic setting.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game, but there are definitely a few things that could have been improved. The game setup before you launch the game can only be accessed in the game folder and can't be launched in game or through steam. When the setup is run it's somewhat confusing and I always felt as if the graphics weren't set up right. Watching the trailer for the game confirms this when I see crisp, clean graphics on the store page and fuzzy, muddy graphics on mine and changing to higher settings just seemed to make it look worse. It seems though that that developers are continuing to make improvements, so maybe this can be fixed in the future.\n\nBalance in the game seemed a bit lacking as solving puzzles became an effort in frustration at times. Having your sidekick Crispin give you clues helped quite a bit, but even with his help some areas required random trial and error because you had no clue what to do. Without a little help from a guide I probably wouldn't have finished the game.\n\nMinor gripes aside though, I had a great time playing this game. With a quality soundtrack, voice acting and funny dialogue it was well worth it. Multiple endings helped keep it interesting a bit as well with radically different results to the storyline. Definitely a must play for point and click adventure fans.","December 4, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/explorermatt/recommended/227000/","explorermatt","Typhoone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/explorermatt/","248 products in account","I've been playing a lot of indie point-and-clicks lately; Primordia stands out because of its writing and setting. It has a LucasArts Loom vibe to it, with the protagonist Horation NullBuilt conjuring up an idea of what Bobin Threadbare would be if he was competent and decided to use his amnesia to his advantage. Yes, both characters have amnesia, have lost their home communities, and the fabric of society quite literally rests on their creations. Elements of the story definitely seem similar. The setting of Primordia is more exciting. It's a colorful combination of dystopia, cyberpunk, and steampunk. While that mix is becoming more and more common these days, finding 'good' games in that genre is still rare.\n\nI mentioned the writing: the story is captivating if only to explore the lore, and the main plot-arc is mediocre. The dialog writing is where the game shines; Horatio's sidekick levitating robot Crispin is a very well written NPC that integrates into the game nicely. The character is used to solve some puzzles, though not too much, and offers rather direct walkthrough-type tips if the protagonist is stuck.\n\nWith it's marvelous writing, I wanted Primordia to feature more NPCs and dialog quests. A particular stand-out quest involves a logic puzzle attempting to legally assign the surname of a pet robot. While the logic is difficult to follow without pen and paper handy, the writing and voice-acting attempts to seduce the player away from choosing the logical option and I was tempted to go down a logically-flawed path (which the game teased would result in different endings and impact late-game quests). Rarely does game-dialog inspire this anymore, and it is where indie games such as Primordia stand a cut above the rest.\n\nThe game has a relatively short playthrough and the puzzles become more difficult, sometimes to the level of ridiculousness, later in the game. This is caused by the game too early allowing me to use multiple items for different quests, and in the late game suffering through trying every permutation of item combination to solve the puzzles. Nonetheless, I would recommend this game to a casual or hardcore adventure gamer, as it is both enjoyable and tells a well-written, albeit cliche story.","June 11, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The biggest flaw is that the game occasionally has pixel-hunting puzzles, which are never good. Bad developers. Only time in the game I looked at guides was when I was missing something from pixel hunting (random LCD screen, bah, random floating junk, what even?)\nThe palette's also a bit dull overall; I get the point of having so much brown but it gets a little tiring to look at after a while, though the game's gorgeous looking otherwise.\nThat aside, only the postitives left. The two protagonist characters each have quite a bit of personality to them and play off each other well for plenty of amusing moments, though the game still keeps a fairly serious and dark tone throughout. The other various characters are all quite unique and memorable and serve the overall plot in interesting ways, usually having their own mini-arcs. The backstory and worldbuilding is also very rich, not outright saying a lot but leaving the pieces scattered for the player to put together.\nThe puzzles are also generally good. Plenty of the standard item-trading things but there's no moon logic present there. And there's straight up logic puzzles on occasion, too, which are probably the most fun. There's no need to memorize strings of numbers or information, either; the game auto-saves all relevant data in the main character's datapouch, as well as providing a map for quick travel. It's got a lot of old-school adventure game design with a more modern feel to it, making it both well-crafted and elegant in execution.\nThere's a lot to like here and little to dislike, I heavily recommend it to, well, pretty much anyone really, but especially point-and-click enthusiasts, because this is certainly top-tier in that regard.","October 2, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of all I recommend this game.\n\nPros:\n• Thought-provoking story full of moral ambiguities and juxtaposed viewpoints making you question your own judgments of the characters and their actions.\n• Good interface with a minimum of unnecessary clicking and waiting.\n• Varied endings dependant on choices made by the player.\n• Interesting scenery, good voice acting, and excellent atmosphereic soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n• Completely unnecessary gender references at various points.  It's a world full of robots... Why does there need to be a "female" robot with boob-curves, or gender binary relationship references between androgynous mechanoids?\n• Serious tone somewhat undermined by numerous 4th-wall jokes by  a main character.\n• Lots of back-tracking and occasionally preposterous leaps in logic were needed to solve puzzles.  Several times I found myself resorting to "randomly combine junk until something happens" or having to look up walkthroughs, and being utterly baffled how someone would arrive at that solution.\n\nAs stated above, I do highly recommend this game, and I enjoyed the story.

One of its features, missing from many other games of this genre, is a subtle hint mechanism to help when you are completely stuck. In the old days, this kind of "stuckness" was a death knell for a game that none of your friends had already beaten. Today, there's a different kind of problem, because you go all too easily to the internet to look up the answer. You do it begrudgingly, the first time, easier the second, and on the third time, you accidentally see how it ends.\n\nBut back to the game in specific: a nice balance of humor and seriousness. I dig the universe the story is set in, which brings some pretty serious gravity to the plot, but you have a zany sidekick who really does actually grow on you. The writers did a great job making you care about the characters... who are robots... Addtionally, in stark contrast to many of the "Press a button to select your ending" problems some games have presented us with recently, there are something like ten seperate endings which are... all pretty different.  All in all, bravo, very fun game.","April 19, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great story, great voice acting from all except Crispin IMO. It's a point and click game with old style graphics, but the original and futuresque story makes up for it. The mood is brought to life with the scenery and music. I enjoyed searching for answers and learning about the world. Primordia and To The Moon are games you can talk about, have a life discussion about once they are over as they deal with deeper and hypothetical life scenerious.  I appreciate games that cane bring more to the table than kill bad guy, game over.\n\nMy only complaints are some of the puzzles are really difficult to achieve without outside help (info kiosk words). I do not like using outside help, but one puzzle requires a typed guess, that's ridiculous.  The hardest achievement isn't impossible, but requires finding the right post in the forums (I just bumped it to the top recently for those struggling for 100%).  Even though there are multiple endings, they take place at the very end (obviously) so it's not like what you did earlier in the game  really mattered, unless you were trying to get the achievements.\n\nOverall 8/10, I would have given it a 9/10 if that one puzzle was really impossible to figure out.","April 11, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A few puzzles might be considered difficult, but most will keep you entertained without causing frustration. It took me about 8 hours to finish before going back to try different solutions to see the all the endings.

One of the central questions the player wants answered is what exactly happened to the humans who presumably once inhabited this Earth and created the robots left behind. Added to this is a tapestry of moral and philosopical themes such as the meaning and existence of free will, individuality, progress, and what constitutes the 'greater good'. These sometimes rather heavy themes are pulled off through excellent writing, and are offset by a quirky humour that runs through the whole game. This off-beat humour and occasional breaking of the fourth wall are reminiscent of some of my favourite, genuinely old-school games such as Simon the Sorcerer, and I think anyone who was playing this kind of thing in the early 90's will appreciate it. The worldbuilding and background detail is fantastic - my one gripe is that the game just doesn't go far enough. There are hints of exciting other locations that we don't get to visit, and the larger philosophical themes are never fully explored.\n\nAs this is a game and not just a visual novel, I should probably mention a bit about the gameplay - it's pretty much standard of point & click games, and uses the traditional inventory system. Nothing stood out as unique, but equally nothing was inconvenient or jarring. The puzzles are not particularly challenging, and there's plenty of hints on hand from Crispin if one chooses to press him for them (it's also pretty fun to hear him getting annoyed and snarky when you try and use him too many times). I prefer simpler puzzles so the flow of the story doesn't stall, but others might find this game too easy.\n\nIn terms of visuals, the pixel art is gorgeous, and the colour palette of browns, rusts and muted golds perfectly realizes the dusty, disued world. The audio content is also great, from the music to the voice acting. Even minor characters are voiced, and the robot voice effects are pretty cool.\n\nOverall an 9/10 for this game. The presentation is beautiful both visually and aurally, and beneath this is a solid story rooted in a world that feels like it really could be our future. Horatio and Crispin are likeable and memorable characters to journey through this tale with, and their easy banter creates the emotional anchor to this crumbling planet. Points are lost for the sense that the game could have been bigger both in terms of the number of locations, and the philosophical ideas that never seem to be explored quite as far as you hope. Regardless, 'Primordia' is highly recommended!","March 3, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only thing left is their own invention: machine. Machine that prospered and slowly became just like human, with their own ideas and vices. Even if they're limited by their programming, they could still interact with others like normal folk. Taking the reigns of Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin, what starts as a simple retrieval turns into a full blown adventure, albeit a somewhat short trip.\n\nGameplay: The game itself follows the point and click style of gameplay, so its hard to screw that part up. That said, it does a good enough job being difficult and leaving you wondering "what the hell do I do now?" Thankfully, Crispin has a built in hint-o-tron to give you tips on what you could do or should do if you're ever stumped. The puzzles themselves are, in my opinion, pretty darn easy. The only difficult ones would be where you meet your unfriendly thief again or when you need access to a certain place with a long string of code. Other than that, it's pretty straight forward. Then again, I play puzzles for kicks so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nThere are some puzzles with different methods of completion, usually a good and bad way. Sometimes the bad way is the only obvious way, where the good way will require a save here and there to help you out should you pull an oopsie. By the way, you'll probably be doing this often. Puzzles do have "soft-fail" states, which can be pretty infuriating, so save often! The actual game itself is, unfortunately, pretty damn short. You could probably finish the entire game within 5 hours or so (after knowing everything and everyone and all the choices). There is A TON of going back and forth. No joke, you'll probably find yourself going back and forth between robots, trying everything, for a good 10 minutes until something works. It can get annoying fast. There are also a few references sprinkled here and there to earn a few chuckles. Some more obvious than others.\n\nArt: Holy hell, this art style. While a mess of browns, it works so damn well together. Not to mention Horatio and Crispin always seem to stand out from the environment whenever possible, so that's also a plus. Unfortunately, the overwhelming abundance of browns makes finding some robots or items kinda difficult. Had to pull the hover method to find a few things sometimes. I understand its supposed to be post-apocalyptia, but sometimes you have to look away and rub your eyes.\n\nMusic: It's amazing. Done.\n\nActing: The VA in this game are beautiful and, at the same time, somewhat phoned in. Sometimes you can tell the lines are being read from the script. Other times you feel it from the heart. It is, overall, a very good experience to feel the voices actually try when they do. Funnily enough, it was the side characters that, in my opinion, had the best acting compared to our main characters.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves a good point and click adventure with a fan♥♥♥♥ingtastic sound track.","May 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is beautiful and well-chosen for the scenes that are meant to get to you (and they really do), and the voices feel spot on for most characters you meet. Some puzzles can get frustrating due to the combination of 'I don't need this right now' for interactable objects that you might or might not use in the future and objects that only become interactable when something else happens in a different area. However, dialogue usually contains hints on where you need to go, and your humorous floating skull sidekick might have something useful to say as well, so pay attention. There's a variety of endings, and you're not restricted to the path of the good guy, though, by that time you'll be questioning your definition of a 'good guy' and how good your actions actually were.

It was an amazing experience and I URGE any and all of you to try it out. I am thus writing a review to leave my mark.\n\nGameplay : the puzzles are sometimes a bit contrived, but satisfying overall. It's all a matter of investigating the area and DON'T FORGET YOU CAN USE CRISPIN. He's essential to many puzzles and I got stumped because I didn't know I could use him as an item! Otherwise, despite being occasionnaly frustrating, the mechanics are very well implemented and its a joy to interact with the game's world.\n\nGraphics : All the graphics in this game are simply GORGEOUS. You can tell the makers put their heart into the art (pun intended), despite there being not all that much since the game is a bit short. But you can tell from the screenshots that this game really shines visually.\n\nAudio : The real beauty of this game : the voice-over. The voice actor for Bastion's Narrator is the main character here, and he doesn't disappoint! And neither do the other characters! Each and every robot has a unique personality, and I loved just examining every little detail just for more of the voice talent. There's even a robot that only speaks in rhyming riddles! And the music, simply entrancing. When you play this, be sure to put up the volume!\n\nStory : As usual, you are an amnesiac and you live with your faithful companion Crispin. While short, the adventure is really gripping, and charming- despite the post-apocalyptic setting. Similar to Machinarium, the world is only populated by robots, and they live in a big city of lights! There's two main sections to the story : exploring the desert, discovering various different areas, and exploring the city, which sadly wasn't that big. Unlike the desert, which had a map with a few area markers you could jump to, the city was only a few connected screens, which blocked you with puzzles. Despite the city being a bit small and the story short, it ends (according to the good ending) on a good note and offers the possibility of a sequel.\n\nAt least... I hope...\n\nI give this game a 9/10, with frustrating puzzles as the only negative point. Try it out! Don't worry, there's plenty of comic relief thanks to Crispin :)","December 27, 2013","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although at first- and even throughout much of the game, as many of the characters are lighthearted- somewhat comedic, the game's oppressive and bleak dystopian atmosphere was surprisingly dark and depressing. The game also did a good job at emotionally connecting you to Horatio and Crispin, which, really surprisingly for me, helped create a really sad feeling later on in the game. Very highly recommended.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/recommended/227000/","strangemodule","strangemodule","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/","339 products in account","Let me just start this review by giving you the following context: I very rarely play point-and-clicks. The most notable ones (namely, those by LucasArts) were before my time, so my only games in this genre I’ve played are the new Sam and Max games and this one.\n\nThis genre greatly focuses on its writing and story, and I feel Primorida does well in that regard. What starts as a simple story of tracking a robot who stole your stuff turns into a one with many hints about the world and why it’s in the state it is, and Horatio’s role in it. Each character, from the straight-laced and practical main character Horatio, to his perpetually floating, snarky sidekick Crispin, and everyone else you interact with is written with enough skill to give them unique personalities without falling into two-dimensional archetypes. While many NPCs fall into some stereotypes of their characters (ex: a soldier robot speaks how you’d expect him to, likewise with a robot with a monocle), they get moments where they flesh out their character and have some very clever lines.\n\nThe overall plot kept me guessing all the way to the end, but stayed mostly clear about what was going on the whole way through. The story is straightforward in that regard, although the littering of hints of the details behind the game world really helped the story shine when it revealed big plot elements.\n\nHowever, I NEED to talk about the gameplay. It’s your typical adventure game fare of solving puzzles by figuring out how items interact with each other, listening to context clues, etc. The game doesn’t go too crazy with the solutions.\n\nThat being said, I will be honest and say I had to use a walkthrough for this game. This is most likely due to my inexperience with the genre, but many times I felt clueless on what to do. Furthermore, when I looked up the solution, I felt like the game gave me little to no inclination that what I was supposed to do may be the answer.\n\nPUZZLE SPOILERS\n\nOne of the most “how was I supposed to do that” moments was when I needed to figure out how to remove rust from gears so I could open a door. I hadn’t met anyone who was a cleaning robot or the like, and I had no items on me that implied they could clean. It turns out that in one segment, there are underwater “submersible” robots who, when I dunked the gears underwater where they were, cleaned the gears. When I clicked on them normally, the main character said NOTHING about their potential cleaning ability.\n\nAnother annoying one was a moment of “I didn’t know I could do that”. I had to inspect a door in order to solve a puzzle, but left-clicking it gave me a quote that didn’t help me. However, right-clicking it gave me a different one relevant to the puzzle. I know that could right-click on items to hear a description of them in my inventory, but I didn’t know why I couldn’t just left-click this door to hear the contextually-important quote for this puzzle.\n\nEND PUZZLE SPOILERS\n\nSo overall, I’d say that you should not feel ashamed if you need a walkthrough for certain puzzles in this game. The second half of this game has quite a few rather obtuse ones, which is a shame since they can halt the progression of what is otherwise a really cool story.\n\nMy other problem is a technical one: this game has no resolution options! It can only either run in fullscreen (which I think is 1024x768!!!) or windowed which has a default size that is most suitable for ants. Thankfully you can turn the “scaling” up, which means increasing the size of the internal resolution (window size in windowed mode increases with this), but the lack of proper resolution options just strikes me as lazy to me.\n\nLastly, and this is sort of a nitpick, but this isn’t Logan Cunningham’s best work. He does a decent job not sounding bored in his lines and emoting properly when necessary, but either due to sound engineering, low quality audio files, or otherwise not as much strength in his voice work, he isn’t as memorable as he was in Bastion. I felt the sidekick Crispin out-did him in passionately delivering his lines. It doesn’t detract from the game at all really, I’m more just feeling like he could have done better.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nI strongly suggest you guys pick up Primorida. It’s got an interesting plot inside a unique atmosphere of a post-human world, and the writing does those both justice. The puzzles can be result in premature baldness due to hair-pulling difficulty, but they didn’t stop me from enjoying the game.","January 7, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

I also thought that the voice of Horatio never felt appropriate for a robot (it’s the same actor as the main character of Gemini Rue, but in that case it fit great) , but it’s just a minor quibble.

That "bit" more turned into hours and hours of continuously playing this game. This game just throws at you the mix of a great story line + good caracther development + Not too hard to figure out but still good puzzles and great comedy. It doesn't have the same funny tone all the time however\n\nWhen Horatio and Crispin fail to find a power source in the wastelands they are forced to head to Metropol, the self proclamed city of glass and light. "Free power for one and all" is what they advertise and they do have power for everyone, but it does come with a price. When Horatio and Crispin step out of the red line train, Horatio finds a robot who collects 1 megacycle from him. At the time, Horatio has no idea of what a megacycle is, but he does find out eventually that the megacycles are brain power, we could also call it processing power. Anyways, the story goes along and Horatio finds out that his power core is stored on the big tower where Metromind is. He then goes on to try and get it back and that's when things take a darker turn. BUUUUUT I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who might have read the spoil alert and then thinks to theirselfs "you know what, Imma read it anyways".\n\nThe story is great, the caracthers are great, the puzzles are excellent and there are multiple endings which means you can replay the game and let me tell you, you will want to replay the game because it is so damn good!\n\nI would rate it an honest 9.5/10 , I would even dare to give it a 10/10 .\n\nAmazing game and for 10 euros, it is a bargain of a lifetime","March 20, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In merely 8-9 hours, the player follows Horatio and Crispin in an unforgettable journey of thought and emotion, which combines the unfolding of a gripping tale with clever puzzles and addictive old-school adventure game gameplay.\n\nFull Review: http://adventureadvocate.gr/gamereviews/item/primordia","February 15, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That "bit" more turned into hours and hours of continuously playing this game. This game just throws at you the mix of a great story line + good caracther development + Not too hard to figure out but still good puzzles and great comedy. It doesn't have the same funny tone all the time however\n\nWhen Horatio and Crispin fail to find a power source in the wastelands they are forced to head to Metropol, the self proclamed city of glass and light. "Free power for one and all" is what they advertise and they do have power for everyone, but it does come with a price. When Horatio and Crispin step out of the red line train, Horatio finds a robot who collects 1 megacycle from him. At the time, Horatio has no idea of what a megacycle is, but he does find out eventually that the megacycles are brain power, we could also call it processing power. Anyways, the story goes along and Horatio finds out that his power core is stored on the big tower where Metromind is. He then goes on to try and get it back and that's when things take a darker turn. BUUUUUT I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who might have read the spoil alert and then thinks to theirselfs "you know what, Imma read it anyways".\n\nThe story is great, the caracthers are great, the puzzles are excellent and there are multiple endings which means you can replay the game and let me tell you, you will want to replay the game because it is so damn good!\n\nI would rate it an honest 9.5/10 , I would even dare to give it a 10/10 .\n\nAmazing game and for 10 euros, it is a bargain of a lifetime","March 20, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The artwork was excellent and the dialogue thoroughly amusing. The story pulls you in and at the end I was a little sad that it was over.\n\nIf you like adventure games then this will be a hit. If you haven't tried adventure games but were looking to then I think this might be one to start with as most of the puzzles are pretty intuitive. The things you need to interact with are generally easy to find on the screen and the dialogue and hints help a lot.","March 23, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some very unique things that set this game apart from other point-and-click adventure games.\nOne element that is so different about Primordia is the surprisingly large amount of dialogue that is incorporated into it, unlike most other games of the genre.\nAnother characteristic that adds to the game is Crispin, the protagonist's "sidekick" if you would call him that. He adds a sense of humour to the game (although sometimes rather corny) and can offer hints to the player that are valuable, but not always completely revealing of the next course of action that must be taken. Crispin is an often uplifting character in this post-apocalytic setting.\nAnother trait that won me over is the atmosphere in the game. It seems realistic in the post-apocalyptic setting, and it is one of my favorite things about this game. The backrounds always seem beautifully made.\nThe puzzles in this game are very engaging and are not always clear-cut which may seem like a bad thing, but I personally enjoy the extra challenge. Not every puzzle is as simple as clicking on one thing and then another. They often include various items and/or certain actions to be taken. This is a huge difference between Primordia and other point-and-click adventure games.\nThe only complaint I really have about this game is that it seems to include a few creationist concepts that I personally do not agree with. It is brought up through the concept of humanism in the game which is symbolic of today's major religions that believe that a god created humans.\nAnother piece of this game that I am not fully content with is the way the protagonist moves. It can sometimes seem somewhat clumsy, but I won't be critical about it seeing as how that is how it is with most other point-and-click adventure games.\nOverall, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It is definitely a worthwhile play for those who like games such as machinarium or other big point-and-click adventure games because of the unique elements it includes.\nOne last thing I would like to address is that it sometimes has multiple choices that can be made, leading to different outcomes. They do not alwyas have a huge effect on the story, but it adds a sense of independence in the game.\nI highly recommend that you all look into playing this game :)\n","July 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Primordia is not one of those games that falls short at all.\n\nI should admit before I go any further that I've only played the opening sequence of this game thus far, and am extremely excited to get back to it after this review, but this particular summary will be noting the aesthetic, and initial response of Primordia.\n\nI absolutely love post-apocalypse. It's not an uncommon scenario, thankfully, so there's lots of material to dig through on the subject. Unfortunately, there's quite a lot of BAD post-apocalypse games out there, and so with some hesitation, I bought this game, and sat down with some skepticism. For ten bucks, I was hoping it was going to deliver, and the reviews spoke for themselves.\n\nPrimordia does something a lot of post-apocalyptic stories don't, and removes humans altogether from the character roster. You begin the game as Horatio Nullbuilt (the surname meaning some dude presumeably named 'Null' built him, which is a common theme throughout the game), the 5th version to be precise, and are accompanied by Crispin Horatiobuilt, your custom companion and comic relief. The world around you is an age-old Earth, looking very barren and very post-war. A strange robot cuts down your door one day and steals your power core, without which you can not charge your own batteries (nor Crispin's). Since that simply won't do, you venture out into the world in order to find the strange robot and reclaim your power core.\n\nEasier said than done. What follows are scenes common to Adventure/Point+Click games: You meet hosts of interesting robots, travel to new and exciting places, and spend a good deal of time trying to combine every single item in your inventory to see if it does something cool. Excellent (okay... MOSTLY excellent) voice acting, a (so far) riveting and comedic script, beautiful artwork, and intriguing characters make this one of my favorite Adventure games to date, and I've barely even started it.\n\nShould you get it? I mean, it's a point and click. You know what you're getting. The deciding factor, in most cases, is the story and artwork, and both deliver wholeheartedly. Even this early, the story is already showing to be incredibly promising, with twists and turns, and dark comedy as only robots can deliver. The script, as mentioned, is really quite good, and I don't find myself simply reading through the subtitles and clicking through in order to progress, but rather relishing the lines and the delivery. The art, while simple and "retro" in style, does not detract at all from the story, but actually enhances it with far-off vistas, incredible robot designs, and teeming robot cities, both very alive, and strangely dead.\n\nFans of point and clicks, this is another excellent addition to your collection, reminding me of titles like Deponia, Riven, and (of course) Monkey Island. Fans of sci-fi, post apocalyptic fiction will also love this game. All in all, I think it's one of those rare games on Steam where I feel like I absolutely got what I paid for, and then some.\n\nAnd I haven't even finished it.\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I could tell just from looking at the trailer and screenshots of this game that it looked interesting, and that "Overwhelmingly Positive" next to the user reviews made it seem like a no-brainer. So, finally I picked up this game and boy, I am not disappointed.\n\nLet's get the bad out of the way first.\n\nThis game runs in a very small resolution, at least for most modern monitors. The highest resolution possible is 1280x800, which looks best in a window. It was also a bit annoying that the only way I could find to change these settings was by a launcher in the actual folder containing the game files. I only found that much by perusing the game forum when I was disappointed with the resolution.\n\nThere isn't much replayability. I can definitely see myself trying this game again to do a few things different, but overall it is a story-driven and therefore linear experience. It has several endings, but most of those endings are decided at your own whim by how you play out the final scenes.\n\nNow, the good.\n\nThe obvious first thing you'll notice about this game is that artwork. I found it to be very cool to look at and definitely gives you that feeling of despair - a world wasting away around you as you desperately try to rebuild what you can. You also have atmospheric music that adds to these scenes but mostly stays in the background. It adds a lot, but doesn't overtake it. Instead, it's all just working together to give you an experience.\n\nThe voice acting is likewise excellent. The main character and his sidekick both do most of the talking, so it's great to see them so well performed. It's easy to pick up on their personalities and they're both likeable.\n\nI'm always a bit bad at puzzles in games, but I thought the ones here were challenging but always possible. Nothing ever felt frustrating or beyond my abilities to figure out. I did get "stuck" in a few places where I had no idea what to do, but it usually came down to me not thinking about the situation well enough or remembering details that I simply overlooked. It's worth saying, almost everything matters in this game. There are few things that are superfluous.\n\nOverall it took me about six hours to complete this game. I would have liked for it to be longer, but I could say that for any good game.\n\nIf you're interested in this game at all, check it out.","August 22, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the central questions the player wants answered is what exactly happened to the humans who presumably once inhabited this Earth and created the robots left behind. Added to this is a tapestry of moral and philosopical themes such as the meaning and existence of free will, individuality, progress, and what constitutes the 'greater good'. These sometimes rather heavy themes are pulled off through excellent writing, and are offset by a quirky humour that runs through the whole game. This off-beat humour and occasional breaking of the fourth wall are reminiscent of some of my favourite, genuinely old-school games such as Simon the Sorcerer, and I think anyone who was playing this kind of thing in the early 90's will appreciate it. The worldbuilding and background detail is fantastic - my one gripe is that the game just doesn't go far enough. There are hints of exciting other locations that we don't get to visit, and the larger philosophical themes are never fully explored.\n\nAs this is a game and not just a visual novel, I should probably mention a bit about the gameplay - it's pretty much standard of point & click games, and uses the traditional inventory system. Nothing stood out as unique, but equally nothing was inconvenient or jarring. The puzzles are not particularly challenging, and there's plenty of hints on hand from Crispin if one chooses to press him for them (it's also pretty fun to hear him getting annoyed and snarky when you try and use him too many times). I prefer simpler puzzles so the flow of the story doesn't stall, but others might find this game too easy.\n\nIn terms of visuals, the pixel art is gorgeous, and the colour palette of browns, rusts and muted golds perfectly realizes the dusty, disued world. The audio content is also great, from the music to the voice acting. Even minor characters are voiced, and the robot voice effects are pretty cool.\n\nOverall an 9/10 for this game. The presentation is beautiful both visually and aurally, and beneath this is a solid story rooted in a world that feels like it really could be our future. Horatio and Crispin are likeable and memorable characters to journey through this tale with, and their easy banter creates the emotional anchor to this crumbling planet. Points are lost for the sense that the game could have been bigger both in terms of the number of locations, and the philosophical ideas that never seem to be explored quite as far as you hope. Regardless, 'Primordia' is highly recommended!","March 3, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Excellent dialogs.\n\nThe puzzles are quite intuitive (after thinking for a bit! =), at least some of them have multiple solutions (I finished the game without solving every puzzle), and the game has a very robust hint system which is nicely integrated into the narrative.\n\nI enjoyed the retro/pixelated visual style, but since mileage varies greatly do check screenshots and videos and see for yourself.\n\nMaybe a tad short, as adventure games tend to be (about 5-8 hours in this case) but you can save the game at any point (and you have as many save slots as you want), which encourages exploring alternative solutions & dialog choices.\n\n***\n\nIn detail (*Spoiler-free*)\nPersonally, I play adventure games mostly for the story, setting, and characters, with a bit of puzzle-solving to spice the mix. As noted above, in this genre I don't care much for AAA high-end graphics as long as what's on the screen is clear.\n\n"Primordia" delivers on all counts:\n\n> The setting is amazing: robots in a post-apocalyptic, nearly Mad-Maxian world (minus the cars), with an orwellian Big Brother on top. Although, to make it better, the mood is nostalgic and bittersweet rather than oppressive.\n\n> The plot is itself quite good.\n\n> I found most characters to be very well crafted. The protagonist's companion deserves a mention of his own: not only he fulfills his Sassy Sidekick role and provides the humor this otherwise grim tale needs, he's also part of a very comprehensive hint system (and seamlessly integrated into the narrative)\n\n> The puzzles themselves are quite intuitive, and the few that may be too obscure are enlightened by the hint system. Several puzzles have multiple solutions, too (I finished the game without solving every puzzle), and at least a few of them affect the endings of the story.\n\n"Primordia" (as other adventure games) may feel a bit too short when comparing the playtime/cost ratio with other genres, but IMHO it's the price of well crafted plot & characters... and, perhaps more important, of setting and themes you keep thinking about even after finishing the game.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","December 23, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The comedic dialogue is nicely written and acted although a bit out of place in the dismal Kinotrope-esque atmosphere of rusted machinery and manufactured wastelands. The graphics really are just stunning but as with many pointy clicky games it falls into the pitfalls of 1. having a great environment and concept but underdeveloped characters and 2. some of the puzzles just make no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. It's one thing to have difficult puzzles, I recently played armikrog and although it took me a while I still required no walk-through because it all followed some sense,  however with this game I needed walkthroughs multiple times only to find nonsense solutions that followed no logic, when it comes to puzzle structure I expected more from the creators of Gemini Rue. BUT I still did find myself really WANTING to advance to see more of the beautiful artwork and unique world-building shown in the game and I have to commend it for that.

I prefer simpler puzzles so the flow of the story doesn't stall, but others might find this game too easy.\n\nIn terms of visuals, the pixel art is gorgeous, and the colour palette of browns, rusts and muted golds perfectly realizes the dusty, disued world. The audio content is also great, from the music to the voice acting. Even minor characters are voiced, and the robot voice effects are pretty cool.\n\nOverall an 9/10 for this game. The presentation is beautiful both visually and aurally, and beneath this is a solid story rooted in a world that feels like it really could be our future. Horatio and Crispin are likeable and memorable characters to journey through this tale with, and their easy banter creates the emotional anchor to this crumbling planet. Points are lost for the sense that the game could have been bigger both in terms of the number of locations, and the philosophical ideas that never seem to be explored quite as far as you hope. Regardless, 'Primordia' is highly recommended!","March 3, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/recommended/227000/","explodingbosoms","The Pasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/","349 products in account","General Overview: Primordia, a point and click adventure, takes place in the unique timeline of post-apocalyptia where humans are no longer present. The only thing left is their own invention: machine. Machine that prospered and slowly became just like human, with their own ideas and vices. Even if they're limited by their programming, they could still interact with others like normal folk. Taking the reigns of Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin, what starts as a simple retrieval turns into a full blown adventure, albeit a somewhat short trip.\n\nGameplay: The game itself follows the point and click style of gameplay, so its hard to screw that part up. That said, it does a good enough job being difficult and leaving you wondering "what the hell do I do now?" Thankfully, Crispin has a built in hint-o-tron to give you tips on what you could do or should do if you're ever stumped. The puzzles themselves are, in my opinion, pretty darn easy. The only difficult ones would be where you meet your unfriendly thief again or when you need access to a certain place with a long string of code. Other than that, it's pretty straight forward. Then again, I play puzzles for kicks so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nThere are some puzzles with different methods of completion, usually a good and bad way. Sometimes the bad way is the only obvious way, where the good way will require a save here and there to help you out should you pull an oopsie. By the way, you'll probably be doing this often. Puzzles do have "soft-fail" states, which can be pretty infuriating, so save often! The actual game itself is, unfortunately, pretty damn short. You could probably finish the entire game within 5 hours or so (after knowing everything and everyone and all the choices). There is A TON of going back and forth. No joke, you'll probably find yourself going back and forth between robots, trying everything, for a good 10 minutes until something works. It can get annoying fast. There are also a few references sprinkled here and there to earn a few chuckles. Some more obvious than others.\n\nArt: Holy hell, this art style. While a mess of browns, it works so damn well together. Not to mention Horatio and Crispin always seem to stand out from the environment whenever possible, so that's also a plus. Unfortunately, the overwhelming abundance of browns makes finding some robots or items kinda difficult. Had to pull the hover method to find a few things sometimes. I understand its supposed to be post-apocalyptia, but sometimes you have to look away and rub your eyes.\n\nMusic: It's amazing. Done.\n\nActing: The VA in this game are beautiful and, at the same time, somewhat phoned in. Sometimes you can tell the lines are being read from the script. Other times you feel it from the heart. It is, overall, a very good experience to feel the voices actually try when they do. Funnily enough, it was the side characters that, in my opinion, had the best acting compared to our main characters.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves a good point and click adventure with a fan♥♥♥♥ingtastic sound track.","May 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is wonderful and moving, the characters are well-written and fleshed out, and the humor is surprisingly funny despite the game's bleak dystopian setting. The art and backgrounds, though they look somewhat dated and old-fashioned, are still detailed and do a very good job building the world and creating the atmosphere. The puzzles were a little hard to figure out at times, but always had a logical solution. I strongly recommend this game to everyone, unless you're not much of a point-and-click fan or can't stand dystopian settings I guess. Seriously though, this game is amazing. You won't be disappointed.\n\nThis game also happened to introduce me to Wadjet Eye Games and has sort of been a gateway drug into their other games. Which are also really good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bittletime/recommended/227000/","bittletime","SirBittle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bittletime/","358 products in account","This game was a pleasant surprise, to be certain. I could tell just from looking at the trailer and screenshots of this game that it looked interesting, and that "Overwhelmingly Positive" next to the user reviews made it seem like a no-brainer. So, finally I picked up this game and boy, I am not disappointed.\n\nLet's get the bad out of the way first.\n\nThis game runs in a very small resolution, at least for most modern monitors. The highest resolution possible is 1280x800, which looks best in a window. It was also a bit annoying that the only way I could find to change these settings was by a launcher in the actual folder containing the game files. I only found that much by perusing the game forum when I was disappointed with the resolution.\n\nThere isn't much replayability. I can definitely see myself trying this game again to do a few things different, but overall it is a story-driven and therefore linear experience. It has several endings, but most of those endings are decided at your own whim by how you play out the final scenes.\n\nNow, the good.\n\nThe obvious first thing you'll notice about this game is that artwork. I found it to be very cool to look at and definitely gives you that feeling of despair - a world wasting away around you as you desperately try to rebuild what you can. You also have atmospheric music that adds to these scenes but mostly stays in the background. It adds a lot, but doesn't overtake it. Instead, it's all just working together to give you an experience.\n\nThe voice acting is likewise excellent. The main character and his sidekick both do most of the talking, so it's great to see them so well performed. It's easy to pick up on their personalities and they're both likeable.\n\nI'm always a bit bad at puzzles in games, but I thought the ones here were challenging but always possible. Nothing ever felt frustrating or beyond my abilities to figure out. I did get "stuck" in a few places where I had no idea what to do, but it usually came down to me not thinking about the situation well enough or remembering details that I simply overlooked. It's worth saying, almost everything matters in this game. There are few things that are superfluous.\n\nOverall it took me about six hours to complete this game. I would have liked for it to be longer, but I could say that for any good game.\n\nIf you're interested in this game at all, check it out.","August 22, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You want to talk about fun and story-driven gameplay? This thing comes close to a masterpiece. 9/10. Details below.\n\nSet in an extreme post-apocolyptia, our hero attempts to recover a power source he desperatly needs, stolen from him by a hulking robot. As his simple quest progresses, he finds himself drawn into the day-to-day conflicts of many men and women bots, deepening the story and lore of the world naturally. On the way you, the player, solve simple yet satisying point-and-click puzzles with elegent conectivity and solutions. The vast majority of the puzzles feel very natural, not forcibly integrated with the environment. The few esoteric ones can be figured out by paying careful attention to the dialogue of NPC bots. As you travel from your humble abode across vast wastes, to a sprawling, decrepit city, you meet incredibly interesting characters. The amount of work that went into the art design is astounding, and reflects well on the amount of work that went into the writing. The story is driven by dialogue rather than the environment, though all the scenes are breathtaking. I will say Crispin's playful banter leaves something to be desired and feels off-key, coming as it is in such a bleak game. But the story and gameplay merge so seemlessly you can forgive it.

I really enjoyed playing through this, unlike other point and click adventure games. The themes are also pretty dark, but very satisfying and aided in keeping me playing. I tend to put these kind of games down because I get bored or suck. I hated mine sweeper as a kid and randomly clicking around the screen got tiresome. Primordia even has some cheeky and cleaver dialogue incase you need to run around clicking everything. Didn't help with the frustration, but the occasional joke helped keep me from just giving up. Plus CYBERPUNK! PLUS POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELANDS!\n\nSPOILERS!!!!--------\n\nThere are multiple endings. I assure you, saving right before the big confontation helps you experience them all! Each is pretty cool, but even some optional items can have an impact on the ending. Mainly items belonging to your companions. Also certain events may occur that have an impact on your endings. Save different files often as kind of a bookmark so you can go back and attempt for different outcomes. I had about 17 so I could see everything with three files for all the endings (confrontation save)\n\nFor example, there's a situation where you can corner a rogue AI. Save before you attempt! Trapping him gives you an item that aids in the true ending, but killing him changes the ending of that chapter. So if you want to experience both chapter endings, you'll need 2 saves, but after that, the two paths merge and continues normally.\n\nALSO! SPOILERS!\n\nHave Crispin talk to the lanterns. He needs the practice!\n\n","November 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles are good without ever being too challenging and the story is tightly knit, with only about 10-11 locations and about 15 characters in the entire game. It's concise without any red herrings. Actually, because the game is so tightly knit, some important secrets are left out in plain sight, which makes it interesting to replay.\n\nWhat I also like about the puzzles in this game are that there's dialouge if the game understands what you were trying to do with a puzzle, but you were using the wrong piece and there's multiple ways to solve several of the puzzles. In fact, the biggest and longest puzzle of the game can literally be bypassed from the moment you enter the second act.\n\nMy only complaint with the game would be the antagonist. The antagonist has a trait that they can "never lie" but then you manage to catch them in lies several times and when confronted with this, the antagonist says "no player, you must be mistaken because I am not". In a game where the entire second act is about logic, it just seems silly. Additionally, my other problem with the antagonist is that at one point the antagonist just says "I know you have a lot of questions about the world and history of this game world, so let me answer all of them for you".\n\nHowever, that small gripe aside, this game had me engaged and immersed the whole time, trying to figure out its secrets and lore (until the minute that it got bored and laid out its cards on the table).","January 14","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

There are some very unique things that set this game apart from other point-and-click adventure games.\nOne element that is so different about Primordia is the surprisingly large amount of dialogue that is incorporated into it, unlike most other games of the genre.\nAnother characteristic that adds to the game is Crispin, the protagonist's "sidekick" if you would call him that. He adds a sense of humour to the game (although sometimes rather corny) and can offer hints to the player that are valuable, but not always completely revealing of the next course of action that must be taken. Crispin is an often uplifting character in this post-apocalytic setting.\nAnother trait that won me over is the atmosphere in the game. It seems realistic in the post-apocalyptic setting, and it is one of my favorite things about this game. The backrounds always seem beautifully made.\nThe puzzles in this game are very engaging and are not always clear-cut which may seem like a bad thing, but I personally enjoy the extra challenge. Not every puzzle is as simple as clicking on one thing and then another. They often include various items and/or certain actions to be taken. This is a huge difference between Primordia and other point-and-click adventure games.\nThe only complaint I really have about this game is that it seems to include a few creationist concepts that I personally do not agree with. It is brought up through the concept of humanism in the game which is symbolic of today's major religions that believe that a god created humans.\nAnother piece of this game that I am not fully content with is the way the protagonist moves. It can sometimes seem somewhat clumsy, but I won't be critical about it seeing as how that is how it is with most other point-and-click adventure games.\nOverall, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It is definitely a worthwhile play for those who like games such as machinarium or other big point-and-click adventure games because of the unique elements it includes.\nOne last thing I would like to address is that it sometimes has multiple choices that can be made, leading to different outcomes. They do not alwyas have a huge effect on the story, but it adds a sense of independence in the game.\nI highly recommend that you all look into playing this game :)\n","July 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When Horatio and Crispin's power core (the thing that keeps them alive and running) is stolen, they must embark on a journey using only stuff they can salvage in classic point and click style to find whats rightfully theirs.

While the abrupt ending is somewhat disappointing, it game never seems to lose a step and the dialogue is exceedingly cyncial and hilarious.

Take notes.  (Most of which actually happens for you with the in-game "data-pad".)  Solve puzzles with said notes.\n\nThe game runs at 640x400 resolution - which can be off-putting to some, but really lends to the retro-adventure feel of the game, and I've come to love it.  (On my 1080p tv, it won't actually fill up the whole screen, but it doesn't really bother me.)  That said - I highly recommend going into the options menu and chosing the "DX" display mode as opposed to D3D if it works for you - the sprites mesh with the backgrounds much better this way in my opinion.  DOS nostalgia!\n\nWhat really shines in Primordia is the story - and the art.  They come together to create a fascinating atmosphere that makes me want to revisit the game again and again - and the developer commentary is great on a second or third playthrough.  The excellent voice acting and seven or so potential endings don't hurt, either.  (The narrator from Bastion plays the main character - and the sidekick that follows you through the game is entertaining at every turn.)  The music and sound mesh well with the art to create an engrossing atmosphere - despite the retro low-res graphics.\n\nThere aren't many puzzles in the "puzzle game" sense - but there is plenty of puzzling to be done in the game in terms of figuring out how things fit together, what things mean, and what the significance of certain items or pieces of information may be.  The story is mostly linear, but there are a few opportunities to take different approaches to solve situations - especially near the end.  Observation and careful contemplation are rewarded.\n\nThe setting is in the distant future in a post-human world - no organic life is to be found anywhere - even the bugs and little things swimming in the sewers are machines - but make no mistake, they have lives and thoughts of their own, and are no less interesting than any human character.  And for the robot fan, there are references to other robots from both popular and obscure culture everywhere - along with a videogame reference or two.  MST3K, Short Circuit, Metropolis, and Fallout - just to name a few.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to any fan of classic graphic adventures, narrative-driven games, or robots.","January 26","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a big fan of the Blackwell games, and this game has many of the same strengths.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent story. There's legitimately a lot to think about in this game, including political, religious, and social commentary. The game is set in a world where humans are extinct and only robots are left. We see how the society they create is a very clever mirror of our own, with plenty of parody of our own flaws along the way.\n+ The point and click puzzles are solid. They are somewhat difficult, but solvable without having to consult a walkthrough because the solutions make sense once you get them. To me, this is one of the most important things about gameplay in a point and click. You have to use your brain to solve the puzzles.\n+ If you do start struggling, you can get hints by talking to people (especially your sidekick Crispin), which again means you don't need to consult the internet to get a nudge in the right direction. Normally, he will give you a clue about which area you should be searching, or which object you should be fiddling with.\n+ The art and aesthetics in the game are good. The characters are interesting-looking, and the world is very neat.\n+ The game is paced well. It does a nice job of moving you from place to place, advancing the story and revealing the mysteries by steps.\n\nCons:\n- Hard to think of any. I suppose the UI can be a bit clunky until you get used to it, especially how you access your inventory.","February 2","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It happens to be my favorite game in the world, but that is a subjective assessment and I intend for this to be an objective review so I will explain WHY my opinon has formed the way it has.\n\nFirst: the world is unique.  The spectacularly different setting in which the protagonist finds himself is interesting and deeply realized. I found that as I played this game I wanted to learn more and more about the backstory, the reason things were the way they were. It is likely that not everyone will have this response but I found that the somehow quite human cyberpunk characters drew me in. The robotic population of this game have dreams, hopes, and problems which make them relatable, but also special. They are obviously not human, but the similarities between them and humanity are evident in many portions of the game. That, however, is not to say there are no differences. Indeed some of the differences are what drove me to be more industrious in my exploration of the world.\n\nSecond: the voice acting is stellar. While the voice acting is not particularly flashy, it has an underplayed value in making the protagonist and his little helper come to life. Throughout it gives simple but essential relatability with the main character, putting the player in his shoes so to speak. The voices are diverse and unique and this additionally draws the player into the world, which now not only has depth, but also seems broad.\n\nThird: the art is dead center with the rest of the game's feel. Though robotic, many tubes and unique shapes cascade through the art design, giving the machines an organic feel (this is not the only game I've seen do this but this game does it well). Most of the tones are dead-feeling beiges and browns but there are many glowing lights throughout the game that give the overall impression of a world with a soul beneath all the lifeless metal. Again this fits perfectly with the world's history and vibe.\n\nFourth: the audio is wonderfully immersive. The sound is electronic with a common use of ethnic sounding pad synths. Deep, slow rhythms give the game a dark and somber feel which meshes perfectly with the mechanized art and characters. There is at least one old record you can listen to, which deepens the games portrayal of the world's past.\n\nFifth: the gameplay is solid. The puzzles are not hard, but they have an obvious digital slant that only increases immersion and interest. Each one is unique, although each of thier formats is fairly standard for point and click games. If this game had to have a weakness it would be the puzzles, if you don't play this game for the story and immersion, I think you're not playing to the game's amazing strengths. If you don't like stories/worlds that you can lose yourself in and just want hard puzzles, don't play this.

You want to talk about fun and story-driven gameplay? This thing comes close to a masterpiece. 9/10. Details below.\n\nSet in an extreme post-apocolyptia, our hero attempts to recover a power source he desperatly needs, stolen from him by a hulking robot. As his simple quest progresses, he finds himself drawn into the day-to-day conflicts of many men and women bots, deepening the story and lore of the world naturally. On the way you, the player, solve simple yet satisying point-and-click puzzles with elegent conectivity and solutions. The vast majority of the puzzles feel very natural, not forcibly integrated with the environment. The few esoteric ones can be figured out by paying careful attention to the dialogue of NPC bots. As you travel from your humble abode across vast wastes, to a sprawling, decrepit city, you meet incredibly interesting characters. The amount of work that went into the art design is astounding, and reflects well on the amount of work that went into the writing. The story is driven by dialogue rather than the environment, though all the scenes are breathtaking. I will say Crispin's playful banter leaves something to be desired and feels off-key, coming as it is in such a bleak game. But the story and gameplay merge so seemlessly you can forgive it. An incredible game with replay value and amazing choice endings. Highly reccomended.","February 27","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't played very many of them, and I usually get frustrated with the puzzles and either look up a guide (which kind of defeats the point) or quit.\n\nI LOVED Primordia. Maybe it scratched the right itch at the right time, but I enjoyed every second of this game. The puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating (the only times that I had to look something up were just because I didn't realize I could scroll down on my data pack, for example, or that I could interact with an object in a certain way. For everything else, Crispin's hints were more than enough). It's gorgeous and thought-provoking. The voice acting was excellent and really brought all of the characters to life. The world is endlessly interesting. Looking at the achievements after my first playthrough, it also seems that there is a great deal to discover that I missed my first time around, which is good, because in my desire to experience more of this world I will probably play through it at least one more time.\n\nA lot of reviews have commented on it feeling a bit short, and I'm tempted to agree. The second half of the game in particular feels a bit rushed, but it seems to have more to do with there being lots of questions to answer, and they all get answered in a shotgun blast at once that seems to detract from the feeling of discovery that permiates the rest of the game. However, if the only bad thing I have to say about a game is "I wanted more..." is it really a bad thing after all?\n\nPrimordia is very literary. It's a game about the preservation of individuality within an increasingly communist society. It's about one's "design," and whether or not it's possible to act against it. It's about friendship, religion, creation, preservation, degeneration, and hope.\n\nDo yourself a favor and play this game.","May 31","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/recommended/227000/","dunetiger","Dune Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/","2220 products in account","Primordia is an attempt at a weighty story that somewhat misses its mark in execution.  As in all adventure games, things start innocently (loosely applied) enough as a giant robot looking like the mobile version of HAL crossed with a lobster (I know, right?) invades your home on a derelict ship and steals your power core.  You, Horatio, from a long line of previous Horatios, must now find a way to retrieve it.  It should be mentioned that everyone in this game, including you, is a robot, and as you begin to explore the world and meet its denizens, you'll find yourself wrapped in a robot existentialist's wetware runtime environment, rolling around in what amounts to be the robotic version of a Kafka story... okay, maybe not that weighty.  There's just something about the ending (of which there are many) that just never seems satisfying, even if you take all the steps to do the 'good' one.  That being said, Primordia still manages to tell its story with care and it's delivered in perfectly-bleak dialogue for a perfectly-bleak world.\n\nTechnically, the game suffers a little bit from a few questionable design decisions.  Being (I assume) an homage to the point 'n' click (PNC) games of yesteryear, the developer insisted on a low-res, 2D game - which is great - but instead of doing what most modern games do which is make a hi-res game look low-res, this game is actually 800x600.  This isn't really that big a deal until you notice that often the character sprites don't 'belong' to the scene.  In classic adventure games, different sprites were created depending on where the character is supposed to be standing; in Primordia, the technique used instead is simply scaling down the larger sprite with the end result being a much crisper sprite on a purposely-blocky background.  Not a dealbreaker, but it can be a little bit distracting.\n\nOther design decisions that were made are quite inexcusable in a modern PNC game.  Despite the genre being declared 'dead' for years, the truth is that the genre has thrived (loosely applied) throughout the decades and made many advances, all of which are ignored by Primordia.  For instance, in most modern PNCs, there's a hotspot-highlight button to speed along play; Primordia does not have that.  In most modern PNCs, you can usually double-click an exit to skip the slow plod of the character walking offscreen; Primordia does not have that.  To be fair, it -does- have a map system for quick travel.\n\nFinally, there is what is known as adventure-game-logic and Primordia is rife with it.  If you're unfamiliar with the term, it is a criticism of classic adventure game puzzle solutions and how they often make little logical sense.  For example, if you needed to sharpen a pencil, logic would dictate you find a pencil sharpener, but older adventure games were known for instead making you combine a stick with a piece of glass and some tape in order to whittle the pencil... while you stand in front of a pencil sharpener.  While the puzzles in Primordia aren't quite so asinine, two extremely dense puzzles spring to mind that are just bad ideas.  Like older adventure games, you could totally sit there and work it out and feel that ego boost, but I find it hard to believe that most players won't be looking for a walkthrough when they encounter them.  That being said, most of the game is paced out well so long as you can get your head into that mindframe of the 90s and just tough it out.\n\nAll in all, Primordia is an accomplished title and a lot of love went into it, especially in the art department.  For a game entirely populated by artificial beings, there is a sort of haunting organic decay that pierces almost every piece of art in the game.  Similarly, the voice direction is quite good and despite Crispin - your sidekick floaty robot buddy - sounding a hell of a lot like Otacon from Metal Gear Solid (it doesn't fit, believe me), every one of the actors gets what the director is trying to accomplish and paints a beautiful, if desolate, piece of work.\n\nBy all accounts, I did not enjoy (but did not dislike) Primordia particularly because I found a lot of the puzzles to be purposely obtuse and the story was not one that resonated with me.  However, that does not make this a bad game and so I cannot possibly give it a thumbs down.  For some people, the story is a mindblowing, harrowing look at the nature of existence, life, its foundations, and its possible future.  It is a fascinating perspective, to be sure, but I was left unsatisfied.\n\nThus, if you're looking for a new PNC game, there's no reason to steer clear from this one.  What I present above are not detractions, but warnings.  PNC veterans will not bat an eye at anything that goes on in this game, but fans of modern PNC games might find a lot of things in Primordia to be frustrating.  Stick with it and it mostly rewards you - just remember that it's more about the journey than the destination in this one.","May 4, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The writer namedrops loads of great novels and other games and stories as inspirations that helped shape this game, which only makes it the more sad that this game is only "not bad."

It's about "Horatio Nullbuilt", a somewhat stoic and secretive humanoid robot living alone in some long-stranded organic-looking airship in the middle of some barren brown desert. Humans are long gone, only machines remain, some worship them - or their legacy - in a secluded and lonesome manner as Horatio does. He has a self-built low-grade flying companion robot, "Crispin Horatiobuilt", who is an obvious sidekick, who keeps refering to himself as that and who is supposed to be a constant contrast to his builder for he is not as nearly withdrawn as him but more humorous, even on a meta-like level for example when he comments your futile efforts to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\n\nThere are more interesting characters to see. All kinds of machines who inhabit the few remaining places in the world. Be it a bomb from some long-past war that never detonated and which is worshipped for it is a creation of man, the remains of colossal titan robots buried deep within the desert or old human cities maintained by robots just enough not to collapse totally.\n\nPrimorida is a middle-scaled adventure for what I can tell. It has an interesting story, great characters, powerful voice acting (every character is voiced - and those robots who cannot talk bleep around in their own manner) and a significant amount of puzzling too. If I remember right I had to look up a walkthrough a few times, though I guess I was just blind on one eye for the solutions seemed reasonable afterwards. There are several endings, they all seem fitting and interesting in their way, and while the decision which you will see is made very lately in the game it is still somewhat relevant what you do mid-game.\n\nThere is a significant amount of lore background. You will meet characters who share their stories and views on the world. You will learn more about them, their motivations and failures. There is a robot society that kinda imitates human society. It has it's own leadership and entities. However barely anything about is perfect. It is in demise, and Horatio is trying to find his way through. He is connected to the world around him more than he admits, and getting to know him better was done very well I think, from robots remembering him to data logs hidden within the places he visits. The art is nice, there are some great dark or soothing music tunes, everything seemed crafted together well and I thought I was satisfied with all aspects of the game even though it has been a long while since I've played it. Definitely the best adventure from Wadjet Eye Games I've played thus far.","July 7, 2014","true","34.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/227000/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","This game is a point and click adventure set in a post-apocalpytic world where all humans are (presumably) dead.  Although I haven't really read books or played other games on this topic, I think it does a pretty good take on the setting, enough so to spark some creative interest of my own.  The characters and full-game voicework are for the most part fairly well done but dialogue kind of falls flat in a few places, mostly because of the script writing and not because of the voice actors.  The story is fairly cohesive and events therein are weighty and interesting, but in a few places I feel like the scenes were not given -enough- weight.  This is especially true of all the alternate endings and post-game cinematics, which although included to give the player some logical options, needed a bit more fleshing out.  It is also interesting to point out, it is impossible to game over although some decisions can change your endings.\n\nThe visual aesthetic of the game is quite nice, as is the music.  While pleasant to listen to and not annoying in any way, none of the tunes were especially catchy or easily memorable, and in a few of the dramatic scenes a stronger musical touch would have gone a long way.  Sound effects are unfortunately fairly weak, lacking thematic when operating devices and having little oomph when explosions occur, and in some places the game seems bugged and plays no sound effect at all.  The voice work has a nice robotic emulation added, although some characters seem to exhibit multiple variances in recording quality or style that doesn't seem to be a character quirk.\n\nPerformance-wise the game runs fine.  Although it resizes itself and forces fullscreen (thus making dual-monitor setups a little wonky), the resolution is not a complaint.  I never had pathing issues or pixel-hunts (just me being blind).  The game interface is functional and unobtrusive, as well as autosaving.  There are some included commentaries as well in the options menu.\n\nAll in all, I really did enjoy the game despite some of its flaws.  Its not very expensive, and it's about 7 hours of gameplay for one playthrough, with low replayability.  The setting is done very nicely and the story is good, what's there to complain about is mostly some rough edges and needed spitshining.  It doesn't ruin the game at all.  I'd say pick it up.","November 27, 2013","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It will probably be a rewarding experience if you are willing to approach it charitably. However, there are better games of this kind to play first (Gemini Rue, the Blackwell series and so on).\n\nPros: A very well crafted and engaging universe, with it's own history and mythology. Some excellent puzzle design in parts. A haunting atmosphere facilitated by a decent soundtrack (probably inspired by Vangelis' Blade Runner music). Fans of Beneath a Steel Sky will find much to like here.\n\nCons: Impossible to enjoy without a walkthrough on hand to get over the occasional obtuse puzzle solution. Could have done with more blind testing to deal with this, or a more robust hint system. Some of the voice acting feels a little innappropriate in tone - the sidekick character in particular.","February 16, 2014","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Make your puzzles actually make sense. Tell the player when the path of a mostly linear game is going to diverge. Better yet, auto-save right before that divergence. Allow the player to be the hero at the end. Choosing "I'll never join you!" should not end with a crap series of still screens and the player losing to the big bad.\n\nConstructive advice to people who play it: Use a walkthrough.

Unlike Machinarium, it is a very dark and gritty setting.  While that fits the game very well, it makes the artwork quite dull and dreary, amplified by the very low resolution the game runs at.  The story, however, makes good use of the setting and is well-written and even includes multiple endings, but that unfortunately is the extent of the the game that I enjoyed.\n\nPrimordia is the best example I have run into of a modern adventure game succumbing to the classic adventure game failing of very confusing and obtuse puzzles.  If you don't already need a guide to complete the story, and you probably will, trying to complete the optional achievements is even worse, essentially necessitating the use of a guide.\n\nIt's hard for me to recommend Primordia when there's so many better adventure games to choose from.","February 24, 2014","false","7.0"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","4"

Despite the unique story, amazing voice acting, and fun universe it all took a back seat to the puzzle aspect of the game.\n\nI'm no stranger to adventure games.  I've always been a fan of these types of games but Primordia simply doesn't do it for me.  I found the puzzles to be frustrating and counter intuitive.\n\nPart way through the game I ran into a game breaking bug that caused it to be impossible to continue without a guide.  After an hour of rubbing things on other things and clicking on every pixel I did the unthinkable and went to a guide only to find out I've run into a somewhat common glitch.  On this Steam forum I see a post from one of the writers/designers for the game say "Sigh. If we ever do another patch, I'll make sure it gets fixed."  This is my ulitmate woe with the indy developer.  I pay for the game and I would hope that known bugs would be fixed.  I don't like to hear "IF we ever do another patch."  A bug in an adventure game isn't like most other games.  You don't always know there is a problem.  You just keep trying to solve the puzzle till you give up or turn to a guide.  For me that ruined half the experience.  Now every time I get stuck I wonder if I'm wasting my time because of another bug or did I forget to pick up a cup of coffee three screens back.\n\nTLDR:  If you want the game then get it for the story and the art and not the puzzles.","September 22, 2014","false","9.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","2"

The story is set in a sci-fi world, where all humans have died and only robots remain. Even though the game has an interesting setting, the story was kinda dull.\n\nGraphics-wise the game looks like the classic point-and-click adventures of the 90's. The world looked interesting with its post-apocalyptic look, but often the graphics were quite low-res, which is unfortunate.\n\nMusic was pretty nice although I didn't pay much attention to it. However, I thought the voice acting was pretty bad even though most reviews online say it's great. The voices didn't seem to fit the characters, which made me dislike some of them. Especially the voice of the droid companion was kinda annoying.\n\nThe puzzles were kinda hard, because they weren't very logical and sometimes required you to backtrack to a previous area to get an item that wasn't available there before. It would have been fine, if you had to use a certain item to get that other item i.e. the item was there, but you couldn't get it yet. The "appearance" of the needed item wasn't indicated in any way. So basically the puzzle design was quite bad.\n\nOverall it's an average point-and-click adventure that suffers from bad puzzle design and a dull story.","December 4, 2013","false","7.3"," 8 of 29 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","8","29","0","0"

The puzzles generally make sense, the story's interesting enough to keep your attention and it's got Abe Goldfarb in it. A few gripes: There are some bits where it's not clear that you can travel further to the side of particular scenes (which stumped me for a while), and there are some items you need to pick up that are pretty hard to see, but the worst is that there are some things you can fail to do (or do incorrectly) that will lock you out of some of the content. But those are pretty minor. Even if you do miss the optional bits, you still get most of it and it's impossible to get stuck in an unwinnable state.

The simple graphics are still beautifully rendered, and the characters you meet are ones who will climb inside your head, and stay for the long haul. With a cast of incredibly well realized and acted robots, the world doesn't just invite you in; it sucks you down, and makes you a part of it. Things in this game will be thought about days, weeks later.

The story is Great and told extremely well. the art style is very appealing combining art nouveau and cyberpunk proves a valid design concept, the resolution ould be a tad bit higher tho and animations are a bit of a let down but that's a flaw of many games in the genre.\nGameplay is fluid, controlls and leveldesign are sensible, avoiding frustration. Riddles range from realtively easy tasks to complex and hard enigmas, without lowering to the level of odd/alien/generic minigames or resulting in daylong meditations on what to do. Unlike most P&Cs with inventory, Primordias items are neither randomly taken from the environment(aka taking the banana instead of the wench) nor require absurd combinations, most "crating" tasks are sensible.\nThe Help function is a bit wonky, it's hints range from being very specific to being nomore than a slight nudge in the right direction and there are no "advice levels" or "search functions". there is no hotspot highlighter, which may be seen both ways. You will have to think a bit to get this game done but it's very well solvable without any outside help** or random clicking.\nIt's also fully*** voiced, and quite good if I may add.\n\nPs: Unniic, Genius!\n\n*Probably THE best if you dismiss myst 4 as not a point and click game\n**I required it once, when I was standing infront of the hotspot. The hotspot was even named "crystal"   -.-\n***The is one spot(info booth) where I would have liked an additional voiceover, something Myst 4 did: voice all written text.\n","November 13, 2013","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I first discovered the studio with Gemini Rue and this is what i believe make their trademark: Point n' Click adventure games written with talent, involving dark/noire universes, with great dialogues and cynical humor. The characters are great with superb voiceacting. The graphics take it back to old school 2D art, which i am very fond of. It gives a very classic look, but remain very serious on the plot, twists or endings. This one has many, by the way. I had fun discovering them all.\n\nSome of the criticisms i could think of is, for exemple, a couple of particular scenes or plot resolutions going too fast or being technically rushed (but they are very rare, though) and also the game being very short. Still, at the end, i enjoyed a great story with very original characters. I really wish for the sequel "Fallen" they might produce later on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Babobeebo/recommended/227000/","Babobeebo","Babo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Babobeebo/","349 products in account","Primordia is a well done point and click adventure game, but those new to the genre may find it frustrating and inconsistent.\n\nPoint and click adventure games depend on their characters and setting, and Primordia delivers in both. The NPC robots who inhabit the world are all distinctive and have personality, but the real centrepieces are the two main characters. Horatio, the playable protagonist, plays the straight man to Crispin, his robot sidekick who I personally found kind of annoying. However, Crispin's sarcasm and jokes do a lot to lighten the mood established by the setting. Primordia takes place in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited entirely by robots. As a crucial and interesting element of this world, some of the robots worship humanity, who they view as their creators and the originators of the world. The world itself is interesting to look at and there are some really striking setpieces in several of the stages. I won't really discuss the story, but I will say that the "good" ending resolves much more than any of the other ones. Though you have to be careful as there are a couple decisions in the game that can lock you out of getting what seems to be the only ending that gives you some sense of closure.\n\nThe graphics are done in a retro, psuedo-16 bit style that can occasionally make it difficult to determine which objects are in the background and which are interactive objects. Furthermore, my biggest problem with the game comes when you try to use these objects. Several times in the game you have to use Crispin to retrieve objects that are out of reach but the things he can do and the types of objects he can get aren't consistent. Sometimes he can bump things off ledges but other times he can't, sometimes he can use a keypad and other times he can't, sometimes he can fly into a pipe and get something and other times he can't. What it boils down to is trying everything you can and relying on trial and error to solve several puzzles as things that worked last time don't now for mainly arbitrary reasons.\n\nOverall, Primordia is an interesting, well-fleshed out point and click adventure game that occasionally doesn't follow it's own rules. But if you can get past hearing "I don't think that will work" several dozen times you'll find a fascinating world filled with a host of unique characters.","November 25, 2013","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even to where at one moment I stopped and found myself wishing it was a movie instead. It's a sarcastic drama, that deals with heavy topics, causing you to stop, think and problem solve. But also holds on to a clever side that lightens the mood and feels at home within the tale. 10/10.","May 29, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definetly recommended for everyone who love point and click adventure games. :) Its quite hard as there are little hints, but the puzzles are made so that it makes sense. Unlike other games who have puzzles that are like, Combine spoon with fork to make a flame thrower.\n\nThe story is excellent, and its filled with mystery, and the best part? Most of it gets explained! The universe it takes place in is just awesome. There are multiple endings aswell, and even characters you can save. So it has quite a bunch of replay value aswell, and all that for the low price of 10 dollars. :) It really is quite worth its money!","December 27, 2012","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will find yourself searching for pixels, but you will also find yourself searching for clues within the dialogue.\nFor the duration of the game, they kept the motif of "a mechanical world" to its fullest: with religion, culture, social echelons and political power born out of machine-esque beaurocracy.\n\nSince I am a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I do not think Primordia is worth 10$, I played it twice-thrice, and I found it to be a pretty short experience -- especially the ending, which felt like it came too soon. The middle section of the game is also burdened with swapping items for other items endlessly, which felt like a chore.\n\nOverall, I got it when it was on discount, and I encourage you to do the same.","March 17, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worse, when I found the numbers needed to solve a puzzle, I wondered how the writers even arrived at that solution.  Evidently, I cannot math.  (Thankfully, though, plenty of other puzzles are subtle yet logical, and a pleasure to work out.)  Some of the dialogue here is pretty cornball, clashing with the dreary dystopian setting, but then again I suppose that fits with the tradition of this style of game.  Beyond these issues, Primordia enjoys an aesthetic drawing from Giger, Moebius, Dune, and probably a bit of Machinarium and/or Beneath a Steel Sky, with music that recalls Blade Runner and Kaiba.  The scope of the story and its setting suggests far more than the ground you actually cover, but just that it seems so sprawling is wonderful.  Primordia feels like a labor of love.","December 25, 2012","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
