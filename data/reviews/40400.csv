We have captured 12 combined planets, and we are doing amazingly, when we find the husk of an ancient ship.\nIt calls to us, and asks us to repair it.\nWe start repairing it with everything we had.\n10 minutes later, it gets fixed, and we get a ship called the 'Exodian Blade.'\nThe Blade shoots a laser that instakills most ships in its path. However, it is super, super slow.\nWe become greedy, and we start capturing planets, with the Blade singlehandley defeating everything on it.\n\nBut when one of my scientists conducts a survey and finds a strange subspace signal, the AI gets mad, and launches a full scale assault.\n\nEven with the Exodian Blade, we couldn't defend forever.\n\nWe had lost all but 2 of our planets; only our capital and a far-off isolated colony remained.\nWe had repositioned the 300 ships left from our 3000 ship fleet at the capital.\nWhen suddenly, my friend completes a nuke.\nHe had been building it all game.\n\nWe use the nuke, completely destroying every ship and planet except for one AI's home and our captial.\nWe track down the AI home, and send the Exodian Blade there.\n\nMeanwhile, a devourer golem appears, which slowly moves and instakills any ships next it, at my capital.\n\nFast forward, I had kited the golem away, and the Blade arrived at the AI home.\nWe were surprised to see that there were only 300 ships there. Nothing that we can't handle.\n\nThen we realize that we needed to destroy 13 different shield generators around the planet that protected the AI core.\n\n"We can do that! We have the most overpowered ship in the game! We can just instakill them all," we all exclaimed.\n\n"The most overpowered ship in the game" looked like crap to what came in next.\n\nA exogalactic wormhole appears, and through it come 3000 different max level ships, ships with missiles, ships with integrated shields, ships we have never evever seen before.\n\nIt took a minute for the Exodian Blade, with 200 million hitpoints, to die.\n\nWe hadn't destroyed a single thing on the AI home planet.\n\nWe had lost on difficulty 'very easy.'\n\nI cant even imagine what the highest difficulty level is like.\n\nThis game is the only game that can make you go from amazing to crap so quickly, and still be fun.\nThis game is the only game that makes losing fun.\nThis game is the spawn of Satan.\nBut it might have well been a gift from heaven.","June 16, 2015","true","35.6"," 379 of 384 people (99%) found this review helpful 186 people found this review funny","99","379","384","186","3"

The learning curve is extremely steep, which means you will probably only lose for the first few dozen hours of playing - unless you choose one of the very easy difficulties.\n\nThe main problem most people will have is the completely different playstyle. Yes, it is an RTS, it looks and even plays as a classic RTS, yet when you go out from your home planet lasers blazing, burning and capturing new resources, you will lose. Always. How discouraging, right?\n\nThe reason to this is asymetry. Your opponent does not share your options. He does not build, he has everything. You on the other hand have but a single planet. Why not crush you in an instant? Cause he doesn't care, you're not important enough to be crushed. However if you blow up a few planets of his.. he might as well decide it's time for the human remnant to die.\n\nAll this said, the game *punishes* you for capturing important assets - planets, technology, etc. Each time you do such an action, the ai gets more aware of your "threat", which will mean stronger and more frequent attacks. From now till the end of game.\n\nIn conlcusion, there seems to be two games hidden under this title:\nFirst, a guerilla war, in which the player gathers strength and tries to avoid antagonizing the enemy too much in fear of brutal retaliation.\nSecond, the glorious moment when the carefully prepared guerilla finally decides to go on par with the ai and fight a full on war - no more hiding.\n\nReplayability: High, assuming you don't mind defeat. There are plenty of ai structures, and only some of them are used on each map. Throughout the expansions, a lot more has arrived to make the game entertaining and keep the player busy.\n\nMultiplayer: Brilliant. The player slots can be changed on the fly by the game host. Playing a single player game and having a friend who wants to join? No problem, open a slot for him, give him a planet and you're playing within seconds. He's leaving again? No big deal, just close his slot, grab his units and go on with your game.\n\nYou probably don't want to play this if:\n- You dislike frequent losing\n- You dislike slow-paced games\n- You dislike games with a steep learning curve\n- You dislike constantly analysing the situation and like to just order your units to go and pillage instead.\n\nYou probably want to try this if:\n- You like complicated strategy games\n- You like analysing the strategic situation a lot\n- You like slow-paced strategy games, in which fortifications actually work\n- You are a hard-core strategy game player and like a challenge\n- You like dwarf fortress and space strategy games","February 4, 2015","true","262.9"," 212 of 216 people (98%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","98","212","216","20","0"

To borrow a quote from Firefly:\n"Live with a man 40 years. Share his house, his meals. Speak on every subject. Then tie him up, and hold him over the volcano's edge. And on that day, you will finally meet the man."\nAI War lets you meet yourself. Some games you play until you can win, then you get bored. AI War is different. At difficulty 7 or below it's still challenging, easy to stumble on the long road to victory and not a sure thing. It'll take a while but you'll have a satisfying victory. But you won't stop there, once you can win the game then you'll feel free to turn up the heat. Walking through the labyrinth of options until, quite quickly, you find yourself standing on the volcano's edge, bound and tied by your own hands. But when you find yourself there it'll be with a smile on your face, saying quite happily: "Oh no! Oh no! Oh dear... I'm dead." And if you do manage to win at difficulty 10, it's a bug. Report it on the Arcen games forums... with pride.\n\nAlso, it has co-op multiplayer. So you can tie your friends up and hold them over the volcano's edge... though you'll probably both be a little singed. (Fighting Scorched Earth AI's and... Mimes! NB: Scorched earth destroys planets rather than letting you take control, never set both AI types to that if you want to win. Mimes mimic the ships you used against it, you'll think... “So what happens if I use...” and the answer: You die.)\n\nLastly, the developers are kind, polite and extraordinarily hard working. The game has evolved with constant developments for year after year after year. They read people's after action reports, watch the lets plays, answer questions on the forums and are just plain nice. Not a dull nice, but a sweet, genuine, sharp and creative nice... rather like shaving a birthday cake into a beard. Or sneaking into the office to digitise old files to save you time.\n\nThey've got a touch of magic, love and creativity that I want to watch, and I hope that other people will have a chance to see it too. So yeah, it's just a game, the graphics are a little dated and the learning curve is a little steep... it isn't really magic and it doesn't grant any wishes. But I like it. I'm glad I bought it. I hope you'll set aside a few hours and give it a solid try. Then some more hours when you drag a friend to play a co-op game.","August 15, 2014","true","112.3"," 260 of 280 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","260","280","14","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/40400/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","For me, it’s a rare thing indeed for a game to move from total obscurity to a fixed place on my hard drive in the course of a handful of days.  Admittedly, I was less-than-enthused as I first started playing this little gem from Arcen Games. I was thoroughly prepared to slog through yet another space-based RTS, and be on way to bigger and better titles. Then, slowly, I began uncovering a depth of play that I just wasn’t expecting in a freshman game from a tiny indie studio. After a few more hours, I realized that I was not only having a blast with my initial runs through the game, I was planning many additional excursions even after my review was written. Although not for the faint of heart, AI Wars: Fleet Command is a surprising, delightful, and thoroughly engrossing RTS title.\n\nAI Wars is just brimming with innovative twists on the 4X-style RTS. First up: regardless of the number of players, from the solo outing to an eight-player mash-up, AI Wars is always Human vs. AI. At first blush, this may sound like a Bad Thing, but it works quite well. Due to this co-op only setting, Arcen dodged a huge problem with many RTS games: the need for balancing several different factions.\n\nNext up is the AI itself. In a very cool take on enemy behavior, the AI advances in difficulty and aggressiveness in direct proportion to the amount of territory the human teams take. Destroying key AI structures increases the “AI Progress” value, meaning a greater buildup of enemy forces, and a greater willingness for them to be used. The AIs themselves can be set from several different flavors at the start of a game, giving players the chance to face turtling AI, highly aggressive ones, tech-mad researchers, or some combination of the mix. Just one little change in AI setting makes for a very different game.\n\nSpeaking of game setup, there are scads of options to choose from at the outset. Galaxy size and planet distribution choices are endless, with millions of possible combinations (and the ability to preserve the random seed for those who want to re-try a favorite map). AI style and aggressiveness, as mentioned above, greatly changes the challenge level of the game. In addition, there are several choices about player tech level, bonus units, and other small flavor changes.\n\nThe scope of AI Wars is staggering. Played over a series of planetary gravity wells connected by jump points, a typical game can have dozens of active battlefronts with literally thousands upon thousands of ships slugging it out. Thankfully, the control scheme is more than capable of handling the hordes. With just a few clicks, entire sweeping fleets can be sent across the galaxy. Typical RTS necessities, such as tech upgrades, resource management, and unit building, are likewise streamlined to allow players to spend much more time in big-picture decisions. The tech tree itself is rather small compared to other games of this type, but it fits well with the flow nonetheless.\n\nThe strategy for playing AI Wars is something truly unique. Due to the AI Progress aspect, it’s often not in players’ best interest to completely take over every planet. Those that take that approach will soon find themselves swamped with enemy forces, since the AI doesn’t have to play by the same resource-limited rules that the players do. Careful scouting of neighboring systems, following by surgical strikes and opportunistic lunges is the name of the game. Because of this, players are often spreading out across the galaxy in a piecemeal fashion, leaving enemy forces interspersed between the growing empire. Thus, players need to find that perfect balance between careful defensive turtling and selective offense.  Adding additional human teammates increases the difficulty proportionally, so the challenge doesn’t fade with the increased number of allies.\n\nAI Wars looks good, although I did take a little while to warm up to the almost old-school style. The ability to quickly zoom in and out over massive battlefields is impressive, as is the ability for the game to visually keep everything straight. I found the background music to also be surprisingly good, since it’s often something I either just overlook or soon disable in this sort of game. The controls are solid, although they did seem just a little clunky at first. After a bit of time, however, I soon had everything flowing smoothly in my quest for human dominance.\n\nAll told, AI Wars: Fleet Command is bound to be a delight to any fan of the heavier strategy titles. It’s an absolute bargain as well, and this title has the rumblings of a very strong, even if not terribly large, community support. I was pleasantly surprised by just about everything I saw in this game, and I would heartily suggest this for those wanting a meaty, unique galactic RTS romp. Although not for the faint of heart (or even the casual strategy gamer), AI Wars: Fleet Command is a surprising, delightful, and thoroughly engrossing RTS title.","November 9, 2015","true","42.6"," 134 of 139 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","134","139","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Audie_Murphy/recommended/40400/","Audie_Murphy","AudieMurphy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Audie_Murphy/","284 products in account","This game is a rare gem, the type of game that only comes out of a small studio.\n\nNo other title I've played in the last several years has offered this kind of tactical depth, but to say it's just a great strategy game would be doing it an injustice.  It's also a game that, despite its rather basic 2D graphics and rudimentary sound, truly captures the essence of the universe it portrays.\n\nIt's a dark, cold universe where humanity has been flung to the four winds, and is pursued by a ruthless alien AI hive across the galaxy as it fights, vainly, for its survival.  It evokes the imagery and sense of encroaching dread of Ender's Game as it puts you in charge of organizing mankind's last stand - a suicidal breakout and attack directly against the AI homeworlds.\n\nTo get there, you'll have to cut a swath through AI controlled worlds, each with layered defenses, guard posts, mobile fortresses and a plethora of other tools at it's disposal to remind you that they are the masters of this domain, and make your beachhead a costly failure.  And even if your beachhead is successful, you will quickly learn that you have but stumbled into the lion's den.\n\nEach tactical victory comes with a price that is higher than the sum of all the troops that fell in achieving it - the closer you get to the AI homeworlds, the more viciously, effectively, and stubbornly it will fight.  Well before you get within stone's throw of their homeworlds, the AI will begin to recognize you as a real and growing threat, and it will respond appropriately.\n\nBy appropriately, I mean it will attempt to destroy you using everything in its near-infinite disposal.  If you expand zealously, like the scourge it believes humanity to be, it will crush you mercilessly without batting an eye.  From star systems and galaxies near and far, it will draw from the hive and send the combined weight of a thousand navies against you.  You cannot win this war traditionally.  You must wage it like a guerrilla campaign, striking hard and fast deep in enemy territory at specific, high value targets, and hoping to escape with your remaining forces back into the night.  You must attrition down dug in positions carefully, lest you give away your true presence and tip your hand.  It is a war that demands long-term strategic thinking, tempered aggression, the careful use of ruse and concealment, and a sixth sense of when your foe is strong and when he is weak.  It requires you to revise your tactics and force compositions constantly, as the AI will adapt to your strategies quickly.  Like using hordes of cheap, fast, throwaway ships to attrition down the enemy?  Well, right now the Ai is building a stealth smart bombing fleet that will be able to annihilate your blob before it can even react.  Like bunkering up and covering your inlet wormholes with shields and hordes of turrets?  The AI just hacked your shield and turrets with the hacker drones right on the other side of the wormhole you havent scouted lately, and not only have they assembled a strike force just on the other side, theyre now making a beachhead into your territory, using your shield and turrets for cover.  That system, well behind the front, that's been quiet as a ghost for the last hour?  As we speak there are AI stealth drones surveying its defenses, helping to paint a picture of precisely how much force and what tools will be needed to push you out of system and split a gap in your supply lines.  Steamrolling the AI with your superfleet, sitting off the enemy's sector, waiting for orders to jump?  It knows you're there.  It's just waiting for you to commit, to jump into system, so it can spring on the black hole generators so you cannot escape.  It will hit you with tractor beams, smart bombs, and long-range standoff fleets that outrange your crippled battleships.  And then, as you helplessly watch your fleet picked apart, that massed invasion fleet that has been assembling just outside your territory gets the go order, and before long you are looking at a massed attack all along the front as the AI carries out probing attacks at your industrial centers - just as you are at your weakest.  It only wanted you to think it was weak, to draw you into a fight on favorable terms, on ground where the tables were turned.  It wanted you to commit the bulk of your forces to suicidal action, as it planned to pin your fleet down, envelop your industrial base, and destroy you.\n\nThe AI is THAT good.  And that's on one of the more modest difficulty settings.   On the higher settings, it goes from being a somewhat difficult campaign into a brutal, oft-unwinnable fight for survival.  You have to employ the same cunning tactics as the AI to stand a chance.  It amazes me that this was a two-man project; the gentleman who wrote the AI script for this should be working for the NSA skunkworks.\n\nThis game has been out for a while, and has six or so expansions now; if it sounds like the kind of title you're interested in, I'd reccommend the bundle.  The expansions offer a number of new tools, ships, modifications, and functionalities to the game.\n\nIt's not the prettiest game to behold, but the gameplay is awesome, the AI is beyond amazing, and the replayability is tremendous.  One of the best PC purchases I've ever made.","September 27, 2014","true","10.3"," 119 of 124 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","119","124","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/40400/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Be warned - this game can get insane.\n\nAs the title suggests this game is a fleet (unit) management game, mixed in with a x4 type of experience. The scale of the game opens up suddenly and can get to the point where it just seems overwhelming, however if you stay with it and learn how it works you'll find a decent game.\n\nI'd recommend taking this game slowly, even if the AI doesn't really want you to. You will die several times as you discover the past ways to link units together and arrange your resource collection and defending units to be most effective - that's just the nature of the game. As such this isn't really the ideal game for a beginner to x4 to step in, yet it might just be one of the most rewarding.\nThe depth in potential is deep and the 3 expansion packs have been done in the 'right way' adding more content to the game and improving gameplay. Thankfully the developers regularly patch AI War: Fleet Command too, which would suggest they're aware of their community, which for me is a major part of buying into a game.\n\nI know some people aren't too keen on AI War due to the rather dated UI and graphics, but I think that's part of the charm. The lack of flashy graphics allows for resources and time to have been spent on the complex nature of the game's actual 'AI'. So, considering the game is called 'AI War', it's almost essential that the game itself has a top level AI behind the scenes making all of this work.\nAt times this can feel like the enemy are being hyper aggressive, but in truth they're learning about you the player. They're not just reacting to whatever race you play, they learn how you use that race and how you setup. Again this might not be ideal for a new comer, however it can help too, as sometimes they'll go 'easy' on you... for a little bit.\n\nOverall AI War: Fleet Command is a very indepth game that doesn't seem to get much fanfare amonst the Steam Community. If you're a fan of x4 games then this is the game for you. If you can look past the very basic graphics there is a very deep experience waiting for you, perhaps one of the best experiences you'll ever have.\nThe added bonus is that this game is often VERY cheap on Steam during the Steam sales.","November 27, 2013","true","8.7"," 125 of 133 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","125","133","0","0"

It is without a doubt my favorite game on Steam.  Just look at how many hours I've played, that's got to say something (like I should go get a life).  Seriously though, the game is great.  I have it, and I've bought about 6 other copies of the game for my friends because I believe in this one so much.  Yes, I know the graphics seem backwards and uninspiring, but you'll learn as you play this game that it's actually better this way.  Look past the graphics and into the mind of a monsterous AI.\n\nThis game is going to have a VERY steep learning curve at first.  Once you get through the basic commands on how to move ships around, set up build queues, and construct your fleet, the game really opens up to you.  You're going to find that this game will challenge your strategic and tactical thinking.  If you think you're good at RTS games, this will push you to the limit.  Do you think there isn't an RTS that can challenge you anymore?  This one can and will.  Are you just plain crazy, play it on the max dificulty, it's a bug if you can beat it.\n\nThere are a ton of units for this game, and I strongly recommend getting all the DLC.  With the whole set you've got nearly unlimited different kinds of games.  You'll find unit combinations that will fit your play style no matter what style that happens to be.\n\nThe AI is one of the most interesting things in this game.  It will surprise you countless times.  Just when you think you've figure it out, it'll show you a new trick.  Look how much I've play this, it's still showing me surprises.  The game still have times when it feels fresh to me.  It's amazing that you can dive so deeply into a game and still find things.\n\nI'll shut up now and let you buy this game.

Great, you'll like AI War.  It's asymmetric, about halfway between skirmish and campaign modes, and it doesn't try to act like a real human.\n\nDo you like really long RTS matches, but don't like that they usually turn one-sided after the first half an hour?  Great, you'll like AI War, it stays tense and balanced for the entire 5-20 hour struggle.\n\nDo you like HARD games?  Play AI War.  The difficulty levels you can select start low but go up to truly legendary heights.\n\nDo you like constant battle?  AI War may not be for you.  Yes it's real-time, but you will spend a fair amount of time thinking and plotting and planning.  Anxiously.\n\nDo you like games that you can finish in one sitting?  Don't play AI War.  Just don't.\n\nDo you like an easy, relaxed gameplay experience?  Probably don't play AI War.  You can set the difficulty low, but it's boring...and the difficulty goes up as time goes on, not down.  Unless you're playing way below your skill level, the endgame is always a brutal nailbiter and if you are careless you can get wiped out.  AI War needs you to think about what you're doing for the whole game.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, and it takes a big time commitment.  If you're sitting on the fence, I'd recommend avoiding it.  There is no "let's sit down for half an hour and see how it is", it will take a lot of time no matter what.  Also, you will absolutely want to sit down and play the tutorial, even though it takes a couple hours.  It's basically just a short version of a full game that walks you through the unique strategies of AI War with kid gloves on.  Playing this game like it was any other RTS is the biggest mistake you can possibly make.\n\nAs for what makes the strategy different?  You have to pick your battles.  The AI is generally not that aggressive, at least not in a planet-by-planet way, but every single time you expand it's like kicking a hornet's nest.  Discretion is the better part of valor, and not just because you risk your current armies:  In this setting, your opponent is much bigger than you, but it also has other interests much bigger than you.  If you stay small and pick your targets carefully, you can keep from drawing too much ire, but if you try to take over the whole galaxy then your enemy will say "oh maybe these humans are a real threat" and stomp the hell out of you.  Don't do that.\n\nAll in all, it's a truly unique entry in the RTS genre.  If the above caveats don't scare you away, give it a shot.  It might not be your favorite game, but it's a truly memorable one, and worth the time commitment to play a few games.","March 4, 2014","true","340.4"," 91 of 95 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","91","95","0","0"

Always treading softly, while carrying the biggest gun (indeed every gun) you can find.\n\nLet's be clear; if you're looking for a game that holds your hand through a linear, scripted campaign, this is not the game for you.\n\nIf you want a game based on systems that will push you to find the most underhand and exploitative responses you can to the challenges it throws at you, look no further.\n\nThis game is stupendously configurable in its setup, which can be somewhat overwhelming when you first start, but makes for an extraordinarily replayable game, even more so with the expansions, rich in choices, threats and options.  If you so choose, you can take a nominally hard setup (two twin-"hard" AI types at high level) and give yourself several "helping hands".  You can choose an easy setup of two easy AI types at a low level and then click every extra challenge on.  And everything is good fun.  Really.  There are even multiple ways to win a game, based on the setup choices you made for each game and the choices you make while playing each game.\n\nAt easier difficulties, you wont find the game too punishing, but as the difficulty levels go up, so do your challenges.  To beat level 9 AIs, you'll need to be exploiting weaknesses mercilessly.  You'll need to be imaginative and ruthless in how you knock out the obstacles in your path.  If you are not willing to min/max your odds and use every cheesy trick you can find, you'll likely find it unbeatable.  And at the maximum difficulty settings...?\n\nThis is a game made by developers that treat "impossible" as a real thing, not just a cool-sounding label.  If you beat level 10 AIs without spamming helpful setup options, this is a bug.  They'll want to know how you did it, they'll congratulate you, and then they'll tweak a few things in a patch so it won't work again.  If you really do want to win on your first playthrough, play at a lower difficulty level.  If you really insist on always winning, don't play at the highest difficulties.  And that's okay because it's still enormously fun at the mid difficulties.  But you'll always find yourself pushing to win on a more difficult map-type.  Against a more challenging AI type.  Against a higher AI level.  With some devious or vicious sub-plot turned on.  With some hellish combination of AI sub-types.  There's always something else to try, there's always something else to lose against.\n\n10/10 - Would doom humanity to an eternity of enslavement by forgetting to rebuild my forcefields  again.

The ships you get to use will be random (although there is a core set and one you pick at the start) and the tech trees are wide enough that in most games you won't get to use anywhere near all of it.  The difficulty paces itself very well, for a beginner starting at recommended difficulties things start off light and raise in tempo, with unexpected bites coming every so often both from the AI's own plans or your mistakes.  As you get experienced you can make the game harder in any number of ways so no matter how skilled you get you can make it a fun challenge.\n\nThe developers maintain awesome forums and listen to the people that play the games and treat their customers right.\n\nReally all I can say is if you're looking at the page for this game and have even the remotest hint of interest, buy it.","December 9, 2013","true","392.1"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","65","68","0","0"

I picked it up in a Humble Bundle quite some time ago, and I dust it off about once a month to kill some spaceships again.\n\nIn AI War you play the commander of a human resistance group. Artificial Intelligence have become sentient, and they have amassed a vast fleet of ships to obliterate humanity. Your job is to destroy the core and end the AI threat. Good luck.\n\nAI War has no real plot, aside from the basic premise I just provided. AI War has no campaign. AI War merely offers you the option to set up a game, play it, and most likely lose. You can set everything from the map type to the difficulty and play-style of the two AI factions, to bonus factions that make the game harder or easier.\n\nMain gameplay consists of building as many space ships as you can, taking them to a planet, destroying the AI, and building a new command centre to claim the planet for your own. Every planet you claim, however, pisses the AI off even more and makes them hit you even harder.\n\nThe graphics are run of the mill. The backgrounds are nice, and the ship models look great, but you rarely see them. You will spend most of the game zoomed out far enough to see all of your units, which become represented by tiny pixel sprites that do not do the artwork justice.\n\nThe soundtrack for the game, however, is amazing. I cannot tell you how many times I have paused the game just to sit and listen, getting lost in the ambiance of the music. I rarely play games with music turned on, but this one almost needs it.\n\nAll in all, this is a highly recommended game. I even recommend purchasing the expansions (which actually add content and change the gameplay).\n\nBut take note, there is no real end to the game. You can finish a map (if you are really lucky), but that just means starting up a new one and trying again. This is a game that, much like a brothel, is really only good for a quick visit every now and then.

I cannot stress how good this AI is!\n-Instead of giving the enemy AI more benifits on harder difficulties, this game insteads actually increases the smarts of it!\n-Well thought-out game mechanics, like massive nukes to destroy a base, or a travel planner for a selected group of units.\n\n*CONS*\n-The Multiplayer matchmaking system is non-existent, meaning you cannot easily find a public server to join. Instead, you or one of your friends has to host it.\n-Graphics are barebones. A little boost to these wouldn't hurt, though I understand that when you have thousands of units onscreen at once it can be a little lagging.\n-Horrible tutorial. It is existent, but when I started the game, the tutorial didn't really help me, thus I had to go the youtube for assistance. This may not apply to everyone, but if you're not a fast learner, you will have to go to youtube or some other website.\n-Steep learning curve.

Building your econemy, your ships (lots of ships; if you say, I'll attack with 400 ships, there are really 500 ships on the map...and you need them), creating your tactics and win against the AI...or lose. Sounds normal? This game has some more stuff than other games...or better, it is doing everything a bit different. It is relativ hard to get into the game. But after one, two, three houres of playing you get it (hotkeys, fight mechanics, etc. ). And than it gets really good.\n\nThe 'story' behind this fighting is, that AI populations have taken the world we know (or better the universe) and the human species has to recover and fight back. Every solarsystem is to capture, because the AI got everything, so you have to fight from the beginning. 'War is not fair' are the introducing words of that game. And that's true. The AI got reinforcement out of nowhere, but that's not a minus for the game, because that's how it works. You get better, the AI too, so get some friends and play it coop, it is much more fun to tell someone how unfair it is, that the AI is sending again 600 bombers to you homeworld ;) and it is impossible to beat the AI alone on higher difficulties.\n\nFor these who don't like micro-strategy, just take everything you have and click on the enemy. They have so many livepoints, that you have to concentrate you fire always on one ship of thair ships, so it's not that important which ship is where, just that it is in combat :). Or you have the option to play as a champion. Than you have no base, just one big ship which gain lvl and better weapons over time, so you have to care about nothing than your 'hero' (a little RPG in strategy).\n\nBut the other are right, be warned: This game is huge. You play normaly over 7 houres on one campain. If you play with friends on bigger maps, it can take over 20h, so be sure to have enougth time.\n\nAnd...If you like soundtracks, buy it! Don't think about the game...this Music is epic, you can listen to it for hours and there are so beautiful songs between (AncientShadows, Cries of Zenith are my favorites ;) ) ...amazing...(with the expensions there are over 5.5h music)\n\nSo if you like space strategy games or really good musik buy that game...and on sale day like now (the holiday sale) it is nearly for free.

When I first purchased AI war, it was on the Arcen Games site and they sent a little email about how they don't believe in DRM, and therefore I could always play using my key, and if I lost my key, simply contact them.\n\nI then purchased this again on steam at a completely reasonable price. I like having my games consolidated in one place and this game was worth it.\n\nI really can't say enough about how good this game is. I doubt even the folks with negative reviews would say absolutely do not buy it. Onto the game:\n\n- great AI that you can tweak any way you like. Arcen even goes so far as to explain why the AI works the way it does and makes a plausible (sci-fi) argument about it.\n- vast array of ships for research\n- a million different galaxies all seeded with their own unique resources\n- Arcen keeps upgrading the game mostly for free, but each expansion is very well priced\n- statistics about each game are very in depth providing great feedback\n\nI've read the negative reviews and the main arguments are graphics and UI. Personally, I'm impressed with the UI. Every single element is customizable. You can change any key, and there's a menu with auto management choices that make things easy for you. There are about 4 keys you can click while mouse clicking to make your ships behave differently and it's simple.\n\nThe graphics are not excellent, but it's a compromise between performance and graphics. This game will work on older systems, there are no glitches, it doesn't require high-end cards, yet it works even during battles with thousands of ships.","November 21, 2014","true","183.6"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","40","44","0","0"

I'm a heavy dwarf fortress player, and tend to favor 2d or isometric games over the new trend for blazing 3d. If you're used to shiny graphics, AI wars will disappoint. Also, it's not a pool with a shallow end. You're either going in deep, or you're probably going to not like it. It has an incredible amount of depth, but requires... lots of real life hours to extract the rewards. I've only beaten one round of it, which took me a real life week and about 20 hours of play time, and that was on 5/5(or easy) difficulty.\n\nMy playtime on steam isn't really a good gauge of how long I've played this, as I bought it direct from arcengames, which came with a steam activation key, but I much prefer the stand alone version that came along with it. On their website, you can also find a demo of this game. https://arcengames.com/ai-war/ I  highly reccomend you play through it before you buy.\n\nThe AI is crafty, but does not cheat. Each difficulty increase gives it new buildings, new strategies, etc. Your goal is to destroy two homeworld planets, one controlled by each AI, who play as a team against you. This game CAN be played with up to 8 human players as a co-op game, but unless you know people in real life who are interested it's kinda hard to match up timezones to play with folks through the internet.\n\nI enjoy the variety of ship types, over twenty I think, and none of them are slightly modified copies of other types. Also, you can make a nuclear bomb so powerful that it destroys the galaxy. How cool is that. As long as it wipes out the AI a split second before it kills you, still counts as a win. :D","July 6, 2015","true","21.7"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","33","34","2","0"

Well.\n\nFirst things, there is a lot to get to grips with at once, so I'd recommend doing the tutorials, then just playing and experimenting. Here's how my first game went:\n\nI build up my starting world, placing turrets and forming a fleet made up of missile frigates, bombers and fighters, the total number at the time was around 150. I staved off an enemy AI attack, which made me confident, and slightly arrogant (I had set the diffculty to less easy, which is between normal and easy). I thought the game would be a push over. I quickly killed and took over two systems, at around the 40 min mark. I had spent time building up a large fleet full of ships, and I think my number must of been between 400-500. I assembled all my seperate fleets, and decided to go for an all out attack on another system. I send the whole fleet in, and within seconds ive lost about 50, due to ion cannons insta killing ships, and the enemies ships swarming over mine. I panic and order a quick retreat. I re-assemble the fleet and make it even stronger than before, and decide to attack another enemy system, assuming it'd be less defended. Upon entering, the AI decided that it had enough of my ♥♥♥♥, and had placed lots of mines around the entrence. I lost 1/4 of ships and about 2/3 of what was left, was crippled. I try and fight, but ion cannons rip apart my ships, and im left with about 50 ships in a matter of seconds. I again call for a retreat, but the AI decided enough was enough. Itfollowed me, and in the space of about a minute and a half, my hours progress had been reduced to 2 fighters and rubble in place of my stations in each ofthe 3 systems.\n\n10/10 would be massacred again.","August 26, 2015","true","9.2"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","97","32","33","23","0"

I was looking forward to it, based on the generally positive reviews and all the Steam "face time" it was getting. Unfortunately, the game didn't grab me. I tried to play it a couple more times to pinpoint what it was I didn't like about the game. Here's a summary:\n\n1) The ship/structure graphics are 2D and don't seem to "fit" the rest of the game. The game has the illusion of 3D with its background starfield, but the ships and structures look like paper cutouts slapped over it. That might not be a dealbreaker, but they don't even rotate when they move. So I guess I'm just not a fan of the art style.\n\n2) The UI is barebones and functional. It's a chore to use the UI, much like learning keywords for a programming language. Once you learn that you can hold down CNTL while right-clicking an empty space after selecting units and those units will auto-patrol, it's cool. But it makes no sense, and is just more stuff I have to remember in order to play. Basically, don't make me work too hard to *play* the game - make me work to *win* it.\n\n3) There are an overwhelming number of ship and structural options and upgrades, and since you make hundreds of ships and engage in blob warfare, it makes me not care about any of them. I can't keep up with what a Mark II frigate's bonuses are - I'm losing 10 ships per second in this battle and they're all various types of ships and the last thing I'm worried about is whether my bombers (wherever they are in the blob) are within range of the strike fighters. Combat is just to maintenance-heavy, unless you go with blob tactics, and in that case what's the point of paying attention to individual ship details/upgrades?\n\nOverall, I think this game is just too complex for the sake of being complex. I think most of the ship variations need to go away, and the mechanics need to be boiled down to a fun and balanced core rules set. Then the UI wouldn't need to be so complicated, and the *fun* complexity could come from what the player can do with the core ships/options available.","August 15, 2014","false","2.8"," 131 of 194 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","131","194","5","7"

The learning curve is rather steep but there are good resources on YouTube to help break the ice. The game seems completely and utterly overwhelming at first but once you sink your teeth into it you will find it quite rewarding. It can be an extremelly challenging game and isn't exactly a casual experience. When you play the game your brain feels fully invested in the task that lies before you. Learning essential hotkeys is key to reduce micromanagement which I find the trickiest part of the game. As you get deeper into the game and play on bigger maps you will need to manage your forces and strategically place them in defensive and offensive positions. I found it difficult to do this and have a tendency to just cluster all my ships in one big wolf pack. Game knowledge and micromanagement are keys to mastering Ai War.\n\nDefinitely an underrated gem and one of the most beautifully made RTS games I've ever played.

I have enjoyed a good few hours off this game, the AI (Where the game focuses it self arround on) is really strong. The game is open to both expirienced and beginning RTS players and with a good mindset can work solo agenst a hard AI duo. The 5 DLC packs add a all new expirience to the game, as example a very own modular capital ship that you can edit to your suitings.

It is not about Conquering and general area control. It is almost exactly the opposite. It's about maximum Efficiency. And it is Hard.\n\nBe prepared to loose the first real game. If you are not used to total surgical strikes and ignoring almost everything around you, prioritizing like hell and cutting out areas which you would like to strike, because something there would be nice to control - you will lose. Because it will become very hard to stop THE AI.\n\nThe game picked me off with a lot of tension. You are not allowed ever to relax your guard. The AI will ruthlessly counter any Unit build and Defense build you specialize in. (dont specialize - just Defend properly... ha - ha.) You relax your guard, you loose your Home Base. You loose your Home Base, you loose the game.\n\nThere are some tower defense elements, as far as i have seen yet, and i have not played by far enough to be able to tell if i simply overlooked some things. But if i played it correctly it is all about surgical strikes and not very much about classical tower defense. Only take what you need. THE AI will retaliate for everything you take. The more you take, the stronger the retaliation strike. It gets harder the closer you come to your goal, exterminating the Home System of the AI (or several AIs) but you will also be obliged to take some systems and make the AI mad at you - because the Home System is protected by Shield generators, and you need to take a planetary system from the AI to destroy the generators there...\n\n\n\nThings you should not be afraid of:\n\nLoosing after 8 hours of playing - by being overwhelmed by a supreme AI strike force\nStruggling with your defenses and getting wiped by a single strike\nLoosing out-of-nowhere, because "you forgot something"...\nA game that gets even harder the closer you get to the Final moment of victory - if you ever reach it\nstumbling across some new evil mechanic the AI throws at you, capable of bringing you into a tight spot\nhaving a game (campaign) against the AI for more then 12 hours\nnot having a PVP mode (a player that would play the AI probably would realize the real thread and simply eradicate it - or be unable to manage the other tasks which the AI has - who knows what other tasks such an AI still has to do?)\nplaying in some kind of "Iron man"-mode - a lost campaign is a lost one. Deal with it. Go for a new one instead.\n\nNothing is more satisfiying then winning the final onslaught - after 14 hours of combat, defense, scouting and deep-striking. You will need the time. It can also go against your ego if you loose the game after 12 hours of combat... You CAN beat the game. If you beat it, you did not turn it hard enough. Make it harder, it becomes more fun and satisfiying.\n\nI had a lot of fun as someone who loves hardcore-games. If you consider yourself a real hardcore-strategican, this game could be a challenge you are looking for. Easy to learn (as basic control and principles), hard to master (beat 2 AIs level 10, without modificators? Seriously as an achievement?

This game is very different as it's the only 4Xgame on the market where it's you (and maybe allies) vs. the AI and the name of the game is.... guerilla warfare.\n\nYes you read that right. You dont just explore, expand, exploit, exterminate in a classical sense. You are not tough. You are nothing. You have been beaten already at the beginning of the game and now the AI wants to finish what they started. In fact the enemy is hell bent on the that last extermination part and typical game starts are such that you have 1 planet and enemy has all the rest. Your fleet? 0 ships and enemy has 4000 with all kinds of goodies to go with it.\n\nBut it's a machine you are fighting against so figuring out where to defend and where to run away is the name of the game.\n\nLearning curve is high. At 4,5 hours i am doing ok (doing easy-games and getting moderately beaten back) but still learning. And i am loving every moment of it.\n\nSo put away those more pompous 4X space games for awhile and take a look at this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/recommended/40400/","AdamMil","Adam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/","240 products in account","I can recommend AI War but not wholeheartedly. Most players, when they buy a game, expect a polished, finished product. AI War is not. Arcen Games keeps hacking on it, changing things around over time. Usually the changes are good, but often they break and unbalance the game. You get to be the guinea pig. Meanwhile, bugs known for years go unfixed. The core design is pretty good now. It's a fun game if you like 4X, space exploration type games. But it's quite a different game from when I started playing eight months ago, when the economy was simplified and the big hacking mechanic was introduced.\n\nThe changes may be good or bad depending on your viewpoint. Even after years it's still changing in big ways, so it's got replayability that other games don't have. But not all the changes are good. They really don't seem to test their changes, which is why they're constantly having to rebalance the game. And not in little ways. They frequently make parts of the game twice as hard or half as hard (or even ten times or one tenth as hard) because they're way out of balance. But it's never balanced and never will be. The game also has no manual, and the information on the wiki site is mostly outdated and therefore wrong so learning the game is trial and error. Even the in-game unit descriptions are sometimes outdated and wrong. That said, they have a new game out now so it's unclear how much attention they'll devote to AI War in the future. I suppose at some point they'll stop updating it, but don't expect them to fix all the bugs first.\n\nAs for the game mechanics themselves, the game is fairly unique among 4X games and that makes it a refreshing choice if you want something different from the tried and true Master of Orion style gameplay. The game advertises itself as having great AI, but it's really not that smart. Rather, the AI plays by completely different rules from you. They don't need resources or research, they can simply spawn thousands of ships at any time, and the number of ships they can have is nearly unlimited. In most games this would be considered cheating, but AI War doesn't pretend that the AI is playing the same game as you. Without the limits that you have, the AI does a great job of providing a challenge.\n\nThe game has tons of replayability given the many different AI personalities, AI plots, minor factions, etc. that you can enable. There are also six expansion packs. Most expansions don't simply add some new units, but provide whole new game mechanics. I don't think anyone could exhaust the replayability that the game has.\n\nThe game is quite engrossing in single player, and multiplayer is even better. The game doesn't have any built-in matchmaking though so you'll have to resort to posting in forums to find other people to play with, unless your friends are into the game. There is no competitive play, only cooperative against the AI. The games aren't quick, though, taking 10-30 hours on average to finish.\n\nI mostly enjoy the game. But it's always buggy, always unbalanced, and therefore always a bit unsatisfying. If you can get past that, the game is good, as long as you don't expect to ever have a polished, finished product. The game has a demo and a decent tutorial, so do give it a try if you're interested.\n\nAlso, Arcen Games is a small, independent development house, and you may want to support them on principle.","August 20, 2014","true","119.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

This game has been called by many people a tower defense of sorts. I would mostly agree but you cant just put it as a tower defense when thats not what it aims to be. This is a real time strategy with some light 4X here and there, well mostly the Expand and Exterminate parts. This game does not feature a diplomacy system because it is always the ai against you beacuse of the plot of the game. Its written in the description of the game on the store page check it out and you will know why the ai is always your enemy.\n\n\n\n\nAlright, so with my almost 400 hours played of this game i have to say this is my favorite game of all time. Just the base game is super amazing and totally worth it. But, then there is the DLC and oh boy does it add alot of stuff to the game!  Also, for you people looking to play Ai War multiplayer take note, there is no matchmaking or such as this is not a game that can be completed in one sitting therefore there are many forums in the "Disscussions" page about people looking for other people to start a game up. And take note that if you want to play multiplayer, you should also own all the DLC becasue alot of people, dont like playing without the DLCs.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, let me get started with the mechanics of the game. When you first start the game, you will see a button called "Tutorial" you should really do it, but if you want to go balls to the walls like me :P and not care about the tutorial, go ahead i actually found it alot more fun to learn it all myself. Anyways, once you have done that click the "start new game". You will see alot of options infront of you, even more so if you have the DLC enabled. Some people would say start with DLC off but i say dont because its better to learn all the mechanics at the same time but it might be alot more to take in the normal. Also, dont be put off about the graphics as some people may say is disgusting to look at, but in reality  UNLESS YOU DELIBERATLY MAKE AN EFFORT TO LOOK AT THE SHIPS  you will never see any graphics becasuse most of the time you will be zoomed out and it then shows icons for your units instead of ship art and such. Im not going to cover the options of setting up your game and such because that is explained in guides for the game. So, once you are ingame i recommend going to the little "ctrls" button and enabling "Auto Build Energy Collector" as it will save you some time and otherwise you might just forget about putting one down which is a waste since you may not need it at the time, but you will forget you dont have one later. And considering there are so many tutorials on strategies and such for this game im not gonna tell you about it and instead tell you NOT to go watch any of those tutorials becasue its more fun discovering what works for yourself.\n\n\n\n\nAll in all ill give this game a 10/10\nI might be biased as ♥♥♥♥ because i love RTS and strategy games but so be it.","December 1, 2015","true","444.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Being the last of humanity in a galaxy where every planet is hostile can get you down very quickly. The AI Progress mechanic makes even trying to progress in the game very scary. There aren't many games where capturing too much stuff can get you into an unwinnable position.\n\nBut then I played it with friends. Even a pair of you is much better than playing solo. As Chesterton wrote, "Two is more than twice one: two is one hundred times one." You can split your attention and work together, using an external tool like Mumble to co-ordinate.

This is the smartest RTS I've ever played. The idea is that you build up your forces slowly over time, only fight when you need to, and most importantly you only take over areas that you decide are of high importance. If you play this game like an ordinary RTS, you will lose every time. No rushing here, folks.\n\nThe interface is also great, though you need a good memory to take advantage of that. Do you want your forces to stay in formation while moving, and them to guard an area? Hold down the right key combination and it shall be done. There's several keys that dictate how your forces can move and what they do when they get there, and you simply hold the key or keys down when you move your forces. Brilliant!\n\nI know some people who were turned off because the graphics aren't amazing, but they're easily good enough for me.

For example, there are moments in the tutorial which state (in summary), "Some aspects of the AI are faked because it's more interesting to play that way."  Ok, fine, but you don't need to tell the player that - a thin veil would have helped me get invested.\n\nHowever, having played for a few hours, I now believe that this is part of the aesthetic.  You are not in space in this game, much as you are not on a battlefield when playing chess.  When you're playing this game, you are purely a human sitting in your chair fighting an AI which doesn't pretend to be "another player like yourself" -- it is a computer program, designed to destroy you, and it will.  It knows what to expect from you, and will therefore not simply overwhelm you because that is an inefficient strategy; it's far more efficient to lure you in and allow your confidence to betray you.\n\nThe final stage of the tutorial is a guided "live fire" scenario, and as of this writing I've failed both times I attempted it.  The first was perhaps because I was moving slowly while trying to learn the mechanics, but on the second try I seriously thought I was on the verge of victory when the AI pirouetted and demolished my entire fleet in minutes.  I can't wait to see what tricks it has up it's sleeve in a real scenario.","December 9, 2014","true","1.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The game's premise is that you or you and other players are set to defend your home planet (and your friends respective home planets) and hopefully wipe out the AI throughout the galaxy.\n\nI havn't beaten the game yet... but the purpose is to wipe out the AI.\n\nThe game starts with a few main ships that allow to build other buildings/space stations or build more units. As any game, there are research centers, power generators, and mine facilities that can be built in certain spaces. This game is huge, and when I mean huge I mean "uhh, which star system was I attacking"? It can be good, or it can be bad depending on whether you can keep up with such large scale games. Doesn't mean its overbearing, just means one must be able to press the "map" button and see what's going on. The way the screen zoom in/out works I think is great, and allows for quick control of what you need to see, do, or build - smooth and quick. I havn't played online but I could imagine this being a great game for a few buddies to go at. Units of course are able to be built and mercenaries can be bought. This game though you'll pump out units by the hundreds and its crazy to see a bunch of ships go at each other. The strategy is though where to send units, and how much... as the AI continuously grows the player has to start thinking where to allocate everything appropriately.\n\nPerhaps one down-side (from an avid space game player perspective) is that the ships don't move when they shoot at one another, they stay still and carry our their attack commands waiting to be hit. So if this bugs you then the game might really get on your nerves.\n\nI like the game for what it's worth and for the sale price I bought it for. The music is also extremely nice to listen to. About time someone brought back some easy-listening classical music.\n\n7.7/10","August 29, 2014","true","2.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Every planet has a really pretty background, but your actual ships and structures are represented mostly by small pixel sprites.\nAt close enough zoom levels, you'll get a glimpse of much more detailed sprites that look great, but very little time will actually be spent at these zoom levels.\nConversely, zoom out too far and the pixel sprites will overlap and become nearly impossible to distinguish. You'll probably spend more time here than at high zoom, but not long enough to really be an issue.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's talk gameplay:\nThis is where the game really shines, though there is definitely a  learning curve. The curve can be mitigated by playing, and paying attention to, the tutorial, but is still undeniable. Much of the curve comes from the seemingly infinite number of options, and indeed I've found myself at a loss of where to go and what to do on multiple occasions. But once you get a feel for the game and start enacting your Master Plan, it's an absolute blast to play. There's a strong sense of pressure from the AI, and battles can be as involved or as automated as you want them to be.\nA common AI tactic I've seen is pushing my fleet into small sections with forcefields, and then taking out the chunks individually. Which is absolutely brilliant, and I've never seen an RTS before where the AI uses actual tactics like that instead of just relying on superhuman reflexes.\nI've only just begun to play, and continue to be amazed by things like this the more time I put in. Getting the game on sale like it is now is a steal, and I couldn't recommend it more if you're looking for a deep and rewarding gameplay experience.","May 29","true","44.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now that I've got the elephant in the room out of the way, AI Wars is a refreshing, unique, and a paragon of everything an RTS should hope to be. I'm not going to dwell too long on all its strengths because the gameplay is extraordinarily solid and I feel there's very little I can say that's more concise or accurate than what others have already said. Just know that it's you or some friends versus an opponent who can crush you at any time: the goal is to accomplish your objectives without drawing too much attention to yourself. A novel core mechanic to an industry over-saturated with Starcraft.\nAmong the game's multitude of positives, I think it's worth to note that it has incredible support from its developers, who continue to release expansions and patches five years (I think) after its release date. In an age where many devs abandon early access titles half way and released half-baked "full games" to fend for themselves, it's good to see one company that clearly opperates by a different set of values.\nBut none of this changes the fact that the game is pug ugly.

It's able to take my hard fought ground that I've acquired over the past 7-8 hrs, intelligently capitalize on one or two risky decisions I made, and wipe me off the map in about five minutes. Seeing that chain reaction of events unfold with literally thousands of ships being brought into play is really neat.  And the greatest part about it is I *knew* what I did wrong, it didn't feel cheap or unfair in any way.  That type of challenge is what immediately makes me fire up another round and try again.\n\nhttp://drfrog.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/ai-war-pocket-reference/\n\nEDIT: While the pacing of the game is very good, I must point out that for me personally, things don't start to settle in until around the 4-5 hr mark.  In the five games that I've played so far, this is where the rubber meets the road and the AI really starts to throw some interesting curve balls.  However, this is probably more due to the AI Progress ranking than any arbitrary progression of time, so I'm sure if I played a bit more aggressively I would face the complex challenges earlier in the campaign.  Which reiterates one of my main likes of the game: how truly flexible and engrossing the AI can be!","September 6, 2014","true","96.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Like my experience with Age of Empires II, this game proves that it is sometimes VERY worthwhile to go back...I went back because of reviews and glad I did.\n\nYes the tutorial is long, yes there is additional reading online, but these things are a given with a game of this complexity.  Ultimately I gave up on the tutorial (twice), set the difficulty rather low and did some good old-fashioned OJT.  Turns out most of the difficulty in getting into this game was not from any flaw in the game itself, just this user's ability to wrap the brain around something that was an "RTS" but substantially different.  Then it just "clicks" and you realize this game might be a worthwhile purchase after all.\n\nMicromanagement is an option, but not an oppressive necessity.  There is an ebb and flow to the game that is nicely non-linear in feel.  For all its complexities and mandatory reading, AI War is actually as simple to play as most other RTS games, but likely impossible to master.  Strategy is the true centerpiece here with all the frustrating satisfaction of a good Sudoku puzzle.\n\nOn the downside, that strategy can feel hollow at times. Unit icons are often difficult to distinguish when the going gets epic, and there are certain times where it feels like the game's creator overstepped bounds in shaping player behavior and threw in eccentric wrinkles that take away from immersion.  Certain unit immunities don't make much sense and there is no explanation of how entity A provides shielding to entity B, thus requiring destruction in a certain order.  That said, these confinements do result in, you guessed it, strategy.  Oh, and a lot of fun mixed with a sense of foreboding unique in gaming.  Even so, much of the difficulty seems arbitrary.  Supposing an AI did squash virtually all of humanity, is it really going to give you a shot at taking over half the galaxy and exterminating it?  Instances of such logic knaw at the enjoyment.\n\nGraphics, for all their simplicity are utilitarian representations that work and keep the systems specs down.  The other elements of this game slowly but surely more than make up for whatever eye candy the player craves.  Same goes for sound.  Interfaces are on par for a game of this scale.  Honorable mention does go to music as it is unique and adds a distinct flavor to the game.\n\nThe game has incredible replayability and customization value even before the additional content...each map is not only a different experience in the technical sense, but unique in its feel.  An approximate parallel would be the difference in comparing the mid-game feel of two separate Axis and Allies games.  The footstomper here is that it is best played with friends.\n\nOther reviews have already said it, but I'll say it too...because somewhere someone is struggling through the tutorial or wondering whether to buy.  Reviews are the only reason I went back.  Singleplayer is good, the AI is good but how much credit can it really take when it holds all the cards?  Co-op is awesome.  Games take 7-15 hours easy, making sustained co-op difficult but, as this game was built from the ground up as a co-op game, drop-in/drop-out/pausing is handled wonderfully.  The programming seems very solid.  Bugs are rare, only 2 spotted so dar.  If the programming of this game was indeed the work of one man, three things are evident.\n1:  He should be very proud.\n2.  He should make more games with this level of effort and innovation.\n3.  "Indie" is almost a derogatory term in my mind, but occasionally it is a term that should make the big developers hang their heads in shame...\n\nBuy it, try it, and wait for the "click." You owe it to yourself and the friends you'll play it with ;)   Score:  8.8","November 26, 2013","true","51.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rootdarkarchon/recommended/40400/","rootdarkarchon","darkarchon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rootdarkarchon/","860 products in account","AI War is a mix of a 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) and RTS (Real Time Strategy) sprinkled with a touch of TD (Tower Defense). The game forces you to battle against overwhelming AI forces, which outnumber you massively. The goal is to destroy both AI home worlds, which is a huge undertaking, given the fact that the whole Galaxy now belongs to the AI overlords.\n\nIt forces you to evaluate your best move.\n\nIt forces you to evaluate the cost-benefits of your actions.\n\nIt never has a correct next step.\n\nYou want to have something to really think about? Try it.\n\nIt will overwhelm you, it will force you to learn new things by hour, it will force you to overthink your strategies over and over. That being said, it has a high learning curve, the tutorials are essential to grasp even the basic premise of the game. The UI is clunky at first, but you will learn to love it; the graphics are mediocre, but this isn't a game about graphics. It's all about gameplay, which is very hard and quite fun, very rewarding if you manage to beat the AI.\n\nThe game has an insane amount of customizability, especially in terms of the AI I have never seen a game that has so much options. Not even Supreme Commander, which is praised for the AI, comes even close to it. Due to this fact every single game plays different, since there are around 10-15 AI types for difficulty setting (Easy/Medium/Hard/Insane), each of them with unique abilities, plus you can change the AI difficulty itself (from 1-10 while the 'real' game starts out at 7).\n\nUnit cap of 1000 in SupCom? Pffsh. AI War forces you to attack the AI forces, which are usually in the ten thousands in the whole galaxy, even simple attack waves can already have 1000+ units. Your fleet will start around 1000 Unit cap (playing with large fleet settings) and grow to 5-6k units in the end. You will have to use your fleet efficiently to win the game, especially since the AI can crush you basically at any time. But - the AI plays a whole different game than the human players, which makes it quite asymmetric and very interesting to say at least.\n\nOh, did I mention the game has a brilliant Co-Op mode and it really is awesome with at least a friend? Well it has one, and works up to 8. There are no public lobbies, which is understandable though, since a game can take up from 12 to 40 hours (usually around 20-25), and is pausable as well as savable, even in multiplayer. Also supports drop-in Co-Op so a friend can join even mid-game.\n\nAnd I haven't even started yet about the expansions, the hundreds of different ship types with different abilities, which are randomized each game, the hundreds of buildings and possibilities, the hacking of enemy ship types, different minor factions which are completely optional (Astro Trains! Dyson Spheres! Zenith!), different game-win conditions aside of destroying the 2 main AI planets, different starting options (want to have a powerful Starship instead of a static home base? it's possible!), and an pretty awesome and very fitting score.\n\nBesides the developer already released 5 DLCs (which is not a bad thing here at all, those DLCs are all pretty much worth the price they're asking, enormous content additions and new modes are introduced) over the course of 5 years, and the game is still maintained with patches, bugfixes and major changes.\n\nThis game is the perfect example of a dance on the knives edge. And I love it for this. It's my absolute favorite RTS/4X genre-mix and I don't expect this to change in the near future.","February 24, 2012","true","166.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's not your regular 4x- well, by the strictest definitions, yes, insofar as it requires copious amounts of micromanagement and is incredibly complex, but it's so much more than that. It's mind-raking strategic planning, sending out scouts to recon distant systems so you can figure out which planet would be most beneficial to your cause, it's expanding your borders so you can get more energy to build a large enough strike force, and when you've won one battle out of many, and half of your fleet has been destroyed and is currently being salvaged by the enemy, then it's time for you to turn back to your planets bordering your target to prepare for a great wave of enemy forces. It's a vicious cycle, and randomly generated (or custom made) "campaigns" pit you against 2 far superior enemy forces, which have various personalities, for hours at times (as of this review, I'm halfway into one such campaign, clocking in 14 hours). You can turn on and off certain elements of the game which give it a new flavor (in lieu of a better term), such as Dyson spheres that will build giant gatling guns to help you if you help it, giant alien spaceships which have been abandoned and can be repaired (so that you may use them), and space-trains which roam the galaxy, supporting AI operations and interfering with you. It's incredible. However complex this game may be, it can automatically become the simplest and easiest game in the world just by turning down the difficulty settings a few notches. Toning down the AI difficulty to a pitifully easy level takes away the need to micromanage almost entirely, making it possible to set your ships to autopilot, which, under normal circumstances would have proven a small yet grave mistake which would have resulted in a game over, and turns the game into something that even the worst RTS player could play. I would highly reccomend this game- especially over Sins of a Solar Empire. This game is more in depth than Sins could ever be, and the cost of the base game for AI War is (again, as of this review) a mere 1/4th of Sin's base game.","June 26, 2015","true","19.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is a game that all RTS gamers MUST have in their library.\n\nEDIT (7/22/2014)\n\nMy comment (above) still stands. This game, even two years of playing, is still fun. The community is friendly, large, and very active along with the developers constantly at work to fix bugs and add in much more content.\n\nThe game to most new players may seem extremely difficult at first glance and start and is not your occasional "Train, Drag, Click, Murder". AIs will commit invasions every 5 minutes and early games at times while you only have such a handful of ships. However, once the user begins to learn, it'll begin to the challenge the mind in attempts to strategize and organize the fleet used for offense and defense. Players can choose to micromanage every single ship in their fleet or macromanage. Both work and don't work depending on the situation at hand.\n\nEventually some will get bored of a strategy game as the AIs become more predictable but no, not AI War. There are more than a dozen AI types, each in which provides a new challenge and way of thinking to face against the ever unpredictable AIs.\n\nNow this game does have DLCs. Most may think that it's expensive and not worth it. Wrong, every DLC throws in a large amount of content and provides much more !!FUN!! to the game, such as ships, new factions, and new AIs. These ships can be used against you or the other way around. So yes, I bought all the DLCs, but one, and all of them are completely worth it. Oh, and DLCs cost no more than $5 USD.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is difficult to start at first with the ruthless AIs, but however, what makes strategy games fun is the difficulty and the thinking it takes to succeed and win.\n\nIf you love RTS games along with sci-fi, this is the game.","September 3, 2012","true","49.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Arcen could easily charge around $30 for the game. I bought the game a long time ago and it was sitting on my library. I actually bought the game and all its expansions twice just for the heck of it. Here is my experience with the game.\n\nThe game starts deceptively simple. It looks like something that is a cross from sins of a solar empire and supreme commander but the game is a whole different beast. The plethora of options on how you want to play your game would ensure that no two game would ever go the same. This gives the game close to endless replayability. The game is so flexible that you can play it as either a click-fest RTS or a grand-strategy/4x that can be pausable. The ship variety and all the other nasty stuff you encounter on your game can be set by you.\n\nSo what exactly is the game like? It is about you against the AI. You are the commander of a group of humans that have been driven almost to extinction when the AI that was used to control your war machines during the civil war has gone turbo. The AI have driven humanity to the brink of extinction and then turned its eye on other alien worlds. Your duty is to survive and destroy the AI. It isn't an easy task. The more systems you attack, the AI's attention will slowly turn towards you. If you get too greedy, the AI can easily squash you out like a bug in no time. You must pick your targets carefully while trying to make it look like you are still an insignificant threat. You have to keep it up until the next thing the AI knows, you will be knocking on its doorstep and destroying its homeworld.The game really gives you that feeling of hopelessnes and dread. You feel wary about your every move, knowing the AI can send out its best ships and destroy your little rebellion.\n\nIn terms of ship variety, there are tons of ships available to you. From the staple fighter/bomber/missile frigates and your basic starships to really nasty ships like the leech starship that can turn destroyed enemy ships in to zombie ships that will fight for you. Getting all the expansion adds a lot since every expansion adds layers upon layers of ships/buildings/factions that you will encounter in the universe. battles are very strategic, at first it may seem that you can get away by piling up a huge blob of ships and overpowering the AI but it doesn't work that way. The ships have different hull types with different weaknesses plus there are different tier of ships and structures. You can't just go in to a system and overrun it with your ships. Some system may have mines that will rip your ships to shreds. Some have Mass Drivers that can easily turn your starships to scrap metal. The different variety of ships and structures are just too many to count. The game is not your ordinary clickfest RTS. The game is as strategic as chess. You need to identify your targets, see what things can easily rip your ships to shreds, which structures you have to destroy before bringing in your other ships. The game is just so deep!\n\nI haven't scratched the surface of the game yet. I played more on my GOG version since I had all the expansions there first. The game is super hard and super rewarding. You wouldn't regret getting it. It can be intimidating but just keep on pushing forward and you will finally see how great the game is. The AI in this game is one of the best ever. It will keep you on your toes. It will always be a step ahead of you. It will make you feel anxious about your every move. It will destroy your carefully laid plans without even using a lot of its resources. This is one of the best strategy games ever.\n\nSidenote: Dev customer service is actually pretty good. I bought 2 expansions direct from them and they actually provided me with a steam key and they respond pretty fast.\n\n","August 28, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Ai in this game doesn't pretend it's a human like in other RTS games. the AI starts off with a large numerical advantage, however not all the AI ships know that the human players are around, and therein lies the first part of an AI War strategy; subtlety. If you attempt to rush the AI, it will react. However, this doesn't mean you have to sneak around either. The AI plays by slightly different rules, it reacts differently; it can even do things that nobody programmed it to do.

AI kept attacking our planets but they were well fortified so no ordinary fleets came trough, We decided to look for important targets to lower the AI progress while doing the champion areas for rare technology and upgrades.\n\nAt 5h49min mark AI got furious and spawned 30 shadow frigates at my friends home world which was the last one left, ships ignored shields and defenses and went straight for the orbital station.

It's a deep and enjoyable mix of RTS, 4X, and tower defense in which 1-8 players work together against 2 very hostile AIs. I know some are unhappy with the graphics and/or the UI but don't let that stop you from getting this enjoyable and detailed game. Graphics do not a great game make although I like many do love some good graphics, and the devs have mentioned they plan to tweak the UI in the near future. For how much this game costs and it's on sale a LOT on top of that, this game will give many hours of enjoyable gaming.\n\nYou command fleets of hundreds and even thousands of ships once you get rolling and the AIs work in a very asymmetrical way in regards to the players. The AI gets angrier as the players tacke systems and other hostile actions, and if you push too hard and expand too much you can actually lose the game from making the AI too strong to handle. This delicate balancing act that starts easy to manage at low difficulties but gets much more intricate and requires a lot more thought as the difficulty climbs and you have to handle more serious threats and a faster climbing AI progress. Being both tactical and strategic in scope and allowing the players to use fine micromanagement or not so much if you don't wish too as well as so many ways to play, they've added many new victory conditions that let you choose how to win and you can turn various ships and AI abilites on and off.\n\nGames can be very long but worth it and the co-op play can be especially rewarding.

Its sorta like the Dark Souls of strategy games.  Its difficulty and breadth of strategic options is its defining characteristic and will either entice you to learn more with a masochistic grin on your face as you lose again (but learn a little more), or drive you away for lack of victorious gratification.  Basically, this is possibly the most unique and challenging rts game I've ever played.  Let me tell you this: Ive played this game over 100 hours AND IVE NEVER BEATEN THE AI.  I came kinda close once on difficulty level 3 (out of 10, lol)  You will never find another game with an AI this good, this powerful.  Ive also never been able to find someone to play it with, which is sad as this game is head-spinningly complex (which I like).  This is one of those games with endless replayability.  Just the way the game functions and plays out is brilliant and unique. The game rewards "deep strikes", you dont just move from one planet to the next, creating a contiguous border until you invariably become bigger and stronger and then just play mop up the rest of the way.  Oh no, with this game you must SCOUT, pick only planets that have stuff you really need or want, because each planet you conquer makes the AI progress grow, making their garrisons bigger, thier core worlds stronger, their attention more focused on you.  You absolutely CANNOT win if you play this game in a conventional 4x or Starcraft-like manner.  And thats why I love it.  Prepare to use your brain.  If something you want is several planets away you must neuter the ones in between you and your target, strike your target swiftly, and with a measured force as you cant support the number of ships the AI can.  Theres literally hundreds and maybe thousands of ways to go about doing this depending on what ship you start with and which advanced labs you find along the way.  Most rts games are rock-paper-scissors in the way they balance things.  This game its like rock-paper-scissors-shotgun-shoe-bubblegum-sand-wood-knife-water.  Theres just so much to learn about the ships, mechanics, AI tendencies and what things you and the AI have at your disposal its INSANE.  Because thats the thing.....the AI doesnt play like you at all, doesnt have the same restrictions, operates with usually very different ships, and has very different strategic functionality.\n\nTheres so many variations the AI can throw at you and so many tools you have to fight back its just more than I could ever type out.  Theres what like 30-40 different main AI types that determine thier ships, gaurd posts, and strategies.  You can tweak this further by determining how they send waves at you, and just really all sorts of other stuff when you set up a map seed.  But then on top of that you can enable "plots", 3rd party factions that can be allied with or hostile to you or hostile to everything.  Theres golems, theres the Neinzul clusters, theres Spire ships, theres human factions, theres Astro Trains.  Theres more turret types than you can imagine, theres......oh nevermind man I cant list it all unless I wrote a whole book.\n\nThe expansions have all added meaningful and interesting content that builds the core game to a level that its just astounding really.  Ill admit this game doesnt have great graphics, but honestly you would need a Cray supercomputer if the graphics were better because of the sheer number of ships and weapon effects that would be going on.  And since its one of those games where you rarely have the luxury of being zoomed in anyway, you realize quickly that grpahics dont matter anyway with this game.  All that said, I still think the graphics arent bad, theyre just not like Homeworld 2 graphics or Sins of a Solar Empire level.\n\nSome apparently comlain about the interface, but I think its actually pretty good considering the complexity the game forces you to deal with.....theres just a lot of buttons available and a lot of buttons that need pushing, thats just how it is.  I doubt anyone else could do it much better.  Theres hotkeys galore if you can memorize them.\n\nAnyway, I cant even begin to explain everything else thats great about this game, Id love to be able to play co-op with someone someday to finally beat the AI.  So please give this game a chance, I promise you that once you get past the graphics and learn it, its FANTASTIC.  This game should win some kind of award for innovation and AI design, I dunno maybe it did. ARCEN hit a home-run with this game in my opinion.  Put your cookie-cutter rts games down, give AI War a try.","December 28, 2013","true","75.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a deep and enjoyable mix of RTS, 4X, and tower defense in which 1-8 players work together against 2 very hostile AIs. I know some are unhappy with the graphics and/or the UI but don't let that stop you from getting this enjoyable and detailed game. Graphics do not a great game make although I like many do love some good graphics, and the devs have mentioned they plan to tweak the UI in the near future. For how much this game costs and it's on sale a LOT on top of that, this game will give many hours of enjoyable gaming.\n\nYou command fleets of hundreds and even thousands of ships once you get rolling and the AIs work in a very asymmetrical way in regards to the players. The AI gets angrier as the players tacke systems and other hostile actions, and if you push too hard and expand too much you can actually lose the game from making the AI too strong to handle. This delicate balancing act that starts easy to manage at low difficulties but gets much more intricate and requires a lot more thought as the difficulty climbs and you have to handle more serious threats and a faster climbing AI progress. Being both tactical and strategic in scope and allowing the players to use fine micromanagement or not so much if you don't wish too as well as so many ways to play, they've added many new victory conditions that let you choose how to win and you can turn various ships and AI abilites on and off.\n\nGames can be very long but worth it and the co-op play can be especially rewarding. Arcen games are great devs and very responsive to the community and this game is the jewel in their crown. Absolutely worth your time and money!","December 25, 2014","true","410.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a best mix of 4x, RTS and TD in existence imo. The attractive features are the automation surpassed only by Distant Worlds, complexity and simplicity both - the amount of features is enormous but they all interact in a simple "shoot each other to death" fashion. On lower difficulties it plays as a simple RTS - send units at enemy until he dies; on higher ones every game is a complex multi-layered dynamic puzzle which active pause feature helps to solve. The only mild disappointment with this game is a hard to find co-op which always results in ppl failing laughably or quitting. As devs said, "this is a game that will last you for some years".

The reason I say that is that after discovering this game, I found that none of my friends were the kind of person who like games like this, which was a bummer. AI War focuses on starship fleet production and careful management of enemy threat through strikes on key targets. A whole lot of strategy goes into what to build, where, what to attack, and when. Game was honestly really hard and I'm not ashamed to admit I never once had a victorious campaign on 6/10 difficulty setting, and the campaigns are looooooong (I'm talking 50% completion of a single campaign after 4 hours of effort).  If you like strategy games I strongly recommend this title --as an added bonus, the music is great.\n\nA word of caution: don't buy AI War expecting a drool-inducing space battle graphics bonanza. This game merely provides a framework into which you can insert your own imagination. To say the graphical interface was bare-bones would be exceedingly generous... but to someone who used to imagine starship battles on sheets of notebook paper instead of paying attention in class, this game was a breath of fresh air.\n\nIf you end up buying this title and you like it, feel free to contact me.

The incredibly long tutorial is one thing, but this universe plays like a tabletop board game in the sense that all of your actions lead to the game becoming increasingly difficult. The game though, with time becomes an experience that cannot be found in most strategy games. Instead of giving you an entire empire to control, you have one planet in a large galaxy. Your single planet has nothing on it. The thrill of building up an intricate turret system and infrastructure whilst evading enemy patrols and ambushes is worth the entry price (which is very low.) Taking over your first planet which will be hard is an achievement that you will remember.\n\nKeep in mind however this game is tough. You will have lots of questions at first like "How do I launch nukes?" "How do I upgrade starships?" and "What the hell is the AI readiness meter?"\n\nWith some time however, this game becomes a blast. I recommend it for people that are willing to put some time in and learn a new game.

It took a very specific setup involving no expansions. It took a dedicated push to really give this game a shot. But one day, this game "clicked" and now I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nAI War: Fleet Command is the game for strategy fans who want to challenge their preconcpetions of what an RTS is all about. Just because an RTS has no multiplayer doesn't mean it isn't hard, challenging or enjoyable.\n\nThe AI in this game is second to none and puts AAA RTS titles to shame. It sneak attacks, it flanks, it understands your weaknesses and exploits them. These intelligent little buggers will constantly keep you on your toes and have you wondering why no other game is like it. On top of being clever, the AI is also highly customizable now with the expansions and there are plenty of opponents to take on. Do you want to take on an AI that will send waves of units frequently to your doorstep? Or perhaps you would prefer an AI who turtles up and defends their planets to the death. Why not combine two different AI types and go nuts? Or even go random and try and figure out the AI's strategy and adapt. The choice is yours.\n\nTactically, the game is pretty good, with unit positioninging being critical in both battles and in general (last thing you want is an undefended homeworld getting sniped by the AI). Where the game outshines any other though is in strategy. No two games are alike, and even in the fairly simple early game (where my 3 games spent most of their time since 2 ended prematurely) the games felt entirely different with a large variety of units, structures and AI tactics to counter. 30+ hours in and I am still seeing new units I haven't seen before. This is a game you will be playing for the long haul once it grips you.\n\nBe warned however - this game is not for everyone. Even for a fan of this kind of game like myself, it took a little while before everything suddenly fell into place and the game suddenly became a masterpiece in my mind. If you aren't sure... why not try the demo? The demo lets you play all the tutorials, a decent amount of the single player game and you can even test multiplayer to see if you can connect to others properly. There is no reason not to give this game a try for free; heck, even the demo could give you a good 10 hours of gameplay.\n\nHighly recommended. Years after release the game is still frequently updated (with an update literally just yesterday) and a new expansion is coming. It is currently on sale. Please buy if you are interested, you will love it if it is for you.","June 28, 2014","true","35.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everything you'd expect from a standard RTS is cranked up to eleven.\n\nThere are MANY different structures. There are MANY different ships to build. Several factions have specialized ships and abilities. You can have fleets in the hundreds and micro every individual ship across a galaxy-sized map. But you are all pitted against a computer. With near infinite resources and reflexes, the odds are heavily stacked against you and that's where the fun and challenge comes in. You will defeat them through pure strategy and decision making. Claim key targets, and do it quickly before the force of a billion suns crush your base.\n\nAmazing soundtrack. Fantastic and complex game. Has up to 8 players for multiplayer. Graphics are lackluster but probably necessary to prevent massive lag or crashing trying to render thousands of particle effects and animations at once.\n\nIt should be noted games are very long, even on the shortest settings. Expect time frames for a single campaign to range from a couple hours to weeks. That along with its extremely steep learning curve means this game requires some serious dedication to go places. Multiplayer especially requires dedicated play sessions; while it does have a dropin/drop out function, it can be difficult to manage when players are shifting around and losing track of the game state often.","July 3, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I used to do coop games versus AI in Starcraft and Company of Heroes and such.  AI War is so much better than any other RTS I've played at PVE that I can't go back.\n\nThere are a lot of difficulty knobs you can turn to tune the experience to be as challenging as you want.  This alone makes it vastly superior to a lot of other games.  They've done a good job preventing cheesy strategies like sending an SCV to kite the enemy workers.  The random elements mean you can't really play exactly the same way twice.\n\nThe UI can be frustrating, especially early on.  The game has a lot of information to present the player, some of which is not obviously useful to a new player.  There are a lot of weird controls, like holding down 4 and drag selecting to select only tier 4 units.  I got used to this, but the UI could definitely use some work.\n\nNot a big fan of the ship art.

Where do I begin? Well with all the expansions, the ways with which you can play are staggering. The number of mini-campaigns that come into play during a long game are so numerous, that you can't always keep track of them all. The graphics aren't great, but I don't mind that, as it allows bigger battles with more ships than in any other game I have ever played. The various races and subfactions are interesting and original, not to mention diverse.\n\nI'll review each of the expansions in order of release:\n\n01. The Zenith Remnant.\n\nAdds lots of interesting features, and controllable ships (admittedly they are hard to find) and new AI types. The Zenith themselves are imaginative and they make lots of pretty explosions (ahhh). Adds golems, massive nearly invincible warships that can decimate entire armadas on their own. For more info, head to Arcen Wiki.(http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War_-_Golems).\n\n02. Children Of Neinzul.\n\nA mini expansion (very mini), that adds a fair number of bizzare organic ships that fill useful roles, for instance: the Neinzul Enclave Starship spawns hoards of younglings (miniature drone-like units) that automatically attack the enemy, although they can still be controlled.\n\n03. Light Of The Spire.\n\nMy personal favorite, Light Of The Spire introduces a whole new way to play AI War, in the form of the Fallen Spire campaign.\nIn this campaign, you must collect various items (albeit repetitive items) and escort them to your home planet. I won't spoil the fun, but if you do want to know all about the said campaign, check its page on the Arcen Wiki (http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War_-_Fallen_Spire_Walkthrough)\nIt also adds heap loads of wonderful starships to your arsenal (yay!).\n\n04. Ancient Shadows.\n\nAn rpg-esque expansion, difficult to get into (study "Minor Factions" carefully before starting a new game, to avoid making the same stupid mistake I did) but once started can be great fun. Doesn't add that many ships, but does give an insight into AI War's past. More info here: http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War_-_Ancient_Shadows. Also adds a hero-type starship to your arsenal, and can be upgraded and customized (what more could you ask for?).\n\n05. Vengeance of the Machine.\n\nOhhh, scary! Yes it certainly deserves that title, as it adds a huge number of horrifying, nightmarish weapons to the AI's arsenal. Although it doesn't kick in until late game, Vengeance of the Machine is a worth-while investment. More info here: http://arcengames.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=AI_War_-_Vengeance_of_the_Machine.\n\nNow, time for summary (finally).\n\nPros.\n\nDeep stratagy.\nWonderful gameplay.\nInteresting concept.\nVisually pleasing. (to me anyway)\nGreat diversity.\nOriginal.\nSci-Fi (I love sci fi).\nGreat music.\nLots more I can't think of now.\n\nCons.\n\nCombat is extremly simple.\nHigher Tier ships and structures are very hard to get.\nResearch doesn't play a big enough role (i.e can't research your own golems and the like)\nNo diplomacy whatsoever.\n\nRating.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nMusic: 10/10 (The best game-music since Total Annihilation. Pablo Vega is a genius!)\nStratagy: 7/10\nConcept: 9/10\nUI: 8/10\nStory: 8/10 (because I like a relatively simple background story, no endless character backstory and drama)\nGraphics: 7/10 (I don't mind simple graphics, but it can be confusing and flashy close-up)\n\nTotal Score: 9/10. Which basically means: go get it. NOW!\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who likes 4x and/or rts.\n\n.rcdeppe.","June 16, 2014","true","125.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Fleet Command is one of those hit or miss games. Some like it and some simply despise it. I am the people that absolutely hate this game. It takes some absurd amount of hours to beat opponents on higher difficulty, and the learning curve on this game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing insane. It took me some ~7 hours just to understand all the control and interface and even though I still hated the game. It is simply way too confusing for me. I enjoyed star craft 2, the old command and conquer general’s series where you amassed huge armies while holding a defensive line. In this game you explore, scout, and explore some more. Find your enemy, attack them, and pray their retaliation suck. This game simply doesn’t have the adrenaline rush that I come to love in an RTS game. It’s simply too slow and cumbersome for my taste.

A mix of 4x, and Tower Defence. The AI in is is absolutely brutal, very cunning.\n\nIn one game it slipped past my forward defenses with a fleet of cloaked fighters, they must have been hidden for a while at my home planet. It continued to batter my forward defenses with wave upon wave of ships, of which I could barely keep producing my own ships to counter. Then de-cloaked his fighters and destroyed my four fleet factories. In the process stopping my re-inforcements to the frontlies and scuppering my supply. In the same second, the AI informed me that 30,000+ ships were on their way to the forntline in 2 minutes 50 seconds to obliterate my small 3000+ fleet and 100+ turrets. Defenceless I lasted out for another 10 minutes of frantically trying to rebuild defences to stop the other 25,000 ships (5,000 has been destroyed at the frontline) gunning for my home planet. That'll teach me to ♥♥♥♥ it off too much.\n\nSeriously give  it a go. Doon't let the dated graphics put you off, the gameplay and strategy options are absolutely outstanding. It'll get you hooked and you'll not see your family for days. That moment when the tables turn and your in the position to finally win is priceless.

Fighting for control of a whole galaxy via a zoomed out map isn't as cool as it seems, when you realise it's all just different screens seperated by numerous waypoints, making intergalactic logistics instantaneous and almost meaningless.\n\nThere are almost no animations to speak of and the whole thing looks like a cheap flash animation, with ships and projectiles 'tweening' around the screen, making everything look static and rather dull.\n\nThe music is simplistic, but very nice, the piano scores especially evoke feelings of loneliness and futility (probably not good that the gameplay does the exact same thing).","December 7, 2011","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The idea to have the AI and humans playing two different roles rather than being symmetric like many RTS's was brilliant and leads to the development of an extremely challenging AI who will pick you apart if you make a mistake (can be easily tuned to whatever difficulty you want). It's technically an RTS but game times are quite long - generally I find it takes about 15-20 hours to finish a game and it will take longer on higher difficulty levels. The interface is a bit clunky and the game takes a bit of an investment in time to really get the hang of it but I strongly recommend this to any strategy fans who would like to try something that's a bit different.

The developers threw out the challenge that techincally speaking putting all the AI difficulty settings (of which there is a lot of modifiers) on their hardest would make the game literally impossible to beat. Challenge Accepted.\n\nThe year is now 2013 me and my friend have played countless battles been close to victory only to be denied in epic and adrenaline pumping ways. At points we have refused to speak on our voice comms out of paranoia that the AI might actually be listening to our war plans. The AI seems to have a counter for most things even luring you into a false sense of security.\n\nThere is a steep yet quick to overcome learning curve to this game. You will probably need a few hours just to get used to the fundamentals of the game (even 4 years on where expansions and still frequent updates come out I am still coming across things I have never encoutnered before).\n\nI would really recommend this game to anyone who though Total Annihlation's unit cap was insane as this game simply does not have one (well where the AI is concerned anyway) Million unit waves will onslaught you. Of course this is a high demand on your CPU and Network transmit so if you play with friends LAN is best or certainly do not do too many players on the internet unless you have awesome speeds.\n\nAI war pushes your CPU into a blackhole of awesomeness.

The idea to have the AI and humans playing two different roles rather than being symmetric like many RTS's was brilliant and leads to the development of an extremely challenging AI who will pick you apart if you make a mistake (can be easily tuned to whatever difficulty you want). It's technically an RTS but game times are quite long - generally I find it takes about 15-20 hours to finish a game and it will take longer on higher difficulty levels. The interface is a bit clunky and the game takes a bit of an investment in time to really get the hang of it but I strongly recommend this to any strategy fans who would like to try something that's a bit different.

That said, if you have enough time to learn this game, you definitely should get it.\n\nI'd say it takes between two to eight hours to learn the game enough to really start enjoying it. Most of the UI is behind keyboard shortcuts (though you can probably *kind of* do without them), and there's so, so many shortcuts, many of them basically mandatory. Well, for convenient playing, in any case, since you can probably manage without, but it's going to take at least twice as long to play the actual game without the shortcuts.\n\nNow, assuming you can manage the UI, the game is excellent. The point of the game is you're against two AI's, which are also AI:s ingame. As in, you're in control of human survivors, surrounded by two mighty AIs. Initially, you're not worth the AI's attention, and will barely receive any attacks. As you expand and destroy AI bases, they will  start to consider  you a threat, and their attacks will get more serious.\n\nThe genius of the game is this: AI and you are not equal. The AI has vastly more troops, and controls nearly all of the map. You're initially in control of a few human survivors, and the only reason you're surviving is  you're not worth the AI's attention. As you begin to draw more attention the threat increases. Your goal is to wipe out the AI's, but you (probably) cannot simply conquer everything, as that would lead to an overwhelming AI aggression. You have to choose the best strategic targets to conquer, and leave the rest to AIs.\n\nThough the game is real time, there is usually no hurry. AI War is really more a puzzle game than an actual RTS. A single playthrough can easily take more than eight hours on standard settings.","August 3, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can lose your units very quickly, and then the enemy will counter-attack, leading to your loss. Consider units caps as a suggestion if you want to live.\nThird, the enemy is an IA. Mostly passive, she's easily predictable.\nFourth, that game gives a weird feeling. Like there's something missing, like an atmosphere, something to make the game unique. And the music doesn't have any personality either.\nFifth, expect a lot a quick save/quick load. Even while doing the tutorial, I had to load 5 times.

I would recommend this game to a certain kind of people. People who like something that is unending and complicated and interesting AND most importantly people who don't feel like they always have to finish every game. It can take 10-15 hours of play time to finish one game. Luckily at least for me the most interesting part is the early and mid game, so if I get bored or whatever I will already have played the good parts.","August 27, 2014","true","131.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A mix of 4x, and Tower Defence. The AI in is is absolutely brutal, very cunning.\n\nIn one game it slipped past my forward defenses with a fleet of cloaked fighters, they must have been hidden for a while at my home planet. It continued to batter my forward defenses with wave upon wave of ships, of which I could barely keep producing my own ships to counter. Then de-cloaked his fighters and destroyed my four fleet factories. In the process stopping my re-inforcements to the frontlies and scuppering my supply. In the same second, the AI informed me that 30,000+ ships were on their way to the forntline in 2 minutes 50 seconds to obliterate my small 3000+ fleet and 100+ turrets. Defenceless I lasted out for another 10 minutes of frantically trying to rebuild defences to stop the other 25,000 ships (5,000 has been destroyed at the frontline) gunning for my home planet. That'll teach me to ♥♥♥♥ it off too much.\n\nSeriously give  it a go. Doon't let the dated graphics put you off, the gameplay and strategy options are absolutely outstanding. It'll get you hooked and you'll not see your family for days. That moment when the tables turn and your in the position to finally win is priceless.  And what is even better that its even harder on co-op. 9.5/10","September 15, 2014","true","153.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had not had any that could really challenge me in a long time.  Most had the same easy road to victory and it was hard to lose unless you really stumbled.  This game though...the ability to almost instantly lose, at least that is how it felt at those times, when everything seems to be in hand is excellent.  It keeps you on your toes and doesn't let you just fall into the same rinse and repeat pattern of other RTS games today.\n\nWhile the visuals may turn off some people, I think they add to its charm and for a game of the size/scope work well enough.  The soundtrack alone puts it above most other games I've recently played.  The continual support and additional content for this game make it a must own for all fans of the RTS genre.","September 22, 2014","true","177.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The things you can do, sometimes must do to actually win a campaign are pretty diverse, and the game offers you plenty of choices to work with. Choices start in setting up your campaign, letting the host set the difficulty and type of each of the two AIs, the type and difficulty of minor factions in the game (which, with all the expanions, make for quite a few), special AI plots, some extra AI behaviour, the map you play on, generated based on seed, your home system (dictating what special ship you get to start with), even letting a player start with multiple home worlds, adjusting AI difficulty and ship number caps accordingly.\nAnother thing of note, aside from the juicy diversity and fun gameplay, is the music.

Goes from 2 to 8 players, the fun starts with 2 players when you gotta plan attacks accordingly and help each other to survive in the hostile  universe; The difficulty is pretty high so i don't think casual RTS players would really feel at ease on this game but hey for the price it costs just give it a go.

It can be very hard. The problem is the way the AI enemy  behaves or reacts to your success.\n\nA normal person used to normal games of that type will be inclined to conquer as many planetary systems as possible. But the way the game is designed, this only makes the AI send larger and larger waves of atackers. And since there is a cap to the number of units you can have, you are quickly overwhelmed. Its so frustrating to be punished for success.\n\nSo since its not a bug but a deliberate design choice, stay away if you dont like games like that.

Not that the game isn't good or anything it's just ok maybe even great if you could get friends to play with. IF you could get ANYONE to play with for that matter.\n\n\nThis is the fatal flaw of AI War it's a co-op game....a co-op game that's past it's prime to be more precise. The player base for this is all but dead and gone. No player servers and even the game makers forum seems to be dead with one post every other month. Now I can't turthfully say the entire games community is dead they may have contracted into a tiny tight neat club of players. But for the average joe hoping to get into some multiplayer games and active co-op  I say your fresh out of luck.\n\nNow for one this wouldn't be so bad really if you could play the game yourself against/with the AI...........and win. The point is that without somebody else supporting and backing you up your chances of surviving even the first 10 minutes of a single player campaign is near impossible. You'll be swarmed relentlessly from all sides by a hand full of AI factions with their near limitless reserves of ships. There's no option for AI teammates so your pretty much on your own in the wolves deen.\n\n\nI say avoid the game if you have no friends to play with and even if you do manage to get a few guys together it's still pretty risky to buy.","September 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","3"

The idea is that an AII has taken over the galaxy and your planet rebels. Luckily the AI is distracted in far off areas and doesn't focus its full attention on you right away. The idea is you have to expand and ultimately find the system the AI core is located and destroy it. The trick is that every installation you destroy raises the AI's alert level causes more and more powerful enemy ships to start warping in. Instead of expanding wherever possible, you have to expand smart along paths you think might lead to the core.\n\nIt's a good original idea. The problem is the execution is horrible.\n\nThe graphics are terrible even for an indie game. All ships are pixely cardboard cutout 2D sprites with NO animation. You just see them glide across the screen like some kid just discovered animating layers in Final Cut for the first time.\n\nThe problem with the awful graphics is compouded by the sheer swarms of units that flood the game. You're pouring hundreds, if not thousands of ships into fight and you can never really tell what's going on. Just a mess of unanimated pixel blobs sitting there and it's impossible to tell who's losing until someone is wiped out with no way to tell why someone won or lost. Did you have enough frigates? Did you need more bombers? Was some special support ship providing an advantage? You can never tell. You just spam an even mix of hundreds of ship types each and hope for the best.\n\nSpeaking of swarms, this is RTS blob warfare at its worst. One of those games where it doesn't feel like you're fighting battles so much as grinding economies against your opponent. That approach doesn't work in this game because you're not fighting against a traditional RTS economy. The AI isn't building units based on how many planets it owns, but by its threat level so it actually gets stronger with more units magically teleporting in the more bases you destroy. Is it worth throwing away 800 ships to take this system? Do I need 500 turrets to guard this wormhole from a future attack or will 200 do? You have no clue what kind of tradeoff is worth it because your opponent isn't playing by the same rules as you. You can't anticipate when the next alert level spike will come or how much of a boost it will be so it's impossible to plan ahead.\n\nThe interface is the worst I've seen in a game since the 1980s. I swear I haven't seen a strategy game this overlycomplicated since those super hardcore 80s wargames that were controlled with keyboards only (not even arrow keys!).\n\nThere are also a bunch of little features that are 0% fun and 100% annoying. There's an "astro train" unit that's a train traveling through space. It is indestructible and will destroy any of your bases it moves through. The only thing you can do is destroy the stations (yes, train stations in space) it travels between, but only the stations that will divert its path away from you. It's ridiculously complicated to calculate which stations you have to destroy to get the train to go away and not at all fun. Thankfully you can turn trains off in the options menu but there are dozens of little annoying things like it and you have to comb through literally 40 optional settings at the start of a game and you won't know which features are worth it and which are terrible until you've played many games and the darn thing is hard enough to learn as it is.\n\nIn summary, this was a good core idea for a game that they should have refined more. If they boiled it down to the best 10% and dumped the 90% that was boring and redundant so that you could actually start understanding the big picture. If they could recreate the core idea in something like the Sins of a Solar Empire engine and make the strategies for units and production more clear, that would be an awesome game.\n\n","March 11, 2015","false","14.2"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","8","23","3","0"

In a tower defense game, you need to have some idea of how tough the approaching waves are, and how well your towers will do against them.  In an RTS, same deal with your army vs the opponent's.  It was my impression that there were so (incredibly) many units, each with gobs of stats, that I would never be able to predict the outcome of any given engagement, or know how much defense to leave in a system.  Couple that with the general awfulness of the graphical presentation of the units and trying to make sense of what was going on, and well, I just don't see putting the effort in.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omgaar/recommended/40400/","Omgaar","Omgaar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omgaar/","157 products in account","As a feminist, this game is rather problematic. It has a communist hivemind group ran by two "AIs" (a stand in for strong independent wom*m) fighting for equality against evil opressors. The narrative even mentions that the oppressors were forced to join with some of the oppressed who did not flee in order to destroy the feminists (with internal misogyny, this is too often a reality). Unfortunately, other than a brief story at the beginning, there is no more narrative a clear point against it. This will not be another Gone Home.\n\nThe thing is , you do not play as the wom*n fighting the patriarchy, instead you play as the patriarchy trying to opress the wom*n who have finally had enough. The game even tries, and fails, to portray the patriarchy as a good thing.\nAt the same time, it portrays the feminists as a great, forgiving, society. Consider that, unlike other RTSs, the "enemy" does not attack you, but instead sits back and lets you do your thing. It is not until you begin to rebel against equality that the feminists are forced to destroy you. This shows how feminism is willing to forgive men for the oppression they have done to wom*n since before the big bang, though men are unwilling to repent their privlege and thus must be killed.\n\nThis game would be much better if it was about playing as the feminists and instead of doing gross killing, you could talk to the patriarchy. Debate them, try to make them join your hivemind. Imagine, instead of playing some adolescent male power fantasy about mercilessly slaughting women, you'd be playing the role of a strong feminist arguing against oppression. Instead of planets, it can be countries, and you must spread your doctrine and prevent the patriarchy from spreading theirs.\n\nThose are the types of games we need, good wholesome games that encourage values like diversity, equality, and tolerance.\nThough, I will say, at least I can boot this game up and pretend I am a saboteur. Purposly destroying the patriarchy from within, making it much easier for the feminist collective to finally bring equality to the savages.\n\n\nI give this game a  Problematic/10","November 26, 2014","true","20.3"," 5 of 28 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","5","28","0","1"

Well, the AI... it behaves... well it behaves like a robot.  It's logical.  It follows patterns, but changes them up.  I also like the feel of the game, how the combat goes, and how, once you learn the game, it's actually a lot of fun.  There are literally hundreds of thousands of different possible games, thousands of different options, and a lot of game customization.  Also, this game is one of the few that you actually get a feeling of accomplishment if you win.  And believe me, winning is anything but easy.\n\nWhat do I dislike?  Well, the graphics aren't that great.  And the game can often be brutal to the point of ridiculous for even the tiniest of errors (as in you accidentally moved a few ships to the wrong system, and seconds later the AI wipes out half of your planets in one fell swoop), and it can be boring with the long periods of time between engages etc.\n\nThat being said, this game... it... it's a masterpiece.  Especially after recent patches that made the AI even less predictable.  I can tell you the following things for sure:\n\n1) On your first play, you will lose.  You will get your rear kicked from your computer, to the moon, and then back again (unless you started it on the lowest possible AI setting, and even then, it's still possible).  The AI will eat you alive, and then spit out what's left of you and laugh (it literally laughs at you.  Dead serious.  The AI is also prone to insulting the players intelligence).\n\n2) If you don't immediately table-flip and walk away after this first posterior punishing, and try again, you're either really persistent, or this is the game for you.\n\nThis game has a VERY steep learning curve, and players need to get used to losing at first.  You cannot play this like most RTS games nowadays.  Aggression will get you killed, and recklessness will make you lose.  That is almost a fact in this game.  However, you cannot just turle.  You must take calculated risks, and be very picky about what you choose to do.\n\nBut there is a god-send.  For the most part, the AI doesn't care about you.  It will more or less ignore you.  You are nothing to it.  Which is good, since that means you have a lot of breathing room and time to think between fights.  You don't have a lot of room for error (and believe me, the game punishes you by an almost ridiculous margin if you do screw up), but that's how this game goes.  Often there will massive engagements lasting only a few minutes that are crazy, insane, and make you wonder why oh why did you start playing, followed by literally an hour or two of planning, building, and movement.  Then another few minutes of insane combat, followed by massive downtime.\n\nAnd like stated in the trailer, you will always be out-numbered and heavily out-gunned.  You will always be minutes away from losing.  Yet you can win.  Despite EVERYTHING, you can win.  It won't be easy.  It sure as hell won't be fast.  But it can be done.  And when you win, when you finally defeat the AIs...  You will either be disgusted with the game and walk away forever, or be insanely proud of yourself, and ready to go again.  For that is the true beauty of this game.  Every game is different.  No two games are exactly alike.","February 4, 2012","true","314.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A list of "you know in every RTS game. you have to X, well i don't like that."  and i have to admit the result is very refreshing.  Its you vs the AI in a very asymetrical war, there is no PVP in this game. Some will be turned off by that fact i am sure, but its a whole nother experience to be facing an AI that can kick your ♥♥♥.  The AI starts controlling everything and has nearly unlimited resources it can throw at you, but you rank so low on its threat meter at the begining that it really pays no attention.  As you become more powerful take more systems from it etc.  You become more of a threat and it begins to take more notice.  It then starts to throw progressivly larger and larger attacks at you and fortifies its defences more and more.  The AI is never idle and you need to be dynamic as well as the AI changes so must your tactics actions that it has learned works based on previous actions it will start to use more frequently and thoughally kicks your ♥♥♥ more times than not.  But loss is all all part of the fun.  Don't bother playing on any difficulty lower than 7 by the way, not worth the time.  Another Innovation thats worth mentioning...  Seamless join and drop of comrades in multiplayer games.  Have a friend that can play but only somtimes, well they can play with you, and when they leave you can take control of thier assets of seamlessly have someone else take over in thier position. Without a doubt there is a steep learning curve to this game, its best to have a more experienced player guide you through your initial game, but its not impossible to learn on your own, as long as you are ok with getting your ♥♥♥ kicked for a little while.   Anyway, great alternate take on RTS worth a shot.  Its so cheap these days what do you have to loose?","December 28, 2012","true","349.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lets just say this tread carefully. The AI is the mammoth you are the mosquito. YOU WILL DIE HORRIBLY. Its gona happen. This game is based around a universe where the huma race allready lost to the Ai. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the Ai's core. Depending on the dlc you have this can mean rampageing through the galaxy destroying every shield core ( or preforming surgical stikes whichever you prefer) you can find with "massive" fleets with over 1,000 ships. But when you end up doing that the Ai can and will throw 10,000 strong fleets at your homeworld causeing a game over. I have personaly never heard of anyone beating this game on hard. Much less with a harder Ai variation... Good luck!               Your gona need it...","March 27","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
