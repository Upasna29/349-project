My fav mode to play is Slaughter (survival) where the zombies keep coming which also has an online scoreboard to challenge your friends. Story mode is repetitive and gets pretty boring; there is a lot of content for the money though! Blood Racing is OK but most enjoyable once you get a good ride. Decent array of weaponry & cars to choose from which are all upgradable (off course :p).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=188479432\nI created a section in the guide above which has a quick list of what you get in the DLCs. Also covers things like the vehicles, game modes etc which might be helpful if you still want to get a better feel for the game.\n\nDefinitely good value, a few weak points short of a classic but overall a solid, fun game!\n\nWorth checking out if you like top-down racing games.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","September 30, 2013","true","29.5"," 80 of 87 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","80","87","0","0"

The story is nothing special but some of these missions can be very exciting - sometimes you can use a tank to just destroy everything that's in your path but even with the taxi cab mowing down hordes of zombies can prove to be satisfying.\n\nWhile story mode can get really boring (you should mainly play it for the money) Survival Mode puts you in a much smaller area and makes you the target of never ending zombie waves. The longer you can survive the higher score you can achieve and you can compete with your friends on the leardboards.\n\nFurthermore, in Blood Race you have the opportunity to compete against other drivers controlled by the A.I.\n\nThis game offers long-lasting, solid fun! You have machine gun, rocket launcher, flame thrower and even a rail gun at your disposal to wreak havoc!\n\nThis is a highly recommended game!","March 7, 2014","true","13.1"," 57 of 67 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","57","67","0","0"

But since the negative things overweigh, I choose to not recommend this game.\n\nThe positive things:\n- Mowing down zombies which explode. Fun!\n- Bonus for mowing down even more zombies, wohoo!\n- A game that doesn't need any explanation and is simple.\n\nThe negative things:\n- Driving can be very frustrating, since you very often get stuck on some stupid corners. And half of the time you're maneuvring back and forth and back an forth and back an forth, while insulting the bad controls with a very foul language. I'm from Lower Bavaria / Germany, which makes this even worse.\n- You never see what's coming, since the camera angles (no matter which one you chose) takes away any sight or fun.\n- Time limits, time limits, time limits. Of course not every mission has to be completed in a certain amount of time, but it's annoying as hell if you have to. Why do game makers don't realize we hate time limits as much as we hate escort missions?\n- Most of the time you're searching for a route to your objective, instead of just driving and giving zombies some hell. The map is very confusing and of course your objectives are at the most far end of the map. The military has helicopters, but meh, f--- this s---, let's just send a normal car instead. The city's completely overrun with zombies and world is in peril, but that's fine. A normal car will do juuust fine!\n- The cars are a joke. I understand that you're beginning slowly with a taxi, a limo, a van, and that every car has its specific speed, passenger seats and maneuvrabilty. Thats ok, because one has to begin slowly. But they are boring and it's not really getting any better. No special cars or anything. The bulldozer and the tank, which are FUN AS HELL every meter you drive them, you're only allowed to use in one, maybe two missions. Yeah, just take the fun away from the player, I don't think he doesn't mind at all. Let's tease him with greatness and bash him afterwards. It's like getting the biggest and most-fun weapon of a game and than losing it forever and never being able to use it again.\n- The ending. Really? It seems the creators of this game lost any interest or motiviation or had been cut really short in terms of available time. It seems kind of unfinished.\n\nThe things that don't matter:\n- For a simple game like this it has an evolving story. Which doesn't make sense. Because yeah, let's send a taxi driver in a city overun with zombies to get some crucial things, while the bulldozer and the tank and all the military stays at the base. Are you kidding? Why not a person on a bicycle, just to make things interesting? Yeah, take this, zombie! *bashes zombiehead with club*\n\nThings that could make this game awesome:\n- A camera angle which actually puts some fun and clarity in the gameplay.\n- More cars / vehicles which also look differently after upgrading.\n- Cars that feel like cars and not like toy cars or bricks.\n- The option to buy upgrades before you start the mission. Not finding powerups during the missions.  You can include an arcade mode where this is enabled by default, I'm fine with that. But for story mode it's uninspiring and fun-breaking. Even with the upgrades your machine gun only has 300 rounds - if you pick up the flame thrower, the machine gun's gone. Mission briefing, upgrading the car, killing zombies. This should be the way. So what is the problem? One can never concentrate in mowing down zombies. Instead you're constantly on the lookout for said powerups.\n\nOverall, it's a decent little game, which could be an effin awesome game, if they just would have put some awesomeness in it. I did not finish the game and after failing in a mission several times and watching videos of the last missions on YouTube, I'm glad I didn't finish the game. It would be absolutely not rewarding.","January 31, 2015","false","4.5"," 54 of 77 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","54","77","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/recommended/220820/","san1281","sanitarian1281","http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/","1229 products in account","In ZDHD, you are Joe Citizen who, for reasons unknown and never really explained, has been recruited by the military to conduct a series of combat, scouting, and search-and-rescue missions. The first ten or so story missions of Zombie Driver HD were fun and the last twenty-one generally vacillated somewhere between tedium and entertainment, with a couple of teeth-grinding exceptions. Most of the components of a good game are here, but none of them stand out in any way, which makes the whole more-or-less precisely the sum of its parts: a mediocre story, weak voice-acting, decent but not remarkable gameplay, nice car models and (mostly) destructible terrain, and some value-added game modes.\n\nYour missions start with briefings, like the one shown above, after which you select a vehicle and buy any upgrades that you can afford based on what you’ve unlocked so far and how much cash you’ve earned from completing objectives or finding money stashes. ZDHD is one of those top-down games where you never get out of your car. The variety of vehicles, ranging from your starter car, a taxicab, to a giant armored vehicle with a 10-passenger capacity, is fairly impressive, but when you dig into the game you’ll find that you’re really only using one or two of the vehicles in your garage, generally a compromise between carrying capacity (most of your missions involve rescuing scientists, first responders, or civilians with special skills such as pilots) and durability.\n\nThe upgrades available for your vehicles fall into two categories: weapons and modifications. Modifications affect a specific vehicle only and are these: armor, speed, and ramming (the last of these represents a vehicle’s ease of turning intact infected into smears of roadkill). Weapons include such items as machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and a rail gun, each of which has three power level upgrades. Weapons are provided in the form of “pickups,” meaning that you drive over a weapon to equip it and only one may be equipped at a time.\n\nWhat story there is in the campaign unfolds largely through the mission briefings and monologues by survivors that you pick up and bring back to base. No explanation for what caused this breakout of zombie-ism is forthcoming although it’s evidently some kind of bio-toxin, and the military has you picking up various groups of folks to assist in containment and control efforts. Many of these groups will question (as you, the player, no doubt will) why the military is sending a lone, untrained civilian to perform these dangerous tasks and some will hint that the military is somehow behind the zombie plague, but whether these are the ravings of a paranoid few or glimpses of the truth is never made clear.\n\nOnce you’ve completed (for me after about 10-12 hours) or gotten tired of the story mode, there are two other single-player modes to explore: Blood Race and Slaughter. The Slaughter mode is basically a horde mode–you have one vehicle and you pick up powerups and kill as many waves of zombies as you can before your car is destroyed. Blood Race felt a bit like a less-fun version of Death Rally: you compete in a marathon of eight events composed of “eliminator” (destroy a target number of enemy AI vehicles before time runs out), “endurance” (survive as long as you can with a bomb on your vehicle by passing checkpoints to add time to the countdown), and “race” (what it sounds like). The race sections aren’t really up to DR because destroying an opponent only takes him out of the race for as long as it takes for him to respawn and most of the tracks are very curvy. Even using a gamepad, the steering for most vehicles is very slippery, so sliding around corners isn’t really an option for novice racers.\n\nIf you like top-down driving games and hate zombies, you may enjoy Zombie Driver HD. It’s not a great game but it’s not a terrible game and that’s about the best faint praise I can give it.","November 25, 2013","true","15.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

You take control over some human, but in how many you can drive a car and slaughter zombies? Not many. This is the thing that intrigue me here. And the game is properly named – Zombie Driver.\n\nThe game have a lot of video option. Except resolution you can find clouds, bloom, FXAA, fog, V-sync, SSAO, fullscreen and shadow type. Despite all those settings and the HD in the name, the game is not that good looking. It's not ugly, just okay. But to be honest most of the times you won't even notice the graphics quality, because there is a danger to be surrounded by zombies and you will drive all the time. The bad texture mostly noticeble when the game stop you to show something.\n\nYou play as a nameless character, a taxi driver, that is caught in a city during a zombie outbreak. He now have to do the military's job. Why? No one knows. Even in the game is mentioned that. To story is the worst thing here. It's not worth paying attention. You do few things here to progress it – save someone, clear a place to move the base, kill something that spawns zombies, plant a gas sparying device and the game is over. Some of the people that you save are saying things that are making hints for something deeper, but ultimately the story goes nowhere. Do some missions and get out of the city.\n\nI don't mind a bad story if the gameplay is good. Here it's just that. The controls are fine. I try controller, but I end up playing with mouse and keyboard. With them it's much more fun. You start with a your taxi and by doing missions you will unlock more vehicles and get money. The cash can be also earned by driving through zombies and break what can be break in the world. With the money you will upgrade your cars and weapons. The upgrades for all straightforward – more ammo, bigger explosions, faster car etc. So pretty much that's it. You drive around, kill zombies, get cash, upgrade vehicle. You don't have all the weapons in all the time. They are on the ground spread around the level and you have drive through them. And all are useful. The thing I found is you need a truck that can take a lot of damage and have good ramming points. After that other vehicles are useless, at least to me. I played with Auroch through most of the game and the only time I change it is when I need to save more than 10 people. For those cases I used a bus, which is pretty decent. The speed of both vehicles is fast enough. The map don't have many places that you can drive really fast. The vehicles have the tendency to fly in the air when you hit a wall. So for me there is no point of using some of sport cars. They can be destroyd easily.\n\nFrom time to time the army gives you a different vehicle – tank or a bulldozer or a truck. This is a neat idea to change a little bit the gameplay. Beside the main objective you have a secondary. It's wise to do them, because you get more money or car or something else. But ultimately the missions are as I mention above – kill, save or destroy.\n\nThere three bosses in the game and all are fun. They have some similar attack and you circle around them and shoot them. Near all the bosses have those places that spawn zombies constantly and it's wise to destroy them first.\n\nThe world is really great. It's not a huge map, but it's big enough. It's very diverse – train stations, houses, industrial zone, suburban area and so on. There are a lot of shorcuts that can be found and it's helpful know them in situations where you are in a hurry. Almost all objectives have some sort of time limit.\n\nSound design is okay. Shooting, engines, explosions and other effects are good, but the music is not memorable. It adds a little bit tension, it's fast paced, it's sometimes orchestral, it uses a lot of drums and guitars. It kinda remind me of Resident Evil the movie soundtrack and Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2. It's a game about shooting zombies and I don't excpect creepy music. I want high octane tracks and that's what i've got. But it's there somewhere in the background. Sadly I can't point one track that stands out above the other.\n\nVoice acting is bad, especially the people you save. They are all steriotypes you can think of – gamer, scared scientist, obnoxious  politician and so on. I know, the focus of the game is the gameplay, but the problem is you can't skip any dialog.\n\nIt seem so far that I dislike the game, but actually I don't. I'm just a little bit disappointed The game for me is just okay. I really like to run over zombies or to blast them to pieces, but the main campaign gets kinda repetetive, but thankfuly it's not that long. I took me around 4 hours the finish it. There is too many minor things that annoy me. Beside the campaign I have problems also with the weapons. They are only four. Don't get me wrong they are all great, especially when you upgrade the rockets and railgun, but they are only four. When you combine all this with the bad voice acting, the repetition, it's brings the game down for me. But there is one saving grace – the Blood  Race. It racing with other cars and zombies on the road. I had so much fun shooting other vehicles. There are 3 different type of races and I like all of them, especially the Eliminator. Here you have to destroy certain number of cars for a limited time. You can shoot them, you can ram them or combination of both. As a conclusion I would say I recommend the game, but on sale.","April 7","true","8.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/220820/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","How many ways are there to kill zombies now? A lot more than there needs to be, that’s for sure. I was socially inept enough to jump on the zombie bandwagon before it was cool, back before 28 Days Later and the Zombie Survival Guide brought them back from their long post-Thriller twilight. I’ve cooled on them enough that zombies as a bullet point is more likely to drive me away from a game, so keep that in mind while I explain just how much I enjoy Zombie Driver HD.\n\nThe main draw of Zombie Driver is the story mode, posing you as a nameless motorist in a city beset by the undead plague. Every mission takes place on the same wide-open GTA-style map, sending you to different areas to rescue survivors, destroy zombie strongholds, or defeat enormous bosses. Ramming is sufficient to splatter most zombies but for bigger targets there are weapon pickups scattered all over, giving you machine guns or flamethrowers to cull the hordes with. You’ll also find repair pickups (which you will need because damage can come in huge bursts) and money, used between missions to upgrade your cars. And that is cars plural, because you unlock sports cars and limos and police cruisers over the course of the campaign. There’s not a lot of variety in the missions and the characters are all voiced so badly it’s funny, but they make simple excuses to run over thousands of zombies.\n\nThe driving really is the best part of the game, appropriate for a game called Zombie Driver. Your vehicles are different degrees of responsive but all are fast and all make satisfying messes out of the undead. You’ll fight different kinds of zombies including dogs and giant exploders and worse, and they all erupt into fountains of giblets and leave crimson streaks on the pavement. It’s a viscerally satisfying game, even if the sound effects aren’t always up to the task of capturing the slaughter. Weapons do tons of damage and clear out crowds, and you get mounting monetary bonuses for long streaks of carnage. Much like in Carmaggeddon, It’s easy to lose track of mission objectives just because you’re having so much fun roadkilling things.\n\nThe HD in the title does indeed mean this is a remaster of a previous Zombie Driver, but with more going for it than just prettier graphics. The campaign is longer, with a full 31 missions and several new bosses to battle. There are new vehicles as well, which can also be used in the game’s Blood Race and Slaughter modes. Blood Race is, again, much like Carmaggeddon where you race against other cars, crushing zombies and blowing up your opponents to progress. Slaughter is you against mounting waves of zombies with its own progression system of weapons and upgrades.

The HD upgrade finally takes care of the low framerate and unresponsive controls, meaning you are now stuck with a game that tries to do a lot gameplay-wise but fails and ends up being plain mediocre.\n\nZombie Driver consists of three different game modes turned into one package, Story Mode feels slightly like the old topdown GTAs (drive around doing missions, it is not a consistent "openworld" though), "Blood Race" is basically car combat racing somewhere between Rock'n'Roll Racing and Twisted Metal and "Slaughter" is your Horde/Survival-Arcademode versus waves of enemies. So far, so unexciting.\n\nA few minutes into each mode you realize everything is really dull and samey. Mission-types keep repeating themselves (basically just pick up people, destroy stuff, get stuff, kill a boss - sometimes they mix it up with a timer) and are generally far too long. Navigating the city is kinda awkward - it is the age of the GPS and after Saint's Row I simply do not want to look at tiny mapscreens anymore - integrate that stuff in the playing area instead. That being said, I am also missing destructible enviroments - driving through winding alleys in a bus, sportscar or tank is simply not fun especially when you get stuck in silly wodden crates or brickwalls that you should easily be able to destroy with the various weapons at hand - I want to cut my own aisles into the city layout, thank you very much (and considering the low-poly nature of everything and seeing how the game is PhysX enabled as well, this shouldn't be impossible to do)!\n\nThis already takes a lot of the speed and arcade-fun out of the game, but the way too limiting ammo-cap and the massive slowdown from ramming into a horde of zombies further hinder me reveling in car-carnage, blood and gore. They could have made it fast, fun and exciting, but decided to be slow (having to clean an area before you can pick up survivors is SO tedious after, like, the second time!), boring and somewhat realistic. The entire story mode just feels so static and confined - it is a shame.\n\nUnfortunately, the other two modes - Blood Race and Slaughter use the very same foundation as Story Mode and don't really  turn the gamefeel upside down enough to be any more entertaining. The entire game lacks a sense of "badassery" and as a result turns into a forgettable experience. Instead of advertising tons of content and spending time on crafting the various modes, they should have shortened the game and made sure that the core gameplay is enjoyable. As far as I am concerned, this is not the case. From a technical point of view, it is a step-up from the original release, but gameplay-wise it could have used an overhaul as well. Overall, a lame experience.","January 4, 2014","false","7.5"," 50 of 85 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","50","85","3","0"

I'm looking forward to trying race mode later.\n\nI always have a nostalgic hankering for a decent top down driving game but am usually disappointed. Zombie Driver HD however is fantastic fun..   Rich environments much of which you can destroy, engaging story, awesome voice acting (in the best B movie tradition), convincing hoards that can swamp you if you're careless, great explosive visual effects, quality audio and HUGE zombie bodycounts.\n\nWhile you are required to develop a certain amount of driving skill it should'nt be too frustrating for novices of the top down style. missions can be completed at a slower pace, sticking to the streets but don't worry about leaving the road, the maps are sensibly designed so you don't constantly get stuck on scenery or in dead ends. As you become skilled with the handbrake you'll be pulling donuts and rail gunning through hundreds of bloody undead.\n\nThe different vehicles work well and purchaseable upgrades mean you're always tempted to stray from the mission to grab extra cash found around the city.\n\nThe atmosphere created in the game is great, weather changes, night time lighting, the army presence, shadows of jet fighters roaring overhead, vehicle getting covered in blood and a constant tension created by time critical mission elements all add the feel of this great little game.\n\nOne thing I would like added is the ability to move the camera a little to scan the environment. Playing with an xbox controller this seems untuitively what the second stick should be used for, although it's arguable that you shouldn't be able to see much further than the street you're driving in.\n\nSo in my opinion the developers have done a great job of creating a top down driving game set in a zombie apocalypse, if that sounds like something you need, you should probably grab it in a sale like I did, or at full price if you're feeling flush.\n\nFUN.","December 5, 2015","true","11.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

I say flaw because if this game was multiplayer, I am pretty confident none of us would ever play another game ever again except this one. Explosions, endless bullet spray, flames...flames at the corner of my brain, fodder, more flames and a laser which basically just punches a hole through an entire city block. Now all that control in one mans hands is fun, place it in three, have a timer and endless enemy spawns and you have a pixelated armageddon catering for an endless maniacal laughter.\n\n2) There is a scientific equation law here which is never broken. The equation is this... Zombie + Speeding Car = Tomato Sauce. Problem is not everyone likes tomato sauce. Some like Bbq, others go for mayonaise, some like wasabi and some boring people dont want any sauce at all. Since the developer/s do not want to limit their audience they should really provide an option in game where you can either change color of sauce, or even have the option of 'no sauce'.\n\nMaybe modders can come to the developers rescue on the second point since the game has been completely opened up for them to run mayhem. Personally i like to place several sauces at the same time on my fodder, so give me white, red, green, in fact even make a rainbow sauce please so i can really paint the town.\n\nBasically the story mode is rather linear in the way it plays out like carmageddon, so that you run over various zombies picking up people from various locations in the city. Each time you pick someone up you get treated to a small dialogue of the story which more often than not pokes a bit of fun at itself and the zombie game genre providing some laugh out loud moments. But it does become a bit stale after a while because most of the levels are basically the same thing over and over. You just grind away making money so you can buy more cars and upgrades.\n\nMost of the zombies really do the same thing, they just cause your car's health meter to go down when they hit it while your standing still or if they throw a projectile at it. It doesnt take much intelligence to find the zombie spawn points which are usually a converted zombie bus, or a massive zombie hive and blow it up first. There is one zombie which really is a major pain though and thats the fat zombie, which is somewhat parroted from the 'boomer' in 'left for dead' if he gets close enough to your car he will explode causing massive health damage to your car if your still within his blast radius.\n\nThe HD graphics in this game are TRULY AMAZING. I found myself a number of times just parking and looking at the beauty around the place regardless to the fact that I was being pounded into the concrete. I just had to look at the houses and green houses and go 'isnt that pretty, go away zombie leave me alone i'm admiring this flowering bush'...\n\nThe other grand mention of this game are the two other modes. This is where the game REALLY shines.\n\nFirst there is a Slaughter mode where its your job to last as long as possible driving around a small map collecting upgrades and money as the waves of zombie spawns slowly get worse each round. There is an achievement to last for 30 waves. This is really challenging and more often than not personally found that my car was exploding into tiny debri even around wave 10. Place this mode in multiplayer and it would be awesome.\n\nSecond there is a tournament mode. The tournament caters three events.\n1) Blood race. Race around a track against challenging ai racers poling for first position.\n2) Endurance mode. Race around a track by yourself, trying to hit the checkpoints in time against a devilish timer.\n3) Elimination mode. Race and blow up as many AI cars as possible.\n\nAgain if all this was in multiplayer it would bring back the feeling of the good old days of 'rock and roll racing' google it.\n\nSeriously enjoyed the graphics and the fun of the modes, just really, really wish it was multi player and could turn off that damn red color and change it to pretty rainbows. Still recommend, but if you don't like tomato sauce I would give this one a miss until modders or devs give more options.\n\nFinally here is an interesting video which shows the evolution behind Zombie Driver HD so far...\nhttps://youtu.be/a-wNhKdML38","May 21","true","33.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

I've never seen a game like this with such a large amount of small annoying problems that all add up to one big disappointment.

It's too bad, because in the hands of a real game company that knows how to make a real game, this could have been great. Or actually probably not since it's vehicle combat meaning you only fire in one direction: forward. Then you back up, reposition, line up, hit the brakes, turn around, speed up, reposition more and ♥♥♥♥-all else to get more shots off in a straight line before quickly having to do all that again. lol.\n\nThere are a ton of other problems with the game but it really isn't worth my time talking about it in detail. The bottom line is that this is just not fun for long because of poor design concepts and new flaws popping up constantly as the game progresses.\n\n4/10","November 8, 2013","false","5.6"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

You just spent 90% of your time to go pick some guys up or to destroy something. That's the main problem of the game. Another problem is the scrolling speed. When you pick a fast car and if you use turbo it is going too fast and you don't see well what you're doing and where you're going.\nHowever, I still find this game fun. It's a no brainer, that's why and I like the idea of blasting away zombies with a mounted minigun, laser, rocket on a taxi,bus,limousine etc. But one thing I don't recommend is to buy it full price.","December 2, 2013","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are a talented driver (I guess) and you are recruited to help out the army as they try to evaculate or establish a base. Missions are fun, fast and filled with satisfying gibbing of zombies everywhere. Typical mission is going to pick up a few specific survivors to help build the base (Doctors, Shipcrew, etc) or going to defend a specific objective. There are secondary objectives, and the game does a good job of mixing up the mission objectives.\n\nSimply put, this is a great game to sit back and relax with, slamming into a billion zombies. I have only played the Campaign so far, but there is two additional modes to the game! Really excited to dive in further. Absolutely worth the price paid.\n\nTLDR; Fantastic fun arcade driver game, in the vein of Carmageedon and others.

Skip forward to 2015 and I picked up the ZD HD complete pack for just over £2 and have been playing it nearly 5 days now, this time however with an xbox controller.\n\nIn short the game visualy looks very nice, easily some of the best "indie" game graphics available even against 2014/15 offerings. SFX compliment the game well nice solid sounding guns and squishy zombie splatter under the tires. Heavy Metal BGM during the survival mini games gets your adrenalin pumping but is less suited perhaps to the missions of the main game, it is good but can become repetative. Voice acting ... well at least there is some, lets just say it doesnt add nor detract from the game, and I've defo heard a lot lot worse.\n\nGame can be tricky to control with kyb and mouse and is definatly easier to be prescise with a stick controller like xbox/ps3 controller.\n\nMain game offers 31 missions each taking between 3-10 mins to complete on your first play through, each with highscore tables and secondary optional missions offering limited replay value but atleast it has. These can be replayed in any order, using any car you have unlocked with ay upgrades you have unlocked making a replay easier to obtain a better score or to do secondary missions.\n\nSurvival mode offers erm.... 7 ish arena maps with the aim to survive as long as possible with waves or increasing numbers and toughness of mobs, earning upgrades each wave to assist you and random weapon and bonus score drops. each map having its own high score tables. This is easily the most fun mode and will keep you playing for significant time after having completed the main game. To be fair some of these maps can feel a little small or tight to move around and can feel like you are just driving in a circle, but most are nice arenas with multiple paths to manouvre around.\n\nRace mode, this is somewhat similar to a classic game Death Rally from the 90s, I havent played much of this so far but is a series of tournaments made up of a set number of events, such as race, checkpoint and elimination. This can be a little frustrating as it is very easy to get stitched up right at the end of an event after leading 95% of a race. This mode seems to be 75% player skill and 25% luck.\n\nMoney spent on car and weapon upgrades from the main game are for the main game only, in the main game new cars are unlocked through playthrough. In survival upgrades  are earned in each game for that game only by completing waves cars are unlocked in this mode by unlocking them in the main game. In race mode cars have to be unlocked with money, money earned and spent on cars and upgrades in race mode is for race mode only.\n\nI can not comment of the race mode achievements, however achievements for the main game are not difficult to obtain. There is one that you should be aware of before starting your first playthrough which if missed will require a full 2nd replay.... which is probably best as it will be easier with some experience having played the game, and one that will require a little skill and luck and several play throughs requiring to complete last mission with less than 10% health. The survial achievements are easily obtainable and fun to boot. With my limited time spent of race mode, I do not think they will be too hard just frustrating needing several replays that will take time, depending on skill or rather luck.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about ZD HD is whether you have 5 mins to play a game or 4 hours, it will keep you entertained and survival mode will always suck you in for just one more try.\n\nIf your paying full price just pickup the main game and the Apocalypse pack well worth the money. If its on sale then buy the complete edition, either way this game is easily a must buy for your collection.\n\n\n***EDIT***\n\nJust a quick note, system specs are i7 4500HQ, 16gb, R9 265x and game runs fine at max settings 1080p, a little slowdown ( just dips below 30fps ) at points in a couple of the later missions, no slow down on survival or race modes. Accidently run with onboard 4600HD for the first couple of missions and would be fair to say it handled max settings well around 28-38 fps but would be fair to say later missions would pose a problem given the 265x diped below 30 at times, should be ok on HD or HD+ however with 4600HD.","January 18, 2015","true","26.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

How about running over hordes of squishy enemies? You can do both these things in Zombie Driver HD. This is the re-release of a 2009 game with improved graphics and additional content, and while the game seems to have mediocre meta ratings, the user review scores on Steam are very positive (in the 90’s). The game was released on consoles like Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, but the Steam version seems to have a lot more achievements than the console ones (more than 100).\n\nThe game’s story is actually very rudimentary, where all you know is that some sort of disaster has occurred, creating zombies all over the city. The opening and closing animations are like motion comics, where they just kind of zoom around on a single painting (not really movies). This means that you mostly pick up the plot from the intros to each level, where your commanding officer gives you your orders. It’s worth noting here that the voice acting is pretty bad, and has some grammatical errors and misplaced emphases. It’s not that big a deal since the game is mostly zombie squishing, and the story is just for adding flavor.\n\nZombie Driver is a top down car shooter where you drive around a large city map infested with thousands of zombies. There are about 30 levels in total, and the game “world” resets between each mission so you can grind for money or achievements if you want. There are only 4 different types of weapon (machine gun, flame thrower, rocket launcher, and rail gun) and the ammo is scarce enough that you can’t just drive around firing wildly. Fortunately, most of your kills will probably be from squashing ♥♥♥♥♥es with your ride. Things like ammunition and repair kits respawn every few minutes so if you take your time, the game is actually pretty easy. There’s no way to change the difficulty, by the way. By completing side objectives during certain missions, you can unlock different cars to drive, each with different stats for speed, armor, and ramming power. If you have the DLC, the best car for most of the game is the Auroch truck. Vehicle upgrades are separate for each car, so you don’t want to spend all your money upgrading your early cars, but the weapon unlocks/upgrades carry over for all cars.\n\nAs for the enemies you’ll be facing, most of them are weak shambling zombies that barely slow you down as you trample over them, but after the first few missions you’ll meet the guy that makes you drive cautiously all the way to the end of the game – the exploding fat zombie. He’s pretty much the only enemy you try not to run over, and this prevents you from just holding down the nitro and boosting around the map. There are also a few bosses to fight, but they’re basically all the same in gameplay (rooted to the ground throwing stuff at you). Since health and ammo pickups respawn on the map, you can use hit and run tactics on bosses, and run away to heal if you’re about to die.\n\nPros:\n+Very nice gruesome graphics for such a small game. I think it was about 1gb to download.\n+Fun for casual zombie squashing, and if you want, you can replay levels you’ve already beaten (but these don’t “save” meaning your main campaign save file doesn’t keep the money found or cars unlocked from level replays). That means the only real reason to replay levels is to unlock achievements.\n+I enjoy games where you can (but don’t have to) grind for money to buy persistent upgrades. I originally thought this game was like the Alien Shooter / Zombie Shooter games, and it kind of is similar in the way you take extra time on each level just to look for extra money to buy upgrades.\n\nCons:\n-The game gets repetitive by the middle of the campaign. Every mission is basically the same (clear out the zombies in a particular area) and it all takes place on the same map. The enemies don’t get any stronger, just more numerous. At least the map is big and you’re constantly upgrading your cars.\n-The game camera swings wildly at times since it seems to be on a slight delay. This means you can do a sharp skidding turn, and a second later the camera rotates 180 degrees. I didn’t get a headache playing the game, but I can see how it would bother some players. There’s also a bug (possibly intentional) where it’s possible for you to get “stuck” on certain obstructions. Despite being a top down game, you can still make small jumps if you’re going fast enough (like hitting a wall at full turbo speed). This means once in a while you’ll get stuck on a wall or a fence and need to restart the level. It’s really annoying if you’ve already completed the mission objectives and are just running around looking for money before ending the stage, suddenly you get stuck and have to start all over again.\n-The “story” is pretty generic and predictable, so don’t play it for the story.\n\nOverall Zombie Driver HD is a great game if you enjoy top down shooters and mowing down massive hordes of weak enemies. Seriously, by the last level you probably can’t go half a screen without running over a dozen zombies. If you’re just playing for the Steam achievements, I can tell you that about half of them are pretty easy to acquire, but the other half require a lot of grinding (kill 10,000 zombies each with machine gun/rockets/fire, etc.).  If you have half an hour to kill (literally), you can beat one story mission at a time until you finish the campaign and move on to the other 2 game modes: Blood Race and Slaughter. Blood Race is an actual racing mode, unlike the main game where it’s just you vs zombies. Think of it as a top down version of Rage racing, with machine guns and missiles. Slaughter mode is a survival game where you try to live through rounds against increasingly dangerous waves of zombies (more fat exploders).\n","February 12, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They've basically fixed everything, and improved the quality of the effects. I noticed slight graphical improvement with the environment, but not much. The dialogue was barely fixed.

Drunk people don't do that or sound like that. STOP IT!\n\nMissions were improved, and I don't remember the original having the huge boss fights which can actually be challenging towards the middle of it. I also got the DLC with the car and the truck. The truck helps a lot, but you'll also have to upgrade the dlc car if you want to beat those timed missions with... *hick* time to spare. *hick*\n\nOne of the things people wanted was multiplayer, and I'm really hoping to see that in a possible sequel.","November 25, 2013","true","16.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, everything in the game is against you.  When driving, you have to collect fuel, health and ammo, but you don't know where to find these meaning you run out of fuel or ammo, or your health does down and you die.  You can either try and rescue the survivors but with not enough fuel, or you can try and find fuel but then there is not enough time remaining to rescue the survivors.  Some of the zombie groups must have hundreds of zombies in, and even with a tough car, you car easily gets damaged.  Then there are super zombies who will damage your car even further, and even throw objects at your car!  At least make the zombies realistic, not super thinking toughened zombies who will seek out objects to throw at your car!  The graphics are awesome as very detailed, and in theory this is a good game, but in practice it is awful.  You end up keep being killed which puts you off playing the game any more.","June 27, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

Depending on the cause, it can also be referred to as seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness or airsickness.[1]\n\nDizziness, fatigue, and nausea are the most common symptoms of motion sickness.[2] Sopite syndrome in which a person feels fatigue or tiredness is also associated with motion sickness. Nausea in Greek means seasickness (naus means ship).[3][4] If the motion causing nausea is not resolved, the sufferer will usually vomit. Vomiting won't relieve the feeling of weakness and nausea, which means the person could vomit until the cause of nausea is found."\n\nWell, "the cause of the nausea" has been found and its name is "Zombie Driver HD".\nSeriously, if you were to design a game to cause "a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement", this would be it.\nZombie Driver HD, is basically a vomit simulator . .  . in HD (or should that be "stimulator"? I dont know. I've just been playing it, so im fairly disorientated).\n\nI would highly recommend trying the demo before you buy, as watching the trailer does not do justice to the epic degree of nausea felt while actualy playing.\n\nThen again, you might, (like I did), think "♥♥♥♥ it. It looks cool. Im getting it."\nMore power to you. You too can be the ower of the most powerful "multicolour yawn" inducing set of camera options in gaming.\n","August 29, 2014","false","2.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","1"

In a game like this, you'd expect to be driving around at high speeds, mowing down hordes and hordes. But no, instead when you navigate around you must take your time and try not to ram into every little thing! It slowed down the game so badly, and this has got to be one of the worst parts, since the 1 hour I spent was carefully driving slowly, so I don't bump into something.\n\nWhat about the other 30 dreadful minutes I spent? Well, let's say it was just killing a few zombies here and there, but it wasn't exciting in any way. Just shooting them, drive away, shoot, probably run over them a bit, it wasn't too satisfying really. The bosses were also ridiculously hard for some reason, I just stopped though by the time I killed the 1st one, it was so boring.\n\nOh yeah, I completely forgot there was a story that was just shoved in, trying to interest you, but it didn't. At least they tried to make one though, but I would've prefered nothing.\n\nI hate this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/220820/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: Take the fun of Carmageddon, the viewing angle from GTA (the original ones) and strap weapons on your taxi and you're good to go on a quest to save the city.\n\nIn Zombie Driver (HD) you are some dude who drives a taxi. Military ("if they even are the military", says the random hippie) enlists you to save a bunch of civilians in a zombie infested city. Mow those zombies! Mayor will pay you a bonus for their smashed bodies! Gruesome, silly kind of humour is cultured in the overly dramatized monologues everyone else gets to give you when you meet them.\n\nZombie driving gets a lot more fun once they strap a machine gun to your car. Later, you'll get equipped with flamethrowers, rocket launchers and even experimental rail guns that shoot blue, helical rays of mass destruction. Not to forget, a tongue-in-cheek car game wouldn't be complete without a turbo booster. Between missions you get to upgrade your cars (new ones unlocked every few missions) and weapons.\n\nThere are no surprises in the zombie varieties: in addition to the regular, shambling corpses, there are legions of zombie dogs, wailing slingers of industrial junk, bloated monsters of the exploding variety and of course the hulk. Naturally, it is more difficult to ram the bigger ones and especially in large groups.\n\nStory mode has two kinds of basic missions: 1) taxi missions: go and save people from buildings around the town (usually with generous time limits), and 2) slaughter missions: go somewhere and kill everything. Here, everything includes the zombie spawners (introduced by the HD version): enormous Jabba the Hut creatures that blurt out more of the monsters (it figures that these are not your average zombies after all). In addition, there are the awesome cleaning and destroying special missions where you get to drive e.g. tanks, with infinite ammo of course. HD version also has a couple of bosses that add nicely into the game's limited lore.\n\nStory wasn't the strong part of the original Zombie Driver and it has only been patched partly by the HD upgrade. It ends abrubtly but rather appropriately although leaving your contribution vague: it is unfortunately never explained why the army (or whatever they are) needed a random taxi driver to sort their mess.\n\nTwo other game modes are more like what the game was designed for: there's the copy of Death Rally called Blood Race (though you can't destroy your opponents permanently) with several different tournaments and challenge missions. Unfortunately, career mode is missing. You'll get money for winning races and can then buy limited upgrades to your car. On the other hand, Slaughter mode is an endless killing spree of perpetually spawning zombies for higher points to show off in the leaderboards. Here only death ends the level.\n\nGame is fun and pretty awesome. However, it is easy to get stuck in corners and sometimes it is not clear what items can be driven through resulting in further stuckiness. Mob spawning can be ruthless and illogical, especially in Slaughter mode: zombies tend not to walk as fast (or at all?) when you are not seeing them in front of you in the camera and the game considers it fair to spawn a group of exploding zombies right behind you when you are reversing.\n\nDespite the few complaints, I can give it thumbs up. Graphics are nice, sounds are not irritating and gameplay is very nice (I used keyboard and mouse). Also, the improvements from the original Zombie Driver are very welcome: e.g. they made booster a separate item from weapons, added a map and made the story mode more interesting with the zombie spawners, bosses and special vehicles. If you have doubts but are interested, you can also grab it on sale for 2 euros or less.","April 21, 2015","true","22.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Basically you're a survivor in the Zombie Apocalypse.  The city streets have thousands of Zombies roaming around.  You are a civilian, you start with a basic car that can run over zombies.  You earn money doing missions, which you can use to upgrade your vehicles with higher powered Machine guns, flame throwers, rocket launchers ect.  The game is not open world, but mission based.  You have to rescue people from these areas before they are killed by the zombies, so on a time limit.  Some are more open missions where you need to make it to different supply points clear the area of zombies, then get the supplies.  Or some missions are just to clear a zombie outbreak and survive.\n\nThe game is a top down style.  Controls are straight forward.  There are power ups located across the map for Car repairs, or ammo for your different weapons.  But Ammo doesn't stack.  If you just loaded up your rocket launcher, then picked up ammo for your machine gun, your vehicle switches to Machine guns, and your rockets disappear.\n\nAs for the story line.  I wish they got rid of the military.  Would be alot better story if you were with a small handful of useless survivors.  Instead you have a fully functioning military base.  They have tanks, Choppers hovering above the base to secure it from any zombies coming to your camp.  There are survival critical missions to save certain doctors, engineers needed for the bases survival ect.  But instead of getting out the tanks, or flying over to the boarded up houses with a chopper and mowing down everything in site, they send the lone civilian in a sports car with limited weapons.  Eventually they will start letting you get some military vehicles.\n\nAll in all, lots of fun to play, lots of action and mass zombie deaths.  Big explosions and Blood smeared all over the city.","November 26, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Racing mode was fun (single player only). i didnt try the arena mode. Story mode has zero variety, but thats forgivable i guess, you drive around killing zombies and pick up powerups and upgrade your car. the thing that makes me NOT recommend - is that i break out into cold sweats from getting dizzy while driving. i think this may be due to the camera... if i played this for an hour i think i would throw up and need to lie down. i dont know - that may be just me... but other top down games like Nation Red or Gatling Gears, did not make me feel this way. too bad. it had some things going for it. maybe playing a mission once in a while or playing a race when waiting for a download or something would be cool. i also liked that it had full controller support, thats always nice to have in a game. But overall - if you are sensitive to cameras spinning without your input- i would avoid. OK i went back and tried 1 more mission - with the 3rd and last camera option....

You drive cars equipped with machine guns, flame throwers, rockets, shock weapons nitro boosts and more. There are plenty of weapons, vehicles and game modes to choose from. The great thing is that for those that grew up with GTA 1 and 2 on the playstation 1 there actually is a 'retro camera' mode where the free camera will fix itself just as the good old days.\n\nThe game is only 10€ and when on sale it goes down to 3€ INCLUDING all the DLC. This game is dirt cheap even at 10€. The story mode is well thought out, voiced, filled with multiple giant maps and a wide variety of different missions. On top of the pretty extensive story mode there are a ton of challenges, zombie killing combo modes and even races! The death races are crazy fun and brutally hard and those alone will keep you busy for quite a while. What's even more incredible is that for that small price tag, you don't only get a game jam packed with content, it actually looks really damn good too! Better than most more expensive games.\n\nIt's seriouslt almost a crime not to pick this up, especially when you are running into it when it's on sale.","February 14","true","16.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The gameplay is dull, and early on too difficult. The voice acted cutscenes seem too long and there is no way to skip them, forcing you to endure their pain.\n\nOverall, do not buy this game on Steam. Even at 50% or 75% off, it is a rip off.

However my new laptop has a Nvidia Optimus chipset (Intel + Nvidia).  If i launch the game with the integrated Intel HD4600 it start and runs, but cannot keep up.  If i launch with the Nvidia card I get the configuration utility which only shows the Intel HD4600, if i try to launch I get a Microsoft Visual C++ error.\n\nThere have been multiple threads about the issue, i have tried all possible solutions but no luck.  This has to do with the video card (and the fact the configuration utility cannot even choose my Nvidia card).  My setup works on all 40 of my other steam games without a problem (even tried the Nvidia on Monkey Island, a little overkill but it still works).\n\nThe game itself is fun an brillant, however due to the fact no one with the Nvidia Optimus can get any support from the game developers i would not purchase this game (there was just an update in August so the game is far from abandoned).

I mean the shooting is ok and so is the whole gun and repair mechanic but the fact you cant drive three feet without your car suddenly not listening to you is impossible.","August 31, 2014","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the game. Super easy, super fun, super cheesy story, super addictive.\n\nI realy like the way it puts you in world and gives you huge amount of zombies to kill. It gives you an awesome feeling of driving over hords of zombies. It is easy to play but it also feels like it should. Different types of vehicles drive different and you can upgrade them. A few different types of weapons.\n\nAlso the missions doesn't feel too alike. There are few bosses that are fun to destroy.\n\nBeside campaign there is race mode where you race around the city and an arena mode where you defend from wave after wave of zombies.\n\n7/10","September 2, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is so bland and uninteresting and it's so fast paced you don't even know (or care) about what you're doing, whether its finding a survivor or just running over zombies (basically the only two things you can do in the game). That being said, all you really do is  run over zombies and  try to steer a car with a wonky turning system. This is literally a game about driving, they could have at least gotten that right. The game looks good and all, and the achievements seem like they would keep the repetitive game alive, but all and all, it just isn't fun after 10 minutes. It tries to tell a story but 20 minutes in you'll be scratching your head at the pathetic dialogue and nonexistent "plot". You just drive over zombies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShaggyMoose/recommended/220820/","ShaggyMoose","ShaggyMoose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShaggyMoose/","408 products in account","Bottom line:\nAn enjoyable and attractive, if somewhat frustrating, top-down driving game in the vein of the original GTA games. Has less complex missions, however spices things up with seriously large hordes of zombies to brutalise with heavy weapons!\n\nPros:\nVideo and audio are generally pleasing. The maps and vehicles have a lot of gritty detail and weather and lighting effects are put to good use. The particle and gore effects are suitably over-the-top and make firing rockets into zombie mobs a very satisfying experience.\nMultiple game modes provide a great amount of content for the price and also offer a variety of experiences. This is a good thing, because the story missions generally feel much the same. In particular, I found the Slaughter mode (arena) to be challenging and required both tactical and strategic thinking to reach round 20 and beyond. Racing includes a variety of different events, in which the aim is either racing, destroying opponents, or driving as far as possible with a bomb attached to your car! Sadly, I found all modes spoiled more often that not by the difficulty in identifying "hard" obstacles and the unpredictable handling of the vehicles during collisions.\nWeapon variety is decent and effective, but fairly uninspired. Power-ups are all incremental improvements until the last level, where power is doubled. Specialisation usually plays second fiddle to whatever happens to be lying around your general vicinity at the time.\nNo crashes in the ten or so hours spent in game (Windows 8).\nCons:\nUnpredictable behaviour when hitting walls and other obstructions; sometimes you bounce, sometimes you stop dead, sometimes you instantly spin 180 degrees. A little frustrating in the main game, immensely frustrating in the race events! Came close to rage quitting a few times in this mode... Apart from this, the controls are fine (used M&KB).\nWhat "story" there is remains utterly predictable throughout and voice acting is excruciating. I am sure its tongue in cheek, but its still horrible.\nPerformance drops and wavers noticeably once there are a lot of zombies on the screen. This is mainly an issue in arena mode, where huge hordes are a common occurence. This is on an i5 3570K with an AMD 6950.\nDLC:\nMostly forgettable...\nThe included vehicles are overpowered and spoil the progression of the story mode a little.\nIf you are still looking for more of the same after completing the game, you won't be disappointed with the additional race and arena maps. If you are expecting something different, don't bother.","February 28, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example a limosine that can save 6 people or a race car that can save 3 people. If you use to limosine you can do the mission in one run and with the race car you have to get the 3 people, go back to base and get the other 3 (Sometimes you don't get that much time to do that).

Has less complex missions, however spices things up with seriously large hordes of zombies to brutalise with heavy weapons!\n\nPros:\nVideo and audio are generally pleasing. The maps and vehicles have a lot of gritty detail and weather and lighting effects are put to good use. The particle and gore effects are suitably over-the-top and make firing rockets into zombie mobs a very satisfying experience.\nMultiple game modes provide a great amount of content for the price and also offer a variety of experiences. This is a good thing, because the story missions generally feel much the same. In particular, I found the Slaughter mode (arena) to be challenging and required both tactical and strategic thinking to reach round 20 and beyond. Racing includes a variety of different events, in which the aim is either racing, destroying opponents, or driving as far as possible with a bomb attached to your car!

For example a limosine that can save 6 people or a race car that can save 3 people. If you use to limosine you can do the mission in one run and with the race car you have to get the 3 people, go back to base and get the other 3 (Sometimes you don't get that much time to do that).

It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it.","September 7, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks good and all, and the achievements seem like they would keep the repetitive game alive, but all and all, it just isn't fun after 10 minutes.
