"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wangflotilla/recommended/213330/","wangflotilla","Wang Flotilla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wangflotilla/","57 products in account","So, I do recommend this game, because it's wicked fun, especially with two players, but it does have some problems.\n\nI got this game because I'm really into Batman, and I wanted to try to get my 7 year old daughter into it too.  I was playing Batman: Arkham City with her, but my wife found out about it, and she was not happy.  So, we agreed that this way more kid-friendly game was probably a good compromise.  And it is pretty kid-friendly as far as content goes.  The characters are fun, and building LEGO stuff in-game to make vehicles and such is a blast.  As far as my goal of getting my daughter into Batman, it worked like a charm, and now we're watching the movies and TV shows, and as soon as she can read I will start getting her some of the old comics.  So there's that.\n\nNow the problems:  controls and bugs.  The controls are pretty decent in single-player mode, but all hell breaks loose in multiplayer mode.  Inside a level, if you and your partner are together in the same location, and one of you moves even a tiny bit while the other is doing something where you have to stay in one spot (i.e. aiming a batarang or Superman's heat vision, spraying something with water, etc.) the aim gets totally thrown off.  If your partner is say, just hypothetically, a willful 7-year-old girl who will not listen to repeated cries of "STOP MOVING, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!", it becomes hard to complete a task sometimes.  Also, if you and your partner split up, the screen splits to give each player a view of where they're going, but it doesn't split just horizontally or vertically, it splits based on where you've moved.  So, if your partner has moved above you, it splits somewhat horizontally.  However if they move off at an angle, the screen splits perpendicular to that angle, so it's not always nice and square and you end up not being able to see much.  Controls with the vehicles are mostly good, except for the flying vehicles for some reason.  It seems like they're unable to move in the vertical axis and the horizontal at the same time.  When completing flying challenges, it was mostly moving forward, stopping, then gaining or losing altitude, then stopping, then moving forward again, rather than a more fluid motion.  If the flying vehicles controlled more like the flying characters it would be better.\n\nAlso, maybe this game was rushed, or maybe it's just me, but there seem to be a surprising amount of bugs and stuff in the game.  Sometimes it crashed if another program required attention or if a notification popped up from Windows, and sometimes it crashed for no reason at all.  Also, there were many places in the game where a character could get stuck and there'd be no choice but to have the other character go somewhere to unstick them.  For example, you can get stuck in a few of the gargoyles on the rooftops of Gotham City, and this would require the other player to stop what they were doing and go enter the subway system, so that both characters would be reset to whereever you exited the subway.  It's little, but when you're playing with a kid, and you can't drop what you're doing to go unstick them for the fourth time, it can become an issue.\n\nOh, and my wife wants me to note that since the male characters tend to have more useful powers than the female characters in this game, that the unlockable Batgirl character should've been allowed to use both Batman's and Robin's power suits.  I tend to agree.\n\nAll this aside, the game is really fun, with a ton of characters to unlock, vehicles to unlock, decent level diversity, and a pretty fun overworld to explore.  The inclusion of most of the 1989 Batman film soundtrack and the main theme of the 1978 Superman film is awesome.  The game ran smoothly on old hardware (3 year old video card in a 7 year old computer) and Xbox controller integration is very nice.  I'm definitely looking forward to further LEGO games, especially LEGO Marvel Superheroes.\n\n8/10, would play again.","January 31, 2014","true","98.3"," 235 of 249 people (94%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","94","235","249","18","7"

If your friends will visit your place, it has 2P local co-op too.  When the worst thing I can level against a game is "it's a bit similar to the last one, but not in a bland way", I would say that gets my seal of approval, yeah. Huge tip: rush through the story mode ASAP before you go back for collectables/unlocks, the simple ability to swap characters/turn on some of the cheats really makes that more pleasant.\n\nMy only complaint: game does not feature Green Arrow, but Black Canary got in somehow. Ah well, that'll probably come up in the sequel it teases at the end. (Spoilers: it teases a sequel at the end which will probably be crazier than this.)","April 27, 2014","true","23.1"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","47","50","3","0"

Not only that, but because of this that means there are many criminals hidden that you have to defeat before aquiring them as spare characters and the missions, like the last game, are replayable to get all the secrets that you either missed because you didn't see them or missed because you didn't have the powers needed.\n\nThere are a lot of villains in this one, some obscure ones too like Hush too. The story is very fun, but also quite epic too which is what I've grown to learn from these Lego games and I have a hell of a lot of fun with them too.\n\nIf you liked the pervious game, you'll love this one and if you want to buy this one and havn't played the first you're likly to enjoy it as there is no continuation with the story of either games, but it has been improved immensly since the last game.","October 14, 2014","true","15.2"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","39","45","7","1"

Like Batman comic books. Indifferent to the 80's-90's movies. Disliked Lego Batman 1.\n\nImpressions: TT's continual changing of the hub world interface really bugs me. From game to game I have no idea how to navigate and spend ages trying to find a story mission.\n\nAfter playing Lego LOTR and Marvel this feels like a huge let down. Which is unfair since this is a smaller and older game but it makes you appreciate how much better the games got after this.\n\nRecommended for: TT Lego fans and those who like Batman really.\n\nConclusion: 6/10. You can bump this score up 1 if your not a Gloomy Gus like me.\n\n\n**SPOILERS AND HINTS**\nI wrote this to help newbies understand how to play the game better and not flail around like I did. Follow these tips in the order shown and you'll get more out and less frustration.\n\nThe spoilers are very mild (are they even spoilers?) but I'm aware not everyone wants hand holding and they are around mechanics of play, there's nothing about the story or exactly how anything is done.\n\nHow to Play:\n1. Complete story mode first\n* You need to unlock characters in the final mission, don't even start on freeroam or freeplay till you complete\n\n2. Find Characters with unique talents\n* In freeroam (use batcomputer, pick a white dot and select to be teleported into town) fly around the sky and head for red skylight beams and land\n* Use the computer terminal to find a baddie, note where they are standing as they taunt you (ground, top of building, etc)\n* Use the ! MARKER tool to drop a marker on the baddies face in the MAP. Head for the red ! in your batcompass, locate the bad guy and walk up to them\n* Most baddies just take a few punches while other require you to do some cleanup or damage to the local environment before take down\n* Only buy the ones you want as money can be short at first: Lex, Ivy, Aquaman, Joker & Riddler are the only ones you really need\n\n3. Red Helper Bricks\n* To help even more get some red bricks for the now familiar helpers (esp. indicate gold bricks, attract studs, indicate mini-kit parts, stud multipliers)\n* Use the batcomputer or the terminals around town (blue skylights easily found with a flying character) and press SCAN on the MAP to find Red dots\n* As before use the marker system to mark the red dot, go to it and complete a task to reveal the brick for purchase\n\n4. Freeplay re-runs of the story missions\nNow you can better complete freeplay re-runs of the story missions with all the tools you need.\n* Use the Batcomputer and select the numbered disks to play the story missions\n* Ideally collect all the minikits, rescue the guy in peril and get 100% on the stud collector for extra gold bricks\n\n5. Get Cash for freeroam vehicles, characters and red bricks\n* To get cash I found the stud multipliers, turned on, switch to Green Lantern, build and smash the green piles around the streets in the middle map for purple and blue studs\n\n6. How to use the Map system.\nWhile Scanning you also reveal dots that lead you to the following...\n* Citizens in Peril: Save the poor soles from their situation for a gold bricks\n* Collapsed arches: rebuild, if you have enough gold bricks, to reveal a bonus character to buy\n* Beat up baddies: beat enough and you can add them to your roster\n* Stud trails: leading to gold bricks which require certain outfits and characters\n* Gold items: Melt with heat vision to reveal gold bricks\n* Riddler/Joker boxes: Only they can open these and usually have a red brick in them\n* Flash Builds: Only Flash can build these structures\n* Vehicles: Shown on the map and take serious cash to buy\n* Environmental tasks: shooting stuff, remote-control, riding and pulling switches\n* Water: Aquaman can swim underwater\nIn Missions...\n* Black bricks: Only Lex's ray can shatter them\n* Ivy flowers: Able to tunnel through the ground","November 22, 2014","true","26.0"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","32","39","3","0"

It took what worked from the other Lego games, and added more stuff to make it even more entertaining. What I think is most important to take into account here is the effort that was put into the voice cast. This was the first lego game that featured talking characters and they did one hell of a job. You'd expect this kind of quality from the Arkham games, but Lego has quite the list of A-list voice actors repraising their roles from the 90s cartoons. Additionally, this instalment adds the members of the Justice Leage as playable characters, making this the best Superman Game ever made.\nThere is one reason to play this: to fly through the sky as superman with John Williams' score in the background.

Unfortunately Scooby-Doo was unavailable due to legal complications and was replaced by Superman. The odd couple of the DC Universe, Batman-Superman is one of the most oxymoronic superhero team-ups ever, after all, one of them is powerful, smart, and amazing, a veritable god amongst men, and the other one's Superman.\n\nThe reason this team-up works is because Batman makes up for all the weaknesses of Superman. For example, Superman has a fatal allergy to Kryptonite, an ultra-rare substance that can only be found in supervillain gift shops and sometimes on eBay. Superman is also hyper gluten-intolerant and can be killed by a well thrown muffin. Fortunately, none of the supervillains know this. Batman of course has no weaknesses. He's only slightly vulnerable to guns and knives. And sharp sticks and heavy rocks.\n\nEveryone thinks Batman wears Kryptonite underpants because Superman is a dirty alien and Batman doesn't trust him. This isn't true. He does it to protect the self-esteem of his friend. If Superman was foolish enough to use his X-Ray vision to check out the size of Batman's package he would be totally embarrassed by his own inadequacy and probably fly off into the Phantom Zone in shame, never to return.\n\nThe reason why recalcitrant loner Batman is so awesome, is because of his tragic past. Born as Bruce Wayne, his parents were wealthy billionaire philanthropists who made regular fully tax-deductible donations to charity via their anonymous Panama trust fund. As founders of the "Wayne Foundation for Kids Who Can't Read Good And Wanna Do Other Stuff Good Too," they were also extremely humble and modest. They even built the tallest skyscraper in Gotham and named it Wayne Towers to remind everyone how humble and modest they were. Sadly they were murdered in a botched robbery when Bruce was very young. As to why two wealthy individuals would want to rob a homeless peripatetic hobo remains a mystery to this day.\n\nInstead of wallowing in self-pity and turning to hookers and cocaine, young Bruce became obsessed with vigilantism and justice. However he had a strict credo against killing and felt that all criminals could be reformed, even the hardened psychotic ones. A policy he no doubt stole from the Greens. One day after attending PAX, he had an epiphany. Perhaps he could reform criminals by scaring them straight. He also realised that what really terrified people to the core of their souls was bad cosplay. However, becoming obese and dressing as Lara Croft was not a realistic option. Dressing as a bat was the next best thing.\n\nBecause Superman wants to be more like Batman, he also conveniently has a tragic past. His real name is Kal-Fail and although raised by humans, he is really an alien from the planet Krapton. The Kraptonians were a highly intelligent and advanced race that somehow managed to blow up their own planet in an event known as the "Great Fuster Cluck". Superman named his alter-ego Cluck Fuster Kent in memory of this event. Superman's real dad Kal-Zone tried to warn everyone but nobody trusted him because he looked like choleric phone-throwing New Zealander Russell Crowe. Superman only survived the catastrophe because his parents were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They really hated him and sent him on a one-way trip to Earth, one of the worst places in the universe. Even episodes of Hanna Montana didn't deter them from this lunacy.\n\nCoincidentally Kraptonians look identical to humans which was fortuitous for Superman and the budget of every Superman movie ever made. Growing up in Kansas, Superman fights for Truth, Justice and The American Way. Enigmatically, Superman doesn't explain what The American Way means except perhaps hinting that it's orthogonal to Truth and Justice, but it probably involves eating copious amounts of high fructose corn syrup[drhyman.com]. Fortunately for Superman, he derives all his sustenance from sunlight which is not only fat free but gluten-free and approved by the Heart Foundation.\n\nNaturally Batman and Superman don't always work alone, but are part of a crime-fighting bowling club named the Justice League. All members of the Justice League have wonderful powers that rival even those of Superman (but not Batman). Fortunately for fans, some of the more notable members of the Justice League like Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Cyborg and Martian Manhater become playable characters towards the end of the game.\n\nFlash, also known as "The Fastest Man Alive," gets his superpowers and reputation from being very fast. Testimonials from his numerous disgruntled ex-girlfriends confirm that he's entirely deserving of his unflattering sobriquet. Nobody is sure exactly how he uses this talent for crime-fighting, and nobody really wants to know, but it works.\n\nWonder Woman is named after the enchanted Wonder Bra that she wears. It has the uncanny power to hypnotise men sending them into a vacuous drooling stupor. Also voted the "#1 Superhero I want to be caught by" in Supervillain Monthly five years running.\n\nGreen Lantern derives his power from bad poetry. Before he fights, he recites a poem about the brightest day and the darkest night, the birds and the bees, and what not. While his opponent is trying to work out whether it's some kind of magic haiku or maybe a clever pickup line, he runs up and kicks them in the bread basket. It's a technique so effective it's been used by the Guardians of the Universe to keep the peace for thousands of years.\n\nCyborg as his name implies, is half-man and half-machine, deriving his superpowers from an accident involving superglue and a washing machine. Now all he wants to do is clean up crime. Just don't ask him where his USB port is.\n\nMartian Manhater is possibly the most controversial member of the Justice League. A feminist alien cougar from Mars, also sometimes known as Left-Wing Liberal Chick, she gets her superpowers from getting people all riled up over gender inequality.\n\nLEGO Batman 2 is a vast improvement over LEGO Batman, with better visuals and dynamic split screen for co-op mode. The plot is your typical buddy superhero melodrama spiced with irreverent comedy. Humourous banter during cutscenes accentuate the friendly rivalry between Batman and Superman, playing the slightly dysfunctional but successful relationship to good effect. The addition of voice acting also greatly enhances the storytelling with Batman voiced competently by Troy Baker instead of the inimitable Kevin Conroy.\n\nThe most significant enhancement to gameplay is the open-world LEGO rendition of Gotham City that is impressive in both scope and detail. The entire city is quite large, even containing a zoo, and an amusement park with working rides. Although there are fast travel points to expedite travel, it's definitely more fun to walk, drive or fly. Unlike it's squeaky clean counterpart Metropolis, Gotham is a dark gritty city, ensnared in a preternatural perpetual twilight. Supervillain henchmen prowl the streets waiting for vigilante justice to be meted out upon them, and the city itself is replete with puzzles and challenges to complete.\n\nAs with the prequel, this game is better with a co-op partner than solo. I had the opportunity to test this with a 4-year old co-op partner whose favourite activity is flying around Gotham as Superman; even though I helpfully suggested many times that Batman is a far better character.

However, if you've played other new Lego games(such as Lego Marvel) you will be disappointed by several things. The flight controls are wonky, the map is hard to use, and no matter who you unlock you WILL have to use Batman&Robin's suits now and again. It's still a great game though. Also, you get Superman very early and he's one of the strongest characters in any Lego game.

The graphics where really smooth but sometimes it would switch from place to place. The gameplay is basically like every other Lego game... BUT WITH FRICKING VOICE ACTING! I do like it but I really miss the old traditional grunts and sound the older Lego games had. I rated the story the least because somehow I think this is more of a Superman/Batman and friends story more than a stand alone Batman game. They should have made THIS game a Justice League game with more added cities you could roam and also more backstory to the other justice league characters. and then another Batman game its self. The characters in the game are very good but sometimes characters like The Flash or Aquaman (expecially Aquaman) are very forgetable. Its like them saying hi to Batman then leaving. Overall I think this game is very good on PC/360/PS3/3DS. Thats right I think it's good on 3DS.

Sadly, not with 'LEGO Batman' and 'LEGO Batman 2'. I played 'LEGO Batman' and didn't really like it, thinking it was rather dull, frustrating, and hard to control with the keyboard. I later went on to 'LEGO Batman 2', hoping and half expecting improvements.\n\n'LEGO Batman 2' is a whimsical and charming game, and improved upon its predecessor by having actual voice acting in the game. (The first game just featured characters making sound effects, like grunting.) However, this game still has the clunky keyboard controls (the default configuration makes no sense to me), unfriendly camera angles, and wonky pathfinding from the first.\n\nIn the end, 'LEGO Batman 2' is a mediocre PC port of a console game at best. TT Games did not bother to optimize it for the PC. The game does not automatically start in your system's default graphic resolution on the first run, which is unacceptable for a modern PC game. Plus, 'LEGO Batman 2' is best played using a controller because its keyboard controls are unintuitive. Reconfiguring the default keyboard controls improved my gaming experience a bit, but I still had to fight the weird game camera positioning.\n\nFurthermore, 'LEGO Batman 2' is really designed for co-op play because the character that I was not controlling was not helpful in fighting off bad guys and solving puzzles in the single-player mode. Yet, the game does not offer online multiplayer. Having two people playing side-by-side may be nice (and nostalgic) if it is done on a console, but less ideal on a PC, especially if both players have to huddle around a single keyboard. That may be acceptable or tolerable back in the early 90s, but not in the 2000s.\n\nBoth 'LEGO Batman' and 'LEGO Batman 2' capitalize on our love of LEGO and Batman. It is unfortunate that TT Games did not put a bit more effort into making 'LEGO Batman 2' more PC-friendly, let alone improving on its gameplay. It is frustrating and disappointing to see TT Games seemingly coast in what they do despite having the lucrative properties of LEGO and DC characters to work off of.","February 27","false","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was about to drop it again.\nThen I forced myself to keep playing it. I get used to the map, I dicthed my usual game partner and played it alone so I didn't have to have my screen ♥♥♥♥♥ by the terrible splitscreen, I eventually get even used to the ABSOLUTELY IRRITATING flying controls. Almost.\nI ended up 100%ed it, like I did for all the others LEGO games, but I have to admit I didn't enjoy it very much. It was a little bit frustrating and this is not really what I look for in a videogame.\nCurrently this game is ranked 14th (second-to-last) in my personal "LEGO games from TT" chart.

I've played only the story so far, with no side missions and it took me roughly 8 hours to complete (blame all my other, unplayed games). The story was simple but fun and well executed, with a good dose of humor. Switching between characters could use some work though, as well as the AI of your fellow hero(es), and sometimes characters can get stuck in the environments. Other than that, it has no big flaws. It's a free roam game, so there's plenty to do besides doing missions. The game showed me I only completed 17.5%, so it could take you well over 30 hours to fully complete; it's BIG.\nThe graphics were excellent, with plenty of detail even though it's all LEGO parts. The animations were cute, the voice acting brilliant. Fun times all around !\nIf you have the money to spend, go buy it. Do yourself a favor.\n\n[Rating: 83/100]","July 24, 2012","true","7.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/recommended/213330/","san1281","sanitarian1281","http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/","1229 products in account","LEGO Batman 2 is the first LEGO game that I’ve actually finished. Well, I may be slightly abusing the term “finished” here. My playthrough ended recently at 22.3%. So “abandoned” might be a more apt characterization, although in fairness to me, I did complete the story mode. I started playing the first game in this series and abandoned it fairly early on, probably due to the fact that the keyboard-and-mouse controls are abominable. Setting up a controller to play and actually playing with a controller are a breeze but do not–under any circumstances–attempt to play this game without one.\n\nAll of the LEGO games are built on a similar foundation: smashing enemies and collecting bricks/studs with which to purchase unlocks/abilities. There is some platforming involved but puzzles are essentially limited to figuring out which superpower/suit is needed to remove an obstacle to progress. As such the gameplay is amusing in short bursts but tiresome over the long haul, especially if you’re 1) over the age of 10; and 2) playing by yourself.\n\nThe story is a slight but entertaining tale that begins with The Joker and various other Bat-villains robbing the guests at Gotham’s Man of the Year awards ceremony and segues into Lex Luthor recruiting The Joker to aid him in his bid to win the presidency of the United States. Batman and Robin eventually have to call Superman to help out, and eventually, with the Last Son of Krypton greatly weakened by exposure to Kryptonite, the JLA shows up to aid in the capture of the evil duo. (Interestingly, Superman is almost too powerful in this game, as he’s essentially invulnerable to harm and has abilities that the Dynamic Duo need four different suits to replicate.) The game doesn’t take itself too seriously and once you get past the major conceit that all of these characters are essentially self-aware toys, it’s pretty funny.\n\nOnce you’ve completed the story in LEGO Batman 2, you can take any currently-unlocked character and faff about in Gotham City, looking for imperiled citizens to rescue or miscreants to defeat. Although the game drops frequent hints about nearly every other aspect of gameplay, the method of actually unlocking characters remains somewhat obscure. Occasionally during a fight (for characters) or while wandering the cityscape and passing near an object (for vehicles), you will receive a button prompt and a message advising you that you can purchase that item for x number of studs. Once you do, that item is added to your roster/garage. In the course of your travels, you will discover items that can only be interacted with using the abilities of specific characters such as Poison Ivy, Man-Bat, or The Joker. However, actually obtaining those characters appears to be a surprisingly trial-and-error affair. Upon completion of the story, I had Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and a few assorted goons unlocked for a grand total of 12 out of 60 unlockable characters. (You can also replay any section of the story in “Free Play” mode (meaning with access to any unlocked character), but of course this approach suffers from the same shortcomings I mentioned above.)\n\nThe game looks and sounds great, but we come back to the fundamental problem of gameplay and the nature of LEGO games. These are games that are meant for kids and co-op. They are meant to be played several times, uncovering more bits and bobs on each playthrough. These are all concepts that are antithetical to the way that I play games. I don’t have kids or a gamer spouse and I rarely play through a game more than once. Kids don’t really mind repetition and doing the same thing ad nauseum; in fact, I’d venture to say psychologists probably have some term for a childhood phase during which they absolutely thrive on it. As an adult, I don’t normally bother with replays simply because if a game offers nothing new on a replay other than a different character, it doesn’t have enough novel content to justify spending my time.","November 25, 2013","false","16.1"," 17 of 44 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","17","44","0","0"

THEN THE GAME DECIDED TO SCREW ME!  to get all of the characters you have to get all the gold lego blocks, that means saving all the citizens, doing all the chalanges in the city, doing all of the god awful races with the god awful flight controls, getting super hero in all the levels, and getting all the mini kits, and here in lies the problem, one of the mini kits in level 13 was glitched... look i don't know if i just got screwed or if this is a problem across the board. but this was serously the final straw for me. when i played lego marvel i loved it and when i saw lego batman 2 on sale i thought i hit the freaking jackpot, turns out it was more like the video game equivilant of the short story "the lottery."  it's fine if you're just gonna play through the campaign but if you're just gonna do that wait for it to go on sale cus thats only about a third of the content, and i certainly can't suggest this to collectithon fan like me for the reason above... all i can hope for is that beyond gotham restores my faith in this team.

Most of the mechanics and gameplay stay the same throughout the games.  That is not entirely a bad thing as the Lego games are fun, and always fun.  Lego Batman 2 is no different.  You start off with Bruce Wayne taking the Man of the Year award and throughout the game you fight classic, and some obscure DC villains among the likes of Joker, Lex Luthor, and Riddler all the way to Man-Bat and Killer Moth.  Through most of the game you will controller Batman, Robin, and Superman.  Towards the end of the game though you will be able to play as the Justice League and this is where the game really starts to shine.  Having the ability to play as all of your favorite DC heroes is an amazing addition to an already fun and enjoyable game.\n\nLego Batman 2 is a fantastic game if you love Lego games, or just want a fun, quirky Batman game.  This game is obviously not going to be as dark and serious as the Arkham series but that does not mean this game is any less spectacular.  Lego Batman 2 is a must buy for any Lego fan or Batman fan.\n","June 14, 2014","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It brings live and character to many of the characters from the DC universe, so you can play as all of them doing lots of fun and wacky things within a relatively open world with a linear campaign to keep you busy for 10 hours.\n\nAs a huge fan of the Marvel game, and having been somewhat disappointed with the first LEGO Batman game, I had high expectations of its sequel. LEGO Batman 2, as I understand it is the first LEGO game which raises the bar of engrossment with added speech to the characters and it's a fundamental part of the fun of these games.\n\nYou'll obviously get to play as Batman and Robin again with various "suits" which give Batman and Robin various abilities. As well as the duo, you'll be able to play as the Justice League members and the supervillans - once unlocked of course. There are incredible single use mechanics where you'll be cruising the streets of gotham tearing apart a giant robot, crashing down to the ground avoiding bits of broken metal and more.\n\nThe diversity in gameplay will not ever keep you bored or disinterested, and the characters won't keep you from laughing. You'll find as with most titles there's far more content and things to do that aren't associated to the campaign and the campaign makes up for 20% of the completion, providing endless fun for those who have a greater interest in the DC universe. This title is a real winner and is worth the time for anybody who likes LEGO, DC Comics or Batman.","April 2, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In comparison to its prequel, a number of improvements made the experience much more seamless, including better controls, split-screen multiplayer no longer restricted to a small portion of the level, and puzzles that made better use of additional characters. The vehicle levels, while repetitive, were much more fun to play this time around. I did find some of the Gold Brick puzzles in the open-world somewhat frustrating, whether by poor design or requiring a specific character (and often specific suit). Overall a solid game, the one downside being I felt the new character roster wasn't appropriately integrated, only requiring Superman or Green Lantern a handful of times, and newcomers Flash and Cyborg serving almost no purpose.","August 16, 2015","true","37.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't completely know why I got this since I didn't care much for the first LEGO Batman, but this one is an improvement. I'm not too far into the game, but I can tell you it is definitely not bad.\n\nThe story isn't too bad. The Joker is trying to defeat Batman once again, but this time Lex Luthor is by his side along with many other villains. Like LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, this game mixes the super hero/comic book storyline with what you expect from a Lego game very well.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much what you expect from a Lego game- do missions, build stuff, get gold bricks, get characters, etc. It is fun, but there's something about the LEGO Batman games that seem a bit boring to me as far as levels go and I don't really know what it is. When you aren't doing missions, you can free roam around Gotham City, like you can free roam around New York in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, and this is pretty fun.\n\nThe graphics for LEGO Batman 2 are about the same as most Lego games. Gotham City has the kind of look that reminds you of the Batman Arkham games, which fits very well with Batman. The animations look good as well.\n\nProbably the main problems I have with this game are what I mentioned before about the levels and the amount of characters. I don't have all of them yet, but there don't seem to be very many. From what I can tell, there's probably around 50 of them. Not bad, but still much less than I expected.\n\nLEGO Batman 2 definitely isn't the best Lego game so far, but it is definitely not the worst either. It has a plot that goes good with both Batman/DC Comics and Lego, entertaining free roam, and a good amount of characters. However, if you're looking for a Lego game that you'll be playig for hours at a time, go with LEGO Marvel Super Heroes or LEGO Star Wars.\n\nI give LEGO Batman 2 an 8/10.","April 7, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A puzzler brawler hybrid that's about a step above a facebook game... and for me that loses it's apeal fast.  It's still got some entertainment value... the original story and voice acting actually serve the game quite nicely.  But if you've played other lego games and found yourself getting bored, look for this on sale or skip it entirely.

Most of the mechanics and gameplay stay the same throughout the games.  That is not entirely a bad thing as the Lego games are fun, and always fun.  Lego Batman 2 is no different.  You start off with Bruce Wayne taking the Man of the Year award and throughout the game you fight classic, and some obscure DC villains among the likes of Joker, Lex Luthor, and Riddler all the way to Man-Bat and Killer Moth.  Through most of the game you will controller Batman, Robin, and Superman.  Towards the end of the game though you will be able to play as the Justice League and this is where the game really starts to shine.  Having the ability to play as all of your favorite DC heroes is an amazing addition to an already fun and enjoyable game.\n\nLego Batman 2 is a fantastic game if you love Lego games, or just want a fun, quirky Batman game.  This game is obviously not going to be as dark and serious as the Arkham series but that does not mean this game is any less spectacular.  Lego Batman 2 is a must buy for any Lego fan or Batman fan.\n","June 14, 2014","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first time you get to fly Superman around the open world Gotham with the classic theme playing in the background? It will be one of your more memorable gaming moments, a slight shame then that the flying controls are so unresponsive and that the open world just amounts to getting to the end of the game and then working down the map, using the correct character or suit on some really easy to follow obstacle courses and vehicles races.\n\nThe replay value of the missions is much better, and the red bricks from the earlier games but oddly absent from LEGO Batman 1 are back, allowing the gold bricks just to become progress monitors and a way of limiting which characters you can purchase from certain doorways in the city.\n\nDefinitely fun, and the voices add a lot, and there is a genuine sense of humour that fits right in with the characters (Batman dislikes Superman, who is oblivious, but Robin absolutely hero worships him, much to Batman's annoyance). The final missions, when you get to play all the Justice League characters (especially The Flash - the animation for him is just superb on every level) is just a little slice of geek heaven. Definitely fun, and definitely worth getting.","June 22, 2014","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If not, you don't know  what you're missing!\n\nAs usual, this game improves on the system a bit.  The character's powers are quite a bit more varied than usual.  Some characters actually have multiple powers, instead of the usual one-power-per-character.  They also used the power-by-costume system for Batman and Robin, which I'm not really a fan of, but it does add some puzzles to the game.\n\nThere is also an open world for the maps between the levels.  Think of GTA, but smaller.\n\nMy only complaint is that there are no achievements for the Steam version!  To get cheevos, you'd have to shell out almost twice as much money and get it on PS3 or 360.  Ah well, no matter.  The goals are all pretty clear in LEGO games, so you don't need a list of achievements to figure out what's going on.","June 24, 2012","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Comme en plus, les jeux de coopération à 2 en écran splitté ne courent pas les rues par chez moi, j'ai donc pris ce Lego Batman 2...\n\n... Et bien m'en a pris. Le jeu est une petite perle de fun, avec de nombreux tableaux, variés dans leur gameplay, grâce à un principe de petits pouvoirs que l'on débloque en fonction des tenues que l'on choisit pour nos héros. Batman récupère par exemple une tenue "détection" pour voir à travers les murs et être invisible, ou une tenue "force" pour faire exploser des choses, Robin s'amuse avec une tenue "acrobate" ou "magnétique" qui le fait coller à certaines surfaces, etc. Le gameplay est donc sympa, accessible et accrocheur.\nLa progression est également très facile, les énigmes sont correctes mais ne vous bloqueront pas bien longtemps.\n\nA cela se rajoute une ambiance colorées et des dialogues dignes du Batman des années 60 avec Adam West : un humour bon enfant mais jamais ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, et quelques bons moments qui font intervenir d'autres personnages de l'univers DC. Lego Batman 2 dépayse donc bien, à sa façon enfantine mais pas ridicule.\nLa naïveté de l'ensemble me font douter d'y trouver un gros intérêt à y jouer seul, mais en coopération le titre devient vite indispensable, car défoulatoire, meugnon et très agréable.\n\nAu final, un très bon moment à passer avec son mouflet devant l'écran, pour faire des KA-POW, des PUNCH, et des PAF.

Along the lines of other lego games with puzzle solving,stud hunting and unlocking of characters. Liked the idea of roaming around gotham city and fighting crime. Found flying controls for characters a bit difficult at first but managed to master them soon after. Pity that DLC characters were not included in the game. Highly recommend the game to all lego/superhero fans.","March 29","true","40.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
