Climbing around on the ceiling can be a little bit dizzying, and at my time of playing there were a couple of little movement snagging areas. It's also a very short game, but I feel like the pace that it sets is good and I worry that if it was longer it might overstay its welcome. At 3.5 hours this was with me backtracking for a couple of achievements. The puzzles are logical and bizzare, the best kind.\nIt's cute and cheerful and unique enough to give a chance. The full recommended retail is high in my opinion for the time you will get out of it but if you can get it for >Â£5 i'd snatch it up. Daedalic published this for a small team and honestly as companies go these are guys that i'd be proud to be giving money to - sale or not.","November 30, 2013","true","3.5"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","29","29","0","1"

I was pleasantly surprised with my gameplay experience.\n\nThe aesthetics are very nice - the amount of detail in the game world is high. During brief cutscenes, the artstyle switches to a charming, fun cartoon appearance. The music and sounds are good and add to the positive, comical vibe emitted by the gameplay. Much of the game consists of you travelling throughout an extensive bomb shelter, trying to fix all of the troubles caused by your roach friend/brother.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to learn - I recommend using a controller to play, but the keyboard and mouse combo work fine. There is a quick tutorial that helps you understand the mechanics of the game. Clues are constantly given, and trial-and-error will help you progress through the game most of the time. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with point-and-click adventure/puzzle games. Most of the puzzle solutions are intuitive - or at least hinted at heavily when you interact with said objects.\n\nGameplay consists of you moving around different rooms of a bomb shelter, usually solving problems for other people in order to progress. As a cockroach, you can walk along walls and the ceiling, changing the orientation of the camera if you do so; you cannot jump, only walk. You can pick up items of interest, combine them in your inventory (if applicable), and use them to interact with the world (indicated by a puzzle icon over an item). Unlike many point-and-clickers, you can actually move your character around without using the mouse - something I found refreshing after playing many mouse-only point-and-clickers.\n\nAnother nice thing I appreciated in this game is the depth of puzzles - many times, you have to do an extra step to solve a problem. For example, there is a part where you need to collect baby flies that are located throughout a set of rooms. One of the flies is racing in a circle around a makeshift track - to capture it, you need to place a net on the wall, repair it, and physically block the fly's way so it goes around you (straight into a ramp that launches it into the net). These type of dynamic puzzles help prevent the game from getting stale.\n\nOverall, the game is a very well-done point-and-clicker that makes up for its simpler storyline with fun, comical puzzles. If you are interested in the point-and-click genre, then you should definitely give this game a try. I normally try to avoid mentioning price if I feel it is unnecessary, but I do think that the retail price ($16.99 CAD) is a bit steep. At the time of writing this review, the game is discounted at 88% ($2.03 CAD), and that is more than a fair price for the value you are getting.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","May 25, 2015","true","1.8"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","24","25","5","0"

When your cockroach buddy accidentally crashes through the floor and gets captured by the ants, you set out on a quest to rescue him, end the ants' terror regime and find a way to get out of the bomb shelter and to a peaceful place somewhere else.\n\nHUMOR\nThere aren't any actual dialogues in the game. All of the communication between the characters takes place in the form of incomprehensible sounds (sort of similar to baby mumbling) and comic bubbles with drawings that show what the characters try to say. Some of those illustrations are pretty hilarious and probably wouldn't be remotely as funny, as if the characters would actually say 'I found this plunger. Shall I put it on my head?'. It's not the kind of humor that makes you laugh out loud and spit your drink on the screen, but it's amusing and cheerful throughout the entire game.\n\nVISUALS\nWhile the game is advertised as a Point and Click game, it hasn't much to do with the usual pre-rendered, stiff and sometimes blurry enviroments known from other P'n'C games. It's actually best compared with The Walking Dead where pretty much everything is in 3D and where you can freely move around while still retaining the classical P'n'C feel of finding objects, combining them, solving puzzles and so on. Due to the comic style of the visuals, you don't have to worry about blurry textures or anything, either - it all looks sharp and just sooooo cute. :D\n\nGAMEPLAY\nBeing a P'n'C adventure at its heart, the game adds some welcome addition to the fairly worn out genre as it basically plays like a sidescroller where you control Jim with WASD (or the arrow keys, respectively) and the actual item handling is done with your mouse (you can also use a gamepad, if you wish to do so - works great). To add to that (and since you're a cockroach, of course) you can also climb on walls and ceilings to progress through the levels, reach items or just avoid being seen by the ants.\n\nIt takes a bit getting used to and you sometimes accidentally climb a wall or a crate that you just wanted to pass, but overall the mechanic works great and gives you another way of freedom to explore your enviroment.\n\nPuzzle-wise, the game is fairly easy as most puzzles only consist of picking up items, combining them and using them on something or someone, but since it's mostly quite obvious what has to be used how and where, they shouldn't provide that much of a challenge for experienced P'n'C or Puzzle game players. However, since the devs probably tried to also appeal to a younger audience, it wouldn't have been of much use to incorporate ultra-hard puzzles that you can't solve without consulting a walkthrough, so I'm generally fine with that.\n\nPLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITY\nBeating the story took me roughly 3 hours, which is rather short for a game like this, but personally I will always prefer shorter games with tight gameplay over games that artificially extend the playtime by repeating the same levels or gameplay elements over and over.\n\nOnce you've played through the game, there's not much else to do apart from hunting the remaining achievements, however, there's one particular achievement that requires you to beat the game in less than 18 minutes, so that adds at least a bit of challenge and replayability to the game.\n\nCONCLUSION\nJourney of a Roach is an extremely cute, cheerful and overall fun game for a relaxing evening, so if you like P'n'C games (especially with a gameplay twist) and don't get putt off by the game's length, make sure to check it out!","September 29, 2014","true","3.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I did not like this at all.\nThe setting is interesting, the story is okay and the controls are sometimes a bit too frustrating (why wouldn't I be able to walk on all walls and step over small pipes). And that's actually exactly what I expected from this game. It's okay to have janky controls. But it's not okay to have "nonsensical puzzle game logic". Every now and again I stumbled upon a puzzle that had the most illogical solution. Sometimes the thought bubble explanations are obtuse, sometimes the required items don't make sense, and sometimes the actual goal of the puzzle is illogical. For example - a bug asks us to find him a drink, but when you eventually find it he won't take it. Why? Because you apparently need to put a AA battery in it to make it an energy drink (simple logic right?). I have no idea how anyone supposed to come up with this solution without just trying all the items on other items and coming up with the solution by trial and error. And the game never gives you a reason why would you have to do it. Progressing in this game mostly means trying all the items you could find on all the intractable points in the current room and hopefully something will happen.\nIf that's something you enjoy/can withstand, go for it. It's cheap on sales. Otherwise stay away.\n","December 6, 2014","false","2.0"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","33","48","2","0"

It uses silent storytelling with simple cutscenes telling the simple and rather nonsensical story.  You play a cockroach in an inhabited underground area populated by other bugs.  The game is very strange with a lot of the things that happen not making a whole lot of sense to me but it all fits pretty well with the bug civilization theme.\n\nThe game is unique in two aspects: First you use WASD to move around rather than the mouse like most adventure games, and second, being a bug, you can climb on walls.  There are restrictions however since the camera is in a fixed position so you can't climb on the foreground or background walls.  The camera rotates to follow you which can be disorienting but it works well for the most part.  There are a few places in the game where you will get stuck trying to climb on things but it's easy to get out.\n\nI find that the weirdness of this game doesn't lend itself well to puzzle solving, but the game tries to give you hints through thought bubbles when you inspect objects.  I find it still ends up being on the obscure side which is unfortunate.\n\nI also had strange performance problems in the last section of the game with the game stuttering badly despite my computer having far more power than the game needs.  I posted on the community hub about the problem so hopefully the developers can fix it, but I haven't heard back at this point.\n\nOverall I find this game hard to recommend.  It's rather expensive for the length of the game and the lack of much of a story.  There's a lot of better adventure games out there, and even for $5 more I'd recommend them over this.","February 24, 2014","false","5.6"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","27","48","0","0"

Journey of a roach is a great game about a roach who need to go and rescue his buddy from the ants. The game is point and click and incorporates interesting movement allowing the roach to walk on the walls and roofs.\nMy first run through of the game took me approx 3 hours. A lot of the puzzles are pretty challenging but can be solved after thinking about them for a little while. i did need to look up a walkthrough for some of the puzzles and had issues on others where the game would not recognize the movements, or in order to complete the puzzle the actions would need to be done very specifically which was some what aggrivating at times. After the first run through the achievements to get the game 100% complete were challenging and i appreciated them to add the additional game play time. Because after 3 hours of inital game play i was defiantly not ready to say good bye to this great game.\nThe game play is some what short for the price of the game but like many others have stated on here i believe it is well worth the price. due to the great art in the game, comedy, characters, story line, and charm.","December 20, 2013","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As you play a roach, you get to walk around not only on the floor but also on the walls and ceiling, which provides a neat mechanic and some skill based gameplay, as you do have to watch your step sometimes and time your movement.\nTo wrap it up, it is a great game, worth taking a look.

With the hash marks on the walls, it would almost looks like a Dr. Seuss environment if there were fewer straight lines.\n\nThe game's shortcoming is its puzzles.  I've got several adventure games under my belt now, but this one had some of the most illogical, silly, pointless puzzles I've ever seen.  A good adventure game sets up a logical progression of events that gets you closer to your end goal, but this particular game ends up rather devious in the way it forces you to think about your surroundings (not in a good way).  I think that the puzzles could be more logical and interesting if the interface were better at explaining how to perform certain actions.  There are no spoken or written words, so your success depends on your ability to interpret the pictures and thought bubbles that appear above characters.  To me, that wasn't very fun.\n\nJourney of a Roach tries to be cute, funny, and witty with its few puzzles.  It works for the first half of the game, but in the second half, instead of ramping up the challenge, it ramps up the frustration.

In Journey of a Roach you play as a Roach. When youre friend comes back after finding a flower you need to travel to the surface to get the flower before it dies. So how is Journey of a Roach ? Its actually quite fun. Now for the Pros. Cute Art style. The game is present in 3D graphics but its also  presented in 2D comic like strips. You control youre charecter freelly and you can walk around a huge enviroments. The game also has cute voice mumble. The game is alot of fun to play through and theres alot of secrets to find. Also the game has a great soundtrack and a great sense of humor. Now but there is some cons. The game is confusing to navigate. You can walk on walks which becomes tedious when you try to find youre way back to where you wanted to go. The game also has alot of illogical puzzles which might be hard to figure out. The game also has a few bugs. Like charecters disspearing and Sometimes the charecters double. Overall Journey of a Roach is a great adventure game which i suggest you pick up at a sale and not full priced because its kinda short.

While this is pretty fun at first, it quickly becomes stale because, well, it's a point'n'click. The way you walk is irrelevant.\nSome puzzles are easy, some difficult, and that's cool, but some are just so abstract that you can only solve them through a tedious process of trial-and-error, which is not good.\nAnd suddenly there is the warehouse room where you have to use a machine to move boxes, which adds a stealth mechanism to the game â you get noticed, you go back to cockroach prison. This room is so bugged that it's game breaking. Two ants notice you at the same time? Instead of throwing you to jail, they notice you alternatively in an infinite loop (while you can't move, quit, or access the menu)! An ant notices you while you're behind two stacked boxes? Infinite loop! Meaning that you are stuck, can't do anything, only Alt+F4 gets you out of it. SHAME! I hope for you that you saved the game soon before. This is the room where I stopped playing, out of frustration and dismay.\nOh, and let's not forget lack of V-Sync causing MASSIVE screen tearing everytime you move, and the overly cartoonish voices that are just GRATINGLY annoying, and you got there the perfect mix for me not to recommend the game.\n\nThe spider room was cool though so I'll give an overall... 3,5/10.

That's all I have to say.\n\nActually I'll say a little more:\nDaedalic Games is a pretty good company that makes point and click games. While most of them are a little too text heavy and tedious, they are over all great games that are bringing back the point and click gaming era .\nJourney of a Roach however, is not a very good game. While the story line and game play are very innovative, actually playing the game is a different story.\nSince you are a roach, you can't talk and can climb on walls. After playing only 30 mins, I can still tell you that both of those points are a big issue.\n1. They use pictures instead of words as a guide.\nThis is a problem just because i got very confused, very often.\n2. Climbing on walls.\nThis would have been a cool feature if only the camera didn't get in the way. (Oh, that dreaded camera! You always have to ruin games for me...) Since the game was way too linear, the camera turned everytime you walked on the wals or ceiling to keep the prospective the same, but all it did was make me want to barf.

The game has a simple structure - cut scenes, walking around discovering things and solving puzzles. That's not particularly modern game play, but could work if you occasionally enjoy an old-school adventure game.\n\nUnfortunately the puzzles are bad. E.g. at some point you have to assemble something to make a certain shape - you have some components to get to that shape. However the components you are supposed to use, clearly don't fit the shape - so you can't look at them and logically figure out which parts you need. Instead you need to keep trying nonsensical combinations until the game decides that now the components fit the shape - even though they clearly don't. That's not difficult, it's just tedious and boring.","December 15, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recommended, though the shortness of the game may warrant waiting for a sale.\n\nLong story: I enjoyed my time with Journey of a Roach. The art style is a bit ugly, but whacky enough to be comical. The story is silly, but nice and often amusing. The puzzles consist almost exclusively of items and are generally unchallenging: the biggest challenge is usually finding the items. Once you have them it is usually easy to figure out where and how to use them. The ability to walk on walls is integral to some puzzles, both in getting close to items, areas and in approaching a problem from the right direction. This adds some extra flavor to what would otherwise be a standard point-and-click adventure game. Additionally, there are some collectables which encourage keeping your eyes open.\n\nThe game is short. I finished it in around 2.6 hours according to steam and the game features an achievement for completing the game in 18 minutes. Personally I do not mind short games as much as games which drag it out longer than their story can support or purposefully waste your time. However, the shortness of the game may affect whether you want to buy it at full prize or wait for a sale, so keep it in mind.","November 16, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A single play through will usually net the majority of the achievements without even trying.  One achievement for completing the game in under 18 minutes usually requires multiple attempts to perfect but is a good indicator of how short the game can be.\n\nIf there is one minor criticism of the game, it is that manoeuvring around doorways and other edges can be tricky.

It's definitely not a game to play if you are prone to motion sickness, but it certainly does offer a neat gaming mechanic as you solve puzzles on the floors/walls/ceilings of each level as a cockroach in search of his friend. The puzzles are fun, the level design is really clever, and the ambient sounds and music adds so much to the atmosphere of the game. The entire game can easily be completed in a few hours, but there are some really fun achievements that will easily double your gameplay (I earned nearly all of the achievements in 5 - 6 hrs).

This is perfectly fine for the most part and makes sense given the premise, but since you can't just click anywhere on the screen and wait for the pathfinding to do the rest, as you would in a point&click, it's occasionally a bit tiresome and tricky to position your little cockroach just right where it needs to be.\nIt's not exactly an epic game as far as length is concerned. It took me a little over three hours to complete and that's including me being an idiot quite a few times.\nThe Ugly\nNo major issues found. I've played through the entire game without ever running into anything that would have ruined the fun.\nOverall\n**This summary contains minor puzzle spoilers**\nWhile the game wasn't quite what I expected, I ended up enjoying it a lot. I particularly liked the creative puzzle design, which requires you to be observant and really get into the logic of the game and its world. For example, you'll find yourself having to electrify yourself to use your own body as a battery, or dump radioactive waste on fish food to make a cute goldfish mutate into a giant monster that explodes out of its aquarium. It's all good, wacky adventure fun. I also liked the simplicity of the story and the complete absence of any dialogue in favor of speech and thought symbols, the latter feature (in combination with the fact that you're playing as a cockroach) actually reminded me a bit of the excellent Bad Mojo, which is always a good memory to invoke.\n\nIn summary, Journey of a Roach is a somewhat brief but thoroughly enjoyable and very charming adventure experience.","August 29, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game in the same bundle and if I had not already played an hour or so of it in the past, I might have thrown it on an indefinite back burner. I'm glad I didn't, because everything about this game makes it worth its time and price. The story is short and to the point, which is what all games should be, if you want to keep playing, avoid the filler levels and just make multiple short games for half the price.\nWhether you agree with me or not, this game looks awesome, runs super smoothly [even with a controller] and everything about it is very straight forward, although the puzzles can be somewhat difficult if you don't stop to think every once in a while. I'm happy with my experience and feel like the devs accomplished everything they aimed to, it works really well as a story and a game.\n\nI spent maybe 6 hours on it total and the reason was mainly that I had a tiny screen. I want to just emphasize that a 13" macbook screen makes it difficult to see everything you need to interact with, and the controller with a 23" monitor made the game less troublesome and enjoyable. The gameplay consists of finding items, combining them with other items and combining them with your environment to solve all of the problems that your roach friend encounters as he gets from point a to ...point a.1\n\nThe pace is fantastic (although uneven at parts), i never feel like I'm spending too much time in one place and the areas are all different enough to keep you pulled into the story for long periods of time. The end of the game comes long before you want it to, but in almost every case, I prefer that to being in a perpetual state of trying and failing to force myself to finish a game that drags on long past the point where it is entertaining.\n\nEnjoy the game, its cheap and easy to do on a lazy afternoon.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10","May 29, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pleasantly so.\n\nThis is a gem of a point-and-click adventure game that is neither too easy or too hard. There are some places where you may breeze by easily (and I love a good relaxing game like that), as well as others where you'll be stumped for a little bit. The length of stumped time depends on the individual. I've never personally been good at solving puzzles, so it might have taken me longer than it will you.\n\nBut that's okay! If you like point and click adventures, and a good dose of back-and-forth breeze versus challenge, you'll love this game! Add to it that that the sounds these adorable little creatures make will have you squealing if you've any sense of cuteness.\n\nThe gameplay itself offers some decent versatility, since you can either use WASD for movement, or just click around. Another fun feature is the thought bubble hints of sorts, though I won't go into more detail than that. The storyline is addictively sweet and genuine, with a lot of character.\n\nIt's not really a game I can personally pick up and play for the entire day in one stint, but it's definitely not a game I will easily put down after a few minutes (looking at some of the games in my library, especially point-and-click ones, ugh). I keep coming back because it's a very easy-going, wind-down and relax type of game. It's just amazingly well done throughout, and won't tax you for brain or reflex energy.\n\nI hate insects, by the way. But after playing this game, it ALMOST makes me not want to kill another cockroach I see. That's how effectively adorable it is. The controls are well done in my book, the inventory is easy to use and not at all laggy or clunky, the achievements are fun to get (even the side ones that aren't necessarily part of the storyline), it has steam trading cards, it has character, it has personality.... What more could you want from a game?! And it's not greedily priced, so I'd definitely say it's worth your money.\n\nChoose. A dinner out somewhere that will last you 30 minutes, or a game that will last you many hours? I think people fail to consider the way they'd spend their money otherwise when it comes to games.\n\nDefinitely recommend!","May 9, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is pretty original but isn't fully fleshed out because the game is so short. The art style of the game is fantastic and the music is great as it fits the areas and rooms well.\n\nHowever, the puzzles are frustrating as you wouldn't really think of the solutions naturally. You have a do a specific thing in a specific way which I wouldn't have normally done. Additionally, the puzzle pieces are easy to miss and it is hard to tell what is what.\n\nOverall, the art was good and the story was alright. However, the lack of logical puzzles and obscure solutions kind of ruin it for me.","July 12, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, 2.5D, because some obvious wall switches can't be made and you are forced to folllow a set path, which annoyed me big time.\nThe puzzles are not really clever and are often too long (why collect 5 flies in so many ways to progress). When playing, you will walk a l-o-t! There even is an achievement for that called "Hardcore Walking". You need to walk 5000 something to get this, but when you need to walk so much to solve puzzles, this one is easy to get.\n\nAt first, I liked the game very much, but in the end, it became a burden and I used a walkthrough for the last part as I was quite done with walking aimlessly.","March 26","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finished it in one sitting, basically.\nThat isn't toitally a bad thing. I loved the art and graphics. The story was cute enough. It was a fun take on your avg point and click, with the keyboard movement arrows. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My only wish is that it was a longer storyline because it passed too quickly and now I dont know what to do with my night.","March 10","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a quirky sense of humor running through. Nice clean artwork and the puzzles are not too obscure. Dont be put off by the publisher of this game, it stands out on its own merits. Take a look below to get a feel for the art style and basic game mechanics.

I only recommend if you can get it cheap being you will waste money but it is different to see so I guess that makes up for it.","March 4","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
