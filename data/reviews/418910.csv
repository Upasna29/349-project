Its one of those games. I generally feel guilty for enjoying some of those mindless clicker-fest titles where there is no end-goal, and nothing changes from day 1, except numbers getting larger. With that being said, I do like them, and the idea of having more complexity and slightly different stages of strategy sounds really good. This is what Idle Civilization is trying to do.\n\nPros:\n+Idle clicker game that is trying to raise the bar for this relatively new genre\n+Its cheap\n+Has a welcome layer of complexity not found in other games like this\n+Addictive, like all the others\n\nCons:\n-Some menus need work. Why not have all the options (or buttons) on the same screen? No need to scroll, and have giant buttons (plus the scroll is not linked to middle mouse button). Or at least give the user the option to have everything on the same screen. Its Early Access, so this is acceptable at this point, I suppose.\n-Like other idle clickers, it doesn't matter what new options do when they open up - JUST CLICK THEM. There is little strategy in early to mid game here.\n-I believe it has to be open to earn you stuff. I don't think back-calculates time after you open it up a day later (like AdVenture Capitalist, etc.). This is fine, I guess, its just slightly different.\n\nYeah totally worth it for me. But that comes with the caveat that you like idle clicker games. If you are not sure, just download AdVenture Capitalist (its free and on Steam), and if you find time flying away, then look at this title.","November 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","39","47","2","3"

It's a different take on the genre, while employing essentially all of the same old mechanics. It also introduces a few new ones.\n\nHowever, it is still an idle clicker. You're running a land by clicking on stuff to make numbers get bigger. Build more houses (by clicking on buttons) to get more people. Assign those people to gathering various resources. Use those resources to build more stuff.\n\nI'm a little undecided on the graphics, but there *is* a somewhat charming early-90s / late 80s style to them.\n\nI look forward to further development on this game and feel it was worth the five bucks for what is already there -- again, if you're the kind of jerk who likes idle clickers... like me.","November 24, 2015","true","11.3"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","23","31","7","0"

It's slow at first, but it starts to stack up over time. It's not like the other ones, i.e. Tap Heroes, Clicker Heroes, or Sakura Clicker, it's more like Adventure Capitalist where you sit and gradually upgrade your mineral per second. I recommend this to those who want something to check on every now and then, or play while watching a TV show or binge watching YouTube.\n\nEdit: The music also sounds like old school Runescape, that's just my opinion.\n\nEdit 2: With the update that fixed minor things, it seemed to have gotten a bit better. I, honestly, enjoy the new wage system. Just be careful, if you type in "100", it'll get rid of all your coins per second.\n\nEdit 3: After playing over a hundred hours, I can honestly say this is the best clicker/idle game I've played, it's really quite enjoyable. It's not too clicky or too grindy, you can even restart every 30 minutes if you gain enough culture points (One Civilization Point per 125 Culture) in a short amount of time.","January 7","true","757.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","15","20","3","3"

The aethetic just is very bland to me.  Your civilization is hidden behind the crafting screen which I didn't like, and the early game consists of clicking on just a few resources and managing what your population does.\n\nYes, I know this is what all idle games are about.  But I just didn't feel the excitement for IC early game like I did for others such as Adventure Capitalist, which is free btw.\n\nIC is actually free on Kongregate but the dev will be adding most of the love to the Steam version.  He needs to pay for new music and a few new systems.\n\nLater on you can build troops and attack npc villages.  This can be a bit exciting until you mis-gauge the strength of the village you're attacking and lose all your troops.  Unlike most online strategy games, IC doesn't tell you the strength of the village you're attacking.  This can lead to frustration as you lose an attack and have to spend another 10 minutes amassing an army again.\n\nIn my opinion, the dev should spend most of the money this game has made on better presentation.  Right now, it looks like a children's coloring book and consists of just a few screens of UI.  The game is only a 17.8 mb file.\n\nAccording to steamspy, this game sold pretty well and has a decent player base.  I refunded though because I was just bored throughout.  A bit slow initially building farms and resources buildings.  Also listening to the same music track loop over and over gets tedious.  The dev says he will also be replacing that, which is a great thing.  I just dont think IC is worth 5 bucks unless you enjoy playing these idle games for only 15 minutes at a time while you scan the news feeds.  Which, is what these games are all about anyway.","November 30, 2015","false","0.8"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","0"

I've been playing this game for some 4 hours now. I must say that I love it. I regularly play grand stragtegy games and the like and  I'm constantly on the look out for 'kingdom/empire building games similar to this. I very much enjoy games that provide me with the extreme statistics that this game provides eg many hundeds-thousands-millions-billions-trillions etc. Of said resources. I'm enjoying the style and the UI is fine.\nIt's a very simple game but has a lot to offer. It's simple but offers a satisfying amount of depth and/but with little complexity. It's very much a 'click game' as it's title suggests. Being early access I find myself being quite patient and still considering it's pros and cons.\nI love the adventurer/hero extention. Gives the kingdom building a more personal/rpg feel.\nThe game for me is kind of reminiscent of 'kings of dragon pass' which was a totally  wonderful game but I had a few hang ups which I found lacking for the game I wanted to play.\n\nAll that being said, I only have a few issues/wishes right now:\n\n1st: I would like the world map to be bigger... MUCH bigger.\nConsidering the staggering numbers of people/tropps/resources etc that you can acquire, it would make for a much better kingdom/empire building game we could have a considerably larger world to conquer/explore/trade with.\n\n2nd: Although there is a quite deep research tech tree with many techs to research, I would like it to be bigger/have more options.\n\n3rd: I would like a slightly deeper/more indepth dimplomacy/trade system. Just more options really.\n\nSadly, that's it for now. Still, great little game.\nI pray that future updates are not just tweaking and bug fixing but expanded content, similar to the above mentioned etc... Keep up the good work.\n","December 1, 2015","true","319.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","4"

There is a lot to unlock, lots of change to happen to the village, and many little adventures for you to go on. You can assign your village jobs, create buidlings, and go on adventures. The tales from these adventures are the most entertaining - the sitings your villagers find are super creative and well written, though I don't feel like some of them affect you too much. There is a lot going on and a ton of ways to spend your research, so you need to be mindfull of going forward and unlocking new things instead of just making more villagers. There is balance too it.

I just play periodically. I will wait for my resources to stack up then BAM I buy things! I am a HUGE fan of Adventure Capitalist, and this is just a nerdier version of it! You actually have to try to get good in this, even though you don't REALLY need to try.\n\nNow I have commented on this before, I just changed my username from Redheaded_Gamer to now Dukase, and I am being patient, especially since this most recent update. But there should be animations. And no rush devs! Creating a game is not easy, I know. Take your time and I will update my review as much as possible!\n\nI am not the kind of person to do pros and cons. I feel like it would put the Devs down if they saw cons. So I will just constructively criticise the game! It is way less harsh in my opinion, since I won't just say how bad something is and not give a reason.\n\nSo first up, as I mentioned, and I will again (Please don't be annoyed!) Animations. Something that would give the game THAT much more life! And it does not have to be big, it can just be the grass flowing in the wind, the water moving with the stream and twinkling in the light. And maybe a day and night cycle. It's pretty awesome how the game is so far, but this sould just hook me, totally.\n\nNow another thing I recommend are sound effect. Like environmental sounds. The water, the wind, birds, the mine, people chatting, maybe you would hear the eventual cow or so in the distance. Just something to go with the animations. To give the game a Simulator feel, but at the same time keeping it an idle game.\n\nAnd one last itty bitty thing. And I really don't care if this is added or not. But it would be cool if you could create a character. And you could upgrade that character to give your town a boost or two. And with that character you could visit other peoples civilizations. Give them a production boost or something. That would be cool.\n\nSo yeah. That is my review on this great little game! I am so glad to see it develop like it is! Even though at first it seemed abandoned. I did not give up on the game! And I can't for a game that I payed for, and love! I would be glad to be a Dev of this game, since its community has grown so much! Great job guys!\n\nThanks for reading,\nDukase signing off!\n\nP.S. I liked the old font better. It was easier for me to read. But the new graphics are great! And the new font is as well! It all fits so perfectly! I think it would be nice to just have a Font switching button. From Old font to New font or something.","June 1","true","0.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However, the price tag was slightly high in my opinion (£3.99). The game brings me back to the retro days and does a well job of keeping me hooked on it. My only problems are a few glitches here and there, which is nothing out of the ordinary. If you want a game that you can leave for a month and immediately get back into it, then this is a decent game. If you want a game that keeps on producing essential items even when you are not playing, this is your game. It's a shame though, that there hasn't been an update for about 4 months now.","May 7","true","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I'll start with the pros:\n\n1. Lots of things to do.\n2. ...\n\nThat's about it. In fact, I'd mark that as a con because it just feels so clunky and overcrowded. There are too many resources, too many tabs, too many notifications, and the UI is cluttered and hard to read to boot. I found myself making comparisons to Anti-Idle, my first game of the genre. It too had a ton of stuff to do, but each activity was separate and had a lot more user interaction. Also, it was free.\n\nSo to sum things up, there are better, free idle games that feel more polished and are easier for some quick relaxation.","March 20","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

This game... Literally saw it at a glance under upcoming about an hour before it was released, came back after watching some Netflix and bought it for ♥♥♥♥♥ and gigs, you know its $5 and took under 9 seconds to download so whats the risk?\n\nSo lets just say the Tutorial was there and it did provide some info, but being an avid gamer i quickly closed that nonsense and was left to fend for myself clicking at random and getting pretty frusterated, once i found out i could CLICK the gather food/stone/wood buttons my saviour the tutorial lady popped back up.\n\nThe entire time i sat here trying to figure stuff out i kept thinking "why am i playing this? its ugly af and i can barely read the tutorial (real talk the T's in the tutorial text box are hard to read lol).. But i don't know, something wanted me to keep playing, so here i am.. controlling the Kingdom of New Eden trying to get that sweet spot of population-to-food-ratio without losing food, but trying to gain some whilst still having as many population left over as i can for the other 2 resources.\n\nIts interesting, ill keep trying it out for funsies.\n\nEdit: btw the soundtrack is fantastic. haha","November 24, 2015","true","15.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","7","16","4","0"
