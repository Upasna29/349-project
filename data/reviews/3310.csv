I recently searched up on Steam as to whether it offers this little bundle of joy. And well, it did.\n\nA classic drag-and-match puzzle game. There are many out there like this. But I would have to say that this one is the grandmother of them all, as far as I'm concerned. The little cute, fuzzy, multi-coloured alien-ey things just help add to the appeal. The sound effects are incredibly adorable as well. You can easily spend around an hour completing classic mode on the hardest difficulty - possibly more. So, don't try and play for a quick 5 minutes or so. It's a trap; don't do it!\n\nThere are a pretty decent amout of achievements available in game - which will make a fun time trying to get them all. I, myself don't have all of them yet. However, it could prove quite frustrating trying to get them all. One of them is to complete a whole game without ONE wrong move. Surely, that's next to impossible, unless you strategically plan your moves beforehand. Which just adds to the beauty of this game.\n\nIt is extremely challenging at times, which is what we all look for in a puzzle game. Why else would we want the puzzle genre?\n\nOverall, cute graphics, amazing sound effects, challenging gameplay with around 4 or so different modes and achievements to get that fire in your heart going just that bit more. I would definitely recommend this game to absolutely anyone; regardless of age. Fun for the whole family!","November 8, 2014","true","21.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Match 3 or more of a kind and amass points that will carry you on into the next level. Depending on the mode, you might face locked Chuzzles that you can't move or huge Chuzzles that make it difficult to move certain lines. You know you've matched when there's a flurry of Chuzzle hair (though it looks like cat hair) flying from that part of the screen.\n\nIt also has some cute "easter" eggs that are fun to do every once in awhile. I like making my Chuzzles Dizzy and tickling them til they're near puking. The death glare they give you if you hang your cursor on them too long is kind've adorable too.

It's certainly as well-made, offering that perfect combination of visuals, music and sound effects, but where Bejeweled goes for fancy, clinkity gems, Chuzzle goes for the cute factor and delivers in spades.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit different too. Here you slide entire rows or columns back and forth or up and down, to form clumps of three of more. With that, you have classic, timed mode, zen, and puzzle.\n\nI like the little touches. If you grab a row or column and shake it violently this way and that, the chuzzles get disoriented and dizzy. Or if you click on any chuzzle, they emit a note. The note is higher from top-left to bottom-right, letting you basically play a tune by clicking on different chuzzles. This is entirely unnecessary, just a nice little touch. Or if you hover your mouse on a chuzzle and leave it there, after a while they frown and shake it off, moving the mouse cursor away.

It's a very nice-looking tile-matching puzzle game with beautiful animations and "characters" design, which in my opinion deserved only positive reviews by the standarts of time it was released. Chuzzle and MadCaps both were my most favourite time killers for many years. Long time ago I introduced it to my parents and they loved it too, played thousands of hours and still playing it.\n\nBut unfortunately technical issues are ruining the experience. There is an annoying problem: game crashes as soon as you try to switch it to windowed mode. And I don't think PopCap games cares about this game anymore - you cant even find mention of it on a their website. Version of the game you're gonna get on Steam is 1.0, however, 1.01 could be easily find on the different sources and it doesn't have same problem. Demo version from developer's website even marked as 2.0. But for unknown reasons, modern version of the game is not on Steam. So unless you have 4:3 monitor as your primary monitor - you're going to look at the stretched image. Pretty disappointing.\n\nBut game itself is very good and if not technical issues I would definitely recommend considering it, if you're looking for something from this genre.\n\nRip.\n\nUPD: Changed recommendation from negative to positive. Game can be switched to windowed mode if you disable H/W Acceleration. After that you can turn it back on, so you can select resolution larger, than 640x480.","June 20, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main star of the game is chuzzles: cute, spherical, fuzzy creatures that remind me an awful lot of tribbles from Star Trek.\n\nMain selling point: this game is a good (and cheap) digital anti-depressant.","February 24, 2013","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good for when you want to have a coffee and a break or time to zone out.  It can become tiresome real quick and can lack substance if you are looking for more of a solid play game.  It is a puzzle game and if if tedious repetition is not for you, then this game can get boring real quick after the gimmick has gone.","April 18","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
