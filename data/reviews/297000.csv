I'll let everyone make their own assumptions after this short review without pointing fingers to who does what (hint/hint).\n\nI instantly got interested in this version hoping that somewhat refreshed visuals might make an old gem look more visually polished. I was wrong. The difference is almost unnoticable and due to the downside of having only Restoration of Erathia instead of full package of 2 expansions with additional castle, items and limitless map generator, this purchase is not worth even 1/3rd of the price of full game on good old games site - http://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition which costs twice less by default.\n\nDO not buy Steam version. Save Your money and conscience, get GOG version. A few pixels more, no achievements, but whole package.\n\nAs this is only 3rd of the full game which has nothing new in that third, it cannot have score of more than just a 3rd of a game.\n\n3/10","January 30, 2015","false","0.6"," 901 of 998 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","901","998","17","18"

Here's the Pros and Cons of this "new and improved version of Heroes III"\nPros:\n- "HD"\n- It's Heroes III\n\nWell that was easy.\nCons:\n- "HD" only improves pixel quality, with no improvements to compatibility to its framerates it may look "nice" at a standstill but who cares about motionless, sub-par "HD"\n- No Random Map Generator that Heroes III Complete has.\n- No Conflux Race that Heroes III Complete has.\n- More expensive than Heroes III Complete, and it doesn't even have Random Map Generator nor Conflux Race among Other things. (The 2 expansions)\n- Buggier. Who the hell remakes a game only to make it buggier? Seriously. WTF.\n- Crashes more often. Same as above.\n- No Random Map Generator. That's a big deal you know. Those who havn't had it just don't know how much they're missing.\n\nUltimately, would I play Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition? Nope. Waste of Money. Heroes of Might & Magic III Complete is 9/10 times better. I at least hoped they would have made the HD versions online playability better but.... Thanks Ubisoft, I don't know what I was expecting. Obviously something better than this piece of crap.\n\nLet me say this again. Ubisoft is charging you MORE for this "HD" version that is missing not one, but TWO expansions. It is BUGGIER, crashes MORE frequently, and again, they had the GALL to charge  more for it. I've been disapointed before; but, this takes the cake.","February 21, 2015","false","0.2"," 605 of 665 people (91%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","91","605","665","35","16"

The graphics look like they were only scaled up and smoothed out. Meaning parts look blurry, lacking in detail, and horrible black borders around characters.\n\n2. The colours seem to have been oversaturated in the process, making your eyes tired and sting when looking at the screen.\n\n3. The animation is painful to watch. Agreed, the original animation was not beautiful or smooth, but I expected that the movements might have been smoothed out - Instead they are choppier and clumsier than ever.\n\n4. There is no random map feature... which is what made the original game playable for 16 years.\n\n5. E...ver...y...thing... Is... So. Slow. I play Dragon Age 3 on the highest graphic settings without any issues, but this HOMM3 HD remake lags as if I was playing online with a 64kbps connection.\n\n6. Features missing, like for example hotkeys. I´ve always played this game using hotkeys, but now they can´t be used.\n\n7. Online multiplayer doesn´t work. The multiplayer functionality is one of the main reasons I bought the game, as it is cumbersome to try and set up the kind of networks that the original one needs to work, but now it feels like I wasted 15 euros on this game.\n\n\nTL;DR\nAs I loved the original game to bits I obviously had very high hopes for this remake, and I am sad to say that this version does not live up to the original and is not worth the 15 euros it costs. My recommendation is to seek out the original game and play that instead.","January 31, 2015","false","28.8"," 644 of 714 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","644","714","12","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cablenexus/recommended/297000/","cablenexus","Cablenexus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cablenexus/","421 products in account","I am old. My first PC game purchase ever was Heroes of Might and Magic III. A Windows 95 CD-Rom with an instruction book on real paper and my PC was not even met the requirements. It was an amazing experience. Little figures on a map searching for treasures and fighting monsters was something I only knew from table top games and now happened live on my 14" CRT screen.\nA whole world opened for me and since then I was really addicted to the Fantasy Turn Based Strategy genre.\nLater played the Warlords series, the Age of Wonders series and the Disciples series.\n\nAlmost 20 years later I still have Homm3 installed on my PC and now and then I even met people with the same experience from this game and we play hotseat together a whole night.\nI still own the original homm3 box, the Shadows of Magic boxed edition, the Collector's edition and the GOG version and when I don't have one available when I'm somewhere else I pirate it for a moment. I guess that's legal because I own the game in four different versions.\n\nAll this years so many progress is made by the real fans of this series to make the 20 year old title even better. We have VCMI, HD mod, Hota and so much user created content now that it is almost impossible to make a new edtion better then what is available fromt the community.\n\nMaybe the biggest reason for me to play this game all this years without getting bored is that every map I play is different and unpredictable. This is because a generator creating a different map every play. IMO a must for every strategy/RPG/Adventure game on the market. I do not like scripted games, predictable games or story campaigns so much because after playing it one time I lost my interest to play the same map again. Also it keeps multiplayer fair because this way the map cannot be learned by players so nobody have advantage of knowing a map better then you.\n\nNow imagine the best book you ever read and imagine a cheap B movie producer turns your book into a bad movie. That is exactly what happened with this version of Homm3 for me. The menu's of the game did not have any overhaul and are not fit in my laptop screen resolution anymore while the original 20 year old game does. For every click I make in the menu I have to wait at least two seconds while in the original game I misclick because the interface is so fast.\nI don't see any progress in interface or menu artwork and it's so much slower then the original. I don't understand this.\n\nAll content after the original game came out like the expansions, the user created content, the new factions, the thousands of maps/campaigns and even the RMG (random map generator) is not there. It's just the base game and even the base game on GOG have more content because it's at least updated with bugfixes afterwards.\n\nThe unique selling point from Dotemu is the graphics overhaul and Í have to admit that it is very nice to see that someone spend so many hours creating better looking monsters and heroes for my favorite game of all time.\nThe units are cleaner and less pixelated on higher resolutions now and that is not bad. But they do not try something original or different so it's not amazing or surprisingly good. Just ok. In the town screens and on the map I cannot see any difference with the original and because every click is so much slower then the original game for me it's not worth the graphic overhaul.\n\nI bought the game just to support the graphic artist and to have a voice on Steam to write my review.\n\nI don't like the remake of my favorite game is not the perfect remake I can imagine. A remake IMO can never be a downgrade of the original. If you don't have original code from expansions you have to wait more time to release while hiring people from the community to make the perfect game or just don't touch it.\nIt looks like a quick project to make cashflow for the company instead of a soul project led by people dedicated to the Homm series. That's something bad.\n\n\n","May 6, 2015","false","2.0"," 425 of 458 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","425","458","11","16"

Essentially, Ubisoft couldn't get the source code for the expansion packs (disappointing) and declared that programming them again from scratch would be too much effort (understandable).\n\nThe dealbreaker for me is that the complete edition with all expansions is available very cheaply on Good Old Games - there's no reason to buy this when the old version is cheaper and gives you more content.\n\nFor what it's worth, the "HD" update is exactly what it says on the tin but it's not what you're hoping for. Pretty much all the sprites used to create the game were re-traced and more detail was added. I respect the work that must have taken, but at the end of the day it still looks like the game from the nineties that it is. You wanted the gameplay - the exact graphics are more-or-less irrelevant to me.","April 1, 2015","false","54.9"," 364 of 388 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","364","388","6","1"

But as of NOW, and for THIS edition of the game..\n\nConflux, powerful combo artifacts, new map locations, and the random map generator will be missed, but the prospect of a smooth(?) multiplayer environment, where you won't have to experience "can't connect, timed out" to a computer 5 metres away meaning you don't spend 30 minutes just trying to get everyone into the lobby and God forbid anyone disconnects during the 4 hour session... Worth. Or so I thought....\n\nWe're missing LAN - the only reason I (and probably you too, if you ever buy this) got this edition is because windows no longer supports IPX and all the problems that came with trying to start a session on TCP/IP. But no UDP? Not a gameplay issue and we are expected to play via steam, but still..\n\nAlso, multiplayer got a new problem. There is this previously unheard of 5~10 sec 'loading' period at the end of EVERY HUMAN PLAYER'S TURN, where all animations freeze and you can't do anything, kinda like the little unskippable tune you had to hear at the beginning of every turn during hot seat, just more insane with no workarounds (and that tune served a purpose, like kicking your friend out of the room before he spied on you - this doesn't) - I have no idea what the game is doing while it throws me an hourglass but it wasn't and shouldn't be there. Most of us do indeed alt+tab during opponent's turns, but early game this practically doubles turn cycles.\n\n\n\nPlease tell me they're patching the hourglass thing. Or I might go back to giving it fifty tries to play the game the old way.","January 28, 2015","false","47.2"," 677 of 799 people (85%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","85","677","799","13","10"

Just wow.\n\nIt feels like Ubisoft loves to mess with their customers. Maybe that's the reason they keep doing it over and over again. Or are they just trying to beat EA for being the worst company in the gaming industry?! I guess we'll never know...\n\n- No random map generator. Long term motivation? NOPE! (Yes, I know that there is a map generator available, but it's not the randomized one I'm talking about.)\n- One fraction is missing.\n- No LAN support.\n- Both DLC's/Addons are missing.\n- [Bug] You have to click for every single moving point of your heroes. Having (e.g.) 100 moving points available will result in 100 clicks you have to make.\n- [Bug] Beside that, the map will reposition itself after every single step, so you have to "re-aim" 100 times as well - ON EVERY HERO, ON EVERY SINGLE DAY.\n- Considering the before mentioned things the price tag of 14,99 € feels like a huge smack in the face (I paid 9,99 € for HoMM3 Complete, including 2 discs).\n\n+ Overall better graphics, although the "old" version wasn't looking that bad tbh.\n+ Support for high resolutions.\n\nThe only thing that would make this game more ridiculous would've been the integration of Ubisoft's beloved 30 FPS cap to make the game look more "cinematic".\n\nConclusion: I was hoping to finally get my hands on a visually more appealing version of Heroes of Might and Magic 3. and I got f'ed hard. I really don't recommend anyone to buy this, unless Ubisofts comes up with some updates.\n\nThanks, Ubisoft.","January 29, 2015","false","0.4"," 704 of 840 people (84%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","84","704","840","37","23"

I can run Rome 2 total war a lot better than this game it seems.\n\nUnskippable Ubisoft logo at the intro, like they are proud of it somehow, though that can be modified out of the game by changing the files in the game folder.\n\nThe music, instead of continuing where it left off like in the original, restarts now everytime the music changes. Walking in a grass field, cue the beginning of the grass theme, go to a city, cue the beginning of the appropriate city music. Needless to say it gets very very annoying to hear the same part of the same song every few minutes. Always the beginning of the song, always. You never spend that much time looking at your city, or walking your hero, so you never really hear the whole song, only the beginning. I get the idea that listening to a song from the middle can be a bad idea, but when the music is constantly changing, the old style fade in and fade out, and starting where you left off just worked so much better and just felt so much more right.\n\nPressing space to visit the location you are standing on got dropped out as well. If you take a wrong portal, you are forced to spend movement going out of the portal and back in. Same if you happen to end your turn and the week on a mill. No idea why they thought that was an ability that had to be removed.\n\nI have heard rumors that cheats work in multiplayer, I haven't checked it myself, had trouble playing online. It's not working as well as I hoped.\n\nThe achievements are, to put it lightly, uninspired. There are no fun achievements to chase, as in Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis. They are all like this: Beat this campaign, beat that campaign, beat this campaign. That's not really fun chasing those achievements, the campaigns may be fun to play, but the achievements are not even flavoring, they are just there so they could put ''Achievements'' in the description.  Was it absolutely impossible to have a achievement like ''Have every type of dragon in your army'' or ''Win a battle with only seven dwarfs''? Yes. Yes it was. That would have meant that they would actually had to put some work into the game.\n\n\nThere... that's what's wrong with the base game. I know they didn't include the expansions, so i'm not complaining about that, since that was never advertised.\n\n\nIn summary: It's lazy, it's buggy, it's bad. Ubisoft should just start working on games for tabloids and phones, because that is clearly what they want.","February 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 264 of 310 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","264","310","5","1"

And you can find fantastic mods such as WoG "Wake of Gods" and HotA "Horn of the Abyss" to add further depth to your game.\n\nI have played HoMM3C for thousands of hours over the past 15 years.\nI have played (and spent countless hours attemping to play) HoMM3C over Hamachi(no longer works afaik) and GameRanger (very buggy for me, always had trouble).\n\nI purchased this version knowing it was just RoE without the expansions.\nThe reason I wanted this was for the MULTIPLAYER on steamworks! FINALLY!!! (HD is nice too)\nBut... There are so many problems...\n\nI do not completely agree with all the negative reviews, which seem to have come from those clueless about what they are actually buying. (Yes we know the EXPANSIONS NOT INCLUDED, they lost the source material apparently, which is a tragedy but you can't give this a bad review just for that when they tell you exactly that in the first place.\nThough I have to say I had hoped for a little better delivery on the multiplayer (which is the entire point of this version for me) and to a lesser extent the user interface (there is an HD-mod that is made for the old HoMM3C version which helped by adding buttons to transfer all items or units (except last 1) to another hero) and a button for purchasing ALL AVAILABLE TROOPS in a town.\n\nCons:\n-Highly addicting gameplay that will absorb years of your life...\n-Bad reviews\n-Multiplayer requires port forwarding (come on, this is 2015...)\n-Multi-player is buggy, disconnects, cheats etc\n-DOES NOT INCLUDE TCP/IP LAN multiplayer (IS INCLUDED in HoMM3C version)\n-NO STEAM WORKSHOP\n-Missing all expansion content (known when announced, mods will help if developers allow)\n-No quick transfer/purchase buttons (I know this is only in the HD-mod, but get with the times)\n-Multi-display is buggy, I mouse right out of full screen mode, which minimizes instead of just scrolling across the map as I intended.\n\nPros:\n-Highly addicting gameplay that will absorb years of your life!!!\n-Steamworks multiplayer\n-Hotseat multiplayer\n-Thousands of gameplay hours\n-HD graphics (supposedly 30000+ hours of retexturing)\n-Community modders converting expansion maps\n\nHopes/dreams for the future:\n-NO PORT FORWARDING in multiplayer\n-Workshop support\n-Expansion content(community reverse-engingeered if it must be!)\n\nThat said, I am still very much enjoying this game again. The lack of buttons to 1 click-transfer units/items or purchase all available troops are SORELY MISSED. So I will probably go back to the HoMM3C version with HD mod when not attempting to play multiplayer.\n\nI really want to give this a positive review, and will do so if they manage to fix the issues that plague multiplayer and user-interface.\n\nThe ball is in your court development team!","February 7, 2015","false","94.6"," 108 of 118 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","108","118","3","0"

Now, I'm starting to think it's actually because they have no respect for the old one.\n\nI grew up with HOMM 1 - 3; my parents still spend hours and hours every week enjoying the GOG version of Heroes 3, which includes the Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death expansions. As excited as I was for this re-release, after having actually taken it out for a test drive, I have to recommend the GOG version over this mess by quite a wide margin.\n\nFirstly, it's just the original game, with no expansions. That makes the current price tag a bit steep, considering what you get with the GOG package (which is also DRM-free and doesn't require a client to play). Secondly, every supposed "improvement" they've made comes at the cost of an established feature: Pressing the space bar no longer allows you to revisit locations atop which your selected hero is currently standing, for instance, and lots of other hotkey shortcuts are absent, as well. Gameplay is often jerky or strangely slow despite the high requirements for such an old game. Some in-game art has been poorly remastered and looks stark and out of place against unaltered backgrounds, creating an overal effect like someone lazily went through and applied Photoshop filters to existing elements. The multiplayer barely works, and then not very well. Perhaps most telling is the absence of the trademark random map generator, which was a highlight of the franchise and one of the things that continues to make HOMM3 playable decades later.\n\nI really played this re-release up to my family and friends, all of whom are fans of the series, but now I'm wishing I had my preorder money back. I feel like the game is not at all as advertised, much in the same way that Ubisoft failed to tell anyone that their proprietary U-play client was required to play Might & Magic X.\n\nPainful though it may be, file this "HD remake" in the garbage along with Heroes 6.","February 2, 2015","false","6.0"," 127 of 150 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","127","150","3","0"

The problem is that it is only the original game which makes it not worth it really. I am however convinced that adding the 2 expansions will revive this game to it´s fullest.\n\nThe only problem is that there seems to be some sort of issue with the graphic engine and HD that makes the fps drop at times but it isn´t something that bothers me, it doesn´t happen very often.\n\nUnfortunantly it wouldn´t surprise me if ubisoft throw in the other dlcs with super "HD graphics" for another 14 euro each, cause thats the only reason splitting this game up like this, to milk as much money as possible, right?\n\nTo summary this I would first like to point out that I really like the game a lot but considering the dlcs are missing and there is no random map generator it´s just Heroes 3, but less. Also the high price tag makes it a goof and even less worth it.\n\nEdit: To be honest the only reason I am playing this is since I already wasted 15 euro on it so I might aswell "get my moneys worth" out of it.

I own every HoMM and every expansion and DLC 1-6.\n\nThat being said, I do not recommend the HD version of the game. My wife bought 2 copies so we could play together. Without a LAN feature (which was removed for this version) we were forced to play using the steam online mode, and after disconnecting a few seconds ino the game several times, even after forwarding all relevant ports, we swapped back to the Heroes 3 Complete from gog.com ($10 and includes all the expansion with no DRM).\n\nThe HD graphics upgrades are nice, and are undeniably better then the original graphics, however, the new set of problems (crashes) and lack of several features present in the cheaper non-HD version do not allow me to give a pass for this game.\n\nIf Ubisoft releases the expansions in HD, or heck, even just fixes the disconnecting issues then I may be able to change my recommendation.\n\nI do appreciate the effort to modernize such a great classic as Heroes of Might and Magic 3, it truly is a masterpiece of a game. Playing through the single player campaign in updated HD will surely be a treat when I get around to it, but don't expect the multiplayer feature to work well in this mode.

For more sp-oriented people there's also no additional campaigns, which were vastly superior to the ones from RoE (especially the AB campaigns are the peak of the series).\n\nSeriously, just buy the Complete edition, slap the HD mod on it (apart from increased resolutions it actually improves the game by adding some great functionality, like automatic force transfer between armies for example) and you'll have yourself a vastly superior game for a lower cost.\n\nI can only recommend HoMM III HD to people who want to replay the RoE campaigns and feel the urge to do it in "HD" that is strong enough to make them pay 15 Euros for it. In other words: I cannot recommend it to anyone.","February 12, 2015","false","2.0"," 66 of 81 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","66","81","2","0"

And guess what's not included with the HD remake, oh I don't know.. MAYBE MONERE'S TOWN?!\n\nCons FOR ITS PRICE:\n66% of campaign content.\n1 Less faction\nLess artifacts\nLess Heroes\nIf they do release the expansions, they'll probably charge for them too. I would really hate that\n\nPros:\nPlay it on a tablet!\nScreen is nicer than the HD edition, but its not a big difference\nSteam multiplayer is easier to configure\n\nMeh:\nNew sprites but same amount of animated frames, so not actually smoother visually because its still choppy.\nSame framerate cap meaning, not really a bad thing, but its not a good thing either.\nAchievements on steam?\nDoesnt work well with mods, I group this is meh, because many people don't know of the mods for the game, but there are some pretty awesome ones out there that can make the game even more fun which is kind of scary, because this game is amazing already.\n\nI'm not being biased because the conflux isn't in the game, what I am upset over, is that its more expensive for less content, and it's not just a little bit of content, it is actually about 50% content missing in comparison to the Complete version on GoG. I'm saying about 50% because if you play all the campaigns and every campaign is approximately 3 maps, you have 18 maps, with the expansions theres another 13 campaigns for 39 maps and you even get an extra town, see why its 50%? Heck, it's even more, I'm just being generous. On top of that for single scenario allows random generated maps, which make multiplyaer fun. Without random generated single scenarios multiplayer because different because you have to choose a premade map, that one of your friends know like the back of their hand and it creates unfair advantage.\n\n\nNow, for what the HD edition does offer some screen size changes and whether or not you want it on fullscreen or not, but the hd mod covers that, the only good thing is everything technically being stretched which makes the game more comfortable. I guess this does support tablet play which is nice on the go, I would play this on a tablet, but even then the expansions could have been released because its just more space at that point. Space on a tablet isnt an issue considering modern storage devices. The sprites are new and fresh in order to preserve the appeal to the game which is fine, its not amazing because the animations arent more fluid but I am impressed in how they buffered things without making them look like a different game. I guess steam makes multiplayer better, but you dont play with random people ever, this is a game of friends and betrayal and jolly cooperation.","February 6, 2015","false","30.3"," 64 of 79 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","64","79","2","0"

Like most people here (probably) this was one of the foundations that made me a gamer today! And has always been one of my favorite games throughout all my childhood! Me and my cousins would always play this even if we were at my familys house, or theirs! The only thing we wanted now when we are older and don't always have the chance to meet up and play like the old days! Is a multiplayer that let's us play against and with eachother without playing on the same PC, we tried Tunggle and Hamachi and other IP changing tools before this version came out to try multiplayer and have lan parties to play this. But always ended up playing on the same PC wich made us very dissapointed, and when i saw this was coming out, the first thing that came to my mind is that we could FINALLY, play together. 3 of us 4 cousins started playing the day this game got out, but was greatly dissapointed when THE only map we could play was "Realm of Chaos (Allies)" and that was it, and since we have ALL played every.single.scenario. On this game it was not exactly enlightning, and to see that it was NO random map generator made us really and i mean REALLY dissapointed!

I mean last time i checked Age of Empires got themselves a expansion on their new HD version so it's not impossible!\n\nSo to sum this up if Ubisoft or anyone else didnt feel like reading this review. i just want to say, if the Heroes III Complete version available at GoG has a legit multiplayer, i'm going to refund these money i spent and buy that instead!","February 1, 2015","false","24.9"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","44","53","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blitz4/recommended/297000/","Blitz4","Blitz4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blitz4/","332 products in account","This game is tough to review. It's an upgraded version of the original, which released back in 1999. I don't care to, and have never played H3 multiplayer, keep that in mind. I have never played the original vanilla game, instead I used a mod to make the game playable on modern computers, I'll get to that in a moment.\n\nThe biggest pros are the new HD graphics, standard support for 1080p, and more than 64k colors.\nThe biggest cons for the new HD version is that you could install a mod for the original game called 'HoMM3 HD' ( https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/ ) which supported larger resolutions than the standard 800x600, 32-bit colors, and it added A LOT to the game, A LOT! You can imagine a mod being worked on for at least 5 years, has some great features. After you use the mod, it's hard to go back to the vanilla game and all of the mouse clicking involved with it.\n\nI'm not here to say this HD version sucks, it's a classic game. You can play random maps by loading pre-built RoE random maps generated with the original game (or downloaded online). There's a tablet version, but you could already play the original game on a tablet before.\n\nTo me the only thing this game adds to the old game is updated graphics, and for me that's not that big of a deal, I would rather have the features from the HD mod instead of the graphics, so I'll stick to the old game until there's a mod for H3 HD.\n\nI'm also hating that I'm reviewing a game called "Heroes of Might & Magic 3 HD", but it should be called "Heroes of Might & Magic 3 - Restoration of Erathia HD" --- there's a big difference and I'm still sore about it.","February 1, 2015","false","0.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","39","47","3","0"

Specially considering that it only the base game (its 2 expansions notwitstanding)\n\nOnly thing that is in true Widescreen resolutions is the main map, every other screen is in 4:3 with borders which is offsetting. And while the textures have been beautifully brought to HD, they are just redraws of the spritesheets, so they still have the same limited animations they had decades ago. The main menu is a great example of this (the angel's sword looks really rushed)\nThey have recycled the cutscenes (which is the aspect of the game that has aged the worst, and they seriously needed a remake) which brings down the value of HD Edition.\n\nPersonally, Im dont like when games are graphics > gameplay; but isn't the goals of HD Editions like this one to bring the graphics up-to-date to an already existing gameplay? (and a great one at that) I usually expect more when decisions  like just remastering the base game are taken into account.

More detailed hero portraits are nice, sure, but why are the town portraits more blurry than ever? Some UI updates? Nice, but it doesn't look good outside on the adveture map. The bold font choice for messages like the ones on the start of the scenarios is a bit hard to read as well.\n\nEntering the towns, they do look good, though. The sharper edges really come to their rights there. For creatures, the updates are very hit and miss: Pikemen, griffons and orcs come to mind as pretty bad updates. Goblins, ogres and black dragons look pretty amazing.\n\nIn combat, the movement shadow comes with a grid you can't turn off, which I personally find offputting. Some animations seem more clunky and chopped up than before.\n\nAll in all, not really worth the extra money, although it is really, really nice to play without that awful Conflux again.

For a HD version of the game, the graphics are hardly any better than on the old classic, the only improvement is being able to choose a higher resolution, which is possible to do with mods on with the complete edition from GoG.com. Unfortunatly the game does not run any better than the old version on newer machines, the game would often freeze for a split second when doing tasks with your hero like digging for the grail. Also since I have two monitors, the game would frequently bug out when scrolling towards my 2nd monitor, even when playing in fullscreen mode.\n\nAnother big letdown was the fact that the HD Edition DID NOT include the 2 expansion packs The Shadow of Death and Armageddon's Blade, meaning you are losing out on a lot of already released content. The price of the HD Edition cannot be justified for how little it adds. You are better off buying the complete edition from GoG.com, saving some money in the process and having more content.","January 29, 2015","false","0.9"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","0"

Mostly because They added a lot of the Iconic features that HoMM is remembered for. Like:\n- Random Map Generator\n- Conflux, the town, heroes, and creatures\n- Compound Artifacts\n- Monolith Teleporters\n- The Four Non-Town Dragon Types, Crystal, Rust, Fairy and Azure\nThe only good this they add are\n- Stable Online Multiplayer\n- Better Graphics\n\n\nThe HD sometimes bothers me even, because they made some changes to the characters. It annoys me. Not to mention that the Sprites glitch out and stand in the wrong locations sometimes!\nI play it in the Original Graphics half the time Because of that!\n\nFinal Thought: Don't bother with this version. Unless Ubisoft Give us the Expansion packs for free, which they most likely wont, because they are horrible people and will try to suck out all the money that we have. So just go to GOG and get the Complete pack for a lot cheaper.","January 29, 2015","false","6.7"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

Arguably still the best Heroes game out there the HD edition makes numerous touch-ups to portraits, units and the world map, combined with the ability to run at higher resolutions. This gives the games' timeless graphics an even more refined edge, which is, quite gorgeous. The problem is that the HD edition only spans the original game (Restoration of Erathia) and does not include both sizable expansions and the slew of addition Heroes Chronicles campaigns. The HD edition would have been an excellent opportunity for Ubisoft to bundle all of this content into one package for the first time.\n\nIn the end you're simply better off using one of the excellent community HD mods.

Literally a downgrade overall from the Heroes of Might and III Complete Edition. Not having random map killed a huge part of the draw to the game possessed by the original. Why not release all the expansions on a game that is 15 years old? It doesn't even run as smooth as the original. A visual tune up with a lot of drawbacks. Honestly if you just visually tuned up the old game and made it multiplayer compatible with the steam interface through a lobby/match making system it would be worth the buy if not more.

Admittedly it is in HD, sadly the game itself is actually worse [in terms of gameplay and content] than something created 15 years ago. WHAT!?\n\nI never imagined I would be writing a negative review, especially considering how much I love this game, but this is dreadful. I put my faith in the HD remake, but in reality I should have bought the original again.\n\nIf you're playing this because you love the random map generator, and exploring each faction then do not buy it. If you enjoy playing the campaign repeatedly and only want to do multiplayer [which I haven't tried] then this is probably for you. Hopefully ubisoft release the rest of the content at some point or at least explain why it has not been included. No doubt a HoMM3 DLC pack for £9.99 will be released in the coming months.

It is NOT a bad game. In fact, this game is amazing, and if you have never played Heroes before this game is my suggestion as to where you should start the journey.\n\nThe reason for my down vote is simply because I paid $17 for nostalgia and that's pretty much it. Granted the graphics are better, but they weren't ever truly terrible for what the game was, and I feel overall not much else was done for it. It does not include all content which only adds to further disappointment and unless you're playing against people of your skill level, multiplayer is a joke (if it even works). The only solution I can see to correct this problem is to release the other 50% of the game (yes, the additional content accounted for pretty much 50% of the game) for free to those who have currently purchased the game and to add the random map generation.\n\nWhilst I still enjoy playing the game it's disappointing to know how unfinished this rerelease is, especially when it is an obvious cash-grab rereleasing a game for today's desktops.","February 10, 2015","false","31.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

Two good examples are that black dragons are no longer immune to magic, and dwarves are no longer magic resistant. Also, some of the old maps are missing. On the up side they did add some new maps. To me, a HoMM fan from the release of HoMM 1, this modified version feels dumbed down and less challenging. Battles will usually be determined by who has the most and the highest level monsters, and not who is best able to leverage their creature's assets better against their opponant's creature's weaknesses. That's because the advantages and disadvantage have all been nurfed to the point where there really isn't much difference between two differerent creatures of the same level.\n\nI wondered if perhaps my perceptions were just a matter of memory being distorted by the mists of time so I go out my old CD's and started up DOSBox and there it was, just as I remembered. BIG difference! Checkers vs. Chess. I thought that I might be able to soften the disapointment by copying over some of the maps which were left out,but instead i was in for another disappointment. The original files and all those user created maps from 1999 are incompatable with this version.\n\nAll that said, I hesitatate to give it a thumbs down. For those who never knew the 1999 New World Computing version, this could be a fun, light strategy and tactics game minus all the minutia and micro-management of epic strategy games of the Europa Universalis genre. It weighs in lighter than  the Total War series too. If you want some strategy but its been a long, demanding day at work or school and your brain just wants to take it easy for the evening, this might be just the perfect thing.\n\nNOTE Since writing this review it has been brought to my attention by Steam user potmdehex that a mod has been released which will convert the old map format to the new format. This adds quite a bit more value to the game considering how many excellent user made maps are still floating around on the Internet, not to mention the fact that it makes the original official game map available again. Information regarding this mod can be found right here on Steam at the HD Edition forum at address: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001014053/recommended/297000?tscn=1463098014\n\nAgain, many thanks to potmdehex for this welcome information (even if his name is a little <adgitive of your choice, either positive or negative>. Personally I take no position on it. I simply wish to offer my gratitude for the information).","May 6","true","43.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","2"

Also, I guess I'll go and... make a huge taco that I can crawl into and hopefully get eaten by Shrek or something big.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randylaheyhimself/recommended/297000/","randylaheyhimself","k.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randylaheyhimself/","226 products in account","Rating: 7/10  (Same amazing music and game, would be a 10 if it wasn't a sad remake).\n\nFirst of all, I've always loved Heroes of Might and Magic 3 since it first came out in 1999.  I will be using "HOMM3" from now on as a reference.\n\n- IF YOU HAVE NEVER played HOMM3 before and are interested in the concept, $15 bucks is worth it.  The game is amazing and I've spent about a thousand hours on it easily (before the Steam version was released)  You can either play single player, multiplayer or campaign.\n\nThe campaigns are fun although it's a shame you don't get to play all of them (no expansions included).  It's one of the best turn based strategies around to date IMO.  You control hero(es) that you can level up and attain spells in which you can cast once per turn in battle.  Lot's of cool spells and creatures in this game!\n\nBasically, you run around as a hero attaining ore/wood/crystal/sulfur etc. mining pits and can choose where you want to go on the map.  You can collect artifacts which will help your hero and raise it's attributes.  You can fit many on each hero.  The object is to build up your base and make a nice army then defeat the opposing hero and his castles as fast as possible.  It's nice that this game has a variety of difficulties which will keep you entertained.  IF you missed this game you should sincerely consider purchasing it, but expect to play mostly single player (which is still a lot of fun).\n\n- IF YOU OWN HOMM3, don't bother.  Remaking a game from 17 years ago HD and adding nothing new is a pretty pathetic joke.  The HD is nice, but I still even prefer the Wake of Gods (non-HD) version where things in the atmosphere move like the trees and such.\n\nThe least they could of done was add a new campaign or some new maps or AT LEAST more than 13 Achievements and GOOD ONES?  I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd love to purchase a new expansion for HOMM3, not spend $15 on the same game.  Also the Netplay is a joke.  Luckily I got this in a Humble Bundle for a great deal.\n\nPros:\n------\n\n- Nicer graphics, same amazing music and sounds\n- Has Achievements.....\n- This game is still awesome\n\nCons:\n------\n\n- Nothing new besides a minor update in graphics\n- Can't hit space when on a tower/building etc. anymore (pretty lame when you go through a dungeon door/teleporter and have to dismiss your hero when a strong enemy is waiting on the other side)\n- Massive lack of new content and achievements\n- Disappointing if you already played/own HOMM3\n\nSo UBISOFT, stop making new Heroes of Might and Magic games with prestine graphics that SUCK and start remaking some Heroes 3 expansions in which people will actually enjoy and buy!\n\nThe end.","March 17","true","21.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

Attacking units does not take any damage in the moats, what is up whit that?\n7. Got an ingame popup during battle telling me the hero felt the battle was uneaven and wanted to run away. (New thing, don´t like new things)\n\nJust buy the original game on gog instead and save yourself the terror of this turdblossom.

I hoped that it would get new players into the HoMM series (HoMM6 is not what a Heroes game should be). I wish this rerelease did a better job of proving the beauty of this game and the simple 2D style with an amazing system (check out spiderweb games). The nostalgia was worth it for me, but I don't know that I would buy another Ubisoft rerelease (or game as of late). It was your move Ubi, you had so many gamers intrigued and excited. Can you fix it?\n\n----\n\nThe expansions are missing because the code was lost... which is understandable, but why no map generator?\n\nOtherwise it is still Heroes III and is worth it.

I have thousands of hours invested into the old series. I would notice something being amiss.\n\nI knew going into it that this was only Heroes 3 Restoration of Erathia. With that being said we should really be judging it for its HD elements and bugs/performance.\n\nThe moats look different. It was the first thing i noticed other then cage of warlords in the fortress town now actually looks like a cage instead of a net.\n\nSo yes there are some hd elements that are extremely noticable. Is it alot? No.\n\nGranted i have not put that much time into this remake yet so i may re-review it after the fact. But for right now i will give it a down vote only because i find this hard to believe that much time has been put into it to call it a HD remake.\n\n","December 2, 2015","false","2.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It hurts me deeply to see it rated poorly, as the result of people complaining about the lack of expansions, or random map generators, etc, when the game itself is so incredibly immense and beautiful, even in its smallest aspects. The truth is that this game is profoundly beautiful, and even more so now as the result of those who took the time to polish and HD it - another facet many seem to be complaining about, and yet it clearly looks amazing now; it has been brought back to life for a whole new generation through this hard work. I want to take this as an opportunity to personally thank the people responsible for doing this, for truly it is difficult to improve upon a masterpiece, and yet here it stands: You all have done wonderful work, and I honestly couldn't be happier with it. I think it's spectacular. I understand that it doesn't have every element of the orginal, and the expansions, but those are but pebbles in the cosmic ocean of how brilliant this is despite them. We need to get the rating higher on this game so that more people are drawn to experience its Magic, and with a little luck, we just Might :) Sincerely, Kenalthani","March 18","true","56.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

I do recommend Homm3 in general. However, This version IS to be recommended to people that's never been playing Homm3 before, as it offers a smooth experience with multiplayer (a broader community as Gameranger is hosting different versions of the game which may or may NOT be compatible with the one you have) and it, obviously, got some nice edges to it. If you loved the older graphics, it's still available with the push of a button.\n\nThis "review" will mention some features which is "hidden", both positive and negative.\n\n-This version offers a stable type of multiplayer solution imbedded in the game. When you enter the lobby, the game will prompt you to open 3 specific ports. This isn't necessarily required, as i've personally played several games via the games own MP function with friends which hasn't touched the ports/their router.\n\n-This version is actually having a very stable MP solution, and we've never experienced any DROPS in connection from any party while playing (3 people on different locations with solid Nordic internet provider)\n\n-The graphic is actually showing more than "just boosted sprites" when you look at certain features such as faces on heroes and creatures. Half of them look ♥♥♥♥ing insane due to insane-staring-eyes, but sharper edges makes things look pleasant.\n\n-The map editor in this is poor, more so for the lack of the well-loved obstacle brush which is available in the "complete" version which includes the expansions. I was told by a kind and well-informed gentleman in the community forum here on steam that the complete version map-editor actually is compatible with this product here on steam IF you during map editing in the other version ENABLE restoration of erathia as compatible - the map editor itself should help you out with verifying that in it's embedded tools.\n-The map editor IS functioning if you still want to create some more intense, smaller maps, however, which is a pleasant surprise to me\n\n-Streaming the game works great, and it's nothing to it. Very easy and smooth. Also a recommendation to stream for your friends while you play to allow for more fun during the turns.\n\nAgain - i can't recommend someone pay 15 bucks for this game if you somehow already have a functioning version of it available, and if you're a veteran and tired of the vanilla. BUT i can recommend it for reasons presented above.\n\nOn a sidenote: I suspect that we might actually see the other expansions delievered to us in a future, for free or for a few dollaz, from Ubisoft.  The lost sourcecode is probably not even true.\nSecond sidenote: I own 3 different setups of the game, and i've lost countless others. My gametime must be 2000+","September 7, 2015","true","67.8"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","24","46","0","0"

Very pleased. Also been playing for days and havent encountered a single bug.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter a recent update the game can no longer open. It errors out and crashes immediately. I ended up buying the GOG version to play. It(being an original version) is missing tons of improvements of the remaster like simple windowed vs fullscreen, extra in-game options and steam multiplayer. It's a shame UBISOFT and the developer they had build the remaster screwed it up so bad. I'd much rather play the remaster if I could.\n\nTo be honest I dont agree with the illiterates who cant read the title of this game and were shocked it didn't have all the expansions built in like the Heroes III Complete Edition does. The remaster's features are a huge improvement over the original and Android support is awesome. I wish i could go back to that instead of the GOG version i have now. Sadly it's just too buggy.","February 7, 2015","false","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played this game since childhood, it is what made me a PC gamer. Easily a thousand hours. The base game was all I had for a long time. Very recently have I touched the expansions. I did however download custom maps and computer generated ones. Those were great, the base game was great, and the expansions are great. The storyline is cool, it puts you in some cool senerios. My favorite class is the winter class, titans are the ♥♥♥♥. But honestly it changes, all the top tier creatures are ♥♥♥♥ing cool. Truly the only Heroes I ever got into. Heroes 5 was gay, but the creatures were cool. Heroes 4 was very lame to but because your hero could fight. This game though, have impacted my brain for sure with the hours I have put in. I believe I started developing some of my basic thinking and understand skills from this game. I only played this game to kill though, no digging for grails or getting 100,000 gold. It was exhausting to get to the point where multiply heroes needed to be strong with lots of creatures. The point where all the creatures that will join you are probably gone, and the only ones left are the insane amount of cyclops, or any other creature that would ♥♥♥♥ on your pool easily. The computer always goes for objectives, so if you actually want to play the game you will need to manage your resources, but this is only for games that are very large maps with several players, and you set the difficulty high. The higher the opponents, the more you get hurt really. Monsters are very strong, and you get less resources than them, which is very important when killing creatures significantly damage you for being a t1 or t2. Most played map is All for One, It lets you choose the pace of the game, and it offers many different castles that work. Angels and Devils on the map for sure, Along with another top tier guarding the devil's box and another guarding an artifact. The understanding I have learned from this game gave me a very unique view on school. I was very ahead in a select group of skills for my age. It has made the way I learn very easy in some situations.","May 12","true","33.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

No more playing around with Hamachi, or Tunngle, or any other ♥♥♥♥ like that. Just create game, invite friend, and presto (although, on hindsight, the MP does suffer from occasional crashes, but I was at least able to finish couple of matches).\n\nHowever... as has been stated before, there are no other expansions included here. Its just the original game, and expensive at that. Why pay 15e for the original game with little better graphics and online MP, when you can buy the complete edition from GoG for 9e, which looks only bit worse, and can still work online with the aforementioned Hamachi/Tunngle/♥♥♥♥ like that (worse than Steam, yes, but it can still work)?\n\nIf Ubisoft would add the other expansions to this edition, then yes. I'd recommend this as must-buy, without a doubt. However, most likely, even if the expansions get released, they'll be as paid DLC, for like 10e per piece or some ♥♥♥♥ like that.\n\nI'd say, stick with the complete edition on GoG.

I bought the game a week ago from ♥♥♥ for 4 euros. Me and a friend started playing it, and it was very easy to connect online and start playing together. The game worked flawless and the graphical changes are extremtly pleasureable to the eye. (We've played around 7 full games now)\n\nI played Homm3 when i was a kid, and I started again several years back. Though I've been playing casually once a month or something. However, for those who plays this game hardcore i understand you want random map generator. Though this will never bother someone who plays on a average or casual level.\n\nYes, a playable race (Conflux) is missing, but honestly I personally haven't felt any difference at all.\n\nWell in a recent patch they updated so that you can join eachother with regular steam invite. But when you press multiplayer it says you have to open ports, so i did. But my friend tried hosting without opening ports and it worked just fine. So because of this I would strongly recommend The HD Edition over the GOG version.","March 22","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

All this is the base game with greatly improved visual quality. I will leave a positive review as this game does look indeed better than the regular verison of HoMM3, which is what was it said on the tin and what I expected, and I'm sure that most of us already have the regular complete versions as well as Wake of Gods, Horn of the Abyss and all sorts of things. The price is steep, though, so I advise you wait for a sale (you can pick it up at GamersGate.com for £3 right now) and simply play the GOG version for now.\n\nTL;DR  - newbies, go to gog.com and pick the complete version there.

It's especially missing convenient mechanics like pressing space to re-enter a building. It's hard to go back to after playing Heroes 3 complete.\n- Doesn't add any kind of mechanical improvements over the original. No Steam cloud, no improved menus (e.g. No load/return to menu during battles which would REALLY have been a great addition). It's just lazy.\n\nBut the main thing really is that the HoMM3 HD mod lets you play the game with both expansions, adds many great shortcuts (e.g. if you're moving the last stack off a hero, it will automatically leave 1 creature on that hero). Having played with the HD mod for so long, I REALLY miss those conveniences and it's hard to go back to this.\n\nThe only situation where this version might be preferable is if you have a small, yet very high-resolution screen, in which case this game will look better.

Better than its ancestor and its succesor, even the HOMM VI itself. For me, HOMM III is my childhood memories. In early 2000 my uncle introduce this game to me, and in one week, I already addicted to this game and my childhood is full of fantasy about angels, devils, dragon, titan, behemoth, hydra, and many more.\nAs the time goes by, I decided to play Campaign and finish the storyline, and I must say, the storyline especialy Shadow of Death and Armageddon Blade is not a cheap storyline like other fantasy adventure, the storyline much more like noveltry and its awesome.\nAlmost ten years goes by after the last time I play HOMM III, in those ten years I was hoping that Ubisoft create new HOMM which is still awesome like HOMM III, and then I thought, "why not a remake of this game with HD definition? this thing is famous nowdays"\n\nHeroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition:\nAnd then here it comes the Return of the Legends\n\nI was dissapoint at HOMM III - HD Edition in Steam's Review Page. So many people dissapoint with the graphic, some people still find the graphic hasn't changing. Well, at the first time I install and play HOMM III - HD Edition, I had a same thought, and then I open my old HOMM and make a comparasion, and Im impressed of how well the improvement actualy is. The problem was in our way of seeing. We grow up with a lot of games that make a lot of improvement in every year, so the classic game look so awful. I think this case is same like the Fallout 4 problem\n\nMy Hope\nI was grateful that I could play this game again in 2015 with a HD Remake.\nI hope that Ubisoft also make the Shadow of Blade and Armageddon Blade Edition.\nI dont care if its come as DLC for this Restoration of Erathia, or its come as diffrent game, I believe HOMM true fans will buy and play it, because Shadow of Blade and Armageddon Blade has a better storyline and game improvement.\n\nI also hoping that in someway, Ubisoft also included the Wake of God edition, eventhough it was a fan made. Im sure that if Ubisoft collaborate and make this Wake of God edition, the WOG edition will come out as a perfect Heroes Edition.\n\nMy Rating for this Game:\nMuch Childhood Memories! 9.5/10","November 6, 2015","true","39.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Videos don't do justice to how nice it looks for an older game.  Overall it's a very slick experience. I like it a lot better than the newer games like Heroes VI, which feel bloated, and I'm convinced it cheats by magically giving the AI units it can't possibly produce that fast.  The absence of a random map generator or expansions is not a deal breaker for me at all.  The map editor is still there,  and there is no end to the number of user maps you can find online.  Personally I find the campaigns to be childishly written, and I don't play them.  The real test of how great this game is would be that even my 10 year old son is hooked on it even though he could be playing more graphically advanced games.","October 4, 2015","true","23.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The HD version was a great excuse to play through it once again.\n\nIf you've never played HoMM before, it's a perfectly paced, turn based strategy where every turn you accomplish something, and your next turn always has something tantalisingly out of reach leading to that "just one more turn" additiction. The mix of hero progression, town building, world exploration and army building is deeply satisfying and the combat mode plays like a chess puzzle of prioritising which threats to eliminate first.\n\nIf you're a HoMM veteran then you probably already own the original on CD from 15 years ago. The HD version gives slightly cleaned up graphics, achievements and the convenience of Steam, but lacks the DLC and some other features. I personally didn't miss any of those features so I was very happy with my purchase.","November 14, 2015","true","69.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I actually love that fact that this game was released on steam, due to my original CD-version not working anymore. Finally I can play this wonderful game again. The graphical retouching is of excellent quality, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it.\n\nYet, this HD-remake let me down. I was dumbfound when I realized that the expansions, and their features along with them, were not included in this remake. The scenarios provided by the game are enjoyable, but this HD-remake doesn't have the amazing replay value that the original game has, due to not having the ability to generate and play random maps - the mainstay multiplayer fun of the title, in my opinion.\n\nI have really mixed feelings about my purchase, after owning the HoM&M III Complete, as it feels very different without all the added content in the expansions. I will be 100% happy with this HD-remake after the expansions become available, and I really do hope they are being worked on.\n\nAs the game stands of this moment, I would rate it 7/10, but has potential for a full 10/10 with the expansions.","September 5, 2015","true","31.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This is true, but the base-game is still the same as it was (w/polished graphics), and is still in my opinion, the best Heroes of MnM game in the collection. However, because of its lack of any expansions, I do not recommend at full price. I waited and purchased it when it went on sale, and am thoroughly happy with the single player and hot-seat multiplayer modes. I cannot yet comment on the online multiplayer mode because I have yet to try it.

Which race to be this time and what warriors do we equip our main hero with? How do you battle tactically (use ranged and hold them off with melee and spells) or just aim for the toughest guys around?\n\nThis game is great with it's many different play modes: scenarios, random maps, campaign and multiplayer.  Mostly the same actual gameplay however different kinda maps and objectives. There is also map editing, edit some maps or make entirely new ones :D\n\nSo this HD remake is pitching it as a whole new game, well not really, just HD rendered which I can't even tell on my current gaming screen, like I know it's supposed to be better and there is an option to turn on the old graphics, which of course turns it all fuzzy. The other added thing is the incorporated steam multiplayer which is very useful when trying to do games online.\n\nIn summary a good game with many hours of gameplay, #3 in my opinion is better than all the rest, #5 comes the closest after that but the classic third is the best, I would fully reccommend purchasing for funs.","October 29, 2015","true","7.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Yes, I know there's an HD mod for the original version (in fact, I love it). Then why did I essentially buy Heroes III for the third time, giving Ubisoft, who has otherwise not treated this magnificent video game series with the respect it deserves, my not-so-hard-earned money? I've probably sunk more time into HoMM3 than any other game, and experiencing this brilliant game with high-resolution graphics is quite refreshing after playing it for well over a decade with sprites made for 800×600 screens. Unlike some other reviewers, I think DotEmu has actually done an excellent job upgrading the graphics (with a few minor exceptions). The gameplay is of course still there, as captivating and enjoyable as ever. The third instalment is the pinnacle of the series, and with the way games are made these days, there will probably never be anything quite like it again. I think this HD edition is the closest you'll ever get to a true 21st-century Heroes of Might and Magic game (not that Heroes IV is bad – it's just different), and that's worth getting, if you ask me.","October 31, 2015","true","36.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It looks beautiful. Its everything I ever hoped for, except for the expansion packs. Please give us the expansion packs. This will give you hours of glorious game play none the less.

If you have never played HOMM but are looking for a challanging turn based strategy game, you will also love it. I cannot recommend this game enough.

Buy this game IF IT GOES ON SALE. Currently they are charging too much considering it's age and the moderately-noticable graphics upgrade. This game also does not include expansion content.\n\n\nREVIEW: One of the best turn based strategy RPG's ever, and the best title in the series.\n\nHowever...\n\nThe "HD" part is not very remarkable. At a quick glance you won't even notice the difference. Also disappointing is the fact that none of the expansions were included with this.\n\nI am happy that multiplayer was modernized. This game is from the 56K modem days, and so connecting was a clunky mult-step process involving each others IP addresses etc.\n\nStill the best HoMM game in the franchise, easy to lose many hours to this game.\n\nI will recommend this game, however I also recommend you just wait for it to go on sale. The full price they are charging is not worth the minimal graphics changes and lack of expansion content.","September 23, 2015","true","30.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I am playing H3 with friends.\n\nBut you should know this before buy:\nIt is only base version of H3: Restoration of Erathia, so there are no features included in expansions such as:\n- Random Map - you need to download maps for RoE (but Map editor is included)\n- additional town: Conflux\n- additional Campaigns\n- Some tweaks in gameplay\n- More neutral creatures\nStill Ubisoft had said that H3HD would be only base game because they only had source code for vanilla game, so everyone was informed about that. I don't know if it is catch to buy DLC or real thing, but I still appreciate the lifting.\nEDIT:\n- Also please mind that some great mods won't work with this version because they use content from expansions, mods such as WOG (in the wake of Gods), HOTA (Horn of the Abyss) and the project VCMI. ( for more information about mods refer to page http://heroescommunity.com/)\n\nAlso this version seemed to have some bugs such as music in city starting over each time you enter, in normal version it would carry on despite what are you doing, so you don't hear same piece of song over and over. But ithere is nothing game breaking.\n\nIf those bother you too much, and only want pure hotseat or single player experience by all means buy H3 complete with all features from GoodOldGames, because you will be dissapointed with this version, as you will miss great chunk of features in complete edition.\n\nThat said although it doesn't feature expansion packs, it is still H3, great basis for refreshed expansion packs. It is still the same playability, but now with easier set up for multiplayer game, and i am looking forward for expansion pack recreated the same way. And I must go now, ONE MORE TURN...","February 5, 2015","true","7.5"," 18 of 43 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","18","43","0","0"

Modern resolutions are supported without making pixels as big as your hand, and that in itself is something, but the game doesn't look "better" per se.\n\nTo me, the key question is whether or not this is a game worth playing, and to this question the answer is "yes". It's amazing how well HoMM3 has held up over the years. It's by no means a "complex" strategy game, since you're basically juggling a few reasources so as to maximise your long term output, and trying not to get outmaneuvered by the opponent. But there's surprising depth to the battle layer, with tons of tricks that you can learn (or, as in my case, remember) that will help you prevail in what may otherwise seem like unwinnable scenarios. Balancing this many units (eight factions times seven units times two variants, plus a number of "neutral" creatures) is hard, and I'm truly amazed, both as a player and as a professional designer, by how many tricks HoMM3 manages to pull off. There are a number of "spiritual successors", but none of the ones I've played is a match, design-wise.\n\nThe levels, that is - campaign maps, are well thought out as well. You will be constantly second-guessing yourself about whether you should explore that forest path, or maybe stick closer to one of your castles in case an enemy emerges from the tunnels. The addition of a second, underground layer has made the game essentially three-dimensional and added much to its dynamism, if not complexity. As a result HoMM3 doesn't take long to wrap your head around, yet it does take some time to master. It's a masterful balance of accessibility and challenge.","February 14, 2015","true","63.6"," 15 of 37 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","15","37","0","0"

At no point does the steam store disclose it being anything other or more than that. 3D0's completely inept handling of the franchise lost the source code for the expansions, so don't expect them. Which is a shame because of the campaigns and UI improvements, but I sure don't miss the Conflux. It is not Steam nor Ubisoft's responsability, whatever their other MANY failings, if you buy this game expecting the expansions because you didn't bother to read what you bought. You're no better than the people participating in early-access games and complaining about playing incomplete games.\n\nSecond: For this lack of the expansions, this HD remake could be a bit cheaper.\n\nOther than that, this is what it says in the tin, Heroes III in high definition. Not the lazy upscalings of previous mods to the game, the models of all units and all art assets in the game were actually re-drawn into a higher resolution on top of the original designs. The game supports widescreen and the higher resolution means you can see more on the adventure map, which is a plus. The game's cinematics are still the same, though.\n\nWindows firewall only complained when I tried to start a multiplayer game, but once I allowed it the multiplayer worked for me without problem. The multiplayer suffers very little from the lack of expansions, only losing the Conflux and a few overpowered artifacts, which doesn't bother me, but might bother you.\n\nThere is no random map, but there is a map editor and it works very well on the higher resolution.\n\nTL;DR - This is Restoration of Erathia only, LIKE ADVERTISED, if you think it is a crime against humanity to not include a couple of expansions that were LOST BY 3D0, feel free to not buy it.","February 14, 2015","true","6.3"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","13","33","0","0"

First, the game itself.\n\nHeroes 3 is, in my opinion, the best game of the series by a wide margin. It's tight, well-balanced, and offers lots of replay value with the map editor. If you've never played this game and you like strategy games, pick it up. You won't be sorry. Having it on steam makes it even easier to play with friends and, hopefully, will bring a good pool of custom maps from the community.\n\nThat being said, this is only the base game. You can buy this PLUS two expansion sets for $10 on another website (the URL escapes me for the moment). This adds a new town type and a random map generator. Some people really like these features, I find them trivial. But it's still more stuff for less money. On the downside, you lose that steam compatibility aspect.\n\nSo, do I recommend getting this? Yes. Do I think it's worth $15? No. If you're like me and $15 is chump change, get it anyway. If $15 is a lot of money for you or you can't justify spending more money on a game than it's worth, wait for a sale and get it 50% off or something. It's not like you'll have to wait long.

For a game made in 1999, I think, the overall HD improvement is awesome considering the fact that everything from the original game was kept, including the maps, story, artefact and the graphic improvement is very noticeble. The HD is very noticeble with many of the game's units which look completely different, redesigned portraits, much better looking artefacts,hero interfaces effects and interface. Overall this game for me is 100% out of 100%. It was an excellent game to begin with and now it's even a better game, looking fantastically pleasant and it's affordable, so in my opinion it fits all the possible criteria. Everyone who is a fan of delicate little details added over this pleasant fantasy world will enjoy. A wonderful game and I hope there will be HD versions for the expansions too. Thank you Steam and Ubisoft. :). I love this game.\n\nNow, after 51.7 hours of playing I have finally finished it. Was completely worth it. I Feel so happy and acomplished.

Still HOMM III HD Edition has more then enough missions and maps to be enjoyed with even more endless replay value thanks to the graphical update.\n\nEnjoy and relax with a HD remake of a classic that is sure to deliever the gaming thrills and spills as only the HOMM series can. Oh and no extra steps about having to log into Uplay. Just start up steam in online or offline mode and your good to go. Thanks UbiSoft for that and for creating this HD remake to a fabulous game.","February 11, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

The expansions are not available. People who want to download and play custom maps are not going to want HoMM 3 HD Edition, because most custom maps require the expansions to play.\n\nSo what exactly do I like about it?\n\nI've never been so devoted to playing any HoMM game that I spend all my time with it. I have a lot of other games I like to play. When I do feel like playing HoMM, I will pick a version and spend a few weeks or a few months playing with it. Then, I move on to the next game.\n\nSo, I guess you could call me a "casual" HoMM player, and I only am interested in single player mode. By the time I finish all the campaigns in Restoration of Erathia, I am ready to move on to another game. So, I might as well enjoy the Restoration of Erathia campaign with the best available graphics and remastering.\n\nI also own the GoG.com complete version, with the HD mod. I find that I like the new HD version better, especially since it doesn't shrink the interface so small, and doesn't zoom out so far. I play on an 82" television screen, and the remastered character sprites are noticeably sharper to me than in the HD mod on the GoG.com version.\n\nIf I still feel like playing Blade of Armageddon and other expansions or downloaded custom maps after I finish Restoration of Erathia, I can move to the GoG.com with HD mod version and continue playing, although I will miss the improvements from the new HD version.\n\nIt doesn't have to be an either-or between the two versions. It can be a both-and. I will use the new version to play Restoration of Erathia, and enjoy lighting up the achievements and having the Steam support. Then I will switch to the other version if I feel like continuing.\n\nI've had no problems with stability issues nor found any bugs, either.\n\nI think my $15 was well-spent. That's less than the price of a home-delivered pizza dinner, and I'm getting weeks worth of much-enjoyed entertainment hours out of it.","February 7, 2015","true","95.9"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","0"

No changes to textures/sprites/bitmaps.  So it's hardly the same thing.\n\nThis HD edition is based on vanilla Heroes III that has only one campaign, Restoration of Erathia. Also, Random Map Generator was added in Armageddon's Blade, along with other additions like Conflux town, more artifacts, etc.\n\nI have GoG Complete version, even big box Heroes Complete Collection and I bought this too. It's a nice feeling to play the game that gave me so much wonderful memories. I've played the demo of this game for weeks even tho it was only one map with limited time.\n\nThe only bad thing is that the chances are very slim for an HD edition for AB and SoD and maybe the price.\n\nThis is the same game that many of us played back in '99 so don't hate it because Ubisoft is involved.","February 7, 2015","true","26.2"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","0"

Also at the time of writing this review it's on the latest Humble Bundle, so if you want a lot of Might and Magic, that's where to grab it -very- cheap, and it is definitely well worth it.\n\nI recommend this game.\nAt the full price? No, definitely not. But on offer? Sure, why not.\n\nWhat are the noticeable differences?\nModels -are- better, I'm not sure if people are just wearing nostalgia-goggles but I can see a clear difference. Enough for me to see there was an improvement.\nText is far clearer, overall It just looks... neater. More crisp, the entire game does. While some people like the looks of the original (as do I) I see nothing wrong with an updated version. And yes you can get HD packs with Mods, but some people might not trust mods, etc.\n\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen throughout a boat-load of reviews is people complaining they took Conflux away (The elemental nation) those who think that clearly don't remember that faction was an Expansion. It was not in the original game, not even the creatures were if I recall correctly. I'm hoping they release the updated expansions though, that's when It'll be worth your hard-earned money.\n\nWhat is HoMM?\nSome people might have never even heard of this game, and most of the reviews I've seen are just pointing out the differences and not explaining what the actual game is.\n\nHeroes of Might and Magic III is a turn-based Fantasy strategy game. You play a faction of your choice (Or depending on the scenario a specific one) based on many different mythological fantasies.\n\nFirst up is the Castle. These are the humans of the game, based on high-fantasy humanity, Griffins, Pikemen, Swordsman, Knights, etc. Fairly basic, not too much fantasy there, but still a fun game.\n\nFortress: This is a Swamp-based faction, such as Lizard men, Dragonfly, Gorgon and even Hydra. Most of these creatures all follow that theme.\n\nDungeon: Pretty much what it says on the box. Beholders, Minotaur, Black Dragon, Beholders, Naga, the things you can expect in a higher-fantasy underground based faction.\n\nRampart: The true 'high fantasy' faction, in my eyes. Dwarves, Elves, Unicorn, Centaur. These are the woodland creatures which are staple in nearly all high fantasy settings.\n\nTower: This is the 'magical' faction, so to speak. Magi, Animated Golem, Gargoyles and Genie are the sort of units you'll expect from here.\n\nNecropolis: Much like the dungeon, it's self explanatory. Skeletons, Undead, Lich, Vampires, etc. The darkest of the factions focused on the risen dead.\n\nThe game is played on an 'overhead map' where you control a hero with a certain set of movement, exploring the map and fighting monsters. Capturing things like Gold Mines and Crystal mines will generate those resources each turn (very valuable). The aim of the game is to simply beat your enemy in most scenarios. Although there are some specific campaign levels and scenarios where you have to achieve a certain objective, such as Kill X, take Y or find Z.\n\nUpon engaging an enemy you effectively zoom into a turn-based battlefield where your units are on one side and the enemy's are on the other. It's your job to command your troops (Each has specific health, attack, etc) and simply kill all the enemy (Unless they retreat)\n\nEach type of unit will stack into one group unless you split them and choose otherwise. (For example you can have a near unlimited amount of units in a single stack as long as they are the same troop, EG. 14 Swordsman)\n\nThe way you recruit units is by going into your cities and Purchasing the required buildings. You may only build one a turn so you should think things through before you buy them. For example, the game revolves around a weekly/monthly system, where each turn is one day. At the start of the week you can buy a fresh set of recruited troops. So it's often best on the later days of the week to either buy a building that unlocks new troops, or purchase something that increases the amount of men you generate per week, such as the Griffon Bastion in the Castle faction (Generates extra griffon a week).\n\n\nIn conclusion it's a fairly decent game, It has it's problems now as it also had it's problems then, is it worth the full price they're asking? No, not in my opinion. But if you can grab it on offer? Yeah, I'd say it's worth it. Even more so if you use Steam as your sole games platform. As stated at the top at the time of writing this review you can pick it, and many many more Might and Magic games up on the Humble Bundle.","May 10, 2015","true","7.1"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

There is a beautiful simplicity to being able to both plot out your movements, use strategy in both how you build your towns, how you control your armies, and the combat system, but to also be able to do this while in a relaxed and casual atmosphere.\n\nSure there is the downside that this game does not include all of the great expansions to HoMM3 and sure you can get those if you buy the complete game on GoG, but at the end of the day multiplayer through steam is just the easiest way to enjoy this game without any headaches and additional 3rd party software.  The random map generator may not be at your disposal here, but what is, is one of the best games ever made in it's original format, remastered with the same look and feel that we all loved, just with the ability to play it full screen with today's graphic standards.\n\nI absolutely love the game and welcome everyone to try it out, if you are ever looking for someone to play some multiplayer with I'll definitely be available for a game.","June 24, 2015","true","20.0"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","8","0","0"

It's less blurry. That's basically it. It's no remake.\n\nYes, it has literally 1/3rd of the content of the Heroes III Complete pack, and doesn't have the all important random map generator (because it was added in one of the expansions).\n\nHowever! It is Heroes III, and it does look just fine in full screen 1080p. Is that worth $15 to you? Because it definitely is to me. I love Heroes III, and while I don't mind playing the old version, my eyes prefer this one.\n\nAnd let's be honest here. Even without the expansions, there's a TON of content included. Easily 100 hours of stuff.

I played that game for _years_. Not only have I been playing it since I was around 9 years old, I've probably put thousands of hours into it altogether.\n\nThat said, I have never seen a single bug. I'm not saying that they don't exist, but they sure as hell were not obvious. The game was so polished that to this day it remains the iconic and definitive version of the HOMM series.\n\nAs we know, Ubisoft has done a remake of the game in HD. They claim to have repolished some 20k+ assets. I've played about 11 hours (according to steam) and in those 11 hours have noticed blatant, unacceptable, almost laughable bugs. Its so amazing what damage can be done to a product when the motive behind producing it is money, instead of the gratification of doing a good job and being proud of what you get to share with people.\n\nExample bugs:\n1. I went to move my battle dwarf, and instead of the battle dwarf moving sound, it played the death sound from an enemy unit I recently killed, _every_ _single_ _step_. And it wasn't just my dwarf! When the enemy moved his it played the same sound! Its as if the data got mixed up somehow. Maybe a dangling pointer? In any case, certainly no excuse for it considering the original never exposed an issue like that.\n\n2. These "HD" ground clutter sprites frequently bug out and cause the grid to be able to be highlighted and its color change to that of a valid state, as if you could move there. The old version correctly changed to the "cannot move there" cursor - every time.\n\n3. The game flat out stops when it receives WM_KILLFOCUS from the Windows message pump. Not "stops rendering" or "stops audio". I mean the game stops. It pauses everything. So you can't end your turn and do something else while the AI runs their turn. You can't even click on your castle and alt tab out to load a youtube video or something. Granted, not a bug, but totally unnecessary change.\n\n4.Arbitrary extremely weird glitches like a unit just jumping places for no reason and moving back.\n\nIt just overall feels unpolished, untested, and unfinished. It was clearly released because after every single HOMM release since HOMM5, ubisoft has been flooded with comments from HOMM players expressing how far they have deviated from Heroes III and how they should just make that but updated.\n\nWell, Ubisoft did it. I still play it because the bugs aren't game breaking, its easy for me to run and keep game states, and its a good game that 3DO made. Its still fun despite the bugs! I feel like they took a group of intern artists for 6 months to do all the assets, and then a few engineers spent a couple months porting it over. Other than that, no love was given to the polish of the game. I get all happy when I load it up, but then just kind of frown inside and go "..okay.. thanks for this I guess I'll take it.." as I load up a map.","February 11, 2015","true","21.5"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

As someone who plays his PC games on a 40" screen, this HD version was necessary and greatly appreciated.\n\nHeroes III is one of my favourite games of all time, and easily my favourite strategy game. I've been playing it since I was 6 or 7 and never really stopped but in recent years, along with upgrading to bigger and higher reslolution screens, the games visuals increasingly looked pixellated and basically pretty damn ugly.\n\nI tried the unofficial HD mod but all that really did was increase the interface size and did very little for the actual textures themselves. Now with this HD version, the game looks beautiful and so it's as good as it's ever been.\n\nAre there flaws? Well yes. It doesn't include the expansions, the battles are still in 4:3 ratio (with borders) and a few of the repainted models look a bit derpy (I'm looking at you wood elves). But truly, this is a small price to pay for an old  game to look absolutely stunning. This breathes life in one of the best turn-based strategy games ever made.\n\nHowever I would appreciate it if Ubisoft added the expansions as DLC. And because of the price point I can see why people would rather just stick to the original version which you can get on GOG for a small fraction of the price of this HD version. My advice to you is to look at your monitor size. If it's 1080p and bigger than, say, 24", then I recommend getting the HD version all day. Either way you can't really go wrong.

The GOG pack comes with all expansions and adds the Conflux castle and lots of new creatures, and there is a fan-made HD mod that can bump the resolution up to 4000x4000 for picky players. In contrast, this remastered HD edition of HOMM 3 is just the base game, minus the 'random map' option in Single Player mode - so it seems like a lot less.\n\nI know all this. I agree with those saying it's a no-brainer in terms of cost: for ~£4 less you get more bang for your buck by buying the original versions from GOG. I have done so, and spent many, many, *many* hours cruising my way through Erathia with my boy Theodorus and our army of Iron Golems.\n\nBut despite all of the above...I have to say, I really, really like Ubisoft's HD edition, because it looks absolutely gorgeous.  I've only played through half a scenario so far (you might say this is jumping the gun somewhat, but some of the negative reviews already posted are after less than 15 minutes of gameplay so I feel I'm allowed) but I've not encountered any bugs at all, other than the fact I had to prise myself away from the PC to make my dinner.\n\nThe gameplay is as smooth as it was in the standard HOMM 3 (none of the jerky movements that shake me out of the action when I replay HOMM 2) but the graphics...look, they're not "HD" in the standard version of the word. But they are absolutely lovely and you can tell that a lot of love and effort has gone into the enhancements. Everything is so much clearer, and it adds a lot more character to the Hero portraits, Creature portraits and sprites. HOMM 3 does look sorta fuzzy next to them now! I'm currently playing as Tower, my all-time favourite faction in any Heroes game, and I feel like I'm seeing the Heroes and the Creatures all over again. They feel a lot more expressive.\n\nSo...would I recommend it? Yes. I would. And I really hope that Ubisoft think about converting the expansion packs in future, because holy moly HD Crystal Dragons? Yes please. But!, full disclosure and all that, I only bought the game because it was £5.99 in the Steam sale and would recommend anyone looking to play it to wait until a) it's at a reduced price - at least in line with GOG - or b) Ubisoft add the expanions, if they ever do.\n\nAnyway, that's enough of that.

Now, before you get on the hate wagon, hear me out. I am a diehard heroes fan, I have played them all since the begining and just want to state this. Heroes 3 is off course, my favorite, and I really wanted to see it in HD. For this , I am grateful to Ubisoft that they did it. I like the new sprites and the graphical overhaul , you really can tell the difference especially on a bigger screen. Yes I am aware of the comunity patch too- this version does look better  because of the updated models. Now, could they have done more on these money and gave us the expansions? Definately, and with this I agree with the general consensus, they are stretching it... I would recomend this game on a sale, definately. The HD graphics and sprites do look sweet, for a Heroes 3 fanboy like me it does worth it. I did pay 15 euros and I am happy with my purchase so far. It is a decent price I think for a HD remake - many say is to much, but in the end, it is the producer's work that they put value on -  (they could have included the expansions though-that's my biggest beef with Ubisoft). The GOG version, yes that is very good, I have that version too, I buyed this for the HD overhaul, and in this regard it has not dissapointed me.\n\n@Ubisoft- Guys, I have paid the full 15 euros price on Steam, no keys from other retailers, no sale. My only request to you is this: Please make Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death HD too and put a decent price tag on them. I will buy them if you do, and I am sure many Heroes fans will, despite their negative comments here on Steam. It is good to see HD graphics on such a good game, and I am sure many fans agree with me here.","February 6, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

I have both versions and this one has far superior graphics.\n\nWhat the unofficial hd patch does is blow the map portion up to 1920x1080 so it fills your screen. It doesn't increase the resolution of any of the assets, and probably most irritating to me, it doesn't rescale the UI to match the larger resolution. So yeah, you see a huge area of map all shrunk down, but all the icons and creatures and towns are tiny! I actually had to downsize my res to like 1400 something just so I could read the text without squinting.\n\nThe HD remake here on steam is a ton better. It displays in 1920x1080 but it keeps the correct scaling of UI and creatures. And they look really nice, they have been touched up for this edition.\n\nSo all these people complaining about price, really you get what you pay for sometimes, or wait for a sale. I got my copy of a humble bundle. Although I do understand missing the expansions, that could be a deal breaker. But just want to put to rest the idea that the hd patch is equal to this remake- it's not at all. This version is comfortable to play and definitely doesn't feel like a 15 year old game.","May 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","5"

Most of them are complains about the missing addons\n- They don't have the source code, so no DLC-stuff going on\n- They told everyone in the first place that the addons are not included\n(you can't judge a company for giving you exactly, what they promised you)\n- Complains about missing faction and map-generator are invalid too,\nbecause they are content from the addons\n\n2. "They didn't add actual features to the game"\n- We all know that Ubisoft would have f*cked it up, if they did ;)\n- It's a freakin HD-Version, dafuq did you expect?\n\n3. "It only shows the left upper corner of the game"\n- Disable the scaling of your screen and you're fine. Or change compatibility options for this specific .exe\n\n4. "It only has 30 fps"\n- SERIOUSLY?!?! Is there ANY argument, that is more irrelevant than that?\n(Since when did we start playing games, because of fps? Do you need 60 fps to play chess?!)\n\n5. "There is no LAN-support"\n- That's true, but hey, you have Steam.\n\nIf you bought the game, without knowing that the addons (and all of their features [obviously]) are not included...well...then it's really your own fault. Please don't criticise the developers/publishers when you were too lazy to read, what you want to buy there.\n\nPLUS=> There are hundreds of fan-made maps on the internet and they are ALL compatible with this game\nNo need for random maps. I mean these random maps were...meh...in the original, weren't they?\n\nThe game is, what they promised us. It looks wonderful in HD and is compatible with higher resolutions and\naspect ratios. Is it worth the price? That's yours to decide^^ <cough> Steam-Sales </cough>\n\nEDIT:\nI recieved more feedback on this review than I expected and I think I should clarify some things since I was in an angry mood, when wrote the above lines.\n\nI played and enjoyed Heroes of Might & Magic III since my childhood and I started playing it once again with the addons some time ago. I am not going to tell you that one version is better than the other, the simple reason for this is, that it depends on personal preferences which one to go with. When I was young I didn't have a random map generator, even better, I played the same map over and over again with my friends (Realm of Chaos) and I assure you it was great fun.\n\nIt is in fact very unfortunate that they lost the source code of the addons. I would be angry too, if they sold the addons later as DLCs, but I am sure they would have implemented them if they could.\n\nFor me, The Restoration of Erathia is the heart and the soul of this game and I am very happy to see it shining with better texture quality :) The price might be discussable, I give you that, but in the end it depends on what you want.\n\nIf you feel that the random maps (even though I didn't really like them, because they are...well...generic) are essential for the game or that you cannot enjoy this masterpiece without Conflux, the neutral creatures the artifacts and let us not forget the mod-addons "Wake of Gods" and "Horn of the Abyss" than feel free to buy the GoG-Version.\n\nI personnaly can live without the addons and mods (btw. I didn't like Conflux. I want to see "Forge".

Might be me, but I think it looks much better than the GOG version with the HD mod.  It sounds better, too.  Yes, it's the original Restoration of Erathia game with no expansions, which is somewhat disappointing.  I haven't experienced any problems so far, but I don't play multiplayer.  Comes with a map editor, too, so hopefully we'll soon see some community-made maps.\n\nNot perfect, but a solid recommendation.

What isn't great is how Ubisoft are going to be money hungry bastar()ds and probably ask for more money for the expansions of this game. Because it is just the base game. It could be a lot worse. I recommend this game, despite it's big flaws. It's a really great game if you ignore all the Ubisoft laziness and half arsed release of the best Heroes game ever made.\n\nAlso first time launching this game through its launcher. Ubisoft logo popped up. Immediately I wanted to erase that from my screen to keep it out of my head. AVG pops up and thinks the launcher is a virus. Through my frantic pressing of buttons to get away from Ubisoft, I accidentally said yes to removing the file. Thanks Ubi, you guys had to put your logo and got me to remove the game launcher.  I can start the game normally now, but out of ALL the cutscenes and logos when you start it, only the Ubisoft one is unmissable. I suppose they need it though, because if they disappeared one day no one would actually miss these money hungry hippos. Here's hoping that they will finish the god damn game without getting us to pay more money.\n\nYeah right.

Sadly the GOG version contains more content for cheaper. I read somewhere that they only got the RoE code from NWC, but GOG has the complete edition, so I'd have to guess there are legal issues as to why they didn't include AB or SoD. The game is definitely crisper, but given that the GOG version exists, the price is far too much for the content you get.

Thank you :)\n\nI have been reading quite some reviews now, and as far as i can see, none of them recommends this game. I can agree with most of them, since i am a HUGE Heroes 3 fan, I have played it for as long as I can remember, and it's a shame to se content lost. For example the random map generator that everybody loves, and just admit it, it could not have been hard to just add it. But I have also read alot of reviews saying that there is a lot of bugs and clitches, but me and two of my friends have been playing for some hours and no one of us has experienced that, the game itself runs flawless, over the internet.\n\nThough it's true that I prefer the gameplay of Heroes 3 Complete I think that this is a step in the right direction. I highly recommend this for people who havn't played the game before, and I do enjoy the graphical changes. What I really hope for is that Ubisoft can see all these reviews and add all the features that we all miss, and add the expansions for free, and they will se many of those red thumbs turn green.\n\nBut just remeber, doing this was better then doing nothing, because going via Steam secures a future for the game.","January 30, 2015","true","56.9"," 17 of 55 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","17","55","0","0"

I have little to no trouble at all with any bugs like people seem to keep mentioning.\n\nAnd everyone who is saying "But there is no random map generator!" That may be true, but if you do have the original HoMM 3  that map creator has that feature, and you just make sure to make a Restoration of Erathia map and save the files into HoMM 3 HD map folder, I've done this and it works just fine.\n\nNo there is no expansions available, but from what I heard and understand that was never announced to even be added with this game remake, if anyone actually bought it before reading up on that then it's on you, I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who has time to kill and don't want to deal with the whole Gameranger crap.\n\nAnd obviously I can't speak for everyone about the bugs, I guess I'm fortunate and Ubisoft will have to fix this cause I do agree that the price is indeed quite ridiculous for not having the expansions and the bugs people seem to have.\n\nBut all in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone still.","February 2, 2015","true","170.8"," 16 of 53 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","16","53","0","0"

Buy it now (either here or on Gog.com and PLAY IT!)  Now, for those of you that are wondering if this beefed up version is worth the extra money, especially if you have another copy laying around (most especially if that copy includes the expansions).\n\nWell ... that depends.\n\nAre the HD graphics pretty?  Yes, they are.  Is it immediately noticeable when you load the game, like a rabbit-punch to the throat?  Not really.  But if you switch between the two versions, the beauty of the HD really shines through.  I only wish Ubisoft had taken the time to include all the expansions with this release, but I imagine they plan to put them out in the future.\n\nGameplay improvements?  Nope.  None.  Not that I've been able to ascertain.  There are definitely some major bugs crawling through the programming here, some things are a little messy, and it could use some work.  Do I think these will be resolved soon?  Most likely.\n\nThe main reason I decided to buy this game was because my family and I like to play multiplayer together, but can't abide by using the hotseat option (who wants to pass around a heavy gaming laptop or switch seats at a desktop?).  We've tried to play our original copies and our digital copies from Amazon via Gameranger, but my brother's computer was unable to connect and constantly booting him.\n\nDoes this new version solve this problem?  Yes, and no.  Yes, we can connect and have successfully played two multiplayer games, but there are also some serious, serious issues.  Whenever we start a new game, we inevitably have to start it four or five times due to disconnects.  I tried to determine if it was a firewall or router issue, but was unable to find a problem on my end.\n\nAlso, it would've been amazing if Ubisoft could've made some modern improvements like letting players see each other's gameplay in a multiplayer game.  It's awfully boring to sit with a load screen while your partners fight epic battles that can last ten or more minutes.  There could've been some improvement to the AI - as it's either way too easy or way too hard depending on the map, scenario, etc.  With such a beautiful game put in their lap to begin with, it shouldn't have been too hard to make some improvements, do some balancing with creatures, spells, and heroes, etc.\n\nIn short, this game is worth the money if you like to play multiplayer.  If not, then stick to the full version with all expansions - even if it doesn't have the pretty graphics.  The art in the HD version is lovely, but graphics to me are never more important than gameplay.","February 1, 2015","true","29.4"," 6 of 30 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","6","30","0","0"

If you have the regular game on a disk, then I recommend sticking to that but I like playing this game either way. Also, Ubisoft, if they are still considering updating this game will probably add the random map generator and also the dlc's but don't get your hopes up if you expect to have a full HD game.

It does not cover the actions of, or my opinions on Ubisoft)\n\nHeroes of Might & Magic III is nothing short of magnificent.\n\nIt is the one game I always come back to, and always install on every computer I own. Since its release in 1999 it quickly became a family favorite, and to this day we still start up large hot seat games at family gatherings (though we rarely finish them). I have sunk countless hours into this game, and I am still not bored with it. I am still excited by exploring the map, I still love the artwork and unique factions, and the music still inspires awe and wonder. As a result I was certainly excited to see it on Steam. Heads up though, this is version does not yet have the expansions, but will offer multiplayer support!\n---------\n\nEverything about this game works exceptionaly well.\n\n-Despite being near 16 years old the aesthetic of the game is still very beautiful and appealing. Which makes exploring maps and playing your favorite factions that much more enjoyable.\n\n- The Factions are well balanced and delightfully unique. Each having their own awesome theme and excellent musical scores. Despite haveing played it for so long I am still somewhat of a casual player, so if you talked with some of the pros they could better critique the faction ballance. But I do know enough to say this: To Hell with Conflux! Oh, and I love Fortress and Castle dearly!\n\n- The Music is fantastic. Every biome, faction, and item on the map has its own music or soudbyte which plays on or in proximity to the location. As your hero moves across the map the music and ambient sound changes to fit your location. This promotes a wonderful atmosphere while exploring, and makes for a very enjoyable experience. Each of the factions have their own score crafted for them to fit their themes, and in a text review, I will not be able to do them justice. If you want a taste then I suggest that you briefly look up the theme music for Fortress (my favorite), Stronghold, and Necropolis. I should mention before ending this note that the music was the work of Paul Romero who I salute for his dedication and hardwork which made Heroes III that much better!\n\n-The game mechanics and overall design is solid and intuitive. I have introduced the game to many friends and all of them took the game quickly. It was built upon the framework set up in Heroes 1 and 2, and it refined the system found in those games. It is clear that a lot of thought went into crafting this title.\n\n-----------------\n\nI adore this game. Everything about it is as close to flawless as anygame can aspire to be. I would like to think it is a labor of love, and it really shows. And for those who are lead to doubt by its age, it aged well. To this day there is little I could criticize as a result of the passing of time. The Music is fantastic, and the art is still beautiful.\n\nI understand that I may not have articulated my thoughts very well, so let me end with this point. The HOMM series is approacing seven titles now. And Heroes III is still considered by the grand majority of fans to be the undisputed champion. Most of the other games are also quite good, but they just cannot quite compare to the greatness achieved by Heroes III. It has almost become something of a problem for later releases in the series. Despite their own merits and achievments, the other games are still measured against Heroes III, and as a result are judged by it. But I do recommend you give the other games a try as well.\n\nHeroes III is the Titan of the Heroes series, and for good reason. It is a masterpiece, and still stands amongst the greatest turn based stradegy games ever made.\n\nLong Live the King!","January 29, 2015","true","0.3"," 9 of 38 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","9","38","0","0"

Does not come with expansion (no extra maps, no Conflux, no random map generator)\n2. $16.95 is a little too pricey for what you get\n3.

It even says: "Important note: Heroes III – HD Edition content is based on the original 1999 game: The Restoration of Erathia" under "About This Game"\nIt doesn't say Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete does it? It says original Restoration of Erathia. Stop giving negative reviews because you can't even make the effort to see that it's not complete.\nAnyway it is a great game and the HD uplift does make the game look lovley. The turn based style and battling are great and can entertain hours on end. Now it isn't complete so $15 is kind of a lot. The game has decent depth, but seeing how you can buy the complete version that has 2 full expansions at GOG for $10 it makes this game not seem worth the buy. If you're a die hard fan like me, you'll get it anyway. If you're on the fence, you should wait for a sale. It's good enough for me to vote positive, but Ubisoft should release the expansion packs, and the random map generator.\nPretty much, if you have the complete version, you may want to give this port a pass.

This is the FIRST heroes of Might and Magic 3 that was first launched and called Restoration of Erathia.\n-This game had ONLY the map editor and NO Random map generator. That was made from a community and was called Wake of Gods (YES that is NOT official expansion for the Heroes 3)\n-multiplayer works fine like I saw it.\n-The extra faction named Conflux (The Elementals) was from the expansion Arageddon's Blade and so it's not in this game.\n-Every extra senario was added with each of the expansion you added in the game (it was called EXPANTIONS not DLC like everyone is calling it.)\n\n\nSo for those who think if you want to buy it or not. This game is exacly what you think it is. The first edition of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 like it was when it first launched.

To be honest, I haven't noticed much change at first - some units had more details, everything looked a bith more smooth - but devs allowed players to decide if they want to see the game in HD or as it was when it firstly came out.

Job well done.\nApart of graphics, nothing has been changed in game mechanics - and bless the devs. So if you are H3 Veteran, and would love to see RoE in new clothes - buy it.

You can see the old review below.  The music is the same between original and HD release.  There are 4 combat soundtracks, and 3 is the annoying one.  It isn't that annoying if the sound is turned down some.  Once I had similar sound levels between computers, they sounded identical.  While I haven't seen all units yet, the only one that I consider worse than the original is the pikeman.  The rest seem fine to me.\n\nHere is the old review:\nThis is my first impression after playing for 20 minutes.  I have a KVM setup so I can switch between the old version on a Windows XP machine, and the new version on Windows 7, viewing both on the same monitor.\n\nMy first impression was positive.  The initial screens looked better and more crisp.  The color palette is the same, bright colors that made the original artwork charming.  I then navigated to the combat screen, and that is where I went to a negative rating for the game.  The art for the pikeman was pretty bad.  The archer was ok, and I didn't notice anything glaringly bad about the enemies I was facing.\n\nWhat I found really annoying was the combat music.  On the original version, the music had deeper tones and a good pace.  On the new version, it was this annoying high pitched instrument (flute maybe?).  The pace seemed slightly faster too, making me feel agitated.  Considering that you hear the combat music over and over in this game, bad music can get very annoying.  I am trying to decide if the newer graphics are worth the bad music.  I think my initial feeling is that I would rather play the original.\n\nOn the positive, this is supported for Windows 7, so if my XP machine dies, at least I have an option to continue playing it.\n\nP.S.  The intro video did not appear updated.  I am not surprised, as it would have been a major undertaking for little value.","January 28, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 22 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","2","22","0","2"

Everyone is all upset about the game only including the original base game.\n\nIt never stated that it included anything else, you shouldn't negatively review a product because it doesn't have something it never said it had\n\nThey are also upset that it didn't include a map generator, kinda understand, and it'd be nice if they brought it back, however\n\nRandom Map Generator SUCKED, always has, always will, what keeps Heroes 3, map wise, alive, is people making maps, not just playing horrible generated maps that are unbalanced and unimaganitive.

Nostalgic. I can only recommend this for people like me who used to play this in their childhood with their childhood friend. It has an online option so it's a good excuse to do something again with your childhood friend that you might not see so often anymore due to studying or whatever.\n\nIf you do not mind at all for graphics, go play the old hom3 without worry of missing anything. You might think "What did they improve at all?" but the creatures and towns and noticeably better than the original version.\n\nIf you cannot play without the expansions, go play the old hom3 without worry of missing anything. I for one played before the expansions and they mean very little to me, so I do not miss them.\n\nThe price is abit steep, but it's about as expensive as going to the cinema with two people. So hey, that sort of justified it for me. But that's my opinion. Just buy this for nostalgic purposes with a friend.\n\n\nBe warned though, sometimes the game just drops a player, I'm not sure exactly why or when but it does. In my opinion the game could definetly use some more polishing besides the art like being able to play your turns at the same time, which is not possible.\n\nThis barely made it to recommendable, just for the purpose of nostalgia with a friend including a fresh breeze in the way of the game's art.","January 31, 2015","true","16.0"," 9 of 39 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","9","39","2","0"

This is actaully the first good thing they have done in awhile, releasing Heroes 3, the one Heroes game most who played it loved, They know that people loved this game that why they are releasing it now, because they took heavy hits last year.\n\nHowever I bare you some bad news and this is all from my fond memory when I used to play Heroes 3 without it's DLC, The Orignal without DLC never even have A Map Maker, only with Later DLC it did. so with that chances are their will be DLC not free however.\n\nOn the other hand you maybe thinking "Oh I can just get the Orignal or Collecters and play that on my Computer" good luck with that, you see the old game even with Collecters (Which I own currently) chances are you may expreance Crashes quite often due to the age of the game and it has not been Optimized for newer computers. HD fixs those problems, hence why I brought it, not to mencion play the game with another Heroes fan that loved this game as a kid.\n\nSo in Summary, chances are there maybe DLC "Maybe" not like the DLC gave you Map Maker, A New Faction to play with, More Heroes and more Creatures. If you are a fan of Heroes Of Might And Magic I would still recomend it get it still if you want to play it again without crashes and with Friends. It's still the Heroes Game I remembered back in the day.","January 29, 2015","true","82.7"," 6 of 32 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","6","32","0","0"

The Erathia base game is pretty much the same as the Complete eddition, aside from small few things. The most important things missing are: unit hotkeys (most people won't notice), artifact combination (happens rarely anyway), 1 town (the worst one at that, but beautfull), random map generator (not for long, as someone is making one), a few other heroes, and a few units), and obviously the campaign, but that's not why you're getting this game anyway. The multiplayer works well, but you do need to go to Firewall and add exception rule for 3 ports (given in the manual of the game that you can find on steam). Overall, the product is an 8/10.\nPRO:\n-Most of the stuff works well, the game has slight lag but you probably won't notice it.\n-MULTIPLAYER :D\n-Price is alright\nCON:\n-They could have just made the campaign withing a month or 2 tops... (this might come if the game sells well though)\n-slight lag, and slight things missing compared to complete eddition is a slight pain point\n-MULTIPLAYER: No ladder??? Also, 8 people can join a 4 player game, and the game doesn't always load on first or even 2nd try... Given that I run powerful rig with fast internet, next to the servers, i shouldn't be experiencing problems, hence we can tell that the problems stem from the poor software or servers (probably software..., duh...)\n-No replay function, nothing new what so ever.... THe graphics look slightly improved, but I'd rather see stable multiplayer and a rehall of the game without changing any of the gameplay features...\nDESCISION:\nBuy if you enjoy multiplayer with random people. DO NOT buy if you're expecting it to be perfect or if you're not a fan of HoMM 3 series because this is not a good representation of the potential that this game carries.","January 30, 2015","true","31.9"," 8 of 37 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","8","37","2","2"

Some people still seem to expect content from the expansions, and that puzzles me. Ubisoft was very open about the content you would be purchasing.\n\nIf you want the better deal, go buy the complete edition on GoG.com. No question about it. If you, however, want to support the franchise in an attempt to motivate Ubisoft into fleshing out any upcoming titles, then I recommend buying this game. Vanilla Heroes 3 is still fantastic.","January 31, 2015","true","13.2"," 13 of 49 people (27%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","27","13","49","3","1"

It's not mind blowing, but better than original are it has achievements. The only downside is that it's the basic version without any expansions which means it lacks content. Also 15 euro for a 16 years old game, hd or not, is way too much. I'd wait for a sale. It's worth 10 euros.

It is not because this was a bad HD touch-up. It is due to me wanting to play Hereos but, since I was kind of alone on it, I needed the campaigns to have some fun. This version really has no campaigns to work with so I went with the GOG version and played a ton of that.\n\nSide note: Hereos Chronicles is fantastic. I absolutely love this series. They are a little bit easier than I would like, but the story is just oozing charm. They are also quite long! GET THESE.\n\nI stand by that this was a good HD remake. The sprite touch-ups are wonderful. However, if you play strategy games solo, you might just want to go for the GOG version. IF you do.... check out Chronicles! I wish I could buy that lot again.\n\n*Edit Over*\n\nI loved this game. I loved it all my life. When I was a little child up to right now, I have been playing this game for decades. When I saw this was coming to steam, I bought it instantly. For those who say "blah blah go to gog and buy it there and better...", sure... you go buy it there. I want it here on steam, so I can play with my friends, not on gog.\n\nOkay, onto the review. To start with, the graphics got an interesting update! The castles (towns) look fantastic. They have a nice touch up and makes it look much better. The individual sprites also look nice! They do have a new look to them, but it is not bad. I was expecting to hate this but it turned out I actually like it! The combat screen looks nice and everything has a decent touch up. However, if you do not like the graphical changes, you can select the original graphics in the menu inside game. This will change it back to what you remember as from over a decade ago.\n\nWhat about the music and sounds? Did they mess up the fantastic composition of Paul Romero? No they did not! It is still the same great music you have heard for more than the last decade from many JVC games.\n\nDoes the multiplayer work? YES! It does! It is easy and you do not have to type in IP adresses anymore. It can be a tad bit sluggish at times, but it is definitely livable and stable.\n\nAll in all, I definitely think this game was worth 15$. In fact I would buy it again. There is no where near enough JVC games on steam. In fact, MM10 added MM6, and Homm3 was just released- these are the only JVC games on steam that I know of. This game is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games. I am certain others will love it too.\n\nNew graphic rating- 9/10, I loved 90% of the changes and having the option to go back to old settings anytime I want sold it for me.\nSound/Music- 10/10, no changes here, but there needed to be none. I loved these tracks and I would hate to see them get changed. I am relieved that this did not happen.\nOnline- 8/10, It can be a little sluggish but it is all good. No more IPs, No more trouble playing with friends.\nGameplay- 10/10, Thankfully unchanged and perfect the way it is.\nContent- 6/10, No expansion, missing map generator and Conflux, as well as various artifacts and creatures. All of this you can live without, but hopefully this gets patched in. If it does, I will come back and edit this section off.\n\nOverall this game revival gets an 8.5/10. Definitely worth your money. I can already tell that I will spend hundreds of hours playing this whenever I get free time.","January 29, 2015","true","20.3"," 15 of 55 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","15","55","0","0"

They promised the original game remade, and thats what they did.\n\nLoved the original, and this version is practically the original, they changed nothing. Online play works which is the most important part for me so i can play with some old friends.\n\nOf course you can get it cheaper anywhere else with all the Add-Ons in nonHD, but then you have the problem in the multiplayer with different versions, tried it a lot over the last years, and the multiplayer over Steam Network is just awesome.\n\nRecommended","January 29, 2015","true","24.8"," 14 of 58 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","14","58","0","1"

Probs by people from top, or by those who considered that meta review is part of actual review. I'm pretty sure that's the case.\n-Meta Review starts there-\nI don't even know why people want expansions so much. I played this game for like 7 years before I learned about expansions.\nSomebody in top reviews [as of release day] said:\n>I love heroes, and this version will allow me to play online against friends, but it is a hollow version of the true game.\n>We will not be able to re-create the fun of the past.\nda ♥♥♥ r u talkin bout ♥♥♥♥♥♥? >true game< well this _IS_ a true game, nothing cut. Same answer to those people who say that it's not a full game. I agree, it would be better with expansions, but it's still a full game.\nIt's community's problem that they assumed H3 == H3C for last decade. I dare you to find any official source that talks about Complete Edition without saying Complete Edition.\nAlso, for those who don't know, Ubisoft doesn't have any assets related to H3C, except for source code of RoE. It's not so easy rewriting the huge "missing" part of a "full game", you know.\n-Meta Review ends there-\nAs for game: HD is pretty good, everything else is as good as it was before. No expansions, but who cares.\n7/8 - No LAN, i cri everytim.

This includes the bonus faction, minor rule changes (moats doing damage for example) as well as the random map generator.\n\nAll of that said, I got exactly what I paid for: an HD remake of the classic HoMM3. I'd like to eventually get the expansions for this version and will gladly pay for them if they are released as dlc anytime in the future.

If anything, why not give it a positive review?  Have more buyers come...  Get them to love the game, just as we (at least, I hope we...) all do.  This is a game of epic proportions.  It is what defined the Turn-Based Strategy Game genre, setting a benchmark that even the creators of this game could not compete with.  This ALSO goes for Ubisoft.\n\nAnyways.... Countless hours have been lost on this game.  It is a masterpiece.  The atmospheric, mood setting music is amongst one of the greatest soundtracks of all time.  Each song matches the scenario, or faction.  The action is immense, with key spells, strategic placement and utilization of units allowing you to sweep a Shadow of Death across the land (ho-ho), and powerful artifacts shape your hero into the god that they will eventually become.\n\nPlease buy this game.
