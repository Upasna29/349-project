That's absolutely true, but since I was determined to have this game function, I downloaded the "RIP Trilogy" demo.  After that, the game launched!\n\nI figured since I got it running I would give it a fair chance, and so I started up the first act of the game.  Only, the game decided it was the right time to change resolution, and the video did not play.  I followed the tips and tricks about using the common Alt+Enter screenshot to drop the game from full resolution to watch the videos.  Hurray, solved!  I kept on, and completed the first area... then the game froze!  Last straw, game!\n\nFrom the bit I played, it was a pretty abtruse point-and-click adventure game.  Not helping it was the art style -- there are ways to do a minimalist visual style well (see Killer Is Dead) and there's oversimplification that makes it uninteresting.","January 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The art style is so abstract that it is very difficult to understand what you're looking at, especially as the camera changes to extremely unusable angles with each new room.  The voices and sound effects are just painful to hear.  Beyond presentation, the game progression is completely arbitrary.  Randomly clicking around is your best way to determine what actions are even available to you.  There are game segments which want to be puzzles, without any indication of your goal or the pieces.  Finally, the story is ridiculous, less than one dimensional, and completely unrelatable in any way.

The whole game can be completed in about 30 minutes and I didn't feel like I missed out on anything by simply watching it unfold.\n\nThe most annoying thing is that there is a known issue on Windows Vista & 7 systems where you are only able to see the videos when the game is in windowed mode. This would be fine if the game didn't force fullscreen every time you exited to the menu or returned to the game.\n\nIt's weird, but there's nothing here that I can really recommend.

I would not recommend this game if your not on Windows XP/2000. Reasoning for this is, I guess this game is probably a pretty old engine 2000 based game? (Idk) So due to this running on Windows 7 for example your going to notice you won't be able to run in fullscreen, you only have 3 resolution options, and 9/10 for a avg screen,it's not going to really fit.. especially if you have a big gamer screen. This game will attempt to run fullscreen despite this and you have to ALT+ENTER to force Window the game,this will require repeating every time you reach the next 'Act'. As a modern gamer, I don't really like this game at all. I never finished this game fullthrough,I got to Act 2 and apparently fell off the map and 'Game Over', not really interested in pursuing the game further. The second and major thing about this game (May be just for people not on XP/2000) is that on first-launch it will redirect to RIP Trilogy 3 Store Page,it requires you to own the game and or demo. Sure the game demo is 30MB,small, but the principal of it is quite surprising,why do I need to have your other game just to play a game of yours I already purchased? (Or at least 'try' your other game). From what I've read online this game appears to be pretty short, I can't really confirm since I never finished but I'm never going too, not interested.","December 9, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A score of 61 would put this game in the "Meh, it's OK" category, though with Vigil:  Blood Bitterness, that decimal point needs to go about 1 or 2 places to the left.  Even a score of 10 should have triggered a federal investigation of payola over at Metacritic.\n\nThe game's one novel feature, the developer's apparent tweaking of the Dark Engine's texture filters until only black and white remains, is a one-trick pony that wears out its welcome within minutes, and becomes simply glaringly, wince-inducingly annoying.\n\nGameplay is nothing more than an exercise in frustration, as clues are cryptic without being logical, solutions are arbitrary and often linked to timers tuned so short that anything less than following the developer's intended path and timing, without an  angstrom's width of deviation, will result in certain death and banishment back to the last checkpoint.  Bugs are game-breaking and interspersed with the wonky puzzles in such a way that there is no way to tell if you are simply approaching the puzzle "incorrectly", or if the game has broken itself in such a way to make the puzzle unsolveable.\n\nI had played through a section with a long walkway outside and "airlocks" at each end.  If you remained outside on the walkway, you died, suggesting vacuum outside.  If you didn't open, run through, then CLOSE both airlocks, you died.  If you ran through, opened and closed both airlocks, BUT didn't run far ENOUGH into the next room, you died (That's right: if you did it correctly, and were standing inside the safe room -- but too close to the CLOSED airlock -- you died).  If you ran through, opened and closed both airlocks, ran far enough into the next room, BUT didn't do it quickly enough, you died.  Fine.  Except that a few puzzles later, backtracking through this area, one could now stand anywhere on the outside walkway indefinitely.  The airlocks were now open and inoperable, presumably because that section was now "solved" and no longer necessary.  So, really, just suddenly no more vacuum of space?  But as soon as I stepped through the inoperable airlock into the next room, I was immediately killed by asphyxiation, judging from the death cutscene -- a cutscene by now in furiatingly familiar to me in this area.\n\nFinally, giving up after about 36 tries, I looked up the solution on YouTube, only to find that I had done everything correctly, but the game had jiggered itself up so completely that it was now  impossible to "solve" and progress.\n\nI generally make a strong effort to complete every game I begin, but this game had played me like a cheerleader plays a nerd on prom night, and I had had enough.  I never went back.  I swear, as I clicked "Delete local content" I heard myself let out an evil little giggle.\n\nSo don't do it.  Just don't.  Browse away from this page and never return.  If I can save just one of you from the torture that I endured trapped inside this ♥♥♥♥ of a game, then my suffering will have been worth it.  Look upon my trembling, twitching form and mutter, "Wow, that could've been me".  Now go.","June 11, 2014","false","7.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is the type of game that makes me regret spending the 25 cents that went toward this game.

As a published game that someone is expected to pay money for? 0.5 out of 10. I give it that much for the interesting color pallete and I thought the blur in the menus were an interesting touch.

Not at all.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what to say, like as with the other reviews the design idea seemed cool. Y'know until you actually put it into practice and realise that walls and doors and open spaces are basically the same colour: black (yay!). The cutscenes for me were broken, so I was probably more confused than most of the already confused people playing this (or less, you never know). The movement is awkward, the camera angles were frustrating...I think what I'm trying to get out is this game was so confusing and so poorly designed that it felt like less of a game and more of a chore.","May 31, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
