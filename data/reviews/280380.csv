The game in its current state may provide light enjoyment for some people, but if you are expecting something great, you will be dissapointed. Graphics are like something from 2005 and the enemies move in the same way. Also it does not provide much of a challenge, unless you are trigger happy then it might be a challenenge finding ammo. However if this game was updated to something that would pass as a modern game then i would recommend it but right now its just not worth it.","April 20, 2014","false","3.0"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Bugs; the AI is absalutely clueless, meaning that this ai is as blind as a bat. not knowing where you are causing it to shoot everywhere around you and missing every single shot for at least 5 seconds if you are standing still, some don't even shoot at you.\nStill not convincing you, what about the graphics right? Nope, with graphics at this level it's as decent as the early 2000's. You will probably notice the poor lip-syncing. The voice acting is quite poor. Even one of the charecters, named Smithy gives this game an evil eye.\n(The charecters, due to graphics) seem to have no emotions, and are hard to relate and attach to. The best part of this game is that it doesn't cost you to much money, but trust me, you have better things to spend that money on. 1/10","April 23, 2014","false","4.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

This game should be changed to Early Access. There are levels, that you cannot get past, either due to its glitches or complexity, crashes constantly. Also there is no save/load feature. There is no tutorial, nor is there a list of commands. This game does not have checkpoints, so guess what, if you die, or in RTS battles your squad dies, you lose.
