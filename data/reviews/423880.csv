Checking my play time with a total of 26 minutes and affirming that I have seen all that this game has to offer me is a bit annoying, even though this has been distributed as a freeware. Let's see, shall we?\n\nYou are a young man named Jung, who is waiting to meet a young girl named Ai for a date. When she arrives, you'll make a brief and ultimately meaningless choice of how to pass your time with her, get presented a dryly arranged twist at the end and forced to live a "realization" of what is it that you are doing with your life... I must say that I'm not impressed. For the ones that would like to avoid spoilers, please skip the next paragraph, ‘cause I feel obliged to present my opinion on a good idea executed poorly.\n\nAi is actually AI: an artificial intelligence developed to imitate the likeness of a human being. The game aims to question the whole content of humanity and what would make a perception or existence human. It is a bold topic to pick and arrange a game about, and it could have been something genuinely interesting only with better writing - added some decent philosophical inclination at least - and better content - more character development and event interaction. There has been countless brilliantly arranged media focusing on this theme - including Niccol's S1m0ne and Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence, so I would certainly recommend at least making some ground research on the philosophical background of the issue brought into attention next time picking such a loaded subject for the developer.\n\nFor the visual novel genre, writing is everything. Cheesy art work and the lack of diversity in CG animations can be forgiven considering this is a first attempt at creating a game, but any subpar writing would cripple a visual novel to a degree of becoming boring, meaningless and tasteless. Dialogues and events shared between our two characters are nothing interesting or imaginative. Sentences, definitions and jokes stand to become dry and forced, making it impossible to humanize our characters to begin with. Sadly, that was the whole purpose of the plot. When you come to the end in 8-10 minutes and got hit by the revelation, you are left uninspired rather than surprised.\n\nAs for the gameplay, you are presented only one choice option: "where will be spending your day with Ai?" Regardless of your choice, you'll end up going through the contents of two of the choices and come to the predetermined end. So, in 15 minutes, you can say that you'll be seeing all there is to see in this game, and there is nothing you'd feel inclined to recheck about after the first playthrough anyhow. Backgrounds are thrown around stock pictures and the repetitive soundtrack is so genuinely annoying, you'd mute the second time its looping without a thought. Ai's character design is cute, but it feels bland and unimaginative with the lack of appropriate emotes and CG animations.\n\nBy the end, give it a try to satisfy your curiosity if you like. There is an optional DLC consisting of the soundtrack and artwork if you feel like supporting the developer too. I hope to see better games coming from this developer in the future with at least some better narrative, considering his choice of theme seems to be promising. As it is though, I cannot recommend Carpe Diem since it has nothing remotely interesting to offer.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 15","false","0.4"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","43","52","0","4"

Not heaps, but it was ok.\n\n\n-The story only went for around 7min's (i'm not the fastest reader, but i wouldn't say i'm a slow reader either, so i'm maybe average??), but i was entertained for those 7min's, & thats what matters. It even surprised me at the end, which is always a bonus.\n-If you look at the art/ graphics on the store page, you've pretty much seen the art/ graphics for the whole game. I think there were 4-5 different backgrounds, with each background showing the same character, who's only variety was when she'd open & close her mouth during dialogue, as well as the occasional blink. Oh, sorry, i forgot, her cheeks also get red at times.\n-The music was fine. Mellow piano playing, but for only 7min's, so i didn't get sick of it.\n\nSo, the game altogether was ok. Nothing blow-away spectacular, but all in all, a good experience. Maybe if it was longer, i wouldn't have liked it as much.\n\nAlso, i haven't mentioned, this VN was the maker's first effort & it's free, so i think you've got to allow for that as well. I'd rather make an average first game than a crappy one, & this isn't crappy (just average).\n\n5/10\n\n\n\n","December 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","1"

The style of writing is simple and nice, the story itself is cute and reminds of good romantic films and anime. I do like the main female character – Ai - and her relationships with the main male character. I also like the way they speak to each other – nonchalant and simple, like real boys and girls do. I would really like to have the same type of relationships with my beloved one (when I finally find him).\n\nUnfortunately, any other information about characters and plot will completely ruin the gaming experience for those who will read this review, because the end will provide you with an interesting twist.\n\nPlease, find a few minutes to play the game – it is worth it and will bring you some positive emotions.

Thanks, Lily.  :D )\n\nSo, someone I know on Steam recommended this game to me, so I thought I'd look into it.   Common consensus I heard was "It's short".   After looking some reviews to see if it's good or bad, I read about the ending being a bummer, but not the details...the achievement name hinted it though....\n\nFor a brief moment, I debated playing it, but ended up saying "What the heck" and booted it up.   Within 15 minutes of reading it legit, it was over.  After reading all 3 routes, I found my final counter was about 30-31 minutes.\n\nPROS:\nCute date scenarios (Kinda' funny too.   Nice sense of humor)\nA girl that acts like a nice friend/girlfriend  (Nice waifu)\nShort (If you want something that doesn't drag on and can be finished quickly)\n+1 achievement\nFree\n\nCONS:\nShort (If you wanted more than a single date, then you may be disappointed)\nThe conclusion is bittersweet  (  She doesn't exist...and never will exist.  It's sad when fictional characters are better than real people...*sigh*  )\nDepressing achievement name\n\nIf you want a cute visual novel to pass the time with or want an easy, quick 100%, then this game should be up your alley.   It also seems to help if you're feeling a little lonely.\n\n7.5/10   It's cute.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567341851","December 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"

(they are all covered but this spoiler filter).\nThis game is a short 'n' free visual novel about a guy called "Jung" and his "virtual" girlfriend "Ai" it's some kind of artificial super-intelligence, they are in a date or something ... i can't tell you anything else about the story because it's too short already (it took me about 20 mins to complete it).\nHere is a small list about the good/bad about this visual novel:\n+ Deep story, it's too short but believe me, this is one of the rarest gorgeous and meaningful piece of art.\n+ The game have some simple & nice drawn backgrounds and characters (there is only Ai tbh xD) as you can see in the screenshots here on the store page.\n+ the game is such a rich emotional experiment, it's a mix of  joy, wonder, love, jealous, curiosity, hope, interest and  grief ...\n+ there is some choices that can effect the game progressing, but not the endings (i mean it will take you to different places/will give you different dialog, it's worth to play the game again to see what will change if you choose this or this or this ..)\n+ it's free!\n+ easy achievement - 100% for those who cares for this things.\n- i've never noticed this, and i don't consider it as a cons but some people may be annoyed by the repetitive (is it?) music, or the lake of backgrounds & the short story or even the simple graphics (i can't imaging that it's possible for anyone to notice this or being annoyed for a really simple thing like this, but who knows? i've seen some weird things in other reviews, not only in this game ..)\nAnyways, i do think that this is one of the best visual novels out there, plus the developer is offering it for free so everyone should give it a try! even if you don't like this genre or you've never tried games similar to this, it's really worth the 7-30 mins of your time, 8.5/10!\n*** Last but not least i really wished "Al" was real i really did .. just damn .. what an anding :/\ni've no idea what i'm doing with my life, do you?! ***","January 18","true","0.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

Is it a person that has the same taste as you? How about the direct opposite? I prefer the opposite as it can be attractive by the way of learning from each other however it does require patience on both sides. Whatever your take, here arrives Ai, your date in this game named Carpe Diem. An appropriate title to say the least – seize the day. Or maybe it’s better to say YOLO – you pick. Nevertheless, that’s the entire point of this game – seize the day. Enjoy your time with Ai as you can take her to the park, mall or even the arcades in the style of a visual novel albeit a short one.\n\nSo my choice is I took her to the arcades (for obvious reasons) and yes Ai and I had a great time. We even ate afterwards and then watched the fireworks later that evening.\n\nBut as the title states, Carpe Diem, enjoy your time as the ending is quite a head spinner.\n\nSidenote: the game is free however if you like the game, support the developer and buy the DLC for 99c.

You have a day to enjoy your date and see the world from Jung's point-of-view.\n\nLength wise it is not the longest VN I have come across, Id hazard a guess to say it is in fact one of the shortest Ive read, but it doesn't need to be any longer, it tells its story well in the period of time needed, some maybe disappointed at its short length but overall I didn't have a problem with it, although yes it would have been nice if it had gone longer.\n\nThe art style is some what basic but this can be forgiven all things considered, though I will say Carper Diem has a certain charm to it.\n\nThe music while like the art is pretty basic, however I will say it does try to add to the atmosphere and does its job as best it can to complement the game.\n\nOverall Carper Diem is a well written piece of work; Visually its alright, music its average however its the ending that is what really sold it for me.\n\nI'll leave you with this, Carper Diem is a good read and will no doubt keep you interested throughout its duration, and its absolutely free if that's not a good reason to check it out I don't know what is....so why not give it a try.\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","April 13","true","20.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It all depends on the creator whether his work will flourish or stay where it is.\n\nCarpe Diem is a free short Visual Novel that tells the story of a man meeting up with his girlfriend (but is that really?). I don't want to further spoil the story, as it is only a short VN, and you will get there eventually.\n\nI am absolutely amazed at how a simple VN turns out to be so fulfilling.\n\nCarpe Diem tackles about reality, and how you incorporate illusion from reality itself.\n\nAnd most of all,it tackled one of the most controversial aspects of an AI, which is the Turing's Test.\n\n\nPros:\n- Nicely-drawn character and background\n- Simple background music that is pleasing to the ear\n- A direct-to-the-point story plot\n- Light humor that incorporates to the conversation between the MC and the other character\n\nCons:\n- Very short VN (It is, indeed)\n- The choices seemed unecessary for me, as they do not really divert from each other.\n- Some CG with the MC and the MC would be nice, especially in some events.\n\n\n\nCarpe Diem may be the first VN of the creator, but I can confidently say that he can go a long way if he continues making VNs. I bought the Extra Package DLC to support this author. So if you liked this VN, please buy it too!\n\n\n\nOverall I'd totally recommend this to those who likes VNs. It may also teach you how to start making VNs for yourself, too.","January 6","true","0.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

I felt this through all the stages of the game until the end. To say the least the ending was special and really makes me think into what the main character feels and what leads him to do what he did.

Carpe Diem is one of these: a short free kinetic visual novel that tells us the simple story of a rather average date between a surprisingly mundane guy and a young woman who relies a little too much on her childish charm.\nWhen I say short, I mean it: depending on reading speed, the story lasts barely 10-20 minutes, including two “play throughs” to see the dialogue at all three locations.\nFor the most part, the best term I can come up with to describe the writing is ‘cute’. Not fluffy pink clouds everywhere cute, just a nice little story about telling the event of a day-long date, with some surprise at the end. Nothing fancy, but if you decide to install it, you probably won’t regret spending that few minutes of your life on Carpe Diem.","March 15","true","0.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Jung is a programmer by trade that is focused on his work (not unlike myself back in the 1990s when I was developing database applications for credit reporting customers).  Ai is the person whom he was dating in the story.  The name Ai is also an acronym for "artificial intelligence", as we find out at the end of the story.\n\nThe intent of the story as described in the "Background" is true to the description.  Getting priorities straight goes a long way in real life, not just in the dating scenes in this game.  For that, I would give this game an "A" for the storyline and intent.\n\nI loved the music the developers chose for this game, though I would have chosen different pieces for each of the three choices you get at the first menu.  For example, I would have chosen for the mall scene a piece music that was commonly heard in shopping malls over the past 50 years.\n\nOverall, I liked this game so much, it gives me an idea for a visual novel.\n\nOverall Rating:  "A"\n","May 21","true","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Its got consistent (but rather bland) art with not many expressions and basic transitions.\n\nThe music is appaling, two or three very short loops of crappy synthesised pianos which drill in my head. I had to turn the music off.\n\nThe writing is what makes a visual novel, and sadly the writing is average. Its not bad, but it does not excel in any way. The visual novel trope of having the main character monolouge things to himself that would be known knowledge to them is present here for some reason which begs the question why words were wasted on it, considering the story is very short and is trying to be very on point with its message. The story gets the message over, and has an interesting idea, but sadly it does not really do anything with it.\n\nAs I said, this is a good first time effort and as practice for developing VN's its a good start, but as a consumer I don't see a reason to recommend this to anyone as the story does not even ask any questions or engage the player in any way.","February 10","false","0.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The thing that holds this game up is the end, and whether you are impacted by it or not depends on how you live your life (literally) and if you think the girl is cute enough to be your waifu.\n\nI didn't hate it. If anything, I think it had a lot of potential that was missed. While I was not impacted by the end compared to others due to my life outlook and because I predicted it, I understand the message being sent, and I personally think the game leading up to that moment could be improved upon. The dialogue is awkward and stiff at times, and both Ai and Jung sounded the same dialogue wise. I think if this was focused on a bit more, a believable feeling could have been created to impact the ending more. The writing could have also been improved in terms of their interactions, but I put this second to more believable dialogue showcasing the characters more. I also think just more art variation could have helped with Ai.

The thing that holds this game up is the end, and whether you are impacted by it or not depends on how you live your life (literally) and if you think the girl is cute enough to be your waifu.\n\nI didn't hate it. If anything, I think it had a lot of potential that was missed. While I was not impacted by the end compared to others due to my life outlook and because I predicted it, I understand the message being sent, and I personally think the game leading up to that moment could be improved upon. The dialogue is awkward and stiff at times, and both Ai and Jung sounded the same dialogue wise. I think if this was focused on a bit more, a believable feeling could have been created to impact the ending more. The writing could have also been improved in terms of their interactions, but I put this second to more believable dialogue showcasing the characters more. I also think just more art variation could have helped with Ai. I understand this is free, but at least one other pose could have been helpful rather than facial expressions (of which only 3 are used).\n\nIt's short, and has a chance of impacting you.

It probably wouldn't take you more than an hour to try all the different options in the game.\n\nI find the assets in the game to be somewhat bland. The musics in the game aren't very interesting to listen to and I actually even muted the background music after a bit of playing and decided to just fire up Steam Music Player to listen to my own collection of songs as I play the game.\nThe scenery backgrounds look kinda odd to me. They don't seem to match the art style that was used to draw the main female Character, Ai. I think they could use some polishing.\n\nAnother shortcoming that I found in the game is the UI. While the UI of the menu doesn't look that bad, the UI for the controls are hardly visible.\nWhen I first started the game, I was very confused that I couldn't find the UI for standard controls to Save, Quick Save, Skip, etc.\nI thought I was supposed to somehow know all the possible shortcuts on my own, but as it turns out, the game does have UI implemented, but it's virtually invisible.\nIt was so difficult to spot, that I actually found it by accident when I pressed random buttons on my controller and accidentally selected one of the control button displayed in the\nbottom right corner of the screen.\n\nOverall, it's not a particularly bad game, but it can definitely use some improvements.\nI think the most important thing to address is the disappointingly short story.\nAdditionally, aside from all the other issues that I've mentioned above, I'd like to see some other improvements, perhaps some animation for the transition? Or some improvements for Ai's character?\nI mean, I'd say she's pretty likable, but I also find her to be somewhat unpredictable based on her reactions to certain situations :P\n\nI have some very mixed feelings about the game and it's a bit difficult for me to decide whether this is a game that I'd recommend to people who enjoy visual novels in general.\nHowever, despite all the shortcomings that I've mentioned above, the game did leave some impression on me, mainly because of the twist at the end.\nEven though, it was somewhat spoiled because I saw the achievement (that has now been renamed to something else) before I played the game, the twist was still a bit unexpected as one wouldn't be able to tell the details from just the achievement's name.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys visual novels and wanting to play some, go ahead and give this one a shot. It's short, but hey it's also free :D","November 30, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","4"

Think of this game as a prototype and not as a real game yet.\nI support the developer, the ideia is good and etc. Still there was not enough time for me to get a relationship with the female character so the end didn't impact me that much.\nAnd i would for sure change the background music and the title screen music. It's so high pitched that it becomes annoying after a while, making you want to turn your volume down.\nSo if the developer can read this, i have 3 major points for you.\n1- The Music for sure is annoying and there's no good game without a good soundtrack, get a better midi sound library.\n2- Make us expierience more time with the girl we're supposed to be in love with, making us wanting her to be a real character.\n3- Read 1 and 2 and make this prototype into a reality.

I'm enjoying it, much like I have with this game. This game may be very small and only takes about 20 minutes for all the lines (3), but it is a very nice game with a great art style, which is surprising actually, I've seen a lot bigger games with art styles way worse than this. I like both of the characters and the way they both interact with eachother, and I think to myself that this is actually a couple irl.

It took me all of 10 minutes to see every CG, a testament to its shortness.  All the paths(of which there are 3) end the same way and each of the three routes uses a lot of the same CGs, so it got a bit boring by my third go around.\n\nI really liked the story, though, especially the end.  It made me a bit sad, even though there isn't much context regarding who Ai is.  And Jun, specifically at the very beginning before the choices reminded me of Hikigaya Hachiman from Oregairu, which was pretty interesting to me.\n\nDefinitely worth at least one playthrough if you like VNs.","December 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As I'm writing this review, I feel like I'm still experiencing the story, and more importantly, the emotion. The message of the story remains unclear, yet somehow very distinct. That's what makes it art.","December 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For lunch today I had ramen noodles. The main protagonist, Jung, enjoys rice, and I too enjoy rice. This connection really made me feel immersed in this universe.

I never considered playing these types of game as a lot of them were based around romance, but recently I've found a few that rely on a deep and heavy story line to entice the gamer. The second reason I chose to play this was of course because it was free. This game was extremely short but i think that's part of the fun. I interpreted this as a short story being told to me through a digital screen. If you are a fan of VNs and/or have some spare time definitely try out this game, The ending is quite impactful. Overall, This game was quite clever and I'll be sure to keep a look out for more games by this developer.\n\n7.5/10\n\nPros:\n-Interesting\n-Choices\n-Fun\n-Unique\n-Mini Story with a little twist\n\nBoth:\n-Length\n\nCons:\n-None!","December 11, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

As a fan of anime and manga I'd been looking at visual novels with some curiousity, and decided to give this one a go because it was free and had 'very positive' reviews. After playing, I can say that while this game only provides one choice and is relatively boring it's excellently composed. Jung's downcast demeanor, forlorn commentary, and the repeating piano loop playing in the background foreshadow the end of the game. "What am I doing with my life?" All of this combined with the author's lack of intent to expand upon this title lead me to believe that the true purpose of Carpe Diem is to teach you not to waste your time on visual novels and/or dating simulators, and that is something I can recommend.","December 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

First of all the reason this game is getting so much praise is because of all these damn weebs and another thing I noticed in a positive review for this game.\nA user stated that "Splendid visual novel, great music and storyline!". Reading this sentence I wanted to blow my damn brains out becuase well first of all the music is so so so bad. There is about a minute until the music ends then there is about a  1 second pause and music starts up again. However I was suprised that there was yet another song added at the end so props for that.\nAnother thing is that there is absolutely no substance to this game. I've counted about 5 differant facial expression changes on the "AI" character and it's a complete wase of time to play. I ended up finishing it in about 4-6 minutes. But the story is just the main character Jung (which you never get to see sadly) and AI talking about nothing, absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing. All for what? A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending that made every Weeaboo that played this game cry. Just a complete waste of time.\nAnd this visual novel isn't very visual. What I mean by this is that there are about 8 or so mediocre scenes that you get to stare at whilst you look at AI. Sounds fun right? Another thing is that there is no immersion. Honestly I love gameplay I love the feeling like i'm in the setting but this game doesn't even attempt to bring that to the table. It's your character and AI just talking about nothing in peticular with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looping soundtrack and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ backgrounds.\n\nCONCLUSIONI blame the damn weebs","December 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","17","32","8","10"

This is a decent first work from the dev and worth a quick look if you like VN's.\n\nTo the dev:\nI do not know what you want in terms of feedback or if you are looking for much at all, but I will give my little two bits here. Your art is rather good, and certainly better than other games on the market. Work that talent and be sure to throw in more overall variety in expression, poses, etc. (I am almost positive you know all this). The music was a good light hearted choice that fit the style as was your stylistic choice for the text boxes (which are all too often forgotten). The dialogue came across as overly simple/lacking enough description, though I do not know if that was to represent the early stages of the character and thus her overall lack to provide truly thoughtful conversation.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed your observations about computer relations within a game about computer relations. Very clever. I look forward to any future VN's you make.","December 11, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It really made me thnk, "What am I doing with my life" and "What do I want to do"? This game asks the gritty reality question a lot of people ignore. I can say I recommend this game to anyone having a hard time in life looking for an answer or simply wants to think for a solid 20 minutes while looking at Ai. I guess the real question is though do you want to go to the Arcade, Mall, or Park? Choosing one of these 3 simple questions could define your life very easily. Are you a nature person, choose the park! Do you like videogames, well take your waifu with you! Do you think waifu will want some new clothes, take her to the mall! I can strongly give this game a 9/11 being that its a real smack to the face to any fat weeaboos who think they are all that and a bag of Funyuns.\n\nFinal verdict 9/11\n\nDecerex with love XOXO","December 16, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

After "playing" this game, it raises few questions about, let's just say about reality or personal perception (don't want to spoil it), but it is pretty much obvious..\n\nSince this is a visual novel, it is expected for graphic to be little more detailed and interesting. It's not great but it's pretty acceptable.. Similar can be said about writing, simple, easy to read, but it lacks certain something to make it more appealing :)\n\nSince this game is free and it has only one achievement (for achievement hunters, easiest pray :), cool premise and ending, with not much cons about it (ok, we can argue about sound and writing), it is recommended to try this short story out..\n\nP.S. and yea, this is my first 100% achievement completed game XD","March 23","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azba/recommended/423880/","Azba","Azba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azba/","663 products in account","Carpe Diem is pretty much exactly as it describes itself. It's a short VN with one non-critical decision and a pretty ok story and conclusion for its length. It won't take you more than 10 or so minutes to give it a look, and considering it's free and you're probably reading this on its store page, why not?\n\nPros:\n+Art is pretty good, even if there's not much to see.\n+Delivers a message you might pay $5+ to see from some other indie game, for free and with less pretension in less time!\n+Has a pretty fully fleshed out options menu for a 10 minute game. All your VN basics are there including saves and dialog skipping, skip only seen etc.\n+Multiple language support.\n+You can buy an extras pack DLC if you want to support the developer. It doesn't contain content locked out from the main game so you won't miss out on anything either.\n?Easy perfect game for your steam achievements collection.\n\nNeutral points:\n=I guessed the twist before I started the game.\n=The only choice in the game isn't too important since each route can lead to at least one of the other locations you can pick from eventually. You will miss a few scenes if you don't try them all though.\n=The music isn't great but I also didn't find it annoying.\n=No voice acting but I'd hardly expect that from a free game and let alone a dev's first VN.\n\nCons:\n-There's quite a few grammatical errors, at least in English. I cannot speak for the other languages available. UPDATE: Eyzi has corrected the mistakes I spotted.\n-The writing is a little stiff. Would have benefited from some creative writing techniques. It's not all bad though, both Jung and Ai have some character to them. Some.","December 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Well that was intersting, I beat it in all of 10 minutes and the ending was... ironic to say the least. I feel it was simply lacking in substance. It had an intersting concept and twist, but the execution left much to be desired. There simply isn't any substance to the thing. The writing was alright, music was good, as I said I liked the plot ideas, but over all when I actually played through it I felt rather bored... then it ended abruptly with a weird meta twist. It needs more content and better writing. I think the idea itself though would be a good jumping off point for a larger story.","December 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Well that was intersting, I beat it in all of 10 minutes and the ending was... ironic to say the least. I feel it was simply lacking in substance. It had an intersting concept and twist, but the execution left much to be desired. There simply isn't any substance to the thing. The writing was alright, music was good, as I said I liked the plot ideas, but over all when I actually played through it I felt rather bored... then it ended abruptly with a weird meta twist. It needs more content and better writing. I think the idea itself though would be a good jumping off point for a larger story.","December 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a short VN with one non-critical decision and a pretty ok story and conclusion for its length. It won't take you more than 10 or so minutes to give it a look, and considering it's free and you're probably reading this on its store page, why not?\n\nPros:\n+Art is pretty good, even if there's not much to see.\n+Delivers a message you might pay $5+ to see from some other indie game, for free and with less pretension in less time!\n+Has a pretty fully fleshed out options menu for a 10 minute game. All your VN basics are there including saves and dialog skipping, skip only seen etc.\n+Multiple language support.\n+You can buy an extras pack DLC if you want to support the developer. It doesn't contain content locked out from the main game so you won't miss out on anything either.\n?Easy perfect game for your steam achievements collection.\n\nNeutral points:\n=I guessed the twist before I started the game.\n=The only choice in the game isn't too important since each route can lead to at least one of the other locations you can pick from eventually. You will miss a few scenes if you don't try them all though.\n=The music isn't great but I also didn't find it annoying.\n=No voice acting but I'd hardly expect that from a free game and let alone a dev's first VN.\n\nCons:\n-There's quite a few grammatical errors, at least in English. I cannot speak for the other languages available. UPDATE: Eyzi has corrected the mistakes I spotted.\n-The writing is a little stiff. Would have benefited from some creative writing techniques. It's not all bad though, both Jung and Ai have some character to them. Some.","December 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Carpe Diem is a great phrase.\n\nI was optimistic at the beginning, and expected there to be multiple choices given to the player that influenced the conclusion. This was not the case, though; it's mostly text and a few frames of Ai (the protagonist) in a few locations.\n\nIn the middle of the experience I was quickly reading through the dialogue and waiting for the end. The little narrative told is not particularly immersive (at least it wasn't for me).  When the end did come, it tickled my interest. An interesting premise, and one that was relevant to my experience of it. I can see how this could potentially have a strong impact on an audience. In saying this, many people, namely those who occupy their time well, may see this experience as disrespectful to their time, or just not relevant to them. Others will be bored. Some, however, will see this for what it is: a small graphic/text experience with something to say about how society spends its time.\n\nCarpe Diem is not enrapturing, and the writing isn't flawless, but, hey, it's free. If you have the time, have a look; why not?\n\nI would be interested to see how the creator's ideas could evolve.","December 15, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though I have no lover, I push on. I look at my life's future and I await the day when I meet that one true person. Yes I've played dating sims before but more for learning how the wrong decisions can ruin relationships and learn the stories of the characters. I go out and I work at my job to keep my family happy. I may be in a place where I may not feel the happiest I could be but I cannot rush things. I still have a whole life ahead of me (as I write this at the age of 23).\n\nOnto the experience, as you can't call it a game due to the very short story. It does make those of you who sit at home and do nothing think. It makes you realise that there is more out in the world than just being indoors. There are people out there who you can talk to, befriend, become lovers with, and marry. While this can crush someones heart it can inspire them at the same time to change. The game says that you must not waste your time for if you do you may never be happy, thus the program crashing.

Well that was intersting, I beat it in all of 10 minutes and the ending was... ironic to say the least. I feel it was simply lacking in substance. It had an intersting concept and twist, but the execution left much to be desired. There simply isn't any substance to the thing. The writing was alright, music was good, as I said I liked the plot ideas, but over all when I actually played through it I felt rather bored... then it ended abruptly with a weird meta twist. It needs more content and better writing.

It makes you ask yourself what you really are doing with your pitiful and insginificant life. Who could have guessed that the character named AI was an actual AI in a computer game. I found myself connecting with her and then became emotionally unstable once I found out the truth. I spiraled into a deprtession turning to alcohol for the support that my beloved AI could not lend me since she was forever sealed away in the virtual world. I love AI and one day I will make her real so we can continue our life together at the mall buying gtx titans, spider keychains and slamming each other over the head due to our excessive tilt from street fighter at the arcade.","December 24, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eisenkoubu/recommended/423880/","eisenkoubu","EisenKoubu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eisenkoubu/","13 products in account","Well...it's not a bad visual novel, but I've definitely seen better.\n\nBeing a free visual novel, I didn't expect much from the start. The game is very clearly a basic RenPy game, using a few default assets. However, much of the art in the game looks like it was made from scratch, from the text box graphic to Ai's sprites. They're pretty well done for a game of this caliber. The game's only shortcoming as far as aesthetics go is the poor amount of music. There's only three pieces in the game, and one of them is played continuously for a noticeably long time. It's nothing major, since the music's fine as-is, but I do prefer some variety when it comes to music.\n\nThe script is what makes or breaks a visual novel, and it's...interesting. The writing is good and the chemistry between the two major characters is great, don't get me wrong. It's that the story feels like the start of an idea that, due to the game's short length, never got fully realized. The twist ending is shocking in a meta sense, but I feel the author could have taken the story a lot further with the idea presented.\n\nOn its own merits, this is still a VN entirely worth reading.

The game is very clearly a basic RenPy game, using a few default assets. However, much of the art in the game looks like it was made from scratch, from the text box graphic to Ai's sprites. They're pretty well done for a game of this caliber. The game's only shortcoming as far as aesthetics go is the poor amount of music. There's only three pieces in the game, and one of them is played continuously for a noticeably long time. It's nothing major, since the music's fine as-is, but I do prefer some variety when it comes to music.\n\nThe script is what makes or breaks a visual novel, and it's...interesting. The writing is good and the chemistry between the two major characters is great, don't get me wrong. It's that the story feels like the start of an idea that, due to the game's short length, never got fully realized. The twist ending is shocking in a meta sense, but I feel the author could have taken the story a lot further with the idea presented.\n\nOn its own merits, this is still a VN entirely worth reading. It's just that, even before I came to Steam, I've played several other free VNs that have much tighter writing with equally good messages and characters. It would do best to check those out as well as this one.\n\nDid I mention typos and grammatical mistakes? :P","December 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the concept, and I'd like to see it revisited with more gusto and foresight.\n\nThe game asks you to take a moment and contemplate what exactly you're accomplishing while sitting around and playing games (and mayhap more directly—"gal games[en.wikipedia.org]"), so keeping it short and to the point does not taunt the player as much. The tradeoff of having a more fleshed out plot and actually trying to get the player invested would yield a much more effective result; albeit, an initial negative reaction.","December 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The artwork is average, the background music is repeditive and its rather short (15 minutes of game play and that's with interruptions).\n\nThe most difficult part of this review is that if I recommend it, I would also in turn recommend considering pitching in on the Kickstarter Campaign.\n\nAfter reading the visual novel and looking over the Kickstarter page, I'd say yes.  The reason is that they are very open about where they want to go with this project, showing the length planned, the artwork looks better the the free "prequel" and the VA sounded okay while a bit unpolished.","May 25","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, I enjoyed this brief experience.\nI feel like the ending was a little heavy-handed but was certainly a twist and even a little self-aware/satirical. On the whole, the writing wasn't phenomenal, and is a skill the developer will need to work on if they are serious about working within this particular genre.\nThe character design was pretty good, I liked the hairstyle. All in all I'm not a very 'visual' person so I can't provide too much feedback in that regard (as I'm writing this I'm realising I didn't even pay attention to the backgrounds). One thing I would have liked to have seen implemented though was for Ai's graphic to have changed when she tried on a new outfit; it was kind of weird when she asked ~"How do I look?" and I'm thinking "Uh, the same?".\nThe music playing through most of the story was a nice and upbeat, and fit the mood of the story. Transitions were abrupt though, and I did not dig the title screen music at all.\n\nI suppose I come across as a little negative; I'm trying to be constructive :3\nIt is a pretty coherently designed first work and I expect the dev. to go onto some bigger and better things (hopefully having come across the review at some point).","December 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

That said, I enjoyed this brief experience.\nI feel like the ending was a little heavy-handed but was certainly a twist and even a little self-aware/satirical. On the whole, the writing wasn't phenomenal, and is a skill the developer will need to work on if they are serious about working within this particular genre.\nThe character design was pretty good, I liked the hairstyle. All in all I'm not a very 'visual' person so I can't provide too much feedback in that regard (as I'm writing this I'm realising I didn't even pay attention to the backgrounds). One thing I would have liked to have seen implemented though was for Ai's graphic to have changed when she tried on a new outfit; it was kind of weird when she asked ~"How do I look?" and I'm thinking "Uh, the same?".\nThe music playing through most of the story was a nice and upbeat, and fit the mood of the story. Transitions were abrupt though, and I did not dig the title screen music at all.\n\nI suppose I come across as a little negative; I'm trying to be constructive :3\nIt is a pretty coherently designed first work and I expect the dev. to go onto some bigger and better things (hopefully having come across the review at some point).","December 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Additionally, it may be Americanized as 'kappa deem'. Now this bit of information may come off as superfluous, but this tid bit alone is what carries the entire story. In fact, I might even say that the objective of the game hinges on this all-too-an-apt phrase.\n\nNow I'm no fan of visual novels as a whole, 'Carpa Diem' is one game that you can't afford to miss (it's free after all damn it). This game is as thought provoking as it is an excellent standard of what current gaming should be. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll even moan in exultation. But above all, you'll cry. This game is not for the faint of heart. The unsophisticated dregs of society will undoubtedly fall to insanity if unprepared for the revelations that are found here. So plebians should tread with caution.\n\nThe game takes on the ambitious undertaking of researching the human psyche. The ideas displayed are revolutionary. Groundbreaking even. The perspective here is fresh, albeit suffering from the naivety of a neophyte philosopher. Regardless, it offers an interpretation on the futility of human action and presents a fatalistic take on both human will and ability to change. In particular, the game seems to be making a allusions to how people try, fail and try again to no avail.\n\nWith the themes and ideas out of the way, let us talk about the plot and gameplay next. In 'Carpe Diem', you play a typical everyman, reunited one day with a girl named Ai, who suffers from a terminal illness. Left only with a single day to live, you must help AI make the most of what little time she has left. The choices you make in the span of the game lead you to 3 drastically different branches of choice in how you must spend your waning time with her.\n\nThe game itself, has about 80 different save slots, and I do suggest you save frequently as you may need to backtrack and find out where you went wrong.\n\nI won't spoil anything, but this is a game I sincerely do recommend for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaha, did you think I was serious? HAHA.\nI was.\nAlright, so the game is short. Literally 8 minutes worth. So if you like, you can break your saves into intervals of 6 seconds as you play if you like. Alternatively, you could just place all you saves at the seconds last piece of dialouge in the game in tribute to the games goal.\n\nBottomline:\nDid I like the game? Yes.\nIs it a game? see: 'VN's: are they games or books?'\nWill I seize the day? HAH! obviously not.\n\nSincerely,\nsomeone who spent their day off writing a steam review and not 'kappa deem'-ing anything at all.\n\nTL;DR:\nCarpe Diem is a cheeky little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game.\nThis review is hollywood hit potential.\nDummies will an hero\nI need a copyright.\nGet me a lawyer.\n2D4U tbqh fam\nOnly for patricians like myself who are capable of deep thoughts\nI'm wasting my time\nBoys be ambitious!\nWhat am I doing?\nIkraievyritim\nShe is dead\n5ever\nis mean more than 4\nAm I the true idiot?\nMy God.\nI should stop for now.\nAnd I will.\nSoon.\nHonest.\n\n\nMaybe just one more sentence.\nOne more for the road.\nOkay.\nJust a word.\nHey, that was a sentence, and so is this\nEnd.\n\nEdit 1 :To the people who can't into comprehension, Carpa Diem means seize the day. The character you play does not seize the day. He keeps going at creating a waifu, despite failing a lot. He is not making the most of his time, and frankly, neither are you and I. That's the point of the game far as I can see, so hush up already for goodness sake. What I'm getting at with this 'review', is that we're all wasting our time. In fact, living is a waste of time. Even contributing is a waste of time. Wasting time is even a waste of time. What a shocker right? Well, that's what this game is. A shocker. The End.\n\nAlso, please teach me how to italics and use bold on the Steams please. It'll help my flow and wording better.

I only decided to try this one as the trailer looked nice and the reviews were mostly positive.\n\nStory starts off with a guy (you) meeting his supposed girlfriend or love interest in the park.

Which reminds me of the simple truth that opposites attract and yet such differences also cause friction.\n\nDisliked:\nI simply didn't understand why Jung would question, what he was doing with his life after his Ai girl friend crashed. I had noted that Jung appeared to enjoy her company, despite the considerable limitations of their relationship. Why should his relationship as it was, with some manner of synthetic (software) individual be judged as anyway inferior to any other relationship, real or imagined, synthetic or otherwise?\nIt is evident that many people live their lives in a very lonely fashion, yet PC (Personal Computer) uptake appears to be considerable. Therefore the thought experiment that the game explores, namely human beings developing relationships with Ai software has considerable merit. Many lonely people with access to PCs and such software could develop relationship within the technological constraints of such. I argue then that numerous people's lives could be bettered by the ubiquitous use of such Ai. I suggest that far be it from questioning his own life, Jung, could improve his Ai and eventually with persistence, make a lot of lonely people happier. Maybe even himself.\nThe implied notion that there is a perfect (or even any) partner just waiting for each of us to approach in real life, is naive and I argue, the greatest fantasy associated with this game.\n\nGood gaming,\nAlter\n\nI suggest that we all enjoy our fantasies, they may be all we have, they may be all we will ever have. I recommend against denouncing them as somehow inferior or unworthy and suggest instead embracing them as part of who we are.","December 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","16","31","4","0"

If you choose to go to arcade first it's..it's just insane how that thing was actually nostalgic to me almost to the point of thinking my stalker made this. I ♥♥♥♥ you not I HAVE A SPIDER PLUSHIE right next to me and that is pretty much how I got it without spoiling anything. Thou I was the one who kept failing at getting it not the other way around.\nThe ending..the ♥♥♥♥ing ending. First I was like ''GASP!'' ''Oh my god is this...she's a!...wait...what..oh for ♥♥♥♥s sake...''\nI can't explain the feels I got from ending, first it was incredibly beautiful but then it turned out to be something completely different.\nThe ''game'' is like 50MB,just download it and see it for yourself.\nIt's really cute game until the ending just makes it seem like a joke,it's free,it took me literally a second or two to download. Just play it.","December 19, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

At first I thought the game was kind of dull, you can’t select dialog and the conversation was kind of bland. As I continued playing though I grew to like the characters and see some charm in them. I don’t know if I would still have given it a good review until I reached the ending. I won’t ruin it for you but the ending was a nice little surprise. So in the end how could I not recommend this game? It’s short, it’s sweet, it has an interesting ending and most of all it’s free.","December 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
