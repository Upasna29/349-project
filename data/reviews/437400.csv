Think Star Fox but without the furries and sci-fi. Problem it its so heavily optimized for the Occulus its almost unplayable without it.\nThat being said, its free! So there no harm in trying it. If you have an occulus give it a shot, but I won't recomend it otherwise.","March 26","false","0.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

That means you cannot aim at enemies while flying in another direction. This leads to you flying in the line of fire just to aim at your enemies, and dying as a result, when you're just trying to land a hit with the very weak weapons of your machine.\n\nThis also means that enemies on the ground can only be hit by looking up to fly up, then looking down to aim at them, consequentially flying into the ground just to take aim and shoot at them. You're more likely to pass missions by avoiding all of the enemies and their projectiles, and to not bother shooting anything.\n\nThe game looks 'decent' if not super basic, as is the music. There is nothing fun about this 'game'. I do not recommend anybody to play or try this. There are better games out there that provide a more interesting VR experience.\n\nTLDR\n1/10 Crash To Aim Simulator","March 31","false","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","1"

Potentially a fun game down the track if the issues are resolved.","April 9","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
