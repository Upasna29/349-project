These guys have a robust stat system of Strength, Agility, Speed (? redundant?), Intellect, and Durability, with stats ranging to 100 and age is a factor.  But herein lies the problem.\n\nNone of these stats seem to matter. There is almost no correlation of stats and attack choices to damage done or received.\n\nAnd with stats out of 100 (maybe more? but not naturally), and seasons at 20 days max, training and ambiguous 'soul quests' were largely tacked-on things to do with your inactive roster (of 2 gladiators that are generally needing to rest by the end of the season anyway).\n\nGraphics and audio, good god.... I felt like I was playing Baldur's Gate using only Open Source elements.  If you play this, listen for the sound of someone biting an apple when a hit connects. (This sounds like a joke, it's not.)\n\nThis game had a lot of promise, potentially being a unique take on games like Football Manager or Franchise mode of popular sports game but fell tragically short.  In case a dev sees this, I would totally revisit with the following additional elements:\nMeaningful stat increases, both for gladiators and the arena. Money and attendance are the only benefits I could tell of upgrading, but attendance only increases money, and money can easily be generated by making decent conservative bets season-round.  Favor, gained from victory, only increases money and attendance.  Training costs money, but even maximum training only cost me something like 250g per gladiator and a victory generally nets me 3x that. (3 of course being how many gladiators you can have anyway).\n\nMeaningful arena upgrades.  I love the idea of unique upgrades a la lemonade stand or even dinopark tycoon.  Let me upgrade the chariot parking lot, or invest in armored lions (btw, these ♥♥♥♥♥ showed up randomly in a fight and did 30% damage to my warrior who was already being curb-stomped by the enemy despite a 2:1 stat ratio in my favor), how about some leg of lamb seasonings for more attendees?\n\nStat increases should be significant.  Gaining 1 or 2 stats per day while training at all is useless in a 20 day season, especially given how they seem to be awarded every other day in random areas? (Plus...:\n\nStats don't seem to do a thing.  Strength seems to be a roll of the dice where the dice don't change despite significant stat differences.  I understand needing to keep a game of fighting management semi-random, but the unknown only seemed to leave me scratching my head.  Even using attacks that play to my strengths seemed to let my opponent urinate on my gladiator for 20 damage.\n\nLarger roster.  Without a larger roster, why even bother training?  I can likely hire a new gladiator with my uesless heaps of gold that is better than my current roster rather than spending half their life training at a snail's pace.\nEquipment.  Equipment would be an excellent gold sink, requiring upkeep, training, and a staff...\n\nI WANT A STAFF! How about providing a staff of people?  The game even compares itself to baseball, why do I not have a "coaching staff" of a blacksmith, nurses, marketing, and construction?  You could do some amazing things with these.  Upgrade your forge, your hospital, your construction and equipment, and upgrades and research take weeks out of the season.  You could pay for better smelting techniques and better staff in general, but you have to upgrade your arena to have room for them.\n\nFavor could be used to petition the gods for better victory, healing, or research.\n\nLastly, bribes are so useless.  I bribed so many matches and lost almost all of them despite a bribe making victory "much more likely."  What a crock.\n\nThis game leaves way too much to be desired.  An extremely interesting premise but what is ultimately less interesting than the colisseums of Caesar 3.  Spend some more time at the drawing board and release some free content that adds some actual management rather than pure RNG, especially if you're going to boast stats and upgrades.","January 6","false","1.6"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","36","43","2","5"

Elysium Blood Games (EBG) is not an RPG (though it uses RPG elements), nor is it a fighting game (though fighting is the central activity of the game).  As I hope you gathered from my cheeky header, EBG is in fact a sports management simulator.  It has much more in common with OOTP or FHM than it does with, say, Pillars of Eternity. Or with Skullgirls.\n\nEBG is a lite sports managmement sim that is complex enough to be engaging, but casual enough to fit in that perfect "lunchbreak" game niche.\n\nThere. Trust me, you will enjoy the game much more if you know what you are getting into up front.  If you don't enjoy manager sims or casual games, you might want to think twice before purchasing so that you don't end up posting a thumbs-down review dripping with haterade the game doesn't deserve.\n\nBread & Circuses: the Citizen's Schadenfreude...and a golden opportunity for an entrepeneurial gladiator stabler!\nThe madness and decadence of "the Empire Before the Fall" is a well-known trope to scholars of history, and one that shows up often in video games.  It's an insane moment, during which the masses feel themselves lifted above foreigners and criminals, because the masses witness the bloody spectacle but need never fear they might end up in the ring themselves.  It's gluttunous and irrational, to take joy in another's suffering. But it became a tightly protected "right." Seneca the Elder observes that "the populace, defending its own iniquity, pits itself against reason."\n\nAnd so here we are to make our fortune by facilitating acts of brutish violence.  Gameplay is divided into seasons, and each season is divided into day-long turns.  As the manager, you get one stat point to distribute among your manager attributes at the beginning of each season.  These stats have global effects.  Then it's on to the stables. The gladiator population is randomly generated, so names, quirks, portraits, and stats will be different every game.  The fighters' attributes are of a type that will be familiar to sports management fans, including the ever-important "potential" attribute.  At any given time you may have 3 gladiators in your stable.  One gladiator must be designated as the fighter for the day's match.  For the other two, you can pay for them to train up attributes, or you may send them on a "soul quest." The choice of quests are each a generated combination of three numbers: risk, reward, and time commitment.  They will usually take several days but your fighter will return with some cash and often some improved stats. Or they will get horribly injured or die.\n\nYou can also use cash to purchase or repair weapons for your fighters, upgrade your stables with permanent buffs, upgrade the stadium to seat more people, bribe an opposing gladiator, or, my personal favorite, place bets on the day's posted matches.  The stadium provides odds for each bracket and you can bet 100, 250, or 500 on each match (or zero if you're not the betting type).\n\nThe game's secondary currency is influence, which you may use to publicize your fights in hopes to increase attendance and payout.  More importantly, you can use it to purchase randomly generated stable-wide buffs that last for a specified number of turns.  There are so many different combinations of these it makes for great fun.\n\nNow that all your stable business is concluded, it's time to fight! The fight is turn-based and you may recommend a technique each turn or you can give a general recommendation for the match and watch it play out.  These fights are heavy on the RNG, but instead of walls of math, each turn generates a blow-by-blow narrative of the fight.  It's a really nicely done feature.  I asked the dev about the lack of explicit math and they said that this technique encourages immersion and discourages min-maxers.  Though I sometimes like to see a game's math-guts, I do in general agree with them.  Certainly it was the right choice for this game.\n\nThis goes on until the season has been played out.  If you've done well, one of your fighters might get to fight in championship rounds for big rewards.  Between seasons you get to use your stat point, and then try to get the fighters you want to keep to stay with you by flashing money under their noses.  Fighters who have had a particularly rough season or who feel they've outgrown your enterprise will refuse to negotiate and just leave your service.\n\nThen it all begins again! I have found that one season, depending on how many days you've optioned for it to be, lasts between twenty minutes and an hour, making EBG an excellent game to hop on when you only have a short time and still have a satisfying experience.\n\n7/10-recommended for fans of sports management sims, gladiatorial combat, lunchbreak games, or bread & circuses in general.  Also, the pricepoint is fantastic for the amount of play you can get out of it.\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","February 27","true","9.2"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","0"

Indepth enough to keep you entertained for a few hours yet casual enough that you'll be able to pick it up and just start playing. While it's definitely lacking on the aesthetic side of things, the music and writing is more than enough to make up for the graphical animations. Personally, I wish they would've delved a bit more into the equipment side of things, maybe given more weapons or changed the effects that weapons could have on a Gladiator's effectiveness in combat. For example, a giant 2-handed hammer would probably slow down your gladiator but his attacks would be downright nasty.\nIn a short and sweet note, this is definitely something that text-based gamers will enjoy but also those who are fans of management style games can find something to like.\n\nPros:\n-Very helpful tooltips althrough the game's screens that explain everything indepth yet don't clutter the screen.\n-Love the writing, simplistic but it gives a great visual\n-Music, although loops, is downright soothing\n-Simple but fun text-based management\n\nCons:\n-Very limited Aesthetics throughout the game\n-Limited equipment selection, most customization for fighters comes from their stats.\n-Sometimes you feel like you get cheated by the RNG but the game can be forgiving\n-Feels like you've done everything after a few hours of play\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRaXEpKS8cU","February 15","true","1.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","16","19","7","2"

It is hard these days to even get feedback from a developer but this one goes out of his way to make sure people are happy and heard. I have faith the game will be balanced and tweaked to satisfaction in the future.\n\nThis game actually gets kind of addicting after a while, give it a few seasons, they don't take very long.\n\nMy old review (which still holds relevance): At first this was a very novel idea and something I would be highly interested in. I love management games. I am finding that having an extremely good fighter who is much better than your oppoenet matters very little more often that it probably should. I am also finding that you do not have very much influence over the development of your fighters, it is pretty much random. This game feels a lot like you have very little control over what is happening at all. It is a great concept, it just needs more ability to actually control the development of your fighters.","January 7","true","14.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","4"

In the game you are the arena master and you are given management over 3 gladiators. You can have a primary gladiator set for fights which can be changed at any time, and train/sent to missions the other two. The season lenght can be chosen at the begining of the game from three given days:10, 15, 20. At the end of each tournament you are given the opportunity to extend the contract of gladiators(they can also decline it) or just fire them to hire others. There are various buffs/weapons which can be used to raise your chances of victories. For some random matches there is a reward for the winner.\n\nThe game lacks the details of the menu tabs. The game menu have a total of six tabs, 3 on each side. The ones on left are Warrior Barracks where you can manage your warriors, Back Alleyway where you can buy buffs, Praetor's Library as the ussualy settings tab. The ones on the right are Arenamaster's Basilica where you have another 5 tabs which are explained if you hover over them, Local Tavern Notices where you can raise your spectators numbers and the revenue for the matches, Town Meeting Hall where you can see the curent standings and attributes of the gladiators from the curent season. Even though some explanations lack with some playtime you will get familiar with the concept.\n\nThe battles are random, and bribing and the equipment slightly raises your chances of victory(doesn't guarantee it). This could be seen as advantage of disadvange, advantage if you don't invest in the other functions and you win and disadvange if you lose after you have invested in them. During battles there is a chance of injury(don't know how it works, in my 5 played seasons never sustained an injury) and death chance where you lose your gladiator.\n\nWhat I especially liked was the sound. The cheers when the battle starts, blocking and moving(as in dodging) sounds as the hurtful yelling after you have been hit greatly enhances the game atmosphere.\n\nIf you are interested in this fact, the game features trading cards, but lacks achievements.\n\nNote - This game was reviewed using a key provided by the developer.","March 1","true","5.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Just shows a bit of realism and doesn't give off that "Oh, it's obvious who's going to win" feeling.\n\nThere are many features that make Elysium: Blood Games enjoyable, from managing your warriors, training them, sending them on quests, to betting on other matches as well as influence and earning gold. I also thoroughly enjoy the soundtracks as they do compliment the game very well.\n\nIt's a great game to play when you get tired of the normal FPS and RPG gameplay and just want to sit down and play something more casual and relaxing, although it's not always relaxing, I sometimes scream at my warrior (ahem... my screen... ahem) because I expected a win but instead he brings me a defeat. But that's the beauty of the game.\n\nIf I were to have a complaint about this game, it would probably be the lack of a tutorial, considering it's start new campaign and off you go. The avatars of some warriors are are ugly, and they're all bold/bare-headed. If they're warriors then I'd expect them to be wearing helmets or other pieces of armour, which is also not evident within the game. While you can give them a weapon, it would be nice if you could also give them some armour. As well as some of the timings of the various unfortunate events... The day before the semi-finals my main fighter decided to steal illegal weapons and he got caught, therefore suspending him for 7-10 days and putting him out of the season.\n\nDespite the stuff mentioned above. I really do recommend this game, kudos for the developer for making us such an enjoyable game. While it has been 2.5 months since the release of Elysium: Blood Games (at the time of me writing this) I really do see more room for ideas and features for this game.

Your fighters will range from 4-8 feet with no weighting given any expected norms. The gladiator's weight is just as variable. Not that this affects the fighting, near as I can tell, but it is a prominent example of how insane the RNG can be.\n\nThe weapons are INSANELY expensive. You can afford one at the start and they are tied to whomever you give it to. Even if they die, they keep their weapon.

Also, the developer is actively supporting the community by interacting with gamers, noting improvements and providing these where they make sense (e.g. Weapons were a welcome addition).  This is an attribute to be supportive of, as some developers will leave gamers with poorly finished products or not engage the paying customers.\n\nThe game:\n\nYou are the 'manager' of a group of gladiators, and have to prepare them for fights, choose who fights and instruct them how they will fight (defensively, normally, or aggressively, or try for specific attacks to make the opponent bleed).\n\nThe fights are text based, and the interface is primarly text and statistical  based.  If you like very strong graphics or controlling characters in first person, this is NOT the game for you.  This IS the game if you like 'simulated management' of the gladiators only, where you choose actions on a turn by turn basis, in what is quite a basic interface but cleanly developed (and hence the price because it is quite basic and casual, yet easy to learn and a little addictive).\n\nPositives:\n\nBeautiful intro with nice opening graphic and strong music.\n\nYou split your managerial skills between Loyalty, Performance, Development and Healing, and are assigned with a selection of Gladiators, making for a uniuqe team each game.\n\nIf your gladiator is not in combat, you can send them to training or on a quest to imrpove their skills (but you dont get to do any other action while they participate in these events or see what they actually do in great detail).\n\nChoose who will fight each battle, they will participate in a league of gladiators. If you choose to try and play dirty you can bribe your opponent to fight worse, or, buy special brews for your gladiators.\n\nA nice side game is a betting game, where you place money on other matches on who will win, based on their statistics.\n\nYou can upgrade an arena if you achieve certain levels, get bonuses for winning certain levels, and advertise to increase attendance and revenue at the arena.  Sometimes there's a chance the 'king' may attend your fight.\n\nSome random events can occur in battles, e.g. lions may appear once a season or so.\n\nTip :\n\n-  Be sure to use the ? help button on each screen on first playthrough and read carefully to understand the game and mechanics.\n\n-  The first battle was over so quickly I wondered what was going on as the text appeared far too quickly.  So I went to the settings and changed the settings so that a manual pogression of text was required, a much slower and enjoyable experience.\n\nDevelopment required:\n\nNeeds steam achievements.\n\nHope to see more overall improvements and features to improve the depth of the game.  One idea, possibly armour? Switchable equipment.\n\nI wondered what period this was actually trying to replicate, then I realised it's more of a 'fantasy setting' gladiator combat game, and doesn't really reference histroy with historical accurateness.  If you don't mind this, you can overlook this fact and focus on the gameplay, as the designer wanted to focus on the game of fighting more than the history I believe.\n\n","February 1","true","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

And adds a level of frustration when you somehow lose a fight, but it makes you want to keep going. There is a lightweight stat upgrade system via sending up to two of your 3 member roster into 2 types of training. Theres a very light level of customization in-game. Tho if you are one of the master-pc race veterans like myself, youll discover you can edit almost anything in the game ( I put my own jpeg gladiator profile pics and .wave files into the game must like in wasteland 2/3)\n\n\nits a casual game, there arent many negative points from me after playing for a few hours. I would like to see a better gold sink, Sitting at 60,000+ gold ( from the in game wager system) with nothing to dump it into feels lacking, I would love to see a weapon system or armor system to dump it into. I would love to see more depth into the stat allocation. I also feel the stat weights are a bit high, I went into a 7 season 20 day game growthing a gladiator into over 120 or 2 stats, still was losing to glads with 40-60 of every stat whereas my lowest stat was 90... **got curious , edited the save file to 300 of every stat to see if it changed anything, it didnt by much** REALLY my only complaint.\n\n\nI wasnt paid to do this review, I wasnt given anything to write this review, all of the above is solely my opinon based on my expirences from playing the game, I recommend this game as a time sink to anyone who enjoys number games or stat games. I enjoyed it :D i only hope it improves.\n","January 6","true","4.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Good old arena combat! I could probably do with a bit more text detail of the fights, a homage to the rich text detail of the play by mail games, but it's still fun none-the-less. If you're looking for a graphical game, this isn't it, though the artwork used in the game isn't bad.\n\nThe creator of the game keeps updating it regularly which let's me know he is still striving to upgrade the game and make it even better even though it's already a finished product.\n\nIt is addictive, you always want to see how well your main gladiator will do against the next opponent, and maybe cringe if you're fighting one of the best... though you could always try to bribe them to lose if the option is available for that particular opponent. Even bribed opponents may still win, then you'll be out both gold and a win, double whammy.\n\nOpponents (and your own) can be injured, even killed. And carry reputations per se, though I'm unsure how that aspect of the game works, your gladiators can become embroiled in scandals, but have a skill which can reduce (or eliminate?) these chances. Maybe your main gladiator is 8 and 0, with an easy opponent coming up, then blam, suspended for misconduct for 6 matches.\n\n*Edit - Forgot to mention there is also questing, to try and improve stats and gain gold. And also training for improving stats. So basically you have three gladiators at any given time. One is your main gladiator fighting in the games, a second one will be training, usually your alternate for gladiator combat, and one will be adventuring on a quest. And through it all, you have to manage your stamina (and injuries, and the rare death).\n\nOverall, this game fills that void for gladiatorial combat. I love it, and didn't hesitate to buy it after checking it out. And it's a steal at only $5 I believe?\n\n~Lawler","April 7","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very surprised that so few Gladiator sim management games exists with the popularity of movies and shows revolving around them. This game is very simple, and does have an active developer. It has muuch room for exansion, tweaking and enhancement. There is a few visual optimizations that eed to be done, mostly involving the game not fitting windows correctly and causing some UI problems (Like trying to find where to click, Haven't compared i t to the other similar game "Age Of Gladiatiors" which also on Steam (Really cutting back on Steam purchases due to this market authenticator nonsense, so mostly only purchasing games from legit key sites, and the other simulator hasn't appeared on any of those yet TMK). But back to this one. It's pretty fun desite the little UI probs. Does get immersive and I'm enjoying it so far. Certainly worth the small price if you are into sims. Hopefully one day a seriously immersive one (Breeding..lol, personality, more stats, weapons, and so forth will come along one day). So I so reccomend it , for this price and it's casual nature. It can at least give you a small genre fix...and with continued support perhaps the Dev willl exand, tweak and continue improvements.","March 19","true","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the brand new Indie Management Sim Elysium: Blood Games. Elysium: Blood Games was brought to you by the AWESOME one-man studio over at SimProse Studios.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jX83zkIRATo\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nAnother hit from SimProse. HIGHLY addictive gameplay. 4/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nSimProse Studios has done it again. Now, this game is NOT going to blow you away graphically or with it's sounds. They are good, especially considering the type of game this is. Elysium: Blood Game is very much a Stats/Management Sim. Although the comparison got me into a little trouble with Redemption, it still rings true: These games are like OOTP-Lite for RPG's, in a sense. Allow me to explain. Out Of The Park makes VERY deep simulations for Baseball and Hockey. What SimProse does so incredibly well is take that concept (managing your team to win it all) and translates it into darker, grittier aspects of past ages. Redmeption absolutely nailed this with it being an OOTP-Lite for Dungeons. This game here nails it for Gladiators.Pretty much a Sports Sim for Gladiators, really. Assemble your team, train your team, you can even gamble in this game to raise your funds. You can promote your fights (can you get the King to show up to your fight and cheer your guy on?). Recruit new Gladiators from the Free Agent pool. Watch as they get injured, retire, suspended, etc just like in pro sports! Performance enhancing elixirs? Yup. Got those too! Just careful of running that risk! Did I mention that ONE GUY does all this? These games are even more amazing when you consider ONE guy did all of this, and if it is anything like Redemption, he will work endlessly to refine the game. You have a dedicated Developer making some awesome, addicting games here. Swoop up the SimProse goodies, friends. Streets of Chaos, Redemption: Eternal Quest and now Elysium: Blood Games belong in the libraries of ANY Simulation fan, particularly if you enjoy the sports-sims like OOTP. This will be RIGHT in your wheelhouse. Take my monies, SimProse....you did it again! These games are cheap and insanely addicting. 4/5\n\nHappy Gaming!","January 5","true","8.3"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","7","26","2","16"
