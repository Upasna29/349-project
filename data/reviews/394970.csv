The combination of the setting and gameplay make this game very enjoyable.\n\nThere are two modes, story and custom.  In story mode you play various set missions, there isn't much replayability in this mode.  You can replay missions to earn a 5 star rating and that's about it.  You also earn souls for completing missions and achievements, you can use souls to buy weapons such as shotguns, smgs, silenced weapons, melee weapons, and grenades.  In custom mode you can download and play user-made maps, this is where the replayabillty comes in.  You can also make your own maps and let others play them as well.\n\nFor gameplay mechanics, when using a gun there is a reticle on-screen and you manually move it to aim and shoot the enemies, so some skill is needed to pull off headshots consistently.  You have melee weapons such as the knife and hammer, pretty self explanatory, you go up to the enemies and stab/bash them to death, a fun thing you can do with a knife (and other throwables) is you can throw it and kill enemies.  You can also throw the knife at various angles and land on top of enemies as well.\nA mechanic which I found interesting was that you can enter vents and traverse the level without being detected.  In certain situations you can kill enemies when you pop out of the vents.  Combined with the alertness of enmies, his feature opens up a lot tactics that you can utilize to kill, sneak past, or distract enemies.\nLastly there is a "cover" mechanic where you can flip over tables or hide behind bigger objects to protect yourself from enemy fire.\n\nSome issues that players might have with this game is the difficulty.  You only have one life and if you get shot or hit, you die and have to start the mission over; there are no mid level save points.\n\nFrom a hours:gameplay ratio you'll get a lot of hours out of the game IF you play custom maps, this is the meat of the game.  If you're playing the game purely for story mode, then I would wait for a sale and get it a bit cheaper.  But that is not to say story mode is not enjoyable it is quite fun.\n\nWith all of this said, overall I feel the game is very fun and refreshing.  This game is a must have, if not now then for sure later on in the future.  I hope this review is helpful to you.","March 16","true","6.1"," 61 of 64 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","61","64","0","11"

In the short time I've played, I've experienced great controls, an intriguing and slowly unwound story, and perfectly flowing gameplay. Like I said above, it is basically those two indie games, wrapped into one. The Gunpoint comes from the somewhat puzzle-ish infiltration of buildings and eliminating guards with a few interesting powers, and the Hotline comes in with the form of fight-die-learn-repeat gameplay. I haven't encounted any bugs so far, aside from some doors that like to close with me on the wrong side of them, and the progression and introduction of new, tougher enemies makes the game a continues learning curve. I'll update this when I finish, but I'd really suggest this, it's a very engaging game.","March 15","true","8.4"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","41","45","5","0"

From alerting enemies with purposeful gunfire, and then porting behind them, to knocking on the front-door and clobbering everyone inside with a hammer; this game has it all!\n\nAnd then, my completionist kicked in. I began to start going for 5 stars. What were once casual, shoot and hide levels began to transform into "How quickly can I murder everything and escape". Accuracy becomes key to getting that coveted fifth star, while dodging and replaying becomes second nature. Frustration gives way to satisfaction as you begin to trounce everything in your path with practiced ease.\n\nAs of writing this, I've made it past the "Zombie Kingz" with all 5 stars, and am currently getting boned by (Minor Spoilers), the regenerating vamps. If you've played games such as Hotline Miami, Gunpoint, or other thrifty games with grueling difficulty, a high skill-ceiling, amazing replayability, and wonderful soundtracks, pick this ♥♥♥♥er up, you won't regret it\n\nWorth noting this game is from the makers of Risk of Rain, a fantastic 2d rogue-like~ (Maps are the same). It's worth noting that this game has a funkier, jazz-esque soundtrack compared to RoR's frighteningly moving soundtrack, but where RoR had emotion, Deadbolt's music, along with it's environmental shifting based on doors and positioning, serves to backdroup the carnage you lay upon the undead.\n\n10/10, buy this ♥♥♥♥.","March 17","true","6.6"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","26","28","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathottopicdiva/recommended/394970/","fathottopicdiva","bobert awful (F+)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathottopicdiva/","690 products in account","Sometimes you've enough video games to realize which games are wearing the influences of the ones the developers have played before on their sleeves. Path of Exile cribs its gameplay style from Diablo, the granddaddy of all action RPGs. Darksiders cribs its gameplay style from games like Zelda, God of War, and at one point it outright steals the gun from Portal. Deadbolt cribs elements from Hotline Miami (kill-them-all systematic clearing of every room in a given building), Gunpoint (one level is literally a level full of traps hooked up to light switches, and the pixellated art style is what Tom Francis, the developer of Gunpoint, would have gone with if he listened to nothing but bands from Metropolis Records), and Hitman (differing approaches to the same problem of killing all dudes, depending on how suave or murderous you want to be).\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Deadbolt was that it doesn't have that many reviews, and that's weird, especially since the reviewers treated Risk of Rain with 8/10 praise. I thought Risk of Rain was pretty cool - a 'single-player MOBA-style RPG', I called it. It was damn fun, so why isn't the followup game getting much press? I don't have any idea why.\n\nThe second thing I noticed is that Deadbolt is definitely Hopoo Games' sophomore slump. While the visual design and layout of the game is pretty distinctive, the mechanics are less so. There's all sorts of mechanical design flaws - for instance, if you need to turn off the lights and there's a gun in front of that switch, then God help you. Same goes for weapons you've dropped on top of each other. The way the game does AI, gunshots, detection means there's always an element of uncertainty to everything - sometimes a good plan falls apart due to whatever RNG forces inhabit the world of the dead. There was one particular level where I had only 60 seconds to complete an objective, and going back to change my guns didn't pause the game, and I didn't realize that up until I was about to complete the objective. Then the game said HAHA NOPE, NEXT TIME CHOOSE FASTER, SKULLBOY and made me do the mission over again.\n\nDid I mention there's barely any checkpoints in this game? So if you finish a level and reinforcements get called in, and you get shot to bits trying to sneak past said reinforcements to your car, you gotta DO THE WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN. This game can be extremely challenging, but sometimes it can just be an unreasonable prick when it comes to spotty little things.\n\nBut Deadbolt itself kept reminding me of other games to a fault. A lot of the missions are in the Hotline Miami-style vein of killing them all, but it intentionally made me focus on single rooms rather than just whirling around in ice-cold violence just straight up murdering dudes. It's like Gunpoint, except the puzzles involve tricking the skeleton to come downstairs so you can pop him in the back of the head with your Derringer. It's like Hitman with its boss missions, except the puzzles aren't as well thought out (except for the one with all the traps, that's my favorite one). It mashes and tries all these combinations with these games I recognize but it doesn't really come into its own, I feel. You can't have Hotline Miami and Gunpoint, those two have completely different styles of play. Same with Hotline Miami and Hitman.\n\nDeadbolt doesn't really come into its own and that's kind of disappointing. I definitely would have enjoyed it a little more if the mechanics and storytelling were refined a bit more. It's still a solid tactical shooter and if you're into this sort of thing where you bang your head against a level until it clears, it won't steer you wrong for five hours.","March 19","true","7.5"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","32","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uzi_786/recommended/394970/","Uzi_786","[Zeu5]Uzi790","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uzi_786/","66 products in account","DEADBOLT is a 2D action stealth game, where you help the undead reach the afterlife\n\nQuick note: If you enjoyed hotline miami, get this. This review will focus on those who haven't played hotline.\n\nThe gameplay of this game usually involves killing all the enemies in a level, possibly performing a task of some sort, then exiting the level to start the next. The gameplay involves maneuvering around the environment, and killing enemies with guns or melee weapons.You must do all this without being hit a single time, as you can only be hit once before dying and restarting the level. The combat itself is satisfying, each gun has little details that set them apart, as do all the melee weapons. Headshots are satisfying.\n\nThere is a good mix of strategy and reaction based gameplay. The game lets you look around the level at the beginning, and take in all the details, such as enemy placements and weapon locations, Then you can build up a strategy from there, separate this enemy from the rest, kill him, take their weapon, turn off the lights so enemies can't see you as well, then lure them in the room and take them out one by one. Watching your plans pan out like this is satisfying, and watching the last enemy fall to the ground gives you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nBut improvising and rushing right in is still very much a viable option, You will die much more, but you'll see yourself learning more and more what to do in what order, gradually inching towards success. Keep in mind these are two extremes, your actual gameplay will definitely involve a mix of both. Sometimes your plan goes wrong, and being able to get yourself out of a sticky situation fast is again, satisfying. Sometimes things won't go as you wish, and an enemy might suddenly jump in, and it's up to you to quickly deal with the situation.\n\nLevels in this game are varied, and each one is different in several ways (Except at the start of the game, which is understandable because you are still learning how to play). The game frequently makes use of special "pipes" which are ventilation systems/ water pipes within housing that you can use to rapidly move around a level, and it allows the player to tackle a level from many different points. some may opt to use the front door, others may go around back, go on the roof, or go right in the middle of a room and drop on an enemy. There is one level which almost entirely makes use of traps, and while it plays very differently to the rest of the game, it is definitely an interesting level, and is a welcome "break" to the regular gameplay. The levels are all set in quite varied locations, from regular housing, nightcluibs, drug labs, and car shops. and each level will look unique and interesting. Enemy placements is usually pretty fair, the game mostly lets you deal with tougher enemies comfortably one on one in the beginning, but later on makes it so that you need to start thinking about engagements. Like separating enemies so you can fight more easily, and conserving ammo so you can deal with stronger enemies.\n\nThere is one level, however, which i feel was absolutely terrible, and has very little place in game. It involves a time limit, and has some unfair enemy placement. With 2 strong enemies, and engaging them causes several other enemies to aggro and come as well in a few seconds. and unfortunately, the only reason i could get through it was because i used a purchasable weapon, the scythe. A player may not be able to access this, due to spending their money on other weapons, so this level is pretty bad, hopefully the developer can tone that down.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, there is a good variety. You get your basic grunts who use guns, or a melee weapon, and you get some with gimmicks. For example, there is a certain type of zombie, whose body and corpse are separated, and both are connected, meaning if you shoot the head, the body will also die. There are 4 different main "races" of enemies in this game, and each of them have their own type of weaponry, and gimmicks that set them apart(except for zombies, who are pretty standard).\n\nI won't delve too much into graphics, i think they look really fantastic, and their is a very high quality throughout the entire game. If you like what you see in the screenshots/trailer, you'll like it in the game.\n\nThe plot of the game is pretty simple. You're the reaper, and you kill the undead for your job. However, the game does have some deeper stuff hidden away. If you know how Dark Souls' story/lore was, deadbolt is pretty similar. It mostly just gives you questions to think about (Like Risk of Rain, by the developer of this game). The plot is there if you're interested in it, and you can easily ignore it, so it's like an "opt in"  system in that regard. That being said, it isn't executed very well, cause there are only a few characters in game that i want to know about ,but there isn't much to learn about them...\n\nThe soundtrack of this game is fantastic, as is the sound design. I especially like the diagetic music. If your outside of the buildings, the music will be "muffled", but if you're inside, you'll hear it proper.\n\nThis game would be pretty suitable for both casual and hardcore players. Playing it once will definitely get you your money's worth, especially if you buy this on sale. For hardcore players, there is hardmode which is unlocked by completing the game once, and some hard achievements, like Beating a new game entirely within 1 hour, or beating a new game without dying a single time. It took me around 16 hours to beat the game on both normal and hard.\n\nHard mode, as i mentioned, allows you to replay the game making it more difficult. It alters enemy placements, so levels will usually  be much more complicated. During hard mode, the game forces you to play smart, so rushing in is no longer viable. Ammunition must be managed well, as due to the increased amount of enemies, you'll need more ammo to deal with situations. As well as forcing you to melee to conserve the ammunition. I think a little bit of dialogue is also changed in hard mode, but i haven't logged any of it, so hard to say how much has changed. Other than that, "hard mode" is indeed hard.\n\nThere's also a level editor, so you can expect some more conent from the community. But this largely depends on the popularity of the game, so maybe you should contribute some stuff if you decide to buy.\n\nThere are issues, however. Sometimes you'll have weapons drop right next to a door or vent, so you have to inch towards guns very slowly, accidentaly enter a vent, or open doors you weren't supposed to, when you were trying to pick up a gun. the game needs to refine in this case.\n\nI played through the game with a keyboard, so i cannot comment on using controllers yet. I also played a decent amount of hotline miami, hence me finishing the game fairly quick.\n\nGameplay is good, both tactical and reaction based.\nLevels are all varied and interesting, only a few bad ones.\nEnemies are all different, and each of them have good gimmicks and designs\nGraphics are good imo, soundtracck is also great\nGood for both casual and hardcore players\nSometimes guns can drop in places that can screw up the controls.\nI will update this review as i play more, do more playthroughs, and see what i think then. I'll also give the level editor a shot and see if it's bad/good.","March 17","true","19.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

I hate those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ vampires there are too many of them and they run real fast and they dance in a dumb way AGHGHGHH. Fun fact: I had the most trouble with that one.\nThe last one. The end of the game. The Dredged. Without spoiling too much it was so incredibly FUN. Seemed pretty normal at first and then Timur the Tinkerer happened. And then Vall happened.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iisteepii/recommended/394970/","iisteepii","Steep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iisteepii/","119 products in account","Lots of potential here.\n\nNailed It\nSetting\nThe setting and characters are so damn cool. Being a hitman in the underworld is coolio, and the pixel art style really adds to the charm. It could have been fleshed out some, maybe have other friendlies you could meet and chat with besides your weapons dealer and your boss. So it's style over substance here, but for a quick little action game I'd err on the side of style too.\n\nMusic\nThe music is pretty damn good. Most of it is some play on the same theme, but it's a damn good theme that fits the game's setting perfectly. I listened to the album on bandcamp and some of the songs are still stuck in my head.\n\nSlightly Amiss\nGameplay\nSo it basically boils down to alerting as few enemies as possible, and flitting around the vents to pick off stragglers before you set off any large alert chains. That's pretty satisfying overall but there are a few nagging issues.\n\n1. E does it all\nThe E key is used to swap weapons, enter vents, take cover, open doors, and interact with other environment bits like light switches. This basically means that if any of those things overlap physically (and they will) the wrong thing is likely to happen. This is especially frustrating when you're on the run- picking up a weapon instead of closing a door or entering a vent killed me many, many times. Having to inch up to highlight the right item also breaks up the game flow even if you're not in danger.\n\n2.Cover is wonky\nThe cover system is just not what it needs to be in an action game like this. The side you hide behind is decided by what half of the thing you're on, so if you misjudge you'll be taking cover with your back towards the enemy. The cover objects are drawn at an angle so it's an easy mistake to make sometimes.\n\n3.Enemy AI\nAt best the AI is expoitable, and at worst it's erratic. If you sound the alert and disappear down the stairs, the enemies will file down one by one for you to kill at your leisure. This isn't super satisfying but since it's sometimes difficult to lumber to some cover in time, the game kind of forces your hand. Other times if you alert a pack of enemies and they lose sight of you, they'll walk back and forth endlessly in one spot. This behavior makes it impossible to re-engage in any stylish way, you simply have to come back with enough bullets to gun the crowd down.\n\nMissed Potential\nThis one is kind of nit picky, and for $9.99 it's a non-issue. The game has the feel of a Hotline Miami mixed with Gunpoint. The Gunpoint bits it got right, flitting around the vents and taking out single targets without being seen feels good and works well. Once you have to alert more than a few enemies the Hotline Miami bits *should* kick in, where you stylishly slaughter the group with skill rather than tact. But that's when the clunky controls really show themselves, and the lack of combat options becomes apparent. There's no movement ability to get you to cover faster. There's nothing to do with an empty gun but look for something else to replace it. Once a group is alerted there's no real option to outplay the AI, you just have to have the bullet count to take them all out.\n\nNot to mention you're the REAPER. You should be gaining abilities over the course of the game, like death stares or turning into invulnerable smoke temporarily or possessing enemies or wall-phasing or whatever else sounds cool. You're not a human in this game but they take advantage of it with vent travel *only*. If not through magic abilities, you should be getting new toys to deal with enemies as the game goes on. Remote explosives you can put on doors, noisemakers that could attract enemies, sleeping darts, what have you. There's enough to cover the game for it's length, but I have no desire to play it again because all that's left to unlock is other guns.\n\nPretty GudSo yeah it could be better, but the game oozes style and I had a good time. Maybe the next one will iron out the control kinks, flesh out the gameplay and the setting and become a real cult classic.","March 16","true","6.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Each stage consists of a more or less complex area to infiltrate, guarded by a number of enemies. As the difficulty increases, so do your options: a wide array of weapons becomes available as you progress, in addition to those you might find during the missions.\n\nAs one hit instantly kills you, balance and level design were always going to be critical. Fear not, Deadbolt is absolutely brilliant in both respects. The tight balance leaves little room for error, but most levels are short enough that you won't mind redoing them until you've figured out how you want to go about them. Then you'll experience the deep satisfaction of a well thought-out and precisely executed plan, clearing the stage like clockwork... or dying to a minor detail that you overlooked. The gameplay is full of clever ideas, of things you can do (enter a vent, switch off the lights, knock a door to distract your foes, etc.) to approach each mission in a number of subtleicious ways.\n\nThankfully, the visual and audio design is on point. The "film noir" atmosphere is simply awesome, not the least thanks to yet another memorable soundtrack from Chris Christodoulou. As for the visuals, this may well be the most stylish pixel art I've seen in a video game. Everything fits so well within the setting, from the vampires in tuxedos and elegant dresses to the blood splattering the walls.\n\nIn conclusion, the makers of the outstanding Risk of Rain have pulled another jewel out of their bag - very diffferent, but somewhat more polished and still unmistakbly theirs. Deadbolt's campaign will last you a solid 10 hours, and these alone are well worth the price tag - but then you can set about completing Hard mode, earning a five-star ranking on every mission or even create your own content with the level editor, as well as exploring the hundreds of custom levels already available on the Steam Workshop.

It got its side-scrolling view and some stealth mechanics from the first one and skull-crushing, brains blowing, blood spraying dynamic gameplay from the second one. What’s original is the setting imbued with dark humor, noir atmosphere and undead stylishness. Amazing soundtrack serves as a topping and all this makes DEADBOLT a game I wouldn’t recommend to miss.\n\nPrepare to die a lot because perfect execution of all the deadly maneuveres recuires accuracy, good reflexes, patience and lots of practice. Oh, and our hero in this game – the Reaper – dies from a single bullet or a hit. You’ve killed every enemy but left a single guard dog in a furthest room of the map? Be prepared that it can maul you to death before you manage to kill the beast.\n\nImmense arsenal of melee weapons and firearms and a couple of tricks in your sleeve like teleportation through the vents present you the variety of ways to kill stuff. It’s totally viable to complete certain missions with a single hammer or pair of pistols but will require some profficiency. Don’t expect to beat every single level on your first try! You’ll often need time to carefully plan your actions prior to executiong a massacre on the heads of chilling zombies and dancing vampires. Yeah, you’ve heard that right – setting of this game is strange as hell but pretty interesting and original, especially if you spend some time studying the hidden casettes, looted from enemies.\n\nIt might seem too short but is being sold with a level editor which supposed to fix that complain. I myself beat the game in 10 hours and its length seemed just perfect to me – it doesn’t feel short and haven’t started to tire you like some puzzle-killing games do.\n\nTotally worth every cent I’ve spent on it. I recommed to give it a try if you like puzzle-killing games like Hotline Miami or SUPERHOT and also if you enjoyed the previois game from this studio – Risk of Rain.\n\nNow go and kill some stuff, Reaper!","April 2","true","10.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

People are simply comparing the two because of the blood and difficulty. If you want Hotline Miami gameplay, play Hotline Miami.\nMy view of the game may be skewed a little because Risk of Rain is one of my favorite games of all time, but I can't help that.\nDeadbolt is a very challenging game, but it is very easy to learn. That is one of the most frustrating parts about it: you know how to play it, but you keep dying. This is the type of game that you will rage quit and come back after a half hour to try again. The gameplay is 2d stealth, like Gunpoint. But again, this game is NOT Gunpoint.\nThe art style is distinctively Hopoo, and the character sprites along with the warm lighting and "rustic city" atmosphere almost reminds me of Dishonored without the steampunk. While a lot of the art in Risk of Rain focused on stressing the fact that you are very small and very alone, Deadbolt keeps things closer, with focus on you and the nearby rooms.\nThe music, like Risk of Rain, is very beautiful and fits the game perfectly. Some of the songs even sound familiar to Risk of Rain, which I sort of enjoyed.\nOverall, while I haven't even beaten the game yet, I enjoy this game immensely. I'm not sure how replayable the main story will be, but the Steam Workshop will probably fix that if it isn't.

I will be honest and admit I'm a hopoo fanboy, I bought this game almost entirely based on my experiences with Risk of Rain, and I wasn't disappointed!\nThe game keeps itself seperate from titles similar to it by focusing at least partly on stealth, rather than the fun, bass-pumping of hotline miami, and I greatly appreciate the sneaky manuvers that can be achieved. While the mechanics are simple (raise gun shoot gun throw melle weapon) I keep finding new ways to use the simple design to my advantage, exploiting tricks with a knowledge obtained through many black blood stains (Big bartender vampires take three hammer hits to kill, phylactaries and head cameras can be broken eith a hammer and still let you keep the weapon, you cant out damage a nightcrawler. Ever)\nThis is a game that offers a great set of challenges for an enthusiast, from the tricky levels in hard mode to the nose-bleedingly difficult four horseman achievements, and, coupled with a community of map makers, will keep a pulse on the undead for a while. The other challenge, and one I had hoped would appear again, is the deep set touches of lore and story that give the world life and hint at something greater. For the life of me, and SPOILERS AHEAD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite collecting nearly all tapes I can only glean that you live as a reaper in this Place, and Ibzan was the reaper before you and wants to pass on, which he believes he can do by speaking with the Flame. Even getting to this conclusion took a fair deal of brain twisting, and while that might not appeal to everyone, I know I am not alone in loving thehidden lore of a game.\nIn conclusion, buy. This. Game. If not for the story and hidden details, if not for the very well done musical accompanyment, if not for the challenge of beating famine and death, get it because at its core, Deadbolt is a fun and fast paced stealth hybrid, and good Flame who doesn't want to spam knock on a door until someone answers and eats blunderbuss?\n","April 9","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But after spending so much time playing through it I have finally decided on my review. It is absolutly wonderful. It has a few flaws that stand out but most can be overlooked.\n\nGameplay 8/10\nThe gameplay is really enjoyable. It is heavy on Hotline Miami style stealth where it isn't "hide behind cover and sneak past enemy" instead it is more of "Shoot this enemy behind another from far enough away so he doesn't hear the gunshot". For me most of the guns I didn't like too much except the lever Action Rifle in the Dredged stages, and the different types of revolvers. I prefered the melee weapons as they could be thrown with the exception of the sledgehammer and scythe. the scythe, once I bought it, was my personal favorite. Fast swing, high damage, good range all in one lethal weapon fitting of the Reaper. the only issue is some stages I don't know how you can complete without the scythe as a few involve either timers or needing to clear a large room very fast without letting anyone know you are in there.\n\nStory 7/10\nThe story isn't really the main focus, but I liked it. You play as the Reaper who is hired by a talking fireplace to do jobs after the undead take the world over. The Missions can be anything from gathering intel, killing a target or targets, to finding out where one of the Fireplaces Candle servants went missing. Plus you can find recording tapes after killing undead that can be listened to(they display text so more of reading) that give a little bit of insight to the undead's thoughts.\n\nMusic 10/10\nThe music is divine, truely and utterly divine. It is made by the same man who made the Risk of Rain OST, Chris Christodoulou and a few others I don't know. The music changes from stage to stage and each one fits well. The music ranges from Strong but quiet Electro-dance in the Vampire's nightclubs, Heavy rock and metal during the Demon mercenary's jobs, Multi-genre Soft smooth music that slowly ramps up but never gets too fast during the Zombie's drug hideouts, to powerful atmospheric music filled with tension during the magic obsessed Skeleton bases. Not to mention the final level, the last song is wonderful.\n\nArt: 8/10\nThe art isn't anything special as it is pixel graphics but it does really fit well. It has that kind of effect where after playing for a few hours you kind of forget it is even pixelated.\n\nFinal score 9/10\nA wonderous game with a really enjoyable challange, heavenly music by an amazing composer and great stage design plus a level editor for those who like to make their own. I highly recomend this game to anyone who is interested,","March 25","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/394970/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","Deadbolt is a 2D stealth action game with an emphasis on quick decisive action and execution in a similar vein to Hotline Miami. But Deadbolt manages to remain it's own unique game and provide a massively enjoyable experience.\n\nPlaying as the Grim Reaper set in a modern time, you have been tasked to cleanse the city of the undead, who instead of being your typical cookie-cutter zombie horror things, the undead act more like underground gangs; Hanging in rundown hideouts, stashing and selling drugs and running questionable businesses. There are several missions taking you through 3 of these gangs of zombies, vampires and skeletons with each mission introducing new mechanics and enemy types to keep the experience fresh and fast-paced.\nThe controls are intuitive, easy to pick up, but tricky to master. Combined with the ever-expanding enemy variety and the fact that you die in one shot (but get infinite retries like Hotline Miami) make Deadbolt a challenging but fair game. Most deaths leave you with no doubt what you did wrong and how you can do better, so during your trial-and-errors the plan on how to beat the level gradually formulates itself inside your head.\n\nYou enter each level undetected by enemies, who mind their own business but ultimately catch on to your presence and start looking around. Enter the vents, which turns you into an undetectable cloud of smoke that can travel through a set series of pathways while still granting vision of the level, allowing you to monitor your foes and plot out your next course of action. Entering/exiting the vents however is not a guarantee get-out-of-jail-free-card. As there are a few precious moments before you enter the vent where an enemy can shoot you down, and some vents exit out of a high-up and out of reach area. So you can't just pop in, shoot, kill, pop-out.\nA problem with this and general world interaction is that there are some levels with cluttered interactive objects. Sometimes you'll find yourself interacting with the wrong item when you meant to enter a vent just because you were not standing in the exact right spot, which given the fast-paced nature of the game means you very well might get killed.\nOn the topic of vents: There is an uncommon but highly unfortunate glitch that may be encountered. You may attempt to enter a vent to safely escape enemy fire, and the game will visually show you that you have successfully entered the vent, however, despite all this you still managed to die. It makes no sense and is unfortunately frustrating. Why did it show that I clearly escaped and then still kill me? It's uncommon but unfortunate all the same.\n\nTo kill your enemies you have a good-sized variety of firearms, some of which you can start the level with or purchase from a shopkeeper as you progress through the game. The guns all have a very satisfying and loud punch to them, as well as their own individual effective ranges. As you aim further and further away from the Reaper the reticle expands, showing that the bullet spread makes the weapon more unreliable with an unmistakeable visual. This doesn't apply to all weapons, but the ones that are perfectly accurate are few and far between.\nKilling an undead is also very satisfying. Despite having 8-bit graphics they still implement ragdoll physics, so dead enemies fall and react in a realistic and gratifying fashion.\nHowever, the biggest complaint I have with Deadbolt is the limited AI of enemies. You fire off a few shots to eliminate a target but get the attention of some other enemies who were within earshot. You escape into the vents or move up/down a level in the building, and when they get there all they do is quickly and seemingly endlessly walk back and forth. I would have liked to see the enemies group up and start patrolling the entire area (in groups, not just run off individually like idiots and get picked off one by one with no fear of consequence). The AI can also be herded a little too easily, popping up and showing yourself in the stairs for a brief moment can cause them to follow you down, lining up for a quick and easy kill.\nThe AI isn't groundbreaking in any sense, and despite its flaws, it serves its purpose well enough. The game is already quite challenging as it stands.\n\nFor the asthetics: Deadbolt is littered with small and loving details showing that the developers really took their time and had a lot of passion for their work. The soundtrack is absolutely outstanding and I might just buy myself a copy to show my appreciation for it.\n\nThe simplicity of Deadbolt's set-up and it's steady challenge is quite simply endearing. I absolutely love this game and I definitely recommend it. If you liked Hotline Miami, stealth games or passionate indy games, Deadbolt will be right up your alley.","April 2","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Here's why:\nExceptional visuals: The art direction of hopoo's previous game, Risk of Rain, was what initially attracted me to buy it, and the art of Deadbolt is even better. What's more is that the gorgeous visuals never obscure the gameplay, which can often move very quickly. This is hugely important and vital to keep the challenges Deadbolt presents fair.\nFantastic soundtrack: Those who've played Risk of Rain will undoubtedly recall the game's unique, wonderfully atmospheric soundtrack, entirely composed by Chris Christodoulou. Chris collaborated with hopoo again for the soundtrack of Deadbolt and the result is just as memorable.\nExhilarating, fun gameplay: Most importantly of all, Deadbolt is a seriously fun game. It captures the visceral gameplay of the Hotline Miami series but not without its own notable spin. The vents prevalent on every map make the game far more mobile than Hotline Miami and also open up a ton more possibilities for dealing with situations. This also means the game lives up to its description; you can play this game as deliberately or spontaneously as you want and still come out on top. Finally, the feeling of success in this game is seriously rewarding: there's something to be said about the twisted pleasure of watching a vampire's head explode after landing a particularly nice shot.\nThere's a ton of little things I love about the game, too (for example, the Reaper's apartment is super cozy and he even eventually gets his own playful little cat!). These may not mean a ton for the overall game, but are nice little touches that really tie together the world hopoo's crafted.\n\nThe freely included level editor is an (insane) bonus and hopefully gives this game some much deserved longevity. Deadbolt is a delight of a game and for $10 I eagerly recommend it to anyone who's even remotely interested in stealth, action, or even puzzle games.","March 14","true","14.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The atmosphere is flawless, setting its own universe into stone using snippets and pieces of imagery, and the art design is just grim enough to set the mood without taking itself overly seriously. The gameplay is somewhere in-between Hotline Miami and Gunpoint, as many others have said, but I can see obvious influences from Risk of Rain. Every hit feels satisfying. Every win feels earned and yet barely earned. Every loss is crushing. It's clear that, after only two games, this team has got its style down, and the game design is so well-crafted that it never left me wondering, "Why did they put that there?"\n\nThe story had me hooked all the way through, and although I yearn for a bit more of it, what's there already wraps up extremely well. I didn't want to kill the final boss, but he certainly wanted to kill me. I'm reminded of Providence, the Bulwark of the Weak. Hopoo certainly knows how to make a player feel conflicted...\n\nAll of this is wrapped together like an undead Christmas present with Chris Christodoulou's incredible soundtrack.

It can get pretty frustrating at some points but I felt that it was well balanced and provides just the right amount of difficulty. There will always be a point when you realize what you were doing wrong or you figure out another way to tackle the mission that's faster and more efficient than what you were doing before, and it feels incredibly satisfying when you successfully pull a plan off. I feel like 3 chapters isn't enough, but considering the level editor, achievements, and amount of time I've poured into this game (I have just finished chapter 2) I definitely got my money's worth. Buy it now if you can, don't wait 5000 years for it to go on sale, the devs deserve the money.\n\nSome notes:\n-The weapons all feel different; all of the guns have varying degrees of accuracy, power, and bullet count. I kind of wish there were more melee weapons though.\n-The pixellated art style is quite lovely, and I feel like it's a step up from Risk of Rain in many aspects (though I loved Risk of Rain's art as well).\n-Chris Christodoulou's music is amazing as always, and sometimes I found myself pausing the game just to listen.\n-Really loved the different environments in the game (especially the clubs), and I like that stuff slowly gets added to your apartment.\n-One gripe I have about the game is that the requirements for getting 5 stars aren't very clear, though I guess it's mostly based on accuracy of headshots.\n-Headhunter+hammer master race.","March 24","true","23.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But then we come to the descriptions of the undead. Sure, they explained the Vampires, Skeletons and Demons well, but they didn't quite go into depth with the zombies. So let me just say this: The story sometimes doesn't give us full details, which begs a few questions. And yes, these aren't always bad ideas to beg questions, but it would be a bit nice to explain what zombies are (Prehaps people who have overdosed on drugs?) There isn't much I can say about the storyline now, except that it is very short if you know the controls well, and can take a challange. The best way you can continue is through the use of the workshop, which, I have to say, was a great addition to the game. Don't get me wrong, the storyline was really great and thoughtful, and the tapes really gave some stories to how the Undead felt from time to time, but the Workshop just adds new levels, new designs to which people add to! It would be awfully fun if they did a contest or something. Next up, we have the end.  We never get an understanding to why our friend (I really forgot his name, the one who died at the well) said that the flames was his 'Old friend'. Now, there is that one Skeleton log talking about how a skeleton had the fireplace, however it vanished for some reason (Perhaps he became an undead at some point). It would be nice to have a  *COUGH COUGH*  DLC  *COUGH*  , Where you play as that undead who lost everything.  Would make for a touching story.  ...So that's all I really have to say about the game. Overall, I'd give it a 6/10, the gameplay was challanging, it had a touching story, but it didn't achieve some things right. But I would really reccomend it for anyone who is into the type of game!","May 8","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Add a thin story [enough to make interest and not bog you down.. GOOD THING!] Where you are a reaper for the God of Life. Nice chats by the fire with him, cause he's the freaking fire.\n\nZombies, vampire, then skeletons [a fourth type I won't mention]. Often combined. Every enemy is unique and you can't be too relaxed. One shot or hit and you are.... whatever the Reaper is when he gets poked? Anyway fast restarting [from the map you are on, few have more than one screen.] makes this less frustrating.\n\nGoodies: Multiple weapons you buy with souls. Many more to find in levels that are or are not buyable.\nHINT, to get your goodies go to your car trunk starting each level. You get one primary and a secondary.\n\nHighlights: Setting, gunplay, melee fun, enemies with phylacteries and Twins that are a vampire boss set in a level. One is the other phylactery so you have to quickly kill one then the other before revival. Each enemy is neat. Zombies without heads and can't see. But their head is chained to the ceiling or on a table. Figure it out from there. Each weapon is neat but I wish you could buy most that are unbuyable.\n\nDev, please add a few like the mines or whatever to buy from the docks!\n\nMore Highlights: #1 is the level editor. Developer, thanks, please help me find out how to make phylacteries for any enemy or expand it for stuff not done in game too please! Hard to learn the editor for being the best part.\n\nBad stuff: Rare enemies that just appear. In a one hit death game this is a mortal sin. Not common happening here but enough to think it was not tested at all or tested by unattached people. to the project IMO\n\nAlso the game really doesn't have much bad for it. If you are pushing against a wall and shoot you will shoot at or through the ground/floor [due to armor piercing in some guns] and make noise by accident. Little things really. Not terrible,\n\n*Fun* 10/10 -2 if impatient\n*Music* 8/10 +/- on your own opinion here\n*Gameplay* 10/10 : cover/limited ammo/guns in level/guns in trunk to start with/ amazing visual feedback to playing, with the walls spattering and the doors full of holes. Shells on the floor and bodies coming apart.\n*Graphics* are defining. Hard to score so I won't, just read Gameplay. Amazing graphical feedback to what happens.\n\nBEST: Enemies and level design, two here because they are almost married in perfection.\n\nWORST: Weapons. Many are too similar. Quite a few unique ones that give an advantage [the Scythe is great to move fast like a dodge while killing at the same time. IMO get this ASAP, no ammo needed]\n\nTo be fair though, bullets are bullets [though not all equal] and can kill lights, phylacteries [the out of reach ones], and enemies. More bullets is good even if the gun isn't amazing. Still, few memorable guns all of which are low capacity and no ammo for them to get almost ever, [2-4 levels at most depending.]\n\nBuy the game! If it's on discount especially absolutely get it and apologize for robbery and attempted murder on the developer[s].\n\n100% Rating IMO.","March 21","true","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As I do reccomend this game 100% to anyone looking for a challenge (with a great soundtrack / effects!) there are just some small gripes I have with the game.\n\n1. [Level design]: In one level a part of the screen would be so dark I couldn't see what I needed to see in one level. During a certan level where you are running around for your life, I couldnt see the elevator button because I am pretty sure it got shot with a bullet hole.\n\n2. [Controls]: The E button is used for A LOT of things, and there are a few VERY frusterating deaths that happened while attempting to close a door or fleeing to a vent, and I pick up a gun instead or something to that effect. It was one of the few times that I could truely "blame" the game for my death instead of myself.\n\n3. [AI]: Enemy AI is pretty good and predictable for the most part (as it should be in this type of game) but when enemies start layering on top of one another in corners attempting to get at you, they can at times get stuck or durp out. Id almost prefer the enemy have the ability to climb a ladder, or fan out after some time instead of patroling one single room after they find a body.\n\nOnly bug I found other than AI getting stuck rarely is if you close a door on a weapon, you can make if fall through the floor sometimes. The difficulty curve seems to go up and down near the end, but at least at the start of the game they do try to slowly increase the difficulty and shake things up little by little. Anyway, if you loved hotline miami, you will get a simiar feel in this game. So turn up that screen brightness a bit, accept you are going to die, A LOT, and you should find an enjoyable 6 or 12 hours depending how stuck on levels you get.","March 15","true","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As far as I can tell there is no reason to get 5 stars on any map, you get the same rewards for merely completing it. Of course, even completing a level sloppily can be a big enough accomplishment.\n\nI still recommend this game, it's fun and it has a good price.

I played a free version of this some time ago and it feels like not much has changed. It's a good game, the finished product feels like it could have used a little bit more polish.\n\nYou can compare this to Gunpoint, but while there are similarities this game isn't quite at the same level. Despite being completely text based the story of Gunpoint really pulled me in and had me laughing out loud at times. This may be a personal thing but I can't get pulled in by Deadbolt's story. Perhaps this game is more about gameplay than story though.\n\nRegarding gameplay the devil is in the details. Gunpoint had really subtle things that made the game feel special. The art style, the sound of rain that becomes muffled as you move indoors, the excellent soundtrack, and interesting puzzles with multiple sollutions and approaches. Deadbolt falls a little short in these departments.\n\nThe gunplay is interesting and works well, and the way zombies get their limbs torn off and blood splattered on the walls looks great. Beyond that there isn't much and it gets old quickly. Get the demo first, and if you want more buy the game.","March 28","false","0.6"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grizzly232/recommended/394970/","Grizzly232","Grizzly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grizzly232/","103 products in account","Frustratingly tedious. That's really the main reason I have for not recommending this game. It's just frustratingly tedious.\n\nWhen I heard that there was a Gunpoint/Hotline Miami mashup, I thought that it would be perfect for me straight away. Turns out I was wrong.\n\nDeadbolt is exactly like I said above, essentially a 2D Hotline Miami. It's a lot like Gunpoint too. 2D, side scrolling levels filled with all kinds of enemies that you can take out in different, creative ways. Sounds great. The gun fights are viscerally satisfying, as the game handles blood and dismemberment extremely well. I grabbed a high powered revolver near the beginning of the game and stuck with it throughout the game, blowing heads off and smearing blood all over walls in intense gunfights. The shooting mechanics are tight and responsive.\n\nThe game itself is short. I can imagine one would blitz through the entire thing if the later levels weren't tedious grinds. The levels themselves aren't very consistent. Some are really well designed, but then others end up just being a flat layout of a few rooms in a grid formation.\n\nAs for the actual story, it was interesting enough. You play as a reaper called Deadbolt as you investigate a gang called the "Zombie Kingz", and you find yourself wrapped in a city-wide operation between a load of other gangs.\n\nNow, onto the bad part.\n\nThe frustrating tediousness of Deadbolt is entirely due to its lack of checkpoints. You see, in Hotline Miami, the system was perfect. Each level was split into multiple parts filled with enemies, and once you finished one part, you'd hit a checkpoint and you'd be done with that part of the level, which meant you wouldn't spend too long on the same level. In Deadbolt, however, you get the entire level all at once, with no checkpoints. You die in one shot and have to take on everyone else in the level without taking any damage at all.\n\nThe tediousness comes from having to restart the level. In a game like this, you're meant to die many times and keep restarting and working out a routine. The routine is a small plan you form on how to take out each enemy in the most efficient way. You start the level thinking "Knock on this door, shoot this guy at this time, then grab his gun and shoot this other guy, then close this door to avoid being shot and hide behind this cover at this exact moment to avoid another shot." The routine works, so you keep doing it every time as you begin to learn each enemy's mindset and they become predictable.\n\nThe problem is that Deadbolt will force you to keep killing the same enemies, again, and again, and again. Even if you've nailed it down the science, EVERY time you die, you'll have to kill them all again. Sure, it sounds simple enough, you just keep using the same routine and move onto the next group of enemies, but then you attack the next group of enemies, and they kill you instantly, and then suddenly you're back to the beginning again, killing the first group again.\n\nEventually, killing the same group of enemies in the same way again and again gets boring, after which you start to lose interest, and just wish they'd be dead already so you could move onto the fresh content and stop playing through the same part you've already played. The earlier levels of Deadbolt are alright, as they aren't so densely populated, but as you go on, you can spend a half hour killing the same group of enemies over and over, just to finish ONE level.\n\nThis tediousness pretty much killed the game for me, and left me wishing it would just end. I haven't even unlocked all the weapons, and I couldn't be bothered, because the last 4 hours I spent in this game were just mindnumbingly repetitive and boring.\n\nAlso, I should add that controls are little bit inconsistent. To swap weapons, you've gotta scroll up for your primary, but down for your secondary. But then when you're using a staircase, you press W to go up and W to go down. Just confused me a little bit at first.\n\nFor the smaller, earlier levels, this game really shines. Later on, it's just a pain in the ♥♥♥. As much as I'd like to love Deadbolt, and as much as I'd love to put it in the same category as Superhot, Hotline Miami, Gunpoint and Mark of the Ninja, it just isn't fun to play.\n\nOh, I should also add that the soundtrack is really ♥♥♥♥in' good. Like, really good. Whoever made that soundtrack deserves a raise.","March 27","false","7.9"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/recommended/394970/","explodingbosoms","The Pasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/explodingbosoms/","349 products in account","DEADBOLT\n\nIn a literal criminal underworld, it's you against the world. In a rather novel twist on gang life and the undead mythos, you play as a single entity to push the recently unliving to the afterlife, though there are greater things at play. It's quick action, so all your moves matter...which can be unfortunate in a lot of settings.\n\nAbstract - As said before, you play as a reaper. Just a reaper, not the Grim Reaper, just a reaper. That said, for a reaper, you're frail and easily outnumbered. Guns are your scythe and souls, your harvest. While the game is intensely challenging, a lot of it can be chalked up to AI acting weird, damage being inconsistent, and overall crappy placement of enemies when you get into the heat of things, leading to many a restart.\n\nWho you are - A reaper that is guided by a strange flame and a lotta neat guns. Plus you have connections with Charon, which is pretty cool in its own right.\n\nWhat you do in game - You usher the undead willing to pass on back to the living by planting .32 calibre bullets right between their eyes or eyesockets. There's a story, but a lot of it is hidden behind RNG drops of "cassettes" that you may never actually totally acquire without grinding levels. You earn souls for completing levels and earning achievements, which help get some of the cooler toys that Charon offers in exchange.\n\nGameplay - Honestly? I have to say, the gameplay was less fun, more frustrating. The challenge is real, sure, but a lot of the time it was trying to get the right conditions. Sometimes a bullet doesn't instant kill something upon a headshot. Sometimes you die within the same frame of going into a vent. Sometimes enemy placement is different than the last time things went down. Sometimes enemies will hear you shoot the lightbulb in the floor below, and sometimes they won't. A lot of the game is summed up in "Sometimes it happens". It becomes muuuuuuuuch worse near the end of the game. The ending really does nothing and leaves one unsatisfied with the plot but satisfied that the game is finally over. It's a shame, since the people who have played this game said good things. I only found this to be "Hotline Miami" with a different theme; Story wasn't entirely apparent and required some hunting/grinding in certain situations, gunplay is amazing but the AI change behaviors inconsistently, music is pretty great. No trippy colors though.\n\nI recently started my foray into Hardmode, but I'm not really sure if I want to dive further into the game on a difficulty that'll most likely leave me saltier than brined shrimp.\n\nEnvionment - Like I said, the music is pretty great and the pixel art is impressive. The animations are fluid and well done, despite being pixel art. Even the housings were given a really nice "decrepid" look. Even the backgrounds are amazing.\n\nConclusion - Gotta say, while it's beautifully done, I'd really advise against this game. If you enjoyed Hotline Miami, and really need that frustrating fix, get this game on sale. If not, avoid.","March 25","false","14.2"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","2"

Missed a headshot because the tiny characters have heads probably smaller than 10 pixels\n2. No markup for enemy sight or firing ranges\n3. Zombies can shoot magic bullets that kill you while leaving any zombie between you and the shooter unharmed\n4. Run out of ammo and the character won't pick up normal zombies' pistol because he's afraind of zombie cooties or something\n5. You killed a zombie with a knife - the most stealth weapon in early stages - and the zombies downstairs heard you\nYet the most annoying thing is that whenever you die for whatever reason, no matter how much you've progressed into the level, you have to restart the stage.

I have no problem agreeing with that, although aspects and gameplay which remind me of those two titles result in something somehow lesser than both\n\nOn one side, you've got the murderous challenge of Hotline, but without the speed-- the frantic, unpredictable nature where after a dozen times trying to even survive opening the front door, you button mash into a reptile brain floor-clearing killing spree.\n\nWith the Gunpoint portion of the equation, you'll find some loose aspects of stealth, like shooting out lights and the game's version of cameras zombie heads	 or traversing the building via ventilation or plumbing. That's super, but missing is the interesting jump physic or the choice in progression through the various gadgets.\n\nI've been finding the game tedious. It's difficult, resulting in a lot of level repeats, and since I'm not really finding the gameplay that enjoyable to begin with, this really works against it for me. Victory doesn't really feel rewarding, and the promise of earning enough to purchase another firearm isn't keeping me hooked that same way Risk of Rain did with unlocking each different hero or item. Somehow feels barren as far as that side of the content goes.","March 24","false","1.8"," 3 of 21 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","3","21","0","0"

I don't get any feeling of real options in this game, and the levels seem poorly thought out. There is no real way to tell what the exact objectives are to get 5 stars on a mission, and the weapon prices seem completely arbitrary relative to the value of the weapon, save for perhaps the scythe, which is the only way to effectively win half the missions past the first arc.\n\nThis game needs upgrades, better balancing of gameplay (the Nightcrawler enemies don't even flinch if you shoot them in the face with a combat shotgun, they instantly gun you down, and they have perfect night vision).\n\nI thought this game was going to be really, really good, and in the same vein as Gunpoint, but it feels more like a dull action platformer that could have been done so much better with a little afterthought and tweaking. Buy it if you're bored and it's seriously reduced in price, otherwise don't bother.","March 18","false","5.0"," 4 of 29 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","4","29","0","0"

At first its all well and good, but then you realize that when your body is no longer there when entering a vent things can still kill you. Then levels start getting timed. You save up souls to buy the scythe, the most expensive weapon you can start with only to find out the game doesn't allow for melee in many levels. Then the hit detection goes wonky on enemies and simply trying to open a vent instead of picking up a weapon.  And trying to rapidly open a close a door because making you fight bad detection is a good trap. Icing on the cake being there are levels that are just trial and error, having a room full of murder switches and having to keep redoing the entire slow level with the broken door opening until you figure out which one is the right one. Fun.\n\nThis game's getting away with too much, if you want a clever stealth action game that lets you go at your own pace or play your style, its not this.","March 14","false","6.3"," 40 of 116 people (34%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","34","40","116","3","6"

YOU DONT KNOW THIS GAME! its not here to be a challenge, its not a puzzle, this game is the worst kind of trial and error. foes dont react the same way over replays, this is the kind of game where you will NEED TO CHEASE IT.\nthis game is HOT GARBAGE. sprites are too small and zoomed out so telling what way they are facing in cover is a guessing game, just finished a job where after learning the way to fight 3 new undead types, killing evreything i go to read a document that pauses the game and as soon as im done im shot in the back from a just spawned undead. oh yea "git gud" and im back to the start of the level. that alone is enough for me to want a refund. LETS NOT FORGET THE TINKERER MISSION WHERE YOU GOTTA FINISH THE LEVEL THEN PICK FROM 10 SWITCHES! NO NO NO ♥♥♥♥ YOU DEV! THERE IS NO WAY ROUND IT JUST GOTTA FINISH THE WHOLE ♥♥♥♥ LEVEL THEN TAKE A GUESS BECAUSE OPENING THE DOOR AND SHOOTING DOENST WORK, PICK THE WRONG SWITCH AND ITS OVER! TRY AND SHOOT THE DILLHOLE AND THE ROOM EXPLODES AND YOU CANT BACK AWAY BEACUSE THE DOOR AUTO CLOSES! I JUST GOTTA FINISH THE ♥♥♥♥ING MISSION 10 TIMES BECAUSE THIS GAME SUCKS!\n\nthe games tips are simply useless, it will tell you to use cover, take breaks and play old levels,\n\n1, taking cover, opening doors and picking up stuff is all the same button so i got a tip saying "use cover" after getting shot because i picked up a hammer instead of getting down. if you drop a gun infront of a door, you are ♥♥♥♥ed, you killl a guy with a hammer and it lands near the cover you intend to take, you are ♥♥♥♥ed, try to pick up a gun trap and instead open the door activate the trap and you are ♥♥♥♥ed. THAT IS WHY YOU DONT USE THE SAME BUTTON FOR THIS MANY FUNCTIONS! how do you make a game with no controller support while not using any more then 5 keys at most, hell i  can fix a huge problem right now, MAKE W ACTIVATE COVER! doorways are never near cover, nor are stares and getting down is more a movement then any form of interatction so that solves half my issues, guns and doors are still a hell combo but at least the cover is fixed.\n\n2, "take breaks" is the games way of offhand dismissing angry players as, "playing wrong" when the game fails to function as in puppy guarding undead and half the time the AI will get hung up on doors just like Hotline miami and  you will die because it will at any second snap into kill mode or better yet later there are hidden undead so good luck finishing a map before the game asks you not to get mad, ill never understand why it tells you to give up after only 3 attempts when you respawn soo fast.\n\n3, playing old levels gets you nothing even if you max out the score so playing old levels is useless.\n\nstory has its moments, reading the thoughts of the undead is depressing and cool, getting it all right is awesome but most of the time the game is out to screw with you, jobs go wrong and the restart gets painfull when you finish a hard part, kill the backup and you read "return to your car" only to get shot by more backup off screen as you aproach the car. im not having fun, trying and failing because of glitches, lies and sucker punches dont get covered up because you respawn instantly. if anything it ruins the game when you destroy soo much of a players work over something soo petty and cheap.\n\nCounting the deaths and not explaining what the stars are tied to pisses me off, for all i know i should restart the entire job not just respawn because i cant tell if deaths takes away stars. just lazy, i shouldnt be guessing any of this crap and deaths shouldnt ever be counted in this kind of game. I HATE DEADBOLT\n\nstory is good, graphics are 10/10 but man its just like the chess computer in "The Thing" A "Cheating ♥♥♥♥♥"","March 19","false","19.1"," 3 of 30 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","3","30","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghotil/recommended/394970/","ghotil","Ghotty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghotil/","334 products in account","First off, remember: If you want to ignore this review, watch your time and make sure you dont go over two hours. Refunds exist for a reason.\n\nThe problem with this game is it tries to be multiple games at once, and so it has no identity of its own and cant hold up to any of them. It wants to be like hotline miami, but it is not nearly tight or deep enough for that. It wants to be gunpoint, but it isint smart enough for that.\n\nIts main issue is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design. The idea is a good one, but it just flat out fails. In hotline miami, you cant reload weapons and you can only pick them up, but it works for hotline miami because it forces you to cycle through enemies dropped weapons and be intellegent about it. In DEADBOLT, you can only get weapons from pickups, meaning that there is only one way to go through every mission, and that is the way the develeopers intended. Sprinkling weapon pickups with barely any ammo in them forces you to go down one specific route if you want to do it right.The level design pretends to be like gunpoint, but in actuallity is completely liniar. For instance, the vents that you can ghost though are almost always entirely useless unless they are specifically put there because its your only good option. For instance, most vents would put you in a room with a bunch of bad guys, yet coming out of the vent locks your controls long enough to make it so you cant actually shoot them, no matter how fast you are. The way to kill enemies is to stunlock them. That is just ridiculous. The enemy ai is rarely consistant and is a pain in the ♥♥♥. Why? Because they are zombies. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nNow this might be me being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and nitpicky, and this has nothing to do with gameplay, so if you don't care then feel free to ignore this part.\n\nThe setting and story are absolutely idoitic. I LOVE a game with a good sense of style, but this game simply tries too damn hard. You are apparantly the grim reaper, who, despite the inconsitancy with that im willing to just let it go as a stylistic choice, are killing ♥♥♥♥ing zombies. I love a good zombie game, but why? I get it is going for a cool theme, but the theme is just ridiculous. Your base has to talking to...someone? through a fire, and the dialogue is in a dialogue box that looks like it was a preset they were too lazy to make fit the theme, and the words themself are just silly. While its music is awesome, it all sounds the same and has no distuingishable tracks, Actually it might all be one track playing in the missions, i honestly dont remember anymore and its been about five minutes.\n\nAll in all, it is another example of a game that has no identity of its own and wants to suceed just by combining other games, yet doing neither of them welll.\n\n\n5/10\n\n(At least the visuals are pretty damn nice)","March 14","false","0.8"," 33 of 110 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","33","110","0","3"

I was having so much fun deep in thought, excecuting my cunning plans, patiently progressing without getting too greedy. After all if you aggro too many enemies at once you're in for a bad time.\n\nEverything was going swimmingly until the balance shifted tremendously against the player. Too many enemies and not enough bullets to go around. Only a select few enemies drop firearms for me to reuse and for some reason I can only carry two. I can't refill my ammo at the car, nor can I pick up a different weapon mid level to progress. Throwing a melee weapon magically makes it vanish into the target's body, unable to be reused.\n\nI could probably overlook every single one of these games stacked flaws if just one of them were solved. Combined as they are though, the game doesn't hesitate to stifle your progress with an array of tricks that get cheaper the further you get.\n\nGo ahead and vote this review down though--You'll come to agree with me once you start making a little progress in the game :D","March 14","false","6.2"," 50 of 170 people (29%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","29","50","170","3","25"

Hotline Miami  was one of the games the made this kind of stealth-taction game noticeable, and there have been a few followups like Gunpoint or Not a Hero, but Deadbolt manages to grab all of those games, looks at them and says, "we can do this and make it just as strange!"\n\nYeah. Deadbolt pulls it off, for sure. You have the tactical, wait-and-pounce feel of Gunpoint, but then sometimes you've got to get in there and mash in some faces like in Hotline Miami. It can be both frantic and tactical and the game is more than happy to move at your pace right up until you do something wrong and you end up trapped in a vent and have to face the music. Deadbolt makes you think and it makes you try different tactics. The controls are rather intuitive too, taking me only a few moments to really get into the swing of the game. Allowing you aim control with the mouse works well, and it allows you to do things like throw a hammer at a zombie who's sitting on a rooftop.\n\nIn short, it's a puzzle game with an opened way to complete your missions. There's usually no right or wrong answer, though I have found some missions to really only have one way to complete them. You'll get a few of those, but normally you have a few good choices of where to start.\n\nMy only gripe about the gameplay is that placement of objects and interactive items, such as cover and vents, can be marred when there is a gun sitting next to them. The cover and vent take priority in that case, so it seems there's no way to pick up that sawn-off shotgun if it falls next to air vent. But that's a minor gripe indeed which I can normally forgive because this game otherwise plays great and looks good while I'm playing it.\n\nI need a sense of style and cool to draw me into a game. Whether that's Hotline Miami's grindhouse 80's film style, or the humour of Stanley's Parable, I need a game to stand out before I make any other decision. And Deadbolt's style immediately jumped out at me. Because it's kinda crazy and weird.\n\nDeadbolt's weirdness doesn't come from a over-the-top, hyper violent antics and killing people while wearing a pig mask, nor does it have a deranged bunny(Lord) trying to take over what I believe to be England. Deadbolt goes after the dark, poetic feel like Edgar Allen Poe jumped in bed with Oldboy and then added a teaspoon of Ghost Rider for ribbing. Deadbolt has a trench-coat wearing, questionably moral hero who is, I'm sure, Death or some avatar of Death, and this is helped in due part with the characters.\n\nYou have a bunch of weird-♥♥♥ characters like Charon selling you guns and Zombie drug-dealers trying to blow your bemasked head off. You have a fireplace whose fire talks to you and gives you missions often in poetic free-verse. The mobsters are all zombies and undead monsters, but sometimes those zombies like to wear gold chains or nice suits. You drive an oh-so-sexy 1934 LeBaron to your missions. Deadbolt makes you feel like you really are a contract killer going after the undead, which is so comic-booky and ironic it works.\n\nOf course, the art in this game, being a Hopoo game, is gorgeous. If you're not into pixel art, then there's not too much here for you; however, if you're like me and you enjoy pixel art, then Deadbolt has your back. Hopoo's style is always extremely detailed despite how far back the camera is. You can easily see minute details on characters like a set of buttons on your coat or undead's necktie done up in a windsor knot, and it all animates so very nicely.\n\nI think that Deadbolt can gladly call the Knock-Knock-You're-Dead genre, which I just made up, it's home and it can easily stand with the best of them. And better than that, it can stand out amongst those other games despite borrowing heavily from key components of Gunpoint, Hotline Miami and Not a Hero. With it's dark, slow, evil tone Deadbolt does something a little zany by going more serious.\n","March 28","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a bit frustrating at times when i would die 40+ times in a level, but was a very satisfying experience overall, and a game i'm sure has plenty of replay value for perfectionists who want to clear a room as quickly and efficiently as possible. I personally got about 12 hours out of it beating regular and hard mode, but i'm sure you could get at least 20 if you went for all 5 star ranks.","March 28","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the art and the gameplay mechanics. There is a lot of attention to detail here, from spent shell casings, to shooting through walls/floors/doors with a strong enough caliber, to splinters and debris from the surrounding environment, to destrubtible light sources, on and on... Very well done!\n\nFor me, the only thing that sometimes gets in the way are the aiming controls when changing levels.  The need for accuracy in getting clean headshots is welcome, but at times the point of aim can shift in ways that aren't anticipated immediately after transitioning to a different floor. I don't know what a solution to this may be or if it's even a problem at all... It's a minor nitpick that I'm growing accustomed to as I play the game more.\n\nIf anything, it helps me appreciate the "simple" controls of Hotline Miami and how it's top-down perspective allows it to streamline around an even tighter gameplay design. In contrast, the added verticality that Deadbolt introduces in being a fast-paced side-scroller makes lining up shots a teeny bit more involved.  But that's also what makes it so engrossing :)\n\nWell done Hopoo!","March 30","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gave up figuring out how to connect two stairwells after a while with no luck of finding anything online (The game has only been out a few days afterall). I was real exited to start making my own levels before I realised I didn't know how it worked.\n\nBug/glich fixes\nI noticed on the timed level (I forgot the name) I could carry on I was in a vent when the timer ran out\n\nOverall 9/10\n\nask youself this.\n\nDo you like killing zombies, vampires and/or skeletons?\nDo you own a PC or laptop?\nDo you have £6.99 (or equivelent) to spare?\nDo you like chocolate milk?\n\nIf you answerd yes to questions one, two AND three you could be in luck!\nif you answerd yes to question four then... umm.. get this game anyway\nif you answerd yes to question five you'd be lying.","March 18","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willemdefault/recommended/394970/","willemdefault","Willem Default","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willemdefault/","298 products in account","One of the best 2D action platformers I've played. If you liked Gunpoint, NOT A HERO, or Hotline Miami, then you'll love this.\n\nThe game, for what it is, looks great. The animations are great and smooth. The gameplay works very well; the gunplay is fun and the cover system is similar but not identical to NOT A HERO. The story [which I have not fully completed yet] is similar in depth to Hotline Miami, and the missions progess it well. The sound effects and music are also really well done, and pair nicely with the graphics in creating a cool atmosphere. One particular mission, which is set at a nightclub, is particularly well done and has the badass-ness of John Wick in The Red Circle.\n\nOne thing I will say is that the game is challenging and unforgiving, which I see as a plus but casual players may find frustrating. You will die, and it will start the whole level again. In this regard it is very similar to Hotline Miami, and may leave you raging after you make a stupid mistake during a good run through a level. However, as much as you'll rage, you'll want to come back and complete that mission. "If I can just kill that guy first/If I can just lure that guy to the next floor/If I can just shoot that prick at just the right angle to blow his head off then I can do this!".\n\nOverall, I heartily recommend this game. It's not expensive (£6.99 is a fair price, for sure), and it will give you a lot of enjoyment. Trying to perfect a mission will add to the replayability, as will purchasing different weapons to try a run-through with a different tac. If you think you might like this game, then definitely go for it.","March 18","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It makes it very clear early on where you can and can't stand to be seen by enemies. Playing through it you learn how to manipulate your prey into moving where you want to be able to quickly tear through them. This game just as fun as it is unforgiving. You are not rambo and will die in one shot. The only thing I just couldn't find a use for was cover. I maybe used it three times throught the whole game. But that doesn't mean the enemy wont.\n\nOverall I found this game very enjoyable and a refreshing take on what a stealth game can be. A++ from me! :D","March 18","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have a plan and a steady hand, you can beat any level without dying.\nI've heard it being compared to Gunpoint, which I played, and you can draw some obvious comparisons, such as the fact Deadbolt is 2D, ect, ect, but I wouldn't call it very Gunpoint-y, because you play the two games very differently, and they don't actually FEEL that similar.\nNot so sure about Hotline Miami, from what I've heard there's a live, die, repeat sort of feel to that game, and its the same with this game. But Gunpoint was really weird because I never actually got frustrated? I don't know why, I SHOULD have, purely because the amount of failures I had.\nThere is a plot, but you don't actually have to take note of it. I was having too much fun playing the levels, so I kind of whizzed through the plot, not because it's boring, but because reading the plot and piecing it together is entirely optional. From what I've heard, its got a pretty great plot too!\nAll in all, I'd say you might play through it once or twice, the second time on hard mode, which is about 8 hours of play, not including custom maps, or acheivement hunting.\nI enjoyed it. I'm not really a pro, but I think its quite nice that in Deadbolt, dying isn't actually an obstacle, just a learning experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah its good buy it.","March 23","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only crazy good traits get me to make a review on a game.\n\nFirst of all, this game FEELS good;\nLight stealth mechanics,\nLots of shooting things in the head,\nRequires the use of quick reflexes I haven't experienced in a while.\n\nThe game LOOKS good;\nNice pixel art,\nGreat use of the lighting,\nThe best little details, such as vampires not having reflections,\nWonderful squirting blood.\n\nAnd finally, (here's the part that really sold me on this thing), it SOUNDS fantastic.\nIt's got a really nice... sort of lax soundtrack that acts as a nice contrast to the death and shooting and crap. It's got this really nice feature where the song playing on the level is sort of muffled and quieter, until you get inside of the buildings where your enemies are, which is just a nice touch. In fact, it was at the point where if my favorite song was playing, I'd sneak into the building and kill everyone just to stand there for a bit and enjoy it.\n\n\n\n...If you still aren't sold on it, you're a contract killer style grim reaper.

If theres a speaker on the other side of a door it will sound muffled until its opened.\nVisual\n-2D sidescrolling with a pretty neat-o art style.  Every time you shoot someone pleanty of gore is left behind on the wall that can eventally get gruesome if you kill enemys in the same spot\nGameplay\n- You feel like the Reaper himself (once you learn how the controls work). The skill curve can be deep at first but once you get the hang of it youll be killing undead left and right. Honestly best gameplay Ive seen in years.\nStory\n-This part is weird becuase its almost like a noir mystery but even once you beat the game and find a secret there is still a lot of unanwsered questions. Very intresting to say the least\n\nCan not praise this game enough.

Without spoiling anything at all, I will say that the first and third sections of the game were considerably more fun and engaging than the middle.\n\nThe graphics are obviously not everybody's cup of tea, but in my opinion fit perfectly. The gore looks fantastic in every level, and only in the end game missions did it begin to bug in the slightest.\n\nThere weren't too many crashes, only two happening in my entire time with the game so far.\n\nPacing of the levels, as I said before, was fantastic in the first and third chapters, and got a little rough in chapter 2.\n\nMusic was amazing, and better than Risk of Rain's in my opinion.\n\nGame was fairly short, though, only taking 5 hours for the full game, but hard mode is proving to be an incredible challenge.\n\n\nTL;DR- Game is $10. 5 Hours of gameplay.

Just finished it in 10 hours.\n\nThe good:\n\n- Unique atmosphere of "undead noir". The art, music and writing all hit the right notes.\n- The story is not a letdown like in most games. It starts well, develops well and ends well.\n- The levels don't get repetitive. The devs keep throwing new things into the mix until the end.\n- That sniper level! Worth buying the whole game just for that.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- While most levels allow a wide variety of approaches, a couple of them fall short. In particular, one of the levels has a time limit, and another one can't be beaten with just melee. Both occur about halfway through the game, and thankfully it gets better afterward. Hint: in the timed level you can just wait in the vents until the time runs out.\n- Buying weapons isn't very useful. You'll only get enough money in the entire game to buy two or three good weapons, and some of the coolest ones can't be bought at all, you can only use them in a couple levels where they spawn.\n- Stairway camping is a bit OP. You can quickly aggro some enemies, slip through a stairway, and pick them off with melee as they emerge one by one. Maybe the devs should make it slower, IMO it should be at least as slow as moving through vents.\n- Apparently thrown melee weapons were OP, and the devs fixed it by not allowing you to retrieve them. If you have a knife, you can only throw it once. It's not gamebreaking but it's a bit weird.\n\nOverall, many cheers to Hopoo for making another amazing game! Though the story campaign was quite substantial and challenging, now it feels to me like it's only an introduction to the game's palette. There's even more fun to be had in hard mode and in user-made levels, so that's where I'm heading next :-)","March 20","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In both good and bad ways.\n\nIf you don't think everything through, you won't make any progress, but even if you do, you will still have to die and retry a lot.\n\nAI behaviors are pretty solid, but sometimes they are unpredictible to the point where you find a way to almost complete a level, die, retry doing the exact same sequence but die again much earlier because some bot will do something it didn't do earlier for no apparent reason. This makes the game unnecessarily frustrating, because even when you get the perfect plan, you'll still have to go through 3-4 attempts at doing the exact same thing at the exact same time (sometimes frame-perfect) before it works the way it should.\n\nThe difficulty makes victories feel rewarding, but slightly not enough given the effort going through the most unfair levels. sometimes, i feel more stressed out than victorious after finishing a level.\n\nI still recommend the game, because i never get bored of replaying my favorite levels in which i can feel the tremendous amount of polish that went into them, and the soundtrack that goes with them.\n\nOne last thing, the controls are messy. You WILL die picking up weapons instead of closing doors because both actions are bound to the same button. It's a shame such easily fixed shortcomings stain this overall worthwile game.\n\nIf you're not afraid of rewarding but borderline unfair difficulty, get this game.\nIf you ARE afraid of unfair and punishing deaths, at least get the soundtrack. It's just amazing.","March 29","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the art and the gameplay mechanics. There is a lot of attention to detail here, from spent shell casings, to shooting through walls/floors/doors with a strong enough caliber, to splinters and debris from the surrounding environment, to destrubtible light sources, on and on... Very well done!\n\nFor me, the only thing that sometimes gets in the way are the aiming controls when changing levels.  The need for accuracy in getting clean headshots is welcome, but at times the point of aim can shift in ways that aren't anticipated immediately after transitioning to a different floor. I don't know what a solution to this may be or if it's even a problem at all... It's a minor nitpick that I'm growing accustomed to as I play the game more.\n\nIf anything, it helps me appreciate the "simple" controls of Hotline Miami and how it's top-down perspective allows it to streamline around an even tighter gameplay design. In contrast, the added verticality that Deadbolt introduces in being a fast-paced side-scroller makes lining up shots a teeny bit more involved.  But that's also what makes it so engrossing :)\n\nWell done Hopoo!","March 30","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hopoo has jumped from action and adventure rouge 2-D like to a 2-D stealth assasitnaion game. And it works perfectley.\n\nThe AI, while terrifiyingly hard, act exactley how you'd expect them to. While still tripping you up with strange new ways to find you. A head on assault can work but it works much better to take it slow amd stealthy.\n\nThe weaponrey, while exactley what you'd think it would be always finds a way to surprise making each weapon very unieqe. Plus hit detection is on point, so if you miss you only have yourself to blam.\n\nThe story is excellent, with simple design but added complexity and lots of depth. To add the atmosphere for each level is perfectley set, with lighting, level design and music to give you the right mood. Not to mention the level design is perfect for the hardness and skill it requires. Not to mention, while the pixel art is in some ways simplistic, it is entirley beuatiful.\n\nThe multiple ways to travel around the level are amazing and smooth as well, and just as a bonus there's a hard mode and workshop for those who want to keep going.\n\nIt's an excellent game about stealthy killing and if thats your thing then go buy it. Especially if you like fantasy and a  noir-ish feel.\n\nIt's worth much more than its cheap price.\n\n"I wake up, it's cold. I can feel everything again. I can feel a warmth. I'm not dead? I move twards a seat and fire roars to life. I rember who I am and what I do. The fire place asks if I'm ready to reap the souls of the undead. I agree.

Their first game, Risk of Rain, was a highly addictive and satisfying experience that was only made better with later patches. Needless to say, I was excited seeing their second game, DEADBOLT, hit the Steam's shelves. And oh boy, did they deliver with this one.\n\nIn its essence, DEADBOLT is a challenging 2D side-scrolling stealth-action game. It features beautifully drawn pixel art graphics and animations, MIND-BLOWINGLY stellar soundtrack by Chris Christoudoulou and a noir story setting that oozes style.\n\nIf this review is not the first one you are reading, you most likely already saw DEADBOLT being compared to Hotline Miami by quite a lot of people. And they are not necessarily wrong -- albeit different in perspective (top-down vs. side-scrolling) and aesthetic there's a lot in common to find in these games. Just like Hotline Miami, DEADBOLT will have you planning out your strategy, making split-second decisions whenever your plan goes awry, observing your surroundings and dying... Quite a lot.\n\nDEADBOLT's gameplay is extremely satisfying. Feedback you get from every action looks great, sounds great and feels great, from hurling a hammer at a skeleton or emptying your SMG clip into a beefy zombie bouncer to vanishing into a vent to escape or flank an enemy. Levels are designed in a way that allows you to take different approaches in completing the objectives given and if you're a completionist, you'll find a lot to like here, optimizing every move to get that 5 star rating on a level. This is further complemented by the ability to customize your starting loadout with a primary and secondary weapon. A number of different weapons can be unlocked as you progress in the story in the order of your choice. Overall weapon variety is relatively large and that keeps the gameplay fresh and interesting. Controls are tight and precise, although delay after certain actions (for example switching into a different weapon after getting out of a vent) might throw you off a couple of times until you get used to it.\n\nStory of DEADBOLT is quite original, in which that it mixes noir and undead settings together. It works out pretty well. Dialogue is interesting to read and you can find casette tapes in various levels that add details to the setting. The whole atmosphere of this game, however, is executed like no other, thanks to the soundtrack composed by Chris Christodoulou. The OST of Risk of Rain (also composed by this guy) quickly became one of my favourite game soundtracks of all time and damn me if Chris has not out-done himself this time. Soundtrack is of such high quality and even while combining a variety of genres manages to stay true to the game's setting and overall context. Use of diegetic music was also a very welcome choice. At this point I cannot wait to hear what Chris is coming up with next.\n\nDEADBOLT is a very difficult game to not recommend. It does very little things wrong and does so much right that I believe it deserves a chance if you're considering giving it a try. :)","April 9","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought Deadbolt on a whim and loved it even more,This game is great and challenging and overall superb.\nSoundtrack\n-top notch, not to much but its catchy and the sound desing is great. If theres a speaker on the other side of a door it will sound muffled until its opened.\nVisual\n-2D sidescrolling with a pretty neat-o art style.  Every time you shoot someone pleanty of gore is left behind on the wall that can eventally get gruesome if you kill enemys in the same spot\nGameplay\n- You feel like the Reaper himself (once you learn how the controls work). The skill curve can be deep at first but once you get the hang of it youll be killing undead left and right. Honestly best gameplay Ive seen in years.\nStory\n-This part is weird becuase its almost like a noir mystery but even once you beat the game and find a secret there is still a lot of unanwsered questions. Very intresting to say the least\n\nCan not praise this game enough. Seriously its only 10$ and you can easily spend more hours than dollars on this game so its more than worth the buy even if your low on a budget.\nCant wait for a follow up!","March 31","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hopoo has done it again, along with Chris Christodoulou. This stealth action game is amazing. And with so many was to play it was well worth the 10 dollars! Funnest aspect of this game has to be the planning, silently kill people from the shadows and take your time, or you can go in guns blazing but you better be ready and accurate, cause if you mess up once its a redo for you. Amazing levels also my favorite has to be the  final Dredged Missions. Oh and the soundtrack, ITS AMAZING! Favorite tracks in no order have to be Heynong Man, Proverbial Dust Biters, The Banality of Enternity, and Undead Man Walkin'.

Each weapon is both balanced and strong enough to fit a variety of situations. The way enemies heads\' explode with a succesful headshot truly makes you feel like the Repear alongside the innacurate firing of the enmies that encourages trading fire when in a gunfight.\n-World: The world of Deadbolt is both dark and relaxing with a very clean and still detailed pixelated art style.\n-Its just awesome.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-Depth: Beyond unlocking all the weapons and beating the game once through on normal (and again on hard) there isnt much to the world of Deadbolt. It makes you wish for an in depth \"perks?\" system that would allow us more Repear powers or the like. The same problem persisted with Risk of Rain with few fun relics and repetative gameplay even with different characters after the first few clears.\n-Story: The set up for the story is there and if you make an effort to collect all the tapes you can get a sense for a loose story within this universe. However with such a short main story arch there isnt much depth that can be acheived. I want to dive deeper into who the Repears are and why they do what they do. I came out with a multitude of questions and even after extensive collection I was still disappointed.\n-Replayability: It would be great if the level editor was more expansive or if the game had a new weekly challange or stage or... something! But once you finish your first playthrough \"Hard\" mode is still much too similar.\n\nVerdict:\n-Buy this game, its 10 dollars and if it goes on sale then it really deserves a purchase.\n-Seeing this as Hopoo\'s second major game I would give this an 8.5/10, its everything I expected and not much more. Not that thats a bad thing, because I did expect a killer soundtrack, fun gameplay, and unique art style.\n-I hope that Hopoo continues to produce great games and eventually makes a game that really has an expansive, replayable universe! I will always support their projects because they keep providing the best.","June 1","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
