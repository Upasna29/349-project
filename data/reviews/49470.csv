"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RathaWynter/recommended/49470/","RathaWynter","Ratha Wynter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RathaWynter/","1037 products in account","I've given MTG 2012 quite a few tries, but ultimately cant recommend it. I want to like it, and when it works properly its even kinda fun, but the amount of things wrong with this game are staggering. Poor UI design AND clunky interface, slow animations, automatically progressing turn timers, dumbing down of well understood mechanics, card logic bugs, autotapping/instacast, lack of proper deck building.. Ultimately some of those design choices can be overlooked. And some card logic issues can be forgiven. But the thing that comes back and kicks you in the face time and time again is the fact that the user interface for this game is just garbage.\n\n1: The interface is HORRIBLE. From the main menu design, to the way that cards are displayed in the game. The cards in your hand are nearly too small to read and overlap eachother despite having plenty of room to display. You have to zoom in on nearly every card to read it. You often cant see whats in your hand or on the battlefield due to something obscuring your ability to look at it. Many situations will ask you to make a decision before you've had a chance to either consult your hand or battlefield to figure out how you wish to respond. No key customization either. Mouse controls are pretty terrible too, although its hard to explain why.. everything is just crammed together in such a way that it obscures everything else and makes clicking on things difficult.\n\n2: Deck building: You cant. You start with 60 cards in a deck, and you unlock 20 more cards. These cards get AUTOMATICALLY added to your deck after every time you unlock a card.. meaning that for an optimal deck you have to go and remove them from your deck after each and every game. You also cannot select how many land to put in. the deck builder automatically does that for you. Also, scrolling left/right through the deck of cards to remove them is time consuming and tedious. Cant remember if its 2012 or 2013, but if you are zoomed in on a card while trying to build a deck and go to switch cards, it zooms out and then back in for each and every card rather than just instantly flipping.\n\n3: The turn and phase timers. (this -mainly- applies to multiplayer but to some degree single player too.) The timer is terrible. Yes its important to make timely decisions, but the timer in this game is frustrating. The turns pass automatically unless you pause them, rather than prompting you to pass priority. When you do 'pass' the turn, then theres still a ~4 second countdown that allows your opponent to interact, even when playing with the AI in multiplayer which chooses not to interact. If you are an MTGO player and try to play MTG2012 you will want to scream at how poor the system feels. Its designed to be newbie friendly as best i can tell.. As someone who was once a newbie to the 2012 planeswalker game, i found it frustrating. As someone was has 30+ hours into it, it still is. Sometimes i find that i cant seem to pause the game at the right time, other times i dont realize that its been paused and sit there like an idiot waiting.\n\n4: Interacting with cards at the right times is nearly impossible, its very easy to miss opportunities due to an automatic pass timer rather than a 'finished' prompt as might be found in MTGO. To this day i've never once been able to figure out the proper time to regenerate a creature in MTG 2012. Logically you would regenerate it after it takes damage, does MTGO bring up a prompt and ask you if you'd like to regenerate it during/after combat damage is being assigned? Nope.\n\n5: Triggered effects: Many cards give your entire team triggered effects. Such as any time a creature enters the battlefield, gain one life. Each time this effect triggers, theres a 3-5 second animation that plays. Each time a creature lifelinks, 3-5 second animation. Having 2-3 creatures that get +1/+1 counters each time you gain life, and multiple creature with lifelink, 3-5 second disruption per creature, per lifelink. I've literally had turns against the AI where i walk away for a minute or two at a time while waiting for trigger animations to resolve. I can understand why this kind of system is in place, however this can make a game that should take 15-20 minutes, take well over an hour, sometimes two. Theres no such thing as a fast turn, especially not against the AI.\n\n6: Cards on the field which have enchantments or equipment on it are near impossible to sort through or to target and require pixel perfect accuracy, especially those that are stacked with multiple enchantments. Double that difficulty for cards with flying that bounce up and down as you try to click on the 2-3 pixel wide card just barely sticking out from the side of your other. If you dont get the target right the first time you dont get a second chance when targeting.\n\n7: Selecting the right card in your hand (or from your deck/graveyard when searching) with the mouse can be very tricky. Theres a very narrow window of where the center of the card is Its about 1/3 the card's width. Its incredibly easy to bump the mouse and cast the wrong spell. The deck builder has the same problems. Theres enough room at the bottom of the screen for the cards to be bigger, and to not overlap so significantly. Considering that a click means autocast, you better get it right the first time.\n\n8: Tapping land is done automatically and the auto-tapper can and will screw you. This not being a toggled option for players baffles me. Considering all the issues with the interface though.. maybe this is actually some sort of blessing in disguise. Typically im going to say no, its not.\n\n9: The time between when one game ends and when the next one begins can be fairly lengthy with unnecessarily long pauses and loading screens. When you win or lose a game you are stuck at the 'game over' screen for what seems like 10-15 seconds before it sends you back to the menu. When trying to do the puzzle challenges this was exceptionally infuriating, one accidental click that you cant take back and there goes 30-45 seconds of restarting ontop of all the time you wasted with unskippable animations and such. There is nothing at all in this game that is fluid, fast, or free flowing.\n\n10: The AI. In multiplayer the AI is fairly bad. Playing two headed giant with a friend where the enemy had literal unblockable creatures during a semi-stalemated board, it only attacked with them once or twice. Apparently if you get enough creatures on the board the AI will just stop attacking entirely even when it has the advantage. Having many creatures with two unblockables that could continue to do damage turn after turn and who wouldnt be viable defenders; the AI just sits there turn after turn. Perhaps it simply does not understand unblockable, Or perhaps its incapable of functioning properly in a multiplayer experience or with so many units on the board. As far as i can recall it seemed to be a decent opponent in single player, mostly.\n\n11: Bugs: Bugs that cause the host of a multiplayer game to get disconnected from his own game. Bugs that cause you to be unable to cast spells on your own turn, bugs that break the interface in some regard and cause you to be incapable of continuing your match, bugs that stop you from being able to swap out of and into the game.\n\nCouple all the bugs with the relatively awful UI, the dumbed down 'user friendly' systems, and slow and general clunkiness of the game and honestly the experience feels pretty unsatisfying overall. The only redeeming quality of this game is that its one of only a few modern MTG games that has a single player component to it. And i -believe- its the only modern magic release (2012-2014) that has the arch nemesis game mode, which is actually quite fun.","August 27, 2014","false","32.2"," 48 of 70 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","48","70","4","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/recommended/49470/","verticalcleave","landwhale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/","831 products in account","DotP 2012 is a huge step up from the previous failure "Duel of the Planeswalkers" (2009) which was a terrible direct port from XBL. While much has been fixed from 2009's release, with improved graphics, UI, and controls, DotP 2012 still struggles to properly emulate the actual Magic: The Gathering card game. The devs are so bent on keeping the players from editing their own decks that they purposefully include simplistic and poorly designed decks. Many decks are binary with boring win conditions and are missing their color's most basic traits, with unlocks only adding bigger numbers and not wider options. However, compared to DotP 2013 and 2014, I think overall this has the best decks. Besides the boring deck design, the real problem with the decks is the unlock system: although you only have to unlock 20 cards total and multiple can be unlocked at once, they lock you out of all the best cards. As you get deeper into the campaign, you are basically forced to continue using one deck, backtrack (or play MP) to "grind" to unlock more, or pay to unlock a deck. This problem is most visible in the Revenge campaign, where your opponents have every card unlocked in every duel.\n\nSo what makes DotP 2012 worth picking up? It has the best game modes out of the three numbered releases; Archenemy is great fun because of the wildly powerful effects of the Archenemy's deck, even just with (or against!) AI. With all the expansion decks, 2012 also has the most decks available at 19 total. My favorite are Dark Heavens (B/W angels & tokens) and Ancient Depths (G/U mana ramp & eldrazi). Despite the multiplayer bugs and lag issues, I think this is the best DotP game available and is the best intro to MTG for new players.","August 22, 2013","true","34.4"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/recommended/49470/","Kysimir","Shortlived","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/","202 products in account","A much simpler remake of the older "Magic The Gathering: Online" game.  There's not as much deck customizeability as there was in the first online version of the game, but there's also not any microtransactions or money sink either.  So if you're looking for MTG without the headache of having to purchase & trade your way to an awesome deck (or ten) then this game's going to be everything you're looking for.  If your favorite part was the deck building, then you might not like the way MTG went with this iteration.\n\nIf you've never played MTG (online or physical) then it's a card game that set the standard for card games.  If you like strategic card games and simple math, then this game's perfect for you.  It ramps up pretty quickly, but this iteration of MTG:O does a better version of showing you the ropes than previous versions and/or your buddy would.","January 18, 2014","true","8.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Filled with endless bugs, the creators seem more interested in making profit than releasing a good product.\n\nIf you are only interested in running the campaign, its definitely something I would recommend, however if you are interested in playing your friends stay far away from this version and upgrade to a newer version like 2014 which seems to have been vastly improved over its predecessors.\n\nRandomly the game will simply crash without any explaination. When searching for a reason, you will find an error log full of problems even before the crash, all of which never seem to be addressed even to this day.\n\nThe game is slow, and by slow I mean, I felt my beard growing while waiting for the game to figure out what it was doing. During multiplayer games, it would simply freeze and take actions back, clearly having sync issues. You would repeat the process over and over to no avail, and do something else to find it would either work or the game would have to be quit in order to continue anything else.\n\nMy friends and I had to quit several games in the middle of combat because of these issues, this led to simply getting a newer version.\n\nBecause Magic the Gathering is meant to be played with other people, sadly I cannot recommend this game for the reasons I have previously outlined.","November 26, 2013","false","13.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

It's not as bad as I first thought, and actually became somewhat enjoyable.\n\nI must note some key features that aren't outright stated:\n\n-Biggest problem is the lack ot total deck construction. Instead you are given an extra 30-card sideboard that is specific to each deck. On the bright side, this forces you to try out decks you might not have considered to begin with, and aren't inclined to make the same deck over and over.\n\n-Be wary of the DLCs and other optional junk. Most just unlock stuff you could already earn in-game. In fact, this was a major problem I had -- once unlocked, you cannot re-lock them. I *wanted* to earn my cards at the end of battle, but that was not available to me since they were all already unlocked.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it. For the price of a $10 starter deck of cards, you get a reasonable  digital Magic experience. I actually prefer the 1997 Microprose Magic though. I give this an 8/10","October 3, 2012","true","54.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like trading cards, you'll probably will also like this game. There are different possibilities to play this game, you might try out the campaign, or just try to beat a challenge, you might try to fight against the Archnemesis (with two other ai, or hosted with other players online), You might try to fight against your foes with more versatile decks on the Revenge, or become yourself an archnemesis with shemes to work.\n\nEach part of the game can be either challenging or easy, that depends either on your deck, your playstyle and your balancing. You will gain 20 new cards for each deck you play, but to gain them you have to be victorious agains opponents (yes, you can beat the same "opponent" several times to do so, but allways playing against the same deck probably will bore you off soon).\n\nThe first challenges are pretty much self explanatory and very easy. Others need planing ahead, and very intense knowledge of the game mechanics on Magic: The Gathering (for example that you can use Mana activated powers or others several times in just one combat round).\n\nThe game is fun to play, and it even doesn't get boring after you played the campaign mode. But you'll be needing other people who still play the 2012 Edition of that game to reach the multiplayer achievements. So if you have some friends who also might like to play magic - try to buy several copies of it, and gift it to them... or let them gift it to you.","February 3, 2015","true","86.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now that I think about it, this is the longest-running TCG on the market, and it didn't need a children's cartoon to be successful, and that should say something. It didn't take long for some of my friends to jump on the Magic train when I introduced them to it, and it's always good to have friends to play a TCG with.\n\nSo if you have any interest at all in trading card games, go download the demo.","October 12, 2011","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They do this by buying lots and lots of cardboard cards with pretty pictures of (sometimes scantily clad) women in dramatic poses. There are cards of other fantasy-type things too but nobody cares about them. The winner is usually the nerd with the most expensive cards although there is some minor element of strategy and luck involved.\n\nThe creators of Magic (who may or may not have been sober at the time) once declared that they wanted Magic to become a classic game like Chess. Chess of course is a symmetric game of pure strategy with no element of luck whatsoever and rules that have remain unchanged for hundreds of years. Magic on the other hand is an asymmetric game of luck, ephemeral rules, endless erratas and sore losers who complain about top decking. Given the huge role luck plays in Magic, it has a pedigree more in common with Snakes and Ladders than Chess. Also, Chess doesn't make you buy new pieces every month (unless you really want to).\n\nThe computerised Magic 2012 is really Magic-Lite, offering only a subset of the Magic TCG and serving shamelessly as an enticement to lure unsuspecting nerds into playing Magic Online or the Magic TCG. For fans of the genre it's worth getting in a sale for the occasional Magic fix.","November 9, 2014","true","70.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have never played  Magic before this game and I am starting to really enjoy it.  The game itself is of course simply a computer version of the card game, complete with beautiful high resolution artwork on zoomable cards.  The art style is pervasive throughout the game.  Gameplay is quite complex (which is why I have not attempted the card game)  however the game manages the framework allowing you to focus on strategy, and the single player campaign and challenges start easy and unfold at a nice pace.  I did get all the DLC which has made the game a bit easier right off the bat with more powerful decks and cards available.  However, the need for sound strategy is undiminished.

Здесь не нужно делать моральный выбор и мучиться из-за его последствий. Все построено на чистой стратегии и тактике. Эта компьютерная игра, созданная по мотивам известнейшей настольной карточной игры, основной идеей которой является создание собственной колоды, включающей как отдельных существ, так и всевозможные заклинания, ауры и артефакты. Собранная колода проходит испытание боем, благодаря которым Вы получаете новые карты и можете модифицировать колоду. Очень важным элементом любой колоды является их синергетичность, а проще, способность "работать" вместе, усиливая друг друга. Когда любой начинающий игру в MTG впервые осознает важность этого элемента ему становятся доступны большое количество произвольных стратегий, которые он волен сочетать. Действительно, оппонента можно медленно "обескровить", отбирая жизненные очки на каждом шаге или напасть мгновенно, уничтожая большую часть армии на поле. Можно просто заставлять сбрасывать карты на кладбище. Стратегий уйма. Найти свою, подходящую только Вам, не составит никакого труда. Однако надо иметь в виду, что оппоненты тоже отличаются, и не факт, что с активной мега-колодой на руках можно будет его сразу одолеть (на исход боя оказывают влияние и колода противника с его собственной стратегией ведения боя и начальный набор собственных карт, который определяется случайно и может неприятно удивить).\nMTG — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 - игра не для всех. Но если она зацепит, будьте уверены, избавиться от подобной привязанности Вы уже не сможете и через какое-то время обязательно захотите собрать свою, уже настоящую, а не виртуальную, первую колоду MTG.","May 28, 2012","true","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Здесь не нужно делать моральный выбор и мучиться из-за его последствий. Все построено на чистой стратегии и тактике. Эта компьютерная игра, созданная по мотивам известнейшей настольной карточной игры, основной идеей которой является создание собственной колоды, включающей как отдельных существ, так и всевозможные заклинания, ауры и артефакты. Собранная колода проходит испытание боем, благодаря которым Вы получаете новые карты и можете модифицировать колоду. Очень важным элементом любой колоды является их синергетичность, а проще, способность "работать" вместе, усиливая друг друга. Когда любой начинающий игру в MTG впервые осознает важность этого элемента ему становятся доступны большое количество произвольных стратегий, которые он волен сочетать. Действительно, оппонента можно медленно "обескровить", отбирая жизненные очки на каждом шаге или напасть мгновенно, уничтожая большую часть армии на поле. Можно просто заставлять сбрасывать карты на кладбище. Стратегий уйма. Найти свою, подходящую только Вам, не составит никакого труда. Однако надо иметь в виду, что оппоненты тоже отличаются, и не факт, что с активной мега-колодой на руках можно будет его сразу одолеть (на исход боя оказывают влияние и колода противника с его собственной стратегией ведения боя и начальный набор собственных карт, который определяется случайно и может неприятно удивить).\nMTG — Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 - игра не для всех. Но если она зацепит, будьте уверены, избавиться от подобной привязанности Вы уже не сможете и через какое-то время обязательно захотите собрать свою, уже настоящую, а не виртуальную, первую колоду MTG.","May 28, 2012","true","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the surface it seems intuitive enough because the cards tell you exactly what they do, but once you start playing, the myriad of microscopic details start unraveling and it ends up becoming an exponential learning tree. Not only do the obvious abilities seem overwhelming, but there are so many hidden caveats of what you can play and when you can play them. The game continuously makes me feel like a novice by making me say "I didn't know it worked like that." Things just aren't obvious enough plus the weak tutorial isn't much help.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the impossible puzzles they throw at you with zero explanation on new card usage or expecting you to know how the AI is going to respond to gift card selections. There is one puzzle I still don't get where you block three attackers that get sacrificed before the block occurs, yet the attackers are still blocked? WTF is that?\n\nI seriously don't know how people can play this game in real life with real cards because of the massive amount of minute details that need to be tracked and managed. You seriously have to combine a geekish life of masturbation and blow up dolls with the organization skills of a librarian. Hopefully the computer version has saved some lost souls from that path.\n\nIs it hard? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Is it my type of game? No, but I do like the fact that it feels like a challenging puzzle game and it keeps me on my toes. There's lots of experimentation, but I expect after achieving some level of proficiency, it will be time to move on to the next game.","December 9, 2012","true","126.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You select a pre-made deck to play with, beat AI opponents, and get more cards to add to the deck. The AI is mostly competent (unless, of course, they're your allies), and some of the matches can get pretty challenging.\n\nIn this version, they added the ability to swap out cards you don't like, and that's a huge upgrade from the previous version. Also new are Archenemy games, where one deck uses "schemes" to take on multiple opponents, and these are mostly fun, though often frustrating and too luck-based.\n\nThe music and sound effects are bad. I turned them off.\n\nI think it's worth it for $10. You can get a lot of playtime out of this, and the variety of decks keep the game interesting. If Magic sounds even slightly interesting, give it a try.\n\nThe bonuses in the Special Edition aren't worth it.

Plus, OCTaGoN is free and doesn't restrict you by pre-set rules or anything. You can also play ANY card game you want on there.","April 2, 2012","false","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can have a very steep curve, but once you start collecting all of the planeswalker decks, and find a few you like, the game gets immediately enjoyable. So just try to stick with it.\n\nThis is a very light & direct approach to MTG but it can be as complex and challenging as you wish it to be. I only had a casual interest in MTG when I was younger, but wanted to try it out again as an adult. The problem was I didn't have anyone to play it with. So this was a nice alternative. What ended up happening was I reintroduced my brothers to MTG and now it's something we all love to play. Thanks to this game!","February 10, 2015","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You select a pre-made deck to play with, beat AI opponents, and get more cards to add to the deck. The AI is mostly competent (unless, of course, they're your allies), and some of the matches can get pretty challenging.\n\nIn this version, they added the ability to swap out cards you don't like, and that's a huge upgrade from the previous version. Also new are Archenemy games, where one deck uses "schemes" to take on multiple opponents, and these are mostly fun, though often frustrating and too luck-based.\n\nThe music and sound effects are bad. I turned them off.\n\nI think it's worth it for $10. You can get a lot of playtime out of this, and the variety of decks keep the game interesting. If Magic sounds even slightly interesting, give it a try.\n\nThe bonuses in the Special Edition aren't worth it.

The interface works well, but the main flaw is that you cannot choose which lands to use when you cast a spell. Also, a huge drawback is that you're stuck with the pre-built decks. You can customize them but only by removing cards from them, not by adding any, so you're stuck with the combos chosen by the developers. The online works, but no one is there. If you can find friends to play with, it's great fun though, and there's a 3-player coop story mode that's very fun.","July 26, 2012","true","105.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if my creature is killed it enters the battlefield since it wasn't directly countered, so the effect triggers o.o)\n\nThis game with the gold version is worth around 5 euro imo, max 7 and I bought it for 20 euro.
