I grew up with these two Bubsy gmes. Both are hard but fun time wasters and for their time, very ahead... I can't recommend it. There are two reasons to this.\n\nFirst, they didn't remaaster this or update it or HD it or whatever. You are paying for two emulated versions of the SNES games back in 97. If the want to revive these games and even the series, they will need to actually MAKE them and do something to make them hold up in today's market. Not just emulators. On Snes9x speifically. Which leads me to my second point...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lord_Nightmare/status/677599372788502528\nIf this is to be believed, despite what they said, this isn't even legally using SNES9x. You are paying for literally nothing. If you want these, go ask Nintendo to put them on Virtual Console or something. At least you get the neat Wii U menus to go with it. And you know it will have been legitimately put there.\n\nAs for any other reviews complaining its too hard and unfair, I managed up to level 7 in 20 minutes. Its not unfair, this is just how games were back in the 90s. If you wanted to win, you had to earn your victory. Don't let the difficulty deter you from a pretty solid gaming experience. Though I will admit it has its unfair parts in it.\n\ntl;dr: Do not buy this game. It is not worked on and you're better off with an actual emulator. Save your money where it actually counts and on a game the devs actually did something on. Me, I'm getting me a refund.","December 17, 2015","false","0.4"," 303 of 376 people (81%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","81","303","376","12","22"

Also one of the games that's included on this collection was already available on pc.\n\nnow I'll actually talk about the game. for those who don't know bubsy was supposed to be the next big hero in the platforming video games in competition with mario and sonic and was the mascot for the development company accolade however unlike those 2 he was multi platform. He had 2 games on snes, 2 games on sega genesis, 1 game on pc,1 game on game boy, 1 game on atari jaguar and 1 on the playstation. Im not the only one that's baffled by this game and it's character. All u need to do is look at the user tags and see the word "memes"\n\nThis game is what it is, its a game that contains the games "Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind" and "Bubsy 2"  the main problem everyone seems to have with bubsy two-fur is that it does not improve upon the snes version. IT'S THE EXACT SAME GAME! the devs don't even try to hide this either when the game starts up it's running in a snes emulator. THIS MEANS THE DEVS HAVE MADE NOTHING! if they want people to bring back Bubsy they need to show that they actually care for the character instead of just releasing 2 games that are the exact same as their 90's counterparts. don't waste £3.99 on this game WAIT Im not gonna call it a u know what DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS EMULATION! People are joking about the game but the problem I have with this is that it's raising the public approve rating. It's currently at 77% approval because people are joking about this game being good which IT'S NOT! Back to showing care for ur mascot at least have the decency to remember when  the original game was released. It wasn't released January 1st 1993 it was released October 28th 1993.\n\nIll now tell u wht my main problems are with  this emulation. The biggest problem is definately the controls. Bubsy slips and slides all over the place like he's on an ice rink. Ill give them props on enemy variety aswell as there is literraly anything. The are mother brain things, there are bird cat things, theres water because water was OBVIOUSLY a big probelm in 1993. I can also see why bubsy didnt receive as much attention as mario and sonic. BUBSY IS ANNOYING!  I dread evrytime I die because I need to listen to his F*CKING ANNOYING VOICE EACH TIME! Dont even make bubsy talk, there was no need to make him talk, answer me WHY did u need to make him talk? Bubsy is also probably one ofthe weakest video game chaacters I've ver seen. He dies in one hit.....There are no mushrooms like mario, there are no rings like sonic......He dies in one hit....... if u get hit once ur sent back to the last save point..... WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THAT! U EXPECT US TO GET THROUGH THE WHOLE LEVEL WITHOUT DYING. AND U ONLY HAVE 9 LIVES WHEN THIS CAT'S 9 LIVES ARE UP THATS IT U NEED TO START FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME!\n\nU might think that this is a steal for £3.99 2 games for the price of one sh*tty one but no ur paying for 2 sh*tty games for the price that this game should not be. Im not saying that it dosn't deserve to be on steam because it does it has a few redeeming factors. Due to the high  difficulty of bubsy two-fur it can make the game addicting and may make u want to come back to it. but that wore off on me after 1.8 hours in.\n\nI think this game should stay on steam but maybe wait  until its at about £1. But I'll give them this at least they didn't do a digitalhomicide move and open up their first amateur game (that was sh*t) for £10. It's not the worst game on steam but I don't think that bubsy two-fur is worth the price it's currently at.\n\nPros\n+Addicting\n+Variation in enemies\n\nCons\n-Annoying looping music\n-Slippery controls\n-annoying main character\n-weird enemies\n-way too high a price\n\nFinal verdict: 3/10\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","December 18, 2015","false","7.1"," 41 of 66 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","41","66","3","2"

Both the port, AND the games. The reason I even own this game is because I got it as a joke gift, which says a lot about the actual games.\n\nFirst off, let me explain this "port". It's literally Bubsy 1 and Bubsy 2 lazily slapped onto an emulator, with a price of $5.49. Now that we got that out of the way...\n\nLet's start with the first game!\n\nBubsy is the pinnacle of bad game design. It tries to go fast like a Sonic game, but you immediately end up dying because of running into an enemy you can't even see until it's right in front of you and have half a second to react. Then, the game tries to be like a platformer. The problem is, the game's areas are barely even designed to suit high-speed platforming, which this game seems to aim for. Honestly, I have no clue what this game was aiming for. It's all over the place.\n\nALSO WHEN YOU DIE YOU HAVE TO START AAAALLL OVER.\n\nI gotta hand it to Accolade though, I really like the charm Bubsy packs. Especially with some of his death animations. Not so much what he says. Bubsy's actually pretty annoying.\n\nNow for the second game!\n\nIt's better than the first, that's for sure! Yet, it still suffers from the same lack of good level design and a few of the same flaws the first game had.\n\n\nI've literally only played this game for fifteen minutes and these are my first impressions.\n\n\nIn all honesty, I think the reason people green lighted this port to begin with was a joke. And it's pretty funny.\n\nDie in a fire, Bubsy.

I mean, making a new Bubsy port on steam; I don't see "What could possibly go wrong" with that. Sadly however this port just seems to be "A bridge to short". The first Bubsy game seems to work well enough, though the addition of save states makes it really easy to "Cheese Wheel your way out of Doom". Bubsy 2, however seems to run a bit too fast and is kinda unstable (Seriously, I went into the first level and crashed when I tried to jump). You gotta "Beavery Careful" when porting these kinds of things. I honestly think it's a bit half-baked, missing some of Bubsy's less famous titles such as "Fractured Furry Tales", and the already existing windows port "Super Bubsy". But if you like it then "Hey whatever blows your hair back".\nSeriously though, the best thing to come out of this were the backgrounds and other Bubsy related steam items that I now decorate my profile with.","February 7","true","9.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","62","16","26","13","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/426630/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4205 products in account","While these two games are available on Steam, since we also have the original versions, this review is based on the original Super Nintendo and Steam games.\n\nBubsy Character\n\nWith so many mascot characters coming out back in the day, Bubsy tries to make himself stand out by using a wisecracking, smartass personality.  Unlike the similarly-styled Gex that appeared during the mid 1990s, Bubsy restricts himself to using his comments only at the start of each level.  This makes his attempts at humor more successful because they do not come out feeling as forced as Gex’s comments.\n\nBubsy I\n\nAs for the gameplay, it comes off as a striped-down version of Sonic the Hedgehog.  Bubsy can run quickly making it that the player can cover a lot of ground in a short time.  Additionally, when jumping, he can open his arms in order to glide across large gaps or dodge enemies.  This comes in handy when dealing with dangerous situation.  The problem with the game is that he dies after only one hit.  There is an item that will protects you for a few seconds, but nothing that will stay until needed.  Without anything to protect him, like Sonic with his speed, this will mean that you will get many cheap deaths.  This only way to make it past a stage safely is to tap forward to prevent his speed from kicking.  The one good thing about this is that the game is very generous with lives make it not so bad when dying.  The game is still fun when moving slowly, but it becomes a hassle having to keep his speed down.\n\nBubsy II\n\nRealizing that one-hit kills was a problem, they fix it by making that he needs three hits to die.  Additionally, he can carry items that let me navigate the stages with some safety.  On the surface, this sounds like a good thing.  However, by giving him a safety measure, it makes the game easier.  In fact, it is now too easy.  With so many ways to protect the player, building up lives is no longer a problem.  The game divides itself into two games, one labeled East Wing and one labeled West Wing.  In both cases, I was able to finish the game with over 20 lives on my first try.  Knowing that there are too many things on the player's favor make playing more of a snore than a joy.\n\nOverall\n\nThe first game has enough basic elements for platforming fans to get into, but the second it not worth the effort.  Just be grateful this collection stops before the disastrous 3D game.  There is a reason there was never a fourth game.  It is clear that the series is falling apart from the start.  It would have been better if they included the other versions of the game instead like the Jaguar edition.  If they did, the package might be more worth it.","April 22","false","4.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/426630/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2595 products in account","This is going to be a review of the first Bubsy title. Why? Because the second one is quite frankly terrible. So if you consider getting this, get it for Bubsy 1, and either ignore Bubsy 2 or consider it an extra.\nBubsy is one of those games that seem to have retroactively become "bad". At the time of its release, Bubsy was considered to be an alright, but not an exceptional one. A solid 7/10 if you may. Bubsy 2 did not fare as well with its reviews, with every contemporary review I've seen giving it less than 5/10.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nOne thing that really helped Bubsy was its graphics. Back in 1993, Bubsy was considered to be a really good looking game, with smooth animations, detailed sprites & backgrounds and with a lot of variations to its animations, enemies & environments. This probably helped the game sell better than it really deserved (no different from how it's these days, eh?). These days the game does not look impressive,  but it's still not an unpleasant game to look at, and pushing on to see what the next level will look like, or what the next death animation for Bubsy might be is a big part of the appeal.\nThe music is nothing special, but it's not bad either, and once again, it showcases a good amount of variety. Each world has its own fitting song. The sound effects are a bit on the weak side though. At the start of each level, or when you've died, Bubsy will tell a "funny" joke. This can get really annoying if you're on a challenging level, and die repeatedly.\n\nGameplay\nAt its core, Bubsy is a standard platformer. You can move as fast (or probably faster than) Sonic, and this is actually not a good thing. The levels are not built for speed, so unless you know them by heart, don't move fast. The game does a terrible job at communicating that you should take it a bit slow though, and any first time player is likely to just die repeatedly because they think that speed is the key. The controls can also be a bit slippery, which makes high speed movement even less appealing.\nWhile the level design is nothing special, often leaning towards a bit bad, the level variety is really good. The levels don't just look different, they play different as well, with each world having its own theme.\nIn terms of game length, it's slightly longer than your typical early 90's 2D platformer, clocking in at just under 1h, if you're good at the genre. For people who don't have a lot of platforming experience, it will probably take many hours to beat.\n\nFinal thoughts\nBubsy was an alright game at its release, and it's still an alright game. It's worth checking out for fans of 2D platformers, but everyone else can skip it. Bubsy 2 should be skipped by everyone.\n","April 8","true","0.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

So I'll have to further stress, THINK HARD BEFORE BUYING THIS. >_>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSoooooo apparently someone decided to get the first two Bubsy games on Steam. An odd pick I'd say but it's happened, and they're here for those who want to try it.\n\nAfter having dabbled into it a bit, I can safely say that anyone who's had any sort of "good" history with the 2D Bubsy titles will be pleased to know that the Steam Release is pretty much on par with the originals in terms of overall emulation. I only noticed 1 or 2 minor hiccups but they're nothing that really breaks the quality of these ports. So if anyone has nostalgia for these games, I can definitely recommend this "Two-Fur" for those people.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID, if you're fresh to this series at all then I'd say think hard about if you want to try it or not, and if so then proceed with caution. While these ports are faithful to the original games, said original games are filled to the brim with all sorts of Bad Gameplay & Level Design Decisions. Bubsy 1 in particular also has some very wonky momentum when Bubsy Jumps after running. And also be prepared to die, A LOT, from very cheap level design & enemy placement.\n\nYou've been warned. ;)","December 17, 2015","false","0.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

I know it has a bad reputation for the cheesy puns, high difficulty level and the falling damage. I kind of like the puns, I expect that kind of difficulty from a 90s platformer and I am quite good at the hovering and knowing when to stop in time, so the possibility of falling damage doesn't bother me. I haven't played Bubsy 2 before and I'm not sure I quite get what is going on in the game half the time. The music isn't as good as the first game either.\nI wouldn't know about the second game but the first game definitely has a lot of improvements. The music, sound effects and graphics are that bit smoother. The password system seems to have been removed but the emulator-like interface has a savestate function to make the game slightly less frustrating. The emulator seems very stable and the controller support has worked okay so far.","January 2","true","0.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Love cats, love his cheeky attitude, and the jazzy music. It has all the special feels of a nostalgia trip. If you've not ever played Bubsy before though, prepare for some inherent frustrations, like touching an enemy and you die. Just about anything makes you die actually. Falling in water, falling from heights. Also the graphics aren't the best (but for me that's all just part of its charm as a childhood Nintendo favourite). The enemies are cute as. They're these little brown aliens that blow rasberries at you. Some kick cheese slices. Others throw eggs with their feet. There's a circus level with an ice cream enemy. But it's not really an enemy because you just freeze. There's also some honk honk cars, and a walking piano making banging key sounds. Then you have all the  yarn ball UFOs.\n\nThe whole objective of Bubsy is just to get through the levels before the time runs out (really easy in the first few stages) and collect yarn balls, which make a cute little "pop" sound. Different coloured yarn balls make different sounds.\n\nI've had a few childhood dreams of gliding around like Bubsy over platforms. Also he can run pretty damn fast, just don't expect the level to become visible for the speed you're running, it can also be hard to predict what the hell is happening in the stage. A bit of a flaw of the game, still it's an amusing way to pass the time anyway. The later levels get a bit harder, but the game isn't very long. At least with the emulator you have the benefit of using the save slot function. You may as well use it because you'll be dying a lot and it'll help with any frustrations. ;)","January 11","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Bad Rats is better than this. Hell, freaking anything is better than this.

While running he can  be at the edge of the screen from the left or right and when in the air it almost always locks onto him.\n--The gameplay is atrocious and unfair, and a big turn off is that the game has fall damage. A 2D platformer with Fall damage. This game was supposed to rival Mario and Sonic. Let that sink in for a second.\n--Level design isn't confusing but instead misleading. What you may think is a shortcut is actually a 1 way ticket to the start of the level. Think of Super Mario Bros. 2 (Lost Levels JP) with the fake warp shortcuts that sent you back to world 1.\n--You don't know what is an obstacle or a platform. This is the worst thing out of the bunch\n--CHECK POINTS CAN SPAWN YOU INTO AN ENEMY CAUSING DEATH\n\n(Also check out John's other reviews too, he's pretty cool and as of this review he' doing the Metal Gear series, including the originals on MSX)","December 30, 2015","false","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, a game that purrfectly blends together the best elements of platforming classic greats, from Super Mario World to Sonic the Hedgehog, has finally hit Steam! Despite these games sufferring from floaty controls, an unforgiving field of vision, & arguably cheap one hit deaths, the game greatly makes up for these flaws by giving us creative enviroments to explore, top of the line retro 16-bit style graphics, & an unmatched audio experience that will have you jamming out to some of the catchiest tunes in video game history. It even has giraffes wearing sneakers & sunglasses! It just doesn't get better then that people!\n\nI hope this release is a sign we'll see the developers tap into Bubsy's true potential. He's a very appealing (& marketable) character & it'd be great to see him featured in other media, like comic books or even maybe a Saturday morning cartoon. I suppose the real question is, where do you take Bubsy from here? A fairy tale themed game perhaps? Maybe even bring him to the next generation by putting him in some sort of 3D title?

It is a joke how usntable it is. I can't even play for a bit of time without crashing. I got it at 50% and the devs aren't asking for much but if you are going to port a classic game at least do it right and put some effort into it. Here is my experience for the short time I tried playing it.\n\nI had to re-map my controller each time I wanted to play for both 1 &2.\nI launc the first game die a few times but on my 3rd death game crashed. I had to restart so I did play a little more and it crashed on the second death.\nSwitched to Busby two, no crashes so far played into the middle of hamlet, found the first bonus level played it and upon returning to the level I was in CRASH! but not just any kind, the sound crashed with the game. It was awful.\n\nTHat brings another point, the game will hitch and hang when you play levels the music often stuttering my PC is able to run SNES games just fine so I don't see how the devs could ♥♥♥♥ this one up so much.\n\nSadly I can't reccomend this and glad I boughht it at discounted price.

Not amazing, but all right. The level design is built in such a way where each level has multiple ways to get from the beginning to the end, oftentimes with ways to avoid most enemies pretty easily (once you've found these alternate paths, that is. Some are hard to find). Its also pretty easy to speed through levels the way its made. You can find a lot of these alternate paths on accident just by running and jumping as fast as you can to get to the end of the level. You run at Sonic level speeds in this game, and I like that.\n\nThe music is catchy, but you hear too much of the same music for too long. Bubsy himself is a fun character though, from the poses he makes to the pop culture quotes and puns he makes at the beginning of each level.\n\nPeople like to complain about the game having falling damage, but the thing is is that to avoid falling damage all you have to do is glide. And gliding is encouraged since it slows down how quickly you fall, allowing you to get farther while in the air, which is extremely useful when you're trying to fly over levels from higher points in them.\n\nIs it perfect? No. My biggest qualm with it is that getting touched kills you. Its unbelievably unforgiving, and considering  you don't have a whole  lot of screen to see enemies and obstacles as you move, this can be an issue. Thankfully, because this game runs in an emulator,  you have save states, so this helps alleviate said problems.\n\nAs for Bubsy 2....Its terrible. It fixed Bubsy's biggest problem (the 1 touch death thing) since you can actually touch enemies in it without immediately dying, but the music and level design took a nosedive as a result.","February 7","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I used to be able to play the first game fine using either a PS3 or 360 controller, now none of them work even if I reinstall the game. Also, the function keys for quick loading do absolutely nothing.\n\nAs it is, the first Bubsy is a classic and the eponymous character really does stand out as a great character design. The game however is poorly balanced, unfair and at times completely  unwieldy. It tries real hard to be like the classic Sonic games, but what you get is a Sonic-wannabe who dies from fall damage and running into walls too fast.\n\nThere are some very cool ideas for stages and gimmicks, such as the multi-part desert/train stages and the black shirt power-up - but no matter how good they are, the assets are recycled ad-nauseum and get repetitive real fast.\n\nThe sequel, Bubsy 2, fixes some of the problems from Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind - you no longer instantly die from taking any sort of hit and the enemy designs and stages are much better and much more varied with added gimmicks like shooter segments and mini games. You also have a choice in which order you want to tackle the stages which certainly makes the game less punishing in the long term. The game does suffer from inconsistent frame rates however can be really sluggish but I can't tell if it's due to poor emulation or if this was really what the original was like.\n\nEither way, it’s Bubsy and if you’re here looking to buy, then you’re probably either getting it out of pure nostalgia - in which case this review won’t matter - or you’re a glutton for punishment like me. But with all of the technical issues of this port, I can’t recommend it for either of those groups at this time. It’s one thing to be schooled by old-school Nintendo-hard games, and another thing entirely to get stuck trying to find workarounds for controls that are completely broken.\n\nJoy2Key does work but can be a pain to set up.","January 26","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't like bubsy, [don't bother, use an emulator. It's free and better (because cheats).] I also want to give credit to retroism for making their own emluator and not stealling it from retroarch. [Update! I have found out that it uses the code from an snes emulator, but i don't know if it's stole. Please comment down below so i can make up my mind on this.] Not a bad job, retroism, however please try to make a new bubsy game and not using an emulator to put the first 2 bubsy games on steam.","December 27, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
