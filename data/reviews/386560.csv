I didn’t find anything. There were tons of space shooters, sure, but Tyrian had a great customization system, and over a decade later I couldn’t find a game that compared, much less improved on it. Turns out Psycho Starship Rampage is the game I was looking for.\n\nPSR is a customization-heavy rogue-like game built on the skeleton of a standard space shooter. Gameplay is divided into two parts. Stages are pretty standard shooter levels with waves of enemies, terrain hazards, and a final boss. But, after each one, you go into “hyperspace” where you can use parts picked up in the prior level to customize almost every aspect of your ship. Thus the game cycles between design and battle until your eventual demise.\n\nWhat makes PSR special is the ship customization. This isn’t merely a matter of selecting weapons or some such—PSR gives you the ability to design a ship from the ground up. You build the body of your ship of basic geometric blocks and give it functionality by installing devices on them. You decide the number, location, and type of engines, power generators, batteries, repair units, and weapons. You have control over the precise angle of guns and, in a very clever feature, over key bindings of individual components, meaning that you can map weapons systems to keys in whatever combinations you like. Your customization is only limited by what you pick up in the levels: technologies are rolled like RPG weapons, meaning that even two lvl 1 blaster patterns won’t be identical. Upgrades must be paid for with scrap salvaged from your exploded foes.\n\nThis system is the game’s strongest feature. Your design decisions are significant, noticeably altering how your ship plays. The interface is clear and easily learned. And there is opportunity to test your customizations out before embarking on another level—a smart feature I wouldn’t have known to ask for. Designing ships is what I most enjoyed about this game.\n\nThe actual shooter is well-executed, but unremarkable and a bit plain. Enemies are rather abstract looking and all come in the same color. The only other element of a stage is random space debris such as meteors. Backgrounds are nice looking but simple. One noteworthy feature of play is the variety of ways to fight. In addition to projectile weapons, you can install impact weapons (energy spikes) or tractor beams which allow you to bludgeon enemies with debris. (This is the only game I’ve played in this genre where terrain obstacles hurt opponents as much as you.) My only real complaint with play is that in some stages small debris, background elements, and scrap look enough alike that, in the thick of things, it can be hard to tell which is which.\n\nThere is a story mode which honestly I’ve yet to thoroughly explore. (It was not implemented yet for the beta period where most of my play took place.) It’s mechanics are largely the same as those described above, though. Still, I can say that the game’s quirky, somewhat morbid humor, present in both modes, actually succeeds in being good for a laugh. Also, parts of the game’s sound track are quite catchy.\n\nOn the other hand I was a bit bothered by the progression mechanic. In typical rogue-like fashion technologies, including fairly essential ones, are to be unlocked with play. Now, right up-front I should say that I dislike grinding. Having to play many games at a handicap while you unlock everything is my least favorite feature of current rogue-likes. In the beta, this frustration was compounded by extreme difficulty. The most recent release seems to have mostly fixed the problem; there still is the need to run survival mode many times to unlock everything though. Also, the devs are listening, and this makes me hopeful that whatever tweaks are still needed will take place.\n\nAt this point, the only really major complaint I have is that the game involves insufficient documentation. I had to figure many things out by trial and error, and in a few very opaque cases I had to consult the devs for answers.\n\nI really like the core of this game. Building your own ship and blowing things up with it is good fun. There is still room for some polishing and tweaking, but this is a solid implementation of an interesting concept. I’ve been looking for a game like Pscyho Starship Rampage.\n\n[Disclaimer: I received a review copy of this game from the developers.]","September 28, 2015","true","20.4"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","40","44","2","4"

I buy a lot of cheapish games on steam and rarely sink more than an hour into any of them... I played this one through to completion (only took me 5 hours, but they were a very fun 5 hours).  I haven't tried survival mode yet but if that's done right I'll definitely sink more into that.\n\nFrom reading the negative review (someone thinking it's too hard/unfair) it seems that it could take some significantly more than 5 hours to play, but to call any of it unfair is nonsense.  I had a few points where I struggled to beat areas but that's because I'd try to tackle the hardest available levels (relative to your current power) most of the time.  And after all of that later in the game I figured out a significantly better way to change up my ship that made me much more powerful.  Half the game is how you outfit your ship and that part is done well.  The menu for it is a little clunky/a bit of a learning curve to navigate through it fluidly but after the slight learning curve it works great.\n\nIt's well worth the price.  This is only the second game I've bothered to review on steam.\n\nOh.. and the negative review about controls not being customizable is bull.  The customization is simply done part by part in the ship editor (and not some sort of global menu).  A global menu for controls would be too limiting.","September 29, 2015","true","5.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanameth/recommended/386560/","zanameth","Zanameth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanameth/","342 products in account","With Psycho Starship Rampage (PSR for short), you always come back for more!\nI remember when I was first showed the alpha version (long before Steam, that is), and it definitely has come a long way to become what it is now (in a good way).\n\nI'll try to line up what I think is good and what I think is currently missing. Sorry for the long read, that's usually how I shape my reviews.\n\n\nAt the core\nWhat makes PSR special among shooters is the great degree of freedom that is given to you for building your spaceship :\n• Shape it however you like\n• Fill it with anything you like, be it power generators, power storage, weapons, shields, armors, reactors, and so on. The balance between all of these is totally up to you. You can load a ♥♥♥♥-ton of weapons or only a few, focus on shielding the front, the back and/or the sides, and so on.\n• Make yourself comfortable : Assign any keyboard key to any weapon (or group of weapons).\n• Weapons can rotate at any time (assign keys to it).\n• Equipment can be merged to keep the bonuses of each and turn it into a more powerful instrument (bad bonuses are merged too if I recall, so read the result before you confirm!).\n• Construction menu takes a little while to get used to, but once you're get the hang of it, shaping your ship goes pretty fast.\n\nThe possibilities are infinite, and that's the cool part. Get Scrap (the game currency) on each level, and upgrade yourself 'till you're ridiculously badass... if you survive long enough.\n\n\nAnother thing that makes PSR really special is that you can play with up to 4 of your friends on the same ship! By that I mean, there is only one ship but you can distribute the movement and the weapon handling to anyone. So you can have, say, one person controlling the ship, and 3 people handling the weapons. The energy (used by weapons) is obviously shared so this leads to ridiculously fun situations. I remember one evening, we plugged 3 controllers and a keyboard and tried a 4-players session. That was messy, but we had a really good time! Just don't forget to put a ton of energy storage for those trigger-happy friends of yours...\nNote that you only need one copy of the game to play with up to 4 friends on local co-op. This is great when you invite people at your home and want to have some fun, without connecting on 4 Steam accounts and all the stuff. Having a TV to plug the PC output is ideal imo.\n\n\nThe levels, the graphics, the soundtrack\nNeon ships everywhere. It's actually a pretty clever idea, considering the fact that you need to make it look good with any possible shape. The assets look really nice, be it backgrounds or objects.\nIf you're a Steam Card collector, I don't think you'll be dissapointed (esp. if you like space stuff).\nThe soundtrack is great stuff as well, and while it'll definitely depend on the individual, I personally haven't got bored of the soundtrack so far.\n\nNo level is the same, as enemy spawns are random, and generated 'on the fly'.\nAt the end of each level, the boss is also randomly generated, and randomly equipped (weapons, that is). The boss becomes more powerful the longer you drag the fight (rage bar on top), so you have to balance the blows you take and the damage you make. Since the boss always changes, you need to adapt your strategy. Not a really big deal on the lower levels, but at higher levels, the bosses can surprise you... rather quickly.\n\n\nI see a "Rogue-like" tag up there, what about it?\nWhen you start PSR, you only have basic equipments : Cannons, power generators and power storage. When you progress through the game, you permanently unlock more stuff for your next game by doing specific actions (kill X enemies with a certain weapon, reach a certain level, etc). Basically, the more you play, the more things you can do, and the more fun you have. Some unlocks are easy, some others are not.\n\n\nGame modes, campaign?\nPSR has a campaign, and it has a slight FTL feel to it (Faster Than Light). By that I mean, you need to reach a certain point by going from system to system, and bad guys will steadily catch up on you and block some routes. You have to take some risks to grab some unlocks to make your campaign progression easier, but you can't waste too much time either, or the bad guys may catch up. Again, each person will have it his/her way!\nAs for the survival... well, it's like its name suggests. If you want to build the mammoth ship of your dreams, that's the mode you want! I always die because I like to take risks on my ship setup, but that's part of the fun.\n\n\nWhat about the cons?\nIMO there aren't many, but if I had to name a few :\n• No way to change the color of your ship.\n• No way to change the projectile/lasers colors.\n• Could use more game modes. Survival is a ton of fun, but something like a boss rush could work too.\n• Even more weapons! The game has quite a number of them, but you can never have enough.\n\nWell, the game just got released, so I suppose there's plenty of time for stuff to happen.\n\n\nClosing words\nAll in all, I believe PSR wanted to focus on the "freedom of build" to distinguish themselves in the genre. Did they succeed? I personally think that yes, they did a good job at it. You'll never make the same ship twice, and spending time to craft your ship has never been this fun (it's usually the most boring part).\nThere are a lot of subtle game mechanics to discover as well, like how your ship handles damage (I'm staying vague on purpose), repairs itself, how you can boost your weapon damage, and so on. Discovering these to push yourself to the farthest levels is another fun thing to do!\n\nHappy rampage, lads.","September 28, 2015","true","30.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

You essentially manage a modular space ship, which you can upgrade and expand through collecting scrap and various upgrades in levels. Upgrades are everything from ship speed, a multitude of weapons, energy capture, and repairing (I probably forgot one or two, as well). The levels are a top-down bullet-hell shooter. You can become overpowered, if you build your ship right - and get a little lucky. Ship management occurs between levels, and you progress along a path similiar to FTL where you jump through space.\n\nPros:\n+Has an addicing 'one more run' feel that has you trying out different ship abilities\n+Controller support is nice, although it can be clunky until you get used to it\n\nCons:\n-Tutorial could be more in-depth\n-Boss battles are embarrassingly bad - they need to 1)show a boss life meter, 2)be more than a larger enemy that just randomly moves around creating bullet hell, and 3)have some sort of personality or story point associated with it\n\nThis isn't perfect, but it certainly is a fun roguelite that I will be coming back to.\n\n","September 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I will agree with some of the other reviews that some of the bosses do seem gimmicky, particularly the later laser bosses.  These ♥♥♥♥♥uckers give you no debris to hide behind and will just laser beam your ♥♥♥ to hell. I did find a cool item... once, the graviton missile. Sadly it seemed like in the 20 hours I played the flashy cool items were nowhere to be found. In fact the light-bulb collectable that seems to spawn the location of rare items disappeared after the 5th world or so. Not sure this is intended but when I beat the game I was close to 40 worlds visited which is a shame, because I would've really liked to have tried some of the other flashy weapons that are available. Great game if you like spaceship shooters, but could probably use some more polish in future patches.

As you go across the galaxy a wave of enemies trails behind you like in FTL, if the wave catches up you lose. The gameplay is fun but I didn't like how rigid the enemies movement patterns were and started noticing a lot of similarities with the bosses at the end of each level. Some more movement patterns are added on as you go, but I didn't feel like there was a lot of difference. There is local co-op in the game, but be warned, you will not get extra ships. Instead, you and your friends can control different parts of the ship so be ready to ruin some friendships. I liked the graphics and the music was very outerspace-like and fit the game, but the most interesting part of the game is customizing your ship.

I'll go to the good things first.\n\nThe ship customization is ingenious! It gives you all the freedom to create a ship that suits exactly your taste. This includes the shape, weapons, weapon directions, energytanks and so on. You can even assign different keybinds to different parts of the ship. It is easily the best part of the game.\n\nAlso destroying enemies feels great and satisfying. The music fits in the game quite well, though I only liked maybe one song. The songs resemble those annoying chiptune songs too much, but that's just my opinion, I don't count it as a flaw in the game. Graphics are also nice and flashy, kind of what you would expect from a space shooter.\n\nWhile the ship customization is fantastic, along with some smaller things, the rest of the game isn't that tempting.\n\nStarting with permadeath. Yeah you read it right, this game has permadeath, which affects many other things that ultimately lead to an unsatisfying gaming experience. Permadeath happens if the enemy wave reaches your position on the world (star) map. This means that you have about 6 lives, as every time you die, the wave moves closer to your position. This means no free exploring and collecting various items on the map, that you would maybe want.\n\nYou have to keep moving forward towards your goal. But you cannot move towards it too fast, since the levels are too hard compared to your level, so you always have to take the "easy", "medium" or at maximum the "hard" route. This means that you have to zigzag your way through the map. This then leads to a situation where you are only a couple of steps ahead of the permadeath wave at all times (so maybe 2 lives).\n\nThis then affects to your decisions regarding what weapons you'd like to equip. When you've found something that works, you cannot really differ from it, since if you try out a new setup and it doesn't work, you're back to your previous setup with maybe one life remaining. So there goes all the fun of trying out new things. Also you don't get to keep the items and scrap you collected before you died, which means no extra boost after death.\n\nThe enemies and levels are all the same, with the exception of enemy movement and bullet patterns. Every enemy and boss is the exact same red wireframe thing. Bosses have some kind of pattern, but mostly they just shoot masses of bullets everywhere. And yeah, don't expect any difference in the last level or boss either. Playing the levels just get boring halfway into the game. And the ship's acceleration and deceleration are more annoying than good game desing, though it does help with small movements, but I'd rather have none or very tiny values on those.\n\nIt's a damn shame, because the ship customization is so well done here, but the negative things really outweigh the positive. It's just annoying and frustrating most of the time to play this game. There is really nothing memorable outside the ship customization system. But this gives potential for future releases, I have to give it that. A slight thumbs down from me.\n\nPros:\n- Ship customization (10/10)\n- Graphics (8/10)\n- Loot system (9/10)\n\nCons:\n- Permadeath (1/10)\n- Level variety (2/10)\n- Enemy & boss variety (2/10)\n- Difficulty curve & forgiveness (3/10)\n\nFinal Score: (5/10)\n"I suggest to try it out because of the ship customization system, but prepare to be frustrated"","October 19, 2015","false","5.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game starts out feeling well balanced, with most enemies not feeling too bullet spongy, but still providing a good challenge. About halfway through the game, I discovered a beam weapons that made the game far easier. By the end of the game I'd slapped 5 beams onto my ship and was sweeping up and down the screen instanly wiping out anything as soon as it spawned, and occasionally wiping out the entire screen with a black hole for good measure. It was a lot of fun to be massacring the enemies that were previously such a challenge, but it made the last half of the game far too easy. Even the bosses would die in 5 to 10 seconds of sitting under my beams.\n\nThe game randomly generates waves of enemies and debris as you progress through the level, as well as a random boss at the end of each level. After a while I noticed the same waves repeating, and the levels started to feel very repetitive. The bosses are all very similar to one another as well - they all move in roughly the same pattern, with the guns being semi-randomized each time. I was disappointed when I got to the final mission, only to see that the last boss was just another of these generated bosses that died in 5 seconds rather than a climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that the game isn't really a roguelike if that's what you're looking for. The game features the same map from FTL with the fleet slowly advancing on you. When you die, you don't start over, the fleet only advances a little further and you start the level over again.\n\nDespite these flaws, the game feels good to play. The controls are a little floaty, but otherwise solid, and binding different weapons to buttons of your choosing is a core feature of the game. The game's best feature is obviously the complete customization of the ship. You can make it take any shape you want to, and the controls for assembling the ship work well with a controller. Components like generators, guns, and shields can all be bought with the scrap you collect from dead enemies, and placed anywhere on the ship. Guns can even be pointed in any direction to shape your bullet patterns as you please. It's offers a huge amount of customization without being overwhelmingly complex like other games that have attempted to put in similar features.\n\nGraphically the game looks good, though not amazing. The art style is unique, bright, and makes it easy to see where everything except small bullets are. The bright red enemies are easy to keep track of, but this also makes it nearly impossible to tell enemies apart from one another and prioritize targets accordingly - until you have beam cannons that is, and just annihilate everything on screen.\n\nThe loot uses Diablo style system with affixes and randomized stats, though most loot you find up until the endgame is useful. The UI for collecting loot is bad, however. As you go through the level you picking up loot boxes. At the end of the level, you get to choose from one of two items from each box. The problem is that the screen doesn't show you the stats for any of the items as you are choosing between the two, so you can't tell if either of the choices is an upgrade or not. You also can only see the current item in the list, not the rest of them. You might end up choosing a generator instead of a cannon, and hoping for another cannon to appear, only to find 2 more generators and no cannons - something you wouldn't have done if you were able to see all the choices rather than being forced to go through one by one.\n\nDespite it's flaws, I found the game to be a lot of fun, and I'll probably go back for a second playthrough at some point. There are no difficulty settings, however, which restricts the replay value of the game once you've nailed down the boss patterns and more or less memorized all of the spawn waves. Whether the game is worth your time at it's current price depends on you, but if you find it on sale, I'd highly reccommend picking it up immediately, as I very much enjoyed the time I spent on it.","October 2, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(see Reassembly and BossConstructor if you like that as much as I do)\n\nThe ship building part is brilliant (editor is even pretty usable on controller!) and it's also a pretty decent and hard arcade shooter, but there are too few enemy types and patterns. I wish enemies were randomly generated (or at least modified) and used the same damage model as the player ship giving more replayability and fun.\n\nOne noteworthy thing is the strange local co-op - you have one ship and you can map individual modules to buttons of your choice so multiple players can control different aspects of the same ship. However, game's rouge-like nature and difficulty spikes makes it very difficult to advance to a big enough ship where larger crew would make sense. Actually, it would be amazing to have say 3 players, one piloting and two operating different weapon systems! An option to start with much more resources and/or a way to (re)strore player designs would be nice.\n\nOverall a very interesting game I don't regret buying for the full price. Just be ready to die a lot ;)","October 8, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Won it twice - with subspace cannons and with pierceing missles.\nBad and good thing is - you have only one life. so every jump counts.\nStill if you don`t stay at early stages for too long - it`s not that hard to win.\nWish there`d be more diffrance in bosses thou.","October 8, 2015","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
