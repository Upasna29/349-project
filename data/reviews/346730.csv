Not the best game I've ever played, but it's entertaining and has an EarthBound/MOTHER-like charm to it, and the screenshots don't quite do it justice- its chibi style looked cheap at first glance, but I liked it after a short time in-game. Random end-of-mission drops (although with listed odds, which is nice) seems a bit of a turn-off, but it's not a huge issue. As it's so new, I haven't gotten a chance to try it out with other players yet, but I'm eager for the chance to. So if you're all tired out of seriousness like Call of Duty or Counter-Strike, why not give a go at something... cuter?","November 18, 2015","true","6.1"," 65 of 78 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","65","78","10","2"

Normally, something being described as 'grindy' wouldn't sound all that great, but here it works pretty well. In a similar fashion to a certain Japanese game where you hunt monsters, much of your time on GOCCO will be spent playing then replaying the numerous quests to get that ONE LAST MATERIAL or THOSE FEW MORE COINS you need to build/buy an outfit part, weapon or other material. There's enough action to keep it from getting stale though, even when you're replaying Quest #20 for the fifteenth time to try and find that frickin' Dragon Blood.\n\nQuests can be played either by yourself on Offline mode, which typically grants you an AI teammate to follow and help you out, or Online with up to 4 players. Thankfully, material drops are 'instanced' for each player, so you don't have to worry about that guy with the max level weapon charging through everything and taking all the treasure.\n\nAn assortment of clothes and costumes are available to customise your character with. Military uniforms, t-shirts and shorts, alien outfits, pretty much anything. If you decide that you don't like the look of your character or just want a new hairstyle, you can also edit everything about your appearance at any time when in a lobby except for gender, but with 16 character slots that really shouldn't be an issue at all.\n\nThe weapons are fun to use, looking as bright as the rest of the game and having secondary uses such as charged shots or alternate attack functions. Each of the weapons can be upgraded to deal more damage, or evolved into a new form to add status effects (fire, lightning, poison, etc.) or just beef up the damage even more.\n\nOverall, GOCCO OF WAR is a nice way to kill some time after enduring some of the other offerings Steam has available. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to save up a few hundred thousand more for that shiny new gun...","December 9, 2015","true","41.7"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","39","43","5","3"

Most importantly, the co-op experience is not limited: you and your co-player(s) participate equally in missions and both get all the awards/benefits. The lobby system is also nice in that you can team up with random people in a griefless and completely optional manner.\n\nThe game is beginner/casual player friendly, but the difficulty level can be adjusted to be more challenging, There is also lots to do: shoot up monsters, complete mission objectives, collect and upgrade weapons and gather cute outfits. So far, there are 20 maps, but there is promise of more.\n\nLastly, the visuals are completely adorable and you can customize your character at any time with a multitude of appearance/clothing options available. I would definitely recommend trying this cute little game out and giving it a chance to grow into something more, perhaps. It is awesome when your co-op gaming is not bound by arbitrary limits.\n","November 28, 2015","true","78.8"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","33","34","0","0"

All you have to do is to pick up one of several ecological weapons available to you which are powered by air and jump into battle on your own or with friends via the online mode.\n\nGOCCO OF WAR is an action/co-op type of game. First, you have to create your Chibi (Japanese slang to describe a person who is vertically challenged) which is really fun especially when you have a fair few options to choose from. Then you have to decide if you want to play online or offline. Either way, you will end up in a lobby. There you will have Chibis you can talk to and find a little bit more of what to do. Also, you will have 3 stands and a billboard.\n\nTo do a quest, just go to the quest stand. There you will be able to activate one. There are 21 quests available to you in the game but you have beat the quest to get access to the next one. During the quest, you will be able to pick up items and gold. At the craft stand, you can enhance or create other weapons. If you accumulate enough gold during your quest, head straight up to the shop stand where you can purchase more powerful weapons. The billboard is a tool for the online mode where you can join a party of 4 on a quest.\n\nThe combat system is very easy to master and the levels are well designed. This is a really cute, fun game to play by yourself or with your friends. For the control side of the equation, I personally prefer to play with the mouse and keyboard. Nothing wrong with the gamepad by the way but I just think using the mouse and keyboard is better.\nUp to 30 different foes to fight against, some will throw projectiles and some will run towards you from left, right and centre.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Cute graphics\n-	Fun and easy gameplay\n-	Great Chibi customization\n-	Good range of enemies\n-	Offline and Online mode\n-	Achievements and Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Could have been a little more challenging\n\nA truly enjoyable game to play, it is cute, it is fun and it has a lot of chibis!

It allows an "Online" or "Offline" choice for you to play within, playing offline would occasionally allow AI bots to help you during missions while online doesn't due to the fact you can ask people to help you. There are around 20 story quests and 2EX quests, giving it 22 quests in total. Each quest has 3 difficulties--Easy, Medium, and Hard. The game has a good amount of customization for your character and a large range of costumes you can craft. The game has both melee and range weapons, however range weapons would be used most of the time in my opinion. The community is extremely friendly, one of the best I seen, you basically can ask anyone inside the community and they'll help you on quests and such.\nThe game isn't fully done, I have read some of the developers comments and shown that the game will continue to expand with everything. So overall, i'm really looking forward to the future of this game, hoping the community and game will grow much larger.","May 4","true","34.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

Was really easy to set up a lobby and the keys are all rebindable, which some people may appreciate since the initial binds are a bit wonky.\n\nThe game itself looks quite good, not a graphical masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it has it's charm for sure. The gameplay itself is a quite basic 3rd person shooter but it absolutely works and the varied missions are a rather nice touch as well. I don't know how many missions there are in total but they do have replayability since there are different difficulty levels that offer a higher drop chance for some of the more rare materials.\n\nSpeaking of materials, the crafting system that this game offers is also rather basic but functional. There are a lot of items to discover and craft, which is a big plus. Customization is something that this game offers plenty of!\n\nSummary: Great little game to play with your friends (lobbies offer up to 32 slots for players, only 4 people can go on a mission together though). Easy to learn yet fun to play, will also offer a decent amount of gameplay for it's cost. If you do have a few friends interested in the game and some money to spare then do give it a shot!","November 18, 2015","true","11.2"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","0"

This removes the "floaty" feeling the camera normally has.\n\nFor the price, GOCCO OF WAR is absolutely a worthwhile purchase. Fans of Monster Hunter-style games will recognize familiar mechanics such as crafting, questing, and multiplayer lobbies, but the combat has a neat twist with the inclusion of the "Air" resource. "Air" will deplete with attacks or dodges and fill back up after a brief period of doing neither. It's pretty cool and never feels like it gets in your way, even when you run out of it. The game also has "badges" which seem to take the place of equipment buffs, allowing you to make a look without worrying about stats.\n\nPros:\n\nThe aesthetics are solid. The art is cohesive across the game and never feels out of place.\nLots of outfit choices for styling your character.\nDialog is very cute.\nThe user interface is fluid.\nThe devs seem super friendly and active.\nThey did a great job with multiplayer.\nCons:\n\nNot a ton of content (quests, zones) compared to other hunting games. However, for the price, this is totally understandable, and the devs seem to be aware.\nNot a lot of varying music as well. The music included is great, though.\nCrafting is kind of confusing at first since you have multiple pouches, books, and items. It doesn't take too long to figure out, though, and it's much simpler than Monster Hunter's system.\nFrom my brief time, there weren't a lot of folks playing multiplayer. This might be a time zone thing, so I'll keep looking.\nAll in all, if you're looking for a cute, fun grind, I'd say buy it -- especially since the more people playing online, the better!","December 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

As for cost vs. gameplay time, you will definitely get your moneys and more.\n\nThe gameplay is basic, there arent many things you have to memorize which i think is a great thing and wgich keeps the game simple.  The game has an "mmo feel" to it, but is not one.  You are placed into a hub where you can accept quests, craft, and purchase items.  There is no story, you go to an NPC, grab a quest, do said quest, and earn rewards.  And that is it, you can also repeat quests on same or higher difficulties to earn gold.\n\n\n\nCombat gameplay is fun, not the greatest, but is solid.  Although it does feel a bit sluggish, possibly due to the 30fps lock(?), but nonetheless still playable.  Controller is recommended to play this game.  Im a mouse and keyboard person, but the game feels better for controller.\n\n***The keyboard and mouse controls have been updated.  It feels much more smoother now and there is no drag when aiming with the mouse.  I now suggest using the keyboard and mouse for playing instead of controller :) ***\n\n\n\nNow for the good stuff, where I feel the game shines is its character customization.  The crafting system is excellent.  With the materials you have gathered you can discover and make new outfits, head, body, and legs.  Also, you can upgrade your weapons and make them more powerful.  Lastly you can earn things called badges which give you stats, as far as i can tell the stats are random so there is much fun in trying to find the perfect one.\n\nDownside which may be a turnoff for some is the "air" mechanic.  Shooting/slashing and doging use up air, so think of it as ammo and stamina combined.  As you drain your air meter you either have to let it recharge by not shooting or dodging for a few seconds or pick up air orbs.  But there are badges which give you increased air and air recovery so this mechanic is a little less frustrating.\n\n\n\nAnother turn off to some is that quests have a time limit, currently at 15 minutes. Now i hate time limits myself, the feeling of being pushed is not fun, but in this game it is bearable...and doable.  You do get a bit of time back by clearing monsters out in a given area.  If it werent for the other good things this game offers this would have been a deal breaker for me, so do keep this in mind.\n\n***this has been updated, the devs have added about 10-15 minutes to all missions.  The quests are much more bearable now for solo play and hard mode solo play***\n\n\n\nAnd last downside is there is no local co-op.  Only one person can play at a computer, but is multiplayer capable by joining online game rooms and joining up with others to complete quests.\n\nOverall this game is excellent and one of a kind.  If you have an interest in this game, dont hesitate to buy it, you wont regret it.  I hope my review is thorough and helps you decide if you want to buy the game or not :)","November 19, 2015","true","33.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I was right on both thoughts. The game is truly adorable and very fun to play but the amount of content it has is fairly limited. In my 8.5 hours of gameplay, I haven't finished it yet, but, If you rush through the quests on the easiest difficulty, you will have it completed in less than 8 hours, If you take your time and just play casually, you can make the fun last longer and longer. To my knowledge, there are only 18 quests and, as of this post, I just recently completed Quest 12. The game is about grinding to get outfits and weapons, but the grind isn't tormenting like many games.\n\nThe only real downfall this game holds is its very small community. It is rare to ever see a public server on the server list which seems to discourage people from playing online. This game seems to be a game you play with a group of friends, or solo, rather than meeting friends on it. If you choose to make a server, it is likely that a few people will join, but it might not be a lot. I do not know too much about the community so it could be more active than I am seeing. When I joined a few servers in January, I had no idea what I was doing but the community I met was very helpful; I never once met a troll. (I could just be lucky.)\n\nIn my opinion, $20 is a stretch to spend on this game, but, if you want a very casual game, this is the game for you, though it can get hectic at times. I impulse bought this game but I do not regret it. There is  a demo you can try out if you're skeptical, it will teach you the basics and show what the game is like. If you're considering this game, try the demo first.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. I will update this review when I play it more. Hope this helps.\n\nEdit: I am, currently, at 11.1 hours into the game, and I finally beat the final quest. There are 20 quests in the game but each are fairly unique, despite most using the same level layouts(never the same). I liked the game storyline, it was cute. Despite my completing the game, I only played on Easy Mode, which is the easiest of the three difficulties. There are also items called badges for stat benefits, but I never used any. I also never enhanced my weapons, but it is possible to do so. There is so much of the game that I have not yet experienced.\n\nI still recommend this game to anyone who may be interested.\n\nEdit2: I am, currently, at 16.7 hours into the game and I found the community! My problem with finding people playing was mostly because I was playing at around midnight, EST, when most people are in various timezones around the world. The people I met were friendly, helpful, and all around fun to talk to. There is a community, albeit a fairly small one, and the developers often pop into the game to talk with their players to get personal, chibi to chibi, feedback about the game.\n\nThough I am 16.7 hours into the game, I am still learning a lot with each passing minute. This game is far beyond worth it to purchase at its price and I expect great things for it based on what I have seen.","February 25","true","23.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And people here are friendly. I still remember when I search for this game, the article wrote, "This is the first game I never see people say F-words."\nAlso it has no exp stuffs make you want to level up or get higher stuffs. Nope, it won't makes you want to play the game like as working.\n\n\nTherefore, it still has many bugs can be fixed. Such as crash, sometimes get unknown errors and when I touch the board and then game crashed.\nIt's a little hard to control even if I edit all stuffs as personal settings. And even if I'm in 60FPS, still feel not enough, it could be higher I think?(Sorry I don't know such stuffs but just feel like "lag" while playing.)\nThe speed of walking/running really slow even if I use roll way to forward. I think the speed could be changed to be higher!\nSome textures look weird. I don't know how to explain. Such as if I go to a place, then there will have some stuffs include players get hided. And it makes me think nobody or nothing there.\nAnd the distance of shooting seems needs improvement. I'm not sure if it is the game setting which has already decided earlier. Sometimes when I can see the monsters in my screen, after shooting but they didn't get damage and I have to go near the monsters to shoot them.\nNetwork issues, it has no problem on playing with my friends. But sometimes don't know why, and it just get someone or I disconnected from the room suddenly. But you know we don't have problem on playing, such as high delaying or stuck.\nIt may not happen too many times, but it could be improved.\nLanguage, I hope we could have Traditional Chinese in the game. Even if we have Simplified Chinese already. But I personal can't accept some difference of those words. I can understand the meaning, but I still prefer our own words to explain that. I don't mind to offer my ability to help this if develop team willing to make Traditional Chinese then.\n\nAnyway, this is a nice game. It can be better a lot. And you should play it if you're really want to be relaxed from something and enjoy coop stuffs with your friends. This will be one of best choice to play this.","May 15","true","28.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

All attacks are powered by air which can regenerate fairly quickly or be picked up in capsules around the level. The controls are simple and easy. The shooting isn't crazy intense, but that's good. It's casual.\nMusic: nothing I would listen to outside the game, but it works in the environments it's intended for and conveys the right moods.\nStory: the setting is a themepark for kiddos to run around in programmed stories and encounters to shoot holographic enemies with air-powered weapons. With that being said there are some darker undertones and humor that you may find amusing. I know I did.\n\nPersonally I recommend the game, although there aren't very many people online at any one time.

The goal of the game is all about grinding, you have to get new weapons, upgrades, new materials, and most importantly, clothes. There's a huge amount of cosmetics you can get, around 200+. The grinding isn't boring though, because it's challenging. The game is a lot harder then it looks. Fun gameplay, cute characters and visuals, enough to do to keep you satisfied for a long time. If you're an achievement hunter like me, you will spend many hours in this game.  The only downside it has is that there could be more quests, and maybe more info on badges and on how to upgrade stuff. The music could be more varied too. No other downside except for that, this would make a great mmorpg too. 9.5/10, one of my new favourites.","January 25","true","22.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can vouch that the multiplayer is great... if you can find people to play with (I for one plan to buy gift copies for friends).\n\nThe game features cute chibi like characters, and various monsters to fight in various missions. From symple "Defeat the boss", "Rescue the NPCs" or "Defend this object", each mission alone doesn't give an entirely unique gameplay element, but those are standard in your ordinary RPG genre.\n\nAfter playing the game for about 4 hours, I noticed the missions are not exactly randomly generated. Each mission re-uses the same landscape with different obstacles placed around, to try to give the game a fresh feel between different missions. For some people, this may detract them from such a game, but this simple setup should not discourage you from trying the game.\n\nWeapons are standard. You can upgrade the weapons in a straightforward path, and they only change when using specific items to upgrade them with.\n\nThere are more clothing options than initially shown to you in the character creator. Other clothes are obtained by either buying them at the shop, or from synthesizing various items you obtain from completing quests.\n\nAs far as I am aware, the main items of the game that affect your stats are weapons, and badges. You obtain badges from either the shop, or from completing missions. The harder completed mission, the more likely you get a higher ranked badge.\n\nFrom a guy that just recently quit Mabinogi, I can highly recommend this game. The toon styled scenery, chibi characters, and japanese theme song almost hit me at home, as something else to burn time into.\n\nand hey, no microtransactions.

Enemies are repetitive, none of them are hard to kill. The only enemies that pose any threat are the machine gun enemies who fire almost constantly at you. Bosses are just bullet sponges and don't do anything special. The biggest issue is that there is no PVP at all.

The framerate is low (locked at 30fps, and I know I can get 60+ on ANY other game), the controls are very clunky on both keyboard and controller, and the game is unnecessarily difficult due to a combo of bad controls and steep difficulty curve. These all contribute to a poor experience.\n\nCustomization options were welcome, but a convoluted crafting system makes obtaining cosmetics a chore. Combining two items could give you one of the same items you used to craft, with no added perk. There were only 3-4 people online for both of my 20-30 minute sessions, so not many to show off the few cosmetics I had.\n\nThe English translation is choppy, and the story baffles me. It seems to be a lighthearted kids' game, but in the first level, Satan makes an appearance AND themes such as death, evil in its purest form, and the apocalypse are brought up. IN THE FIRST LEVEL! But I don't think this game is meant to be played for the story, anyway. It is definitely gameplay-centric. So no big deal. But overall, the game is simply not worth its current price.\n\nEDIT: Whoa, the dev responded to my review minutes after me posting. And with that, I realized my original review was a bit too harsh, so I edited it accordingly. It was kinda unfair to judge a game immediately upon its release. I mean, even big companies like Bethesda launch patches directly following release. I figured this was a lazy port of a Japanese game, but now my gut tells me I'm wrong. The developer cares about their game, stating a desire to continually improve the game. And, maybe when the game is a bit more polished, I'll come back, as the concept is promising.
