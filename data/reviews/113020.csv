If you don't mind  feeling the adrenaline pumping to your brains the first few missions you're given, you'll find that Monaco: what's yours is mine is much deeper than just heists  organized by french pixelized criminals and cheesy french lines randomly tossed by guards emailing their parents about how they finally got a good job (not) chasing you. It's about not dying; it's about cleaning a level, to see how far you can go for a bunch of lousy coins. When you finally avoided all the lasers, the guards, the dogs, the chopper; when you've asserted your domination over the rich and glorious city-state of Monaco, all you got to do now is to play the levels again and again to ultimately clean out Identity without alarming the guards once.\n\nAllez mon vieux, t'as rien a faire ici!\n\nNow with Zombies, boobytraps and Bazookas:\n\nCERVEAU!","November 25, 2013","true","119.2"," 227 of 254 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","227","254","0","3"

The music is awesome, the play feels great, there's a bunch of variety and it never gets old because every time you play a level again you try doing something different that changes the whole thing?\n\nYeah, me neither. Or at least I didn't until I tried this game.\nThe game revolves around... Well, it differs between levels. Sometimes you're making a heist, sometimes you're rescuing someone, and sometimes you're simply getting the f--k out of there.\n\nThe game is well balanced with multiple characters, each with different pros and cons. One of my personal favorites, the pickpocket, has a little pet monkey that follows him and gets coins for him. See that coin just out of reach because you'd trigger an alarm to get it? Let monkey Hector get it.\nThen there's, say, the cleaner. See a guard blocking your way? He can just sneak up on him and put him to sleep with good ol' clorophorm.\nThen there's a locksmith, that, you guessed it, picks locks, safes, ATMs, everything twice to three times as fast as everyone else.\nThen there's a looko-- you get the point.\n\nThe music also plays a part, mostly because it's 1- Dynamic and 2-Wonderful.\nSeriously, you can just see some of the music in this game by going in this link: http://austinwintory.bandcamp.com/album/monaco-gentlemans-private-collection-bundle\nThis music was made by the same guy who made the music to Journey. And we all know how wonderful that turned out.\n\nThe game also has a full fledged workshop with a level editor that, while awkward at first, has literally every single thing in the actual game. See something in game? You can do it in the editor too. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's the same editor they used to make the levels in the game.\n\nBut don't be fooled by it's cartoonish graphics, because under that pixelated looking exterior, is a whole story full of drama, plot twists, foreshadowing... And you can play the piano. Yes, that's right, you can play on a f--king piano. With friends. There's even an achievement for doing so.\n\nMy point is, what are you doing still reading this? Seriously, this is a huge wall of text. Unless you skipped straight to the end. Either way, stop reading this, and go buy the game. Now. I want more friends to play with me, because, you know.

Thankfully, Monaco is 'not' a mess, but rather, a stealth heist game in which you and up to three other thieves band together to plunder the money of a variety of facilities in and around Monte Carlo, everything ranging from Casinos to Hospitals to High Security Prisons, being represented.\n\nThe game's two virtues are its deceptive level of gameplay depth, and its humorous design aesthetic. It's the personality hidden behind the neon pixels that at first attracts one to this game--the perplexingly simple yet expressive character designs go along with the frantic piano ragtime and silly french NPC voices, to be extremely memorable. You'll laugh as your little colorful lego thief pees in a toilet, wiggles their hands to hack a PC hollywood style, or hugs a wall and takes deep, ragged breaths after being shot--to the accompaniment of bloodied footprints left in their step. And as your little Mr. Pink dies from that one guard who peaks just inside your hiding place to bop you with a wrench, they explode into a neon pink colored skeleton, and the music thuds to an abrupt halt--only for the music to pick up again where it left off, once your fellow criminals put your guts back in (to the sound of hilarious squishing noises).\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's definitely the part that keeps you playing Monaco, long after you're familiar with its pretty pixel face. On the one hand, you can be a sneaky, super subtle player who never gets caught, never trips a trap, never fires a shot. It can at first be a difficult process to do so, as you're forced to learn by trial and error (due to the game's sparse tutorial elements) how to remain undetected.\n\nOn the flip side, however, Monaco, unlike some of its compatriots in the sneak-em-up genre, never trips over the hurdle of forced stealth. You can shoot people down in a bloody Scarface-esque machinegun massacre, lure guards and civilians into side areas off patrol and give them a wrench over the head, 40's femme fatale style, or be a clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, cut the circuit breaker in a particularly well-guarded facility, and just 'camp' the power room subduing guards who come with chloroform, while your (debatably) coordinated teammates do the legwork.\n\nIn fact, if you're in a hurry, it can sometimes be better just to run aggressively past NPCs, dodging from cover to cover to avoid security agent machinegun fire, or to climb in a vent duct to escape angry attack dogs who are onto your scent, rather than trying to outstealth them. And as a result of this flexibility, at first, it seems like Monaco will be trivially easy to play and win.\n\nBut Monaco is a stern teacher, and it knows how to steadily ramp up the difficulty to keep you challenged through around thirty-some different, replayable missions. As you go, new classes and items are introduced to the formula, along with new map features like security-trigger handscans, computer viruses, alarm-triggering ATMs that must be busted open for cash, and more.\n\nThe game is incredibly flexible in its approach, and each class is nuanced enough to be distinct from its brethren. (The one class I am not personally fond of is the Pickpocket, which tends to encourage reckless, self-serving tactics over cooperation, at lower levels of play experience.) However, the classes are not so distinct that they cannot all perform basic functions like opening a safe, or hacking a PC--it's just that some classes do these things more efficiently than others. So there will rarely be a point where you play a mission 'exactly' the same as the last time you played it, as you tackle obstacles in a level best suited to whatever class you are playing at the time.\n\nLastly, there 'is' a story to the game, consisting mostly of text dialogue, but which is filled with humor and an actually relatively intriguing plot, fleshing out the personalities and origins of the thieves you play as. The thieves themselves have some pretty charming tics--the Hacker is constantly making references to PC error codes and computer shorthand terminology, the Gentleman is your 'World's Most Interesting Man', complete with his own little intrigue and espionage plot, the Cleaner is a stoic psychopath who rarely speaks beyond deep heavy breaths, and the Mole has a terse Serbian accent and a Freedom Spoon which he employs with a mixture of bravado and thuggish loyalty.\n\nThe game does suffer from a poor matchmaking system, which is a bit prone to lag and connectivity issues. Also, the menu options are a bit confusing, and there is one bug with using a controller that prevents mouse usage until your machine is restarted--so if you tend to use a controller for some games, like Gauntlet or Dark Souls, but prefer a mouse and keyboard for Monaco, you may run into complications where your mouse doesn't want to work to aim guns til you pull a soft reset on your OS.\n\nAll in all, I give Monaco a thumbs up. There are a lot of visual tweaks that could probably make finding your way in the maps a bit easier, the story could use some accompanying visuals (even if just still scenes), and the tutorial aspects of the game are sorely lacking even after a custom tutorial map was added--but the game just has so much complexity and charm, that it's hard not to pick it up from time to time, if you can get past those hiccups long enough to get into the meat of the game.\n\nGrab it if you don't have it, and see if you can't wrangle some friends into the heist with you on headsets. At worst, it'll make for an amusing weekend of cartoon criminal hijinx.","August 3, 2015","true","019.2"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","49","53","11","2"

Monaco is a game that revolves around a gang of criminals who plan a series of heists to escape from jail, and to escape from the suspicion of the law. Throughout the course of the game, players will choose different and unique character classes (mole, locksmith, cleaner, hacker) who utilize special skills (digging through walls, opening safes, knocking people out, diasbling security systems) and a vast array of thieving tools ranging from shotguns to smokebombs in order to perform heists.\n\nThe game features a unique top-down blueprint perspective that, when a good plan goes through, feels like a scene out of the Oceans 11 series. While the game on single player is enough, it's the multiplayer that truly makes this title worth a purchase. Local Co-op and Online Co-op (these are mutually exclusive in this case) let you have fun with friends and strangers, and friendly strangers around the world.\n\nThat being said though, multiplayer is also one of the biggest caveats of the monaco experience. Servers can be unreliable at times and the leaderboards seldom update or never record scores, if it all. This can create some frustration since a really fun aspect of Monaco is planning routes and heists and seeing how these strategies stack up against other players. While this game is a personal favorite of mine, I recognize that this type of game isn't for everyone. Very often do I see others online who treat this game more like smash tv than splinter cell and the game punishes you heavily for just running in guns a blazin'. so if you're looking for a typical high speed shooter experience, this isn't going to be your thing.\n\ntl;dr This game is about stealing ♥♥♥♥ like nobody even knew they took a ♥♥♥♥.

And a strange tale to tell.\n\nWhen the game came out, I didn't believe in it. I was very interested by the concept, but really put out by the graphisms. You see, I hate this game of "faux retro" graphic style a lot of people use nowdays to surf on the wave of nostalgia, especially when they could totally make games look better using their technology and talent. So the game at first was no more than a missed opportunity to me.\n\nEnter Kotton, a friend of mine, who told me I should really give the game a try. I wasn't convinced. So, as he often does to try to force my hand, he gifted it to me. Game was small, I decided to download it and give it a try.\n\nAnd oh boy, what a gem did I found. Let me get things straight: I WAS WRONG. So very very wrong.\n\nMonaco is an awesome game with a very strong ambiance, the graphic style has its own strange blocky charm. It takes a while to get used to it gameplay-wise, but when you do, it's all smooth sailing.\nThe gameplay is extremly solid. Everything happens for a reason and by knowing how things work, you can make the better of them. There is only a limited amount of RNG.\n\nThe scenario is interesting and to the casual player, Monaco has the big advantage of being extremly funny when things go wrong, turning into a Benny Hill comedy with guards chasing the characters around in a total chaos while the alarms are blaring and everyone tries to scramble for a good hiding spot. To the more result-focused player, the game is also interesting, with a scoring system dependant of both efficiency and speed, a strong speedrunning community, and some pretty challenging maps to boot.\n\nEvery character has its own specificities, meaning multiplayer is always a treat(in good or bad), and allow a great amount of teamplay.\n\nI ended up loving this game so much I gifted it in turn to something else, hoping to share the love, and retablishing balance in the world, as an apology to not believing in it to begin with.\n\nDon't exactly expect a top view shooter though, this is not what Monaco is. Monaco is a pure stealth game, and a solid one at that. It does have some shooting, but to a limited extent, and to be used strategically.\n\nIf you can get it during a sale, you will probably pay it something like 2 euros or so, and at that price, it's pretty much... A steal.","August 20, 2015","true","133.5"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","37","41","8","0"

It's a good game, BUT, play it MP. Find a pal or three and co-op the campaign. Push through to the end of the first one* at least, it's around 18 stages. You'll get new thieves as time goes on, experiment, shake up who uses what if you're stuck. It's a great game in this context. Solo, though, it's kind of a pain in the ♥♥♥ stealth title. I played half of the game alone and it involved more skulking than stealing.\n\nIt's fun! It just requires pals to really bring out the true chaotic underbelly of the game as someone lingers a second too long and suddenly all the guards are rushing towards one corner of the manor and do you help that guy or do you jack everything you can in the meantime and maybe pick up his corpse later? No honor among thieves, you know.\n\nEnjoyed the hell out of it - stopped after campaign #1 because my group finally went "Yeah, that's a good amount."\n\n* There are 4.

That's the first thing to keep in mind throughout this review. For an Indie game, I am suprised as to how polished and nice looking the game is, with no bugs that I have found or are aware of. The soundtrack is fantastic, and is one of the many things that keeps me coming back to this game. Another great thing about it, is that you can just jump into it and have some fun with it. There is not a lot of tutorial needed to know what you are doing in this game. It is more of a stealth game, than a shooter such as Hotline Miami.\n\nAnother point that I want to go over, is the Co-Op mode. Although I do not have a lot of experience with this, from what I remember, it was great fun to see how you can help your friends out with completing a mission as fast as possible. You can look at the game as a casual indie game, but you can also get competitive and try for the leaderboards.\n\nThis game has a lot of depth to it. It does very well at creating atmosphere for the player, and it is a lot of fun to just run around the area to not get spotted. Even though the storyline is a little bit thin, it is not the main selling point of this game. If you want a game that you can just jump in an play with for a good amount of time, and not get bored with it, I highly HIGHLY recommend this title!\n\nSo go, run, get out your wallet and GET THIS GAME NOW!

It takes time to get through them though, time the enemy can pummel or shoot you. Unlike other stealth games, a well planned out escape won't necessarily lead to death if you're clever.\n\nThe difficulty curve is really well done. You're consistently unlocking new content and styles of gameplay with every level, the challenge slowly increasing. If you die, it doesn't feel like such a failure compared to other games because you learn. I actually found it fun to die. While playing co-op, death adds an extra layer of difficulty of: How do I get my teammate back up?\n\nThe in game dialogue is clever and cheeky. There is strong depth of gameplay here. I even like the basic 2d graphics, it feels uncluttered and consistent compared to other games. The smaller and quality nature of the maps make the game forgiving of failure.\n\nThe bad would be finding enough people to play the later levels with, the few co-op games that lag, and dying on the later levels after an arduous journey through four levels.\n\nI highly recommend the game. I give it a solid 8.5.","May 2, 2015","true","209.0"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","32","35","4","0"

It's been around for a year now, so the price is lower than release, and I'm sure you can get it for next to nothing from either a Humble Bundle, or waiting on a Steam sale.\n\nAs you can see from previews, it's a top down sneaking/stealing game. You've got eight characters total, each with their own main ability, and a less noticeable side ability. Example, if going by the preview, the Lookout is the expert at Recon, which means when she's sneaking/stationary, everyone gets red icons on the map indicating where guards/civilians are, even when not in vision.\nHer secondary power is that she opens ladders/vents 3 times as fast as anyone else. The main power of each class is the draw, but often you'll find the secondary power is incredibly useful as well.\n\nThere are a rich amount of stories, though given that this game is a year old now, online co-op can be somewhat hit or miss. There are still players, but you might not be able to get a game every time you look.\nAnother frustration is that later missions become really very difficult for a solo player to beat. It's always completely possible, though sometimes it requires some extra work. This really is a game that benefits from co-op.\n\nAs people have mentioned, getting seen or alerting guards will not be the end of you, and in fact is required sometimes to move guards out of position. That said, later missions in say the 2nd story or the epilogue will punish you quickly for not being stealthy.\n\nFinally, for a small little indie title about pixilated thieves, there is actually a pretty good story being told here. It presents itself as story's being told by one of the thieves in a police interview. As such, the 2nd story is the same heists, but completely changed around, and a step up in difficulty as it's another of the crooks recollection of the tale.\nIt's up to you to puzzle out the whole truth of what really happened here. The reveal comes in the final mission of story two, but it's easy to miss what happened if you aren't expecting it.\n\nI continue to play this game and highly recommend it for the price it is now (15$, and certainly recommend it on sale)","December 3, 2014","true","135.8"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","22","22","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eidolancer/recommended/113020/","eidolancer","Doc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eidolancer/","151 products in account","Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of my favorite games. I just want to start with that. I got this game a couple months ago and I'm hooked. Yeah, it's a little frustrating at times, but only in that sort of "Aargh I'm not quite good enough for this level!" way.\nMonaco is kind of a fun time-waster singleplayer, but where it really shines is multiplayer. It is FANTASTIC, and not just for the sake of completion. It's so much fun to run through the levels, causing chaos, or try to not get spotted at all. Make sure you discuss your plans with other players, but don't be surprised when things fall apart because of an unlucky corner with five guards behind it.\nThe way powers help your friends makes the teamwork element of this game happen so naturally you might not even realize you're doing it at first. The hacker runs through a hallway trailing viruses, and the laser grid in your way just dies. The Mole digs a tunnel, and you escape through it to a nearby shrub. And everyone loves a Lookout. If there's one character who doesn't play well with teams, it's the Pickpocket, whose power is purely self-focused and who tends to hoard all the coins. If everyone's okay with that, by all means, play him. But if you're just browsing for random games online, it's polite to not use the pickpocket.\nThe difficulty wobbles a bit around the start of the second act, but it pretty much goes steadily up from there. And keeps going up. This works to the game's advantage. The difficulty curve gives you enough time to get used to the system, and then slowly works in new elements and characters, and by the time you're dealing with the really hard stuff, you've got at least an idea of what to do. You may not be able to do it on your first try, or even your first ten, but you should be able to understand at least the theory of how the pieces fit together.\nReplay value? The game has incredible replay value. Not only are there eight characters to play through with, but there's an entire community of fan-made maps to play, and once you've done all the main story, there's even a zombie mode for more violent fun! I've already beaten the main story, and I'm working my way through the stunningly difficult final campain, "Fin". I am curious how they might expand the story that I thought was over, but it seems to be a well-written wrap-up.\nThe story is simple, but has a few twists to make it more satisfying. Without spoiling too much, I will say that I would have been satisfied with the game if it had concluded with "Identity". The two (much shorter) extra acts were icing on the cake. It's a pretty standard heist plot, with a little bit of "how we got here" thrown in, betrayals, and other standard tropes of the genre, but it managed to surprise me in places, which made me very happy. It's not often you get to play a mystery from the villain's perspective and still be surprised.\nIf I'm ambivalent about only one aspect, it would be the artstyle. The sprites are charming, but it's really quite difficut to tell who's who at times, and for colorblind players, this would be completely incomprehensible. Everyone looks like squares, including the enemies. The top-down angle limits the perspective, but the backgrounds do not suffer from the same confusion as the characters. They are gorgeous, elaborate, and the way lighting is used is something I've never seen in another stealth game. In some of the levels, I can even look down through the floor to see bits of the lower areas. The music is amazing, but since the levels can be a bit long, it loops a lot. It's by no means grating, and it spreads the clips out with slow, quiet periods, so it doesn't get stuck in your head too often, but it could have used a little variety. I loved the musical cues for when someone got spotted or an objective was completed, though.\nAll in all, a fantastic game, and one that I'd readily recommend to anyone who likes stealth games, co-op games, or mysteries.\nSingleplayer: 3/5. A little tedious, but fun and challenging.\nMultiplayer: 5/5. The game's strongest point. One of the best co-op experiences I've ever had.\nArt: 3/5. The sprites were limited, but the settings were gorgeous.\nSound: 4/5. The music was excellent, and I wish there had been more variety to it. The voices of the characters were delightful, even if I couldn't understand a word of french.\nDifficulty: 4/5. Quite a challenge, but not so difficult you become disenchanted. You learn and get better noticably over time.\nReplay: 5/5. Many levels, community-made maps, and excellent multiplayer. The end is just the beginning.","November 3, 2014","true","51.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xanaset/recommended/113020/","Xanaset","Caketown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xanaset/","225 products in account","Monaco was an interesting concept and was alright for awhile. The problem is, the game provides a co-op function which it then, through its very design, discourages you from using. There is no way to make any permanent progress on any given level. Any deterrent you use to reduce the number of potential threats (even shooting the guards or exploding them) can be reversed by other guards, and murdering everyone on every map is impractical, if not impossible. This means that ultimately, the best way to beat any map is to remain undetected, but remaining undetected is infinitely easier when playing alone, as cooperative matches often just turn into a smash-and-grab chaotic cluster♥♥♥♥.  At the same time, playing the game alone is almost pathetically easy, and feels hollow. In either case, the concept felt a bit unpolished and there was never a sense, at least not for me, that careful planning and slow, steady progress on a level would reward a player (or group of players) with a superior playing experience, so every level just devolved into "Grab what you can, die in a bush, and hope someone survives to revive you."\n\nSuffers from the same problem Dungeon Defenders did, in that it provides cooperative play without an incentive to utilize it (indeed in both cases it was almost a hindrance to bring others into the game).\n\nHad some fun with it though, probably worth checking out if you're not expecting much and you're just looking for a casual experience to share with a few people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though.","June 3, 2013","false","6.9"," 124 of 215 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","124","215","0","0"

The presentation of the game is very well done, as every little detail in the visuals of the game makes sense in some terms of either the mechanics or the story of the game. The art style of the game is something new to almost anyone, and the co-op play in Monaco is some of the best there is in the Steam market. Community maps are also being made daily, so the replay value of this game is also top notch. Quite the hidden gem to be discovered by anyone who enjoys uniqueness and creativeness in both presentation and gameplay.","December 24, 2014","true","36.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

The stealth mechanics manage to fit well with the generally arcadey feel, as the guards aren't super perceptive, so they can be avoided if you're careful (and sometimes if you aren't!). Stealth playthroughs, especially in singleplayer, are satisfying and tense. However, Monaco is just as fun when you don't try to be stealthy, as you can get into crazy and action-filled situations as you're forced to escape oncoming guards after you trip an alarm or get caught. The AI can be punishing, though, and some enemies, such as shotgun toting Gendarme, are not to be taken lightly. Multiplayer tends to lean towards the more wild approach unless you're working in a two-man crew or everyone is trying to stay on the down-low. You're given the pick of (once you unlock all of them) eight thieves, each with their own unique abilities, all of which are useful. This is another reason why the game shines in multiplayer, because each thief can tackle different situations that others would have trouble with. There's also a good number of equipments which provide the player with some tool that can get help them get the job done, like smoke bombs, shotguns, C4, and EMPs. Monaco has a ton of standard campaign levels with unique settings and good variety, and there's also hundreds of user-made levels, some of which are almost as good as the standard ones. The level editor itself is fairly easy to use once you understand the basics, and there are a couple of really extensive guides on the community page which can help get you started. It's also got a sweet noir style piano soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy who made the Journey soundtrack.\n\nNow, all of this comes with, as I see it, one major catch. Monaco is a really old game, as far as indie online co-op games go (it seems). There's a way smaller community base than there was a few years ago, so finding players can be a challenge. Because of this, I'd recommend that you find a friend willing to play with you, or try the local co-op. If neither of those work out for you, try and leave a message on the community board asking for players. From what I've seen, there are some people who would be willing to play.","April 25","true","507.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Every character has their own two special advantages (except for the Redhead, whose second ability is crippled from a lack of other players), and you could complete the campaign from start to finish using any of them. So if the single-player is really good and stands up on its own from the co-op for once, why play co-op? Answer: Four players running around having their perfect plan ruined by a difficult or unexpected triviality, running from the guards and trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of there without screwing everything up further. This is hilarious, and when the players succeed, it's hilarious and a sight to behold.

Well why not this?". I will recommend this game to anyone, and say that it is a game that I should have picked up a lot earlier than I did.\n\nIt is a fun and neat little indie game that can offer hours of gameplay once you get into it. It is very intuitive and can offer a challenge to almost anyone. I have only played it for about 4 hours, and in that time I only beat the first story-line (it was a very relaxed 4 hours, mind you). The game is very addictive once you start, and you will find more and more difficulty in the various levels as you go on.\n\nThe biggest downside to this game is that it can be very hard to find a multiplayer game without at least one dumbass who can and will ruin it for others, but once you do find that one team, you can swoop through the entire game no problem in a short time.\n\nAs for the crew, I found it fun to play more or less each of them, but I did find a few that I favorited over others, due to their playstyle, and I imagine most people will as well.","April 18, 2014","true","6.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","8","10","7","0"

The unique portion is working together as each different player or unit has a specific function. There are 8 different classes to unlock while progressing through the game : the locksmith, the pickpocket, the cleaner, the lookout, the mole, the gentleman, the hacker, the redhead. In order, the locksmith can pick locks a lot faster than anyone, the pickpocket is able to acquire coins from a greater distance and doesn't alert guards or trigger alarms, the cleaner can knock out guards and heal faster, the lookout can see a vast majority of whats going on from great distances, the mole can rip through almost any wall (my favorite characteristic!), the gentleman is able to disguise himself, the hacker can disable alarms and spread viruses into computer systems and finally, the redhead who is able to attract enemies and have them open doors for her while not harming other immediate players. Some of these players come when you first start the game while others have to be unlocked as you progress (nothing wrong with that)! Map designs are also very fluid and challenging. Some parts will seem impossible to get by without a helping hand. There is usually always a way though if you're stuck playing solo.\n\n\nThe unique view setting this game provides is the excitement through it's graphics. Although simple in premise, it's very effective in providing a good game play experience (unless you don't like this sort of thing and are bound to stylish 3D graphics). Sounds are absolutely fantastic and as a French speaking individual, it's greatly appreciated. I'm sure those who do not speak French will start picking up a few things as well. The dialogue is okay (I wish they added a bit more) but for the most part it does a good job keeping you on your toes.\n\n\n\nI would recommend buying it on sale.\n\n\nIndie Rating : 8/10\n\nAs a standalone game rating : 7.2/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nMy friend is hacking while I'm breaking down walls\n\nThere are graphic indicators in game to show where your friends are (notice bottom left)\n\nDon't alert the guard don't alert the guard don't alert the guard\n\nIf you're making holes in the wall, the guards can hear it","July 21, 2014","true","2.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The story is told in conversation snippets before each mission between characters. Visuals are pretty much demonstrated by the screenshots. Design and mechanics are simple, which I like though it may not be to everyone's taste. The characters only have one specific different skill and a hidden secondary skill that makes them all feel different, but not overly so. A nice surprise about the game for me was that I found out a year after owning Monaco that they had updated the maps, providing more/newer content for free with older maps remain playable.\n\nThough single player is good, the multiplayer is what makes it great. Maps get notoriously difficult at later stages and very difficult to beat without help. It can get frustrating, but clearing them also feels incredibly rewarding. Keep in mind however it's rare to see open/public lobbies (from what I've seen), so make sure you have friends to play with. Replay value is high when not going solo.\n\nI would recommend this game for most people, unless you are completely sure it is not your cup of tea.

Now, when I say this game is a "puzzle-ish co-op game", I say that because it's not quite a puzzle game, as it has elements of action to it, but completing each mission can be seen as a "puzzle" of sorts. I'd say it's a stealth game, but it's not entirely that, either: while stealth can make things easier, blitzing through a room and drawing all eyes to you can work occasionally also. The goal of each level is to steal all trophies before exiting via the escape route, with an added side objective of collecting as many coins as you can to get a higher score. The main obstacles in the game are the guards, who, upon seeing you, chase you down and beat you senseless until you either escape their pursuit or die. When the latter happens, you can get revived by your buds, but doing so leaves you vulnerable for a decent amount of time, so caution is necessary. By default, you have no means of combat, leaving avoidance of threats as the best option. However, there are items that allow you to better deal with threats, like smoke bombs, sleeping darts, guns, and explosives (possibly others I may have missed), of which you can have one equipped at a time, and all of which are replenished by collecting the previously mentioned coins throughout the level. In addition to guards, there are other obstacles, though most of them just draw the attention of the guards so they can go about their merciless beatings of your team. To offer a wider array of methods to deal with the various things between you and your loot, the game has a character system in which each character has a special ability unique to them; there is a very nice diversity of character choice, with each character possibly opening up alternative routes to the objectives. For instance, the Hacker can hack into terminals and disable nearby electronics, such as cameras and laser sensors, the Cleaner can knock guards unconscious when behind them, and the Mole can break through (some) walls. The game is certainly a lot less interesting and enjoyable when playing alone, as it's meant to be a co-op game first and foremost. It has a story mode, and I have no strong feelings regarding the story either way, but the levels are very well-done, generally. The game has a built-in level editor and thus aptly is tied to the Steam Workshop, so when you're finished with the campaign, there are plenty of community levels to peruse as well, a fair amount of which are bound to be substantial and enjoyable.\n\nIn short, fantastic little co-op game that's fun, interesting, and worthwhile. I had a blast playing it, and it's probably one of my favorite little indie games (and by "indie", I mean the real definition of indie—that is, self-published and independent of any larger company; sorry, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of that term is killing me) of all time, simply based on how much of a good time I had with it.","March 24","true","12.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Unlike most stealth games though, Monaco expects you to be caught, and gives you tools to deal with a situation. That's not to say finesse isn't important, since you have to earn additional gear usage.\nThe characters have different abilities and each one has a different way of handling the same level, giving great replayability.\nSingle-player and multi-player also have very different methods of approach.\nLike all good games, it starts off simple but becomes quite challenging in the end. Getting all of the gold in a level unlocks mirrored, more difficult versions of the levels.\nThe music is a smooth ragtime piano that changes to fit the action.

No one on drums? Do I REALLY have to do this? Ugh, screw it. To the review!\n\n\n\nMonaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an indie game released last year. It is stealth and puzzle based, with some action elements in it and a whole lot of teamwork. For the most part, I really enjoy the game. Seeing there's so much to say, I'll say it as best as I can, like I say in pretty much all of my reviews.\n\nWe'll start off with, hmm... How about visuals. Y'know what they say, "First is the worst, second is the best, third is the one with the (Treasure, hairy, etc) chest." So, like that said, "First is the worst." Allthough, the graphics aren't all that bad. They just don't compare to the greatness of the rest of the game. It has the retro feel to it. Kinda stale, as lots of indie games do that, but I've seen worse.\n\nSo, second is the best. I give the gameplay the "2nd is the best" award. The gameplay is so, open. You can choose your playstyles and take advantage of that with one of the eight classes to choose from. If you want to run around and knock people out so your teammates can get to the next floor or car, pick the Cleaner. If the place is heavily guarded with lasers and such, pick the Hacker. If you're too lazy to strategize and want to get to the next floor, choose the Mole. There are many secrets to discover, and some of them can actually be quite humorous. So yeah, you can explore the rooms to get all the loot, since there is no time limit. No, I'm not done yet. Did I mention that there was a LEVEL EDITOR? For you creative minds out there (like myself, no, seriously!) you will enjoy the level editor. It is very simple to use. After looking at a guide made by Andy Nguyen, the man that designed most of the levels in Monaco, I was able to learn how to add lasers and such. I discovered that unlike other difficult level editors *cough* Super Meat Boy *cough* I was able to create a level. The only other game that I can think of with a level editor that simple is LittleBigPlanet. If anything, Monaco's level editor is easier to use, and you're talking to an LBP fanboy. Okay, let's continue before I begin to talk about LBP...\n\nI'll go to the story next. Although there isn't much of a story, there are pre-dialogues before every mission, so you can get info on what's going on. I thought it was acceptable and a little surprising to see how well done it is. I have low expectations on story, unless it's a huge story based game. I think Monaco's story is interesting. Especially for the Lockpicker's story. But hey, there isn't much else to say.\n\nNow, for the audio. Not much to it. Okay, not much to it when talking about the AI. Okay. I take that back. There are lots of awesome sounds in this game. That's it. Fooled you! I didn't talk about the magnificent soundtrack. Monaco's songs are mostly piano songs, but when played in a game like this, it was done in an amazing way. It's not an "Oh. My. God. Drooling! Drooling! Drooling! Drooling!" soundtrack, not like Bastion's or FTL's anyway, but I enjoy it.\n\nReplayability time. Since I only have a couple hours into the game, I don't know much about replayability. However, I do know it does last you quite some time. You can try and get #1 on the All-Time list for the record times, or you could design more levels. It's up to you. What's funny is that these paragraphs are all small except for gameplay. Well, I'm doing my best to keep this not biased.\n\nNow, for the flaws. Don't worry, almost done! Despite Monaco's many, many pros, there are some pretty major flaws that need to be pointed out. Okay, to be honest, it's one major flaw. Ready? The AI in this game is HORRIBLE. And I do mean HORRIBLE. So, I climb up a ladder to hide from guards, but one climbs up, walks right through me, and climbs down without noticing me right IN FRONT OF HIM. Also, I ran away from another group of guards, not far away and still visible, I stay there and wait for the pursuing guards to catch me. What's the problem? Those lazy fatasses decided to go back to their post. There are countless more stories about how big of morons these guards are. Want me to tell you some more? No? That's what I thought. Let's finish this thing.\n\nIn conclusion, Monaco is an amazing game. Fun, simple gameplay mechanics, neat soundtrack, a surprising story, and pretty impressive replayability, you'll definitely enjoy the game. One of the few gems from last year the I, personally, think should have gotten more praise, despite it already having a couple positive reviews. However, the ♥♥♥♥♥ AI makes the game a lot less difficult and lame. If you don't mind bad AI and stale graphics, then you're in for one enfer d'un tour, which means "hell of a ride" in French.\n\nGraphics: 5/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nStory: 6.5/10\nAudio: 8.5/10\nReplayability: 8.5/10\n\n\n.:8.2/10:.\n+Great gameplay\n+Good soundtrack\n+Acceptable story\n+Great replayability\n+Missions are open\n+Simple level editor\n-Stale visuals\n-Horrendous AI","May 23, 2014","true","9.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

And that is a hefty recommendation all by itself.\n\nUp to four players choose one of 8 crooks, each with a unique specialty. The Locksmith opens doors and safes quickly, the Cleaner neutralizes people when they're not looking. Then the team must work together to pull off heist objectives, or, more challenging, get every available coin.\n\nThe action takes place in a top-down view. Layered systems of security, from dogs and motion sensitive cameras to civilians that alert nearby guards, must be bypassed or defeated to get in, get rich, and get out.\n\nThe control scheme is marvelously compact. There is a sneak button and a use-special-item button. There is a button to bring up the HUD and see how much life you have and how many coins remain to be stolen in a level. There is a button for push-to-talk. And there is a control stick. If you want to do something, like unlock a door or hack into a computer, just walk into it.\n\nOnline co-op feels magical. Even with strangers, you start to move as a team and think together. And if you don't, hilarity ensues as your careful plans go to pot.\n\nCan't omit the thoughtful graphics and sound design, but the core gameplay is the meat.

The tightly structured gameplay is fast and fluid, and the colorful cast (quite literally) of playable characters are great. Everything about the game, from its mechanics to its presentation, to its music and its sound, feels original and fresh. Monaco is a game with a strong sense of self, a game that is acutely aware of its own eccentric identity and not afraid to show it, which is precisely what makes it such a strong title.\n\nIn much the same fashion as Hotline Miami and Fez, the incredible art design shows just how much detail there can be in blocky, pixellated graphics. The music is nothing short of masterful, wearing its ragtime, silent-movie inspiration on its sleeve and being all the better for it. The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.\n\nThe game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory.

Qui va là?\n\nIt's a decent single player game*, but the co-op play is great! Best played with people in the same room or at least with free-flowing voice chat. Works fine as a two-player game, but some levels would have been much easier with 3-4 people.\n\nLevel design is brilliant and almost perfectly calibrated to increase the difficulty as you go. Except for Pearls Before Swine, that level was a ♥♥♥♥♥ and much harder then it needed to be. Not that I'm bitter about spending a week of evenings on a single level or anything. :) I didn't realize how awesome the levels were until I tried some of the featured / highly rated workshop levels. Most of those aren't worth the time yet. Maybe in time as people get better at designing...\n\nThe storyline was actually interesting. I'm usually a "mash the button to skip past all these stupid words" type, but not this time. Very well done.\n\nIt does have a few annoying aspects:\n- If your connection to Steam drops, you'll get booted from the game. You can't reconnect to a game.\n- The menu interface is stupid. Good luck trying to exit the game and managing to hit the right combination of Space and Esc without reading the options every time. If you prefer to play on LAN instead of over Steam, you'll have to set that every.single.time even though it seems to remember all the other settings just fine.\n- The outlet/coin spawns are randomly generated, so sometimes you may want to restart a level if your team has a hacker and the outlet placement sucks.\n\n\n\n* My spouse has been speedrunning levels for weeks now, so it's also a great single player game if leaderboards and completionism are your thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/113020/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nMonaco: What’s Yours Is Mine is a 2d stealth game that is played from the top view the whole time. The game is very random in puzzle nature so it’s difficult to plan for whatever you face in the game. You can play between several different campaigns and also play player-based maps.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  The first campaign you are the Locksmith, tell the story of escaping from prison and trying to make it to a new country and leave his past of crime behind him. Unfortunately the temptation of getting additional wealth starts to pull him away from his initial intentions.\nAdditional campaigns tell of a more elaborate story, the second campagn is about the Pickpocket, whom is narrating and telling a different story from the Locksmith. There are two more campagns but I haven’t played those yet, because of the increasing difficulty in the puzzles.\n(Where are my Ninja stars and places to sneak and hide?  //Goes back to Ninja games)\n\nGame Play: In Monaco you can choose between eight different characters, each with their own ability’s to help them get through the various puzzles. There are useful guides to help you understand more about what the characters do.\nTo list the basic starting four characters: the locksmith can picklocks really fast, the Pickpocket has a pet monkey that collects loot, the cleaner knocks people out (when they don’t see him), the lookout can detect enemies that are farther away and out of your line of site.\n\nAchievements: The achievements in this game are rather straight forward, but also rather tough. As usual you get several achievements just from beating a few levels, but in the end most of the achievements will require a lot of work to earn. Most can be earned with guides on offline single player. But the rest will require\n\nPrice: Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine costs $14.99, for me that is overpriced, but you could easily get many hours of gaming out of it. If you do get over 20 hours out of the game (and know you love stealth based games and a lot of challenge) it’s probably a fair price.\nI feel like it’s not fair for me to say that I don’t recommend the game because of the price, I just really didn’t enjoy the game, but it was a good game and I think it’s worth a try… try the free weekend or a demo or something before you purchase it to know for certain if you like this style of game.\n\nConclusion: I really thought this game was interesting, different, unique, and added a great amount of challenge compared to most classical stealth games. But this game would be way more fun to play with friends. Even when I played a few games with strangers I enjoyed the fast paced gameplay.\nBut I really can’t say this game makes it on my top list. I would recommend this game just because I think it deserves a chance, but once again; try it on a free weekend or a demo of some type before you purchase, so you know ahead of time what you’re getting yourself into.\n","June 2, 2014","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Best thiefing experience in a long while, this is what I wanted out of Payday: the Heist. Despite the apparent lo-fi style, it is amazingly packed with small details and the audiovisual stuff is really well done. It's not just a super-complicated Pacman, the theme and style works giving it an excellent atmosphere. Playing alone it's more like defusing a bomb slowly and methodically, but in multi (online or local) it becomes (theoretically) this synchronized masterplan where everybody does their bit to pull off the job. In practice you'll screw it up though and get to run around in panic, falling back to even worse plans... "all right plan E: Ignore everything, just RUN!" Unique playstyles with different characters and the slight randomization in the levels make this one quite replayable. It's also very comfortable to play with a gamepad.","April 26, 2013","true","38.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Monaco is the perfect mix of Hotline Miami, and Payday. With a simple design, usual heist game plot, this game is easy to grasp, suitable for gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nHowever, this game has it's fair share of problems. The new October update, is dissapointing. The Origin campaign, whilst giving more info on the characters, feels like the same mission every time. I feel... more cheated out of a good promise, rather than dissapointed. The "Zonaco" zombie mode, is, well the same campaign. Only with zombies. So no round based, team oriented survival mode, like I hoped for. Saves us the screamers online, I suppose.\n\n+ Story is well written, despite it's repetative missions\n+ Co-Op is tackled well, but the campaign can be played regardless without a partner\n+ Replayability. I have barely taken a chunk out of this game.\n+ Story is split into 2 Acts.\n\n- The October update.\n- It's easy to find the quick way around a mission, however the game tackles punishment well.\n\n7/10.

Monaco was by far one of the best experencias i had this year related to videogames - counitng only to what was relesed this year -. Almost everthing is perfect on this game, from the visuals, OST and the COOP. COOP on this game is the cherry on top of the cake.\n\nMonaco has some diversity missions such as, heist, saving someone or get alive from some place. Also contains 3 game modes; Enhanced, Classic and Zombies. Enhanced is shorter, more streamlined maps and will make a better and easy experience. Classic mode that is purist, hard to say.\n\nNow to class, some to choose and they are all great. Going to give some examples, The Cleaner, he can put enemies to sleep, is really hand when you find a room full of them.\nThe Mole, funny character to use, he can breaks for almost any room really good to dig shortcut's. I think you got the point that character in Monaco are fun and useful to use.\n\nIf you ever get bored of doing COOP and SP you have two options; PVP and creation mode. PVP is here you against another player "fight" to see who stole the intel first and can escape alive. Very fun game type. The creation mode is here you can make your own levels, case you have a nice imagination you may get feature in Monaco weekly/month workshop levels.\n\nAnother thing i love in games and i especially love this on in Monaco is the OST, is brilliant, this gentleman Austin Wintory[austinwintory.bandcamp.com] made an awesome job here. The OST is so calm and fits very well in this game. - I advise you hear the full ost on that site -\n\nNow that you read my shout review, go buy this game and enjoy it!\n\nTotally worth your money!\n\n~ 8/10","December 31, 2013","true","12.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As I sit here in my palatial library, peering through my grimoire and other works, I note that I have not extended the pleasure of a review to the unwashed masses. Substantial evidence points to varying activities which have kept me from this world of opinion and unsubstantiated claim and counter-claim but now I return from the dead. Does it matter that Monaco, written by Neil Patrick Harris & Sylvester Stallone, has come out? Is this what has brought about my sudden return from pseudo-retirement? In all likelyhood, it is not.\nMonaco follows the journey of a band of thieves and crooks through the eponymous city of Monaco, Kentucky. Eugene Onion (Dwayne Johnson) is joined by Ribroast Jones (Ben Kingsley), Shia McBoof (Michael Sheen) and Michael "Canned" Meet (Daniel Day Lewis). The band makes their way from heist to heist never stopping to ponder the "why" or "how" of the entire situation. The Mise-en-scène denotes a chaotic and bizarre existance, punctuated extravagantly through the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Goldberg.\nWho's to say whether or not this follow up to the 1923 movie, "The Man with a Hat on his Head" will take off, all I can say is that this is a whole new direction for Marvel to take the Batman franchise in.","May 11, 2013","true","2.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Every one of them, has a special abillity.\n\nFor example:\n\n-Lockpicker= He can unlock things very quickly.\n-The cleaner= He can hit enemies\n-The Mole= He can crush through walls\n\nAnd many more...\n\nSo far I played like.. 1-2 hours or less, and I liked the game from the start.\n\nHere are the things WHY is this game awesome:\n-Good Graphics\n-Awesome Gameplay\n-Good Physics [movement, actions]\n-Sounds [Example: When you use a computer, it makes a sound of: ''Writing or typing, on a keyboard''\n-Addictive Storyline/Gameplay\n-You can hide in bushes and trees!

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn","January 13, 2015","true","1.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","62","8","13","13","0"

One has the ability to put enemies to sleep for 30-60 seconds if they are not alerted. (sneak up on them). Another can "charm" her way into tricking one enemy to help with opening doors, etc. Another can break through walls (great for bypassing doors that are locked, especially double locked doors). Another can hack security systems and outlets to open doors and stuff.\n\nAt first it looks like a crappy little 2d top view game, but once you get into it, it's much more than that.","April 6, 2014","true","44.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AaronionRings/recommended/113020/","AaronionRings","AaronionRings","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AaronionRings/","770 products in account","Monaco is a steal at this price\nNot going to go into much detail right now but this game is brilliant. Lovely and fairly unique art style with gameplay and story that manages to both fit in perfectly with the visuals and give it a lot of charm. There's a wide range of characters you an play as with each one having their own unique traits and/or abilities that compliment the level design perfectly. Each gives you an entirely different approach to how you move throughout the levels.\n\nIn co-op play, only one player can play each character so you have to work out what's best (or the most fun) for the situation and who's playing what. The different characters have great synergy with one another and allow you pull off much more complicated and efficient strategies. This can also lead to the most hectic games you'll see with one mistake causing sheer chaos. Though the single player is great and doesn't suffer from solo play, the co-op is the life of this game and it's where the most replay value will be had.\n\nClassic mode allows you to play as originally intended if you don't want to play with the changes in updates and zombie mode makes everything much more dangerous with much more persistent enemies. If you run out of levels to play then there's a level editor and Steam Workshop support to keep the game lasting as long as you want.\n\nI've only got 2.5 hours of this game on Steam but I purchased this game for the Xbox 360 on release and I've very much enjoyed what I've played. There's a lot more content in the Steam version, it is 100% the better version of the game and it's worth the full price without a doubt.\n\nGrab this game while it's 87% off if you don't own it already. The discount is for both a single copy and the 4 pack. It's a steal at this price and you'll be missing out big time if you don't pick it up.","January 23, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

If you're confused by what you're seeing in the store, don't be alarmed. The screenshots and videos don't do this game justice; you have to actually play the game for a bit to get a feeling for what's going on. All that color and chaos comes together nicely when you're playing.\n\nMonaco is decent entertainment as a single-player game, but the single-player game is best used to get familiar with each character at your own speed. Where Monaco really shines is when you get 2-4 people together in co-op mode. Different characters' abilities complement each other in surprising ways, and strategies emerge that simply aren't possible in solo play. Figuring out how to combine different characters' abilities to meet the unique challenges that each level presents is half the fun.\n\nIf you don't have Steam friends to play with, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the Monaco community. This is a group that really likes to cooperate, and is patient with new players. The patient, cooperative play style of Monaco appeals to more mature gamers, and the public community really reflects that.\n\nI enthusiastically recommend Monaco. It’s a blast.\n","December 8, 2013","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a cool graphics style, original classes with unique abilities, fun stealth mechanics, and very challenging missions.

I should warn you of a minor inconvenience. You see, I've been put under house arrest. But pay no heed to the officers in my foyer. I'm sure they will be perfectly polite."\n-The Gentleman, in answer to a call from the "pool inspector"\n\nMonaco is all about the grand heists. Robbing casinos, banks, palaces, hotels and escaping with everything that's shiny. A series of levels in which you steal all the goodies then make a quick run for the nearest exit. Monaco is truly a unique take on the "heist" genre. If you give it half a chance and more than just a couple of challenging hours then you just might find a hidden gem that is more enjoyable and challenging than many other AAA games that are out there right now.\nI guess at the end of the day Monaco may be written off as just a bare-bones and simple 2D top-down view game that might isn't as "engaging" as other heist and stealth games. But that's the charm of it. To me this title is very underrated. If you go deeper into the gameplay and the storyline that stretches across multiple levels, you'll find a game that's both intriguing and amusing. I won't spoil it, but the story follows a crew of misfits that each bring a set of very different shady abilities to the table, all in for the long haul. You get to control any one of them for each level, and as they are each and all very different, so is the manner by which you can play. Monaco has all the characteristics of a good PC heist game:\n\nPlanning and strategy is crucial every step of the way; if you just jump into a room full of guards you are sure to die in the ensuing chaos. There are many tools of the trade provided however, and it's important to use them carefully. Monaco grows on you the more you come to terms with how simple yet challenging the game mechanics work.\nLevel design is logical, meaningful, and often intimidating. But the game does a good job of balancing skill, strategy and luck for the player. There are often several methods of reaching the objective within a given level. This goes hand in hand with the various different characters within the game, and I do mean everyone. Monaco takes every one of them into account and still (perhaps) manages to balance the challenge for each different style of play. I myself preferred to play as the Gentleman.\nPC (KB+M) controls are simple, sharp and manageable. Keyboard remapping is also available, but for some reason does not work in the menus. The character you control is always in your focal point as this is a top-down view game; there should be no blaming the camera for any mistakes you make here. The in-game HUD is also minimal and clear on objectives and whatever else needs to be known.\nAI is a little difficult to explain here, but like most games the more you play Monaco the easier it is to understand and adapt. The key is in avoiding detection; the longer you are out in plain view of guards and civilians the more suspicion you draw. This suspicion is based on line of sight; but unlike how it is often very difficult to know where guards are and how they will see you in FPS or third-person games, the top-down strategic view here makes things much easier for you to act and react. This level of control really makes you understand that if something does go wrong, then only you are to blame.","August 8, 2015","true","51.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course that implies sneaking, breaking vaults with laser tourettes poiting straight at you and being synchronized with the people you rely on saving your butt by cutting off the power, hacking through computers, breaking through walls, disguising  and even "cleaning" or seducing the guards and civilians. You may need to be revived too, so for the sake of your team mates, please don't die in a laser room or in front of a guard. The bushes are your friends and those smoke bombs are going to save your ♥♥♥ many times. The top-down view presenting the architectural plans of the floor are very accurate and easily navigable by the players.

Sounds mediocre, right? WRONG.\nMonaco is a fantastic game, and that fact become clear immediately upon starting up. The gameplay is much like what I just described, but with a style all its own that I cannot say I have ever seen in anything else. It's totally unique, and that style pervades every element of Monaco. The music and artwork truly shine (This is one of the few indie soundtracks that I went out and bought, to bring credence to that fact.)\nAlone, it's great fun, but the developers had the foresight to add in a multiplayer co-op mode- this instantly pushed a good game to great. The online chaos that may ensue, or the local co-op  madness (If you have spare controllers or keyboards) are nearly reminiscent of the great Nintendo multiplayer experiences of yore.\nSo, if you have the money to spend, get this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/113020/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Monaco is a great looking artsy game with a great concept and, to a certain extent, this concept works out very well. More in singleplayer than multiplayer.\n\nThink of Monaco as a 1-4 player(s) Pacman-like heist game; collect as many coins as you can, grab some loot and then make a run for it. Sounds great, doesn't it ? Yes, as a concept. In reality it could've been so much better. Let me try to explain.\n\nFirst of all, I've been waiting for this game to be released for a long time, and now that it has finally been released I can't help but feel disappointed. Why ? Because in co-op the game is just so damn hectic and it's hard to see your location or any location for that matter. There are no instructions on how to use your character and their abilities properly. You can see why that's distracting when you're playing with other people. Your partners have certain expectations and instead of actually helping you're running around making it look like you know what you're doing. But you actually don't know. People (including yourself) will ragequit because of this. They're unforgiving. Sure, not everyone, but a lot of my games have ended that way.\n\nAlso, the AI is a bit random from time to time, so there's no right way to finish a level. You need a bit of strategy and also a whole lot of luck. One thing that could instantly make this game better is by simply increasing your field of vision, giving you a better sight while walking around, and giving you more of an idea on what to do next.\n\nThe single-player mode is thankfully less hectic, but still doesn't really teach you how to use your abilities properly. In single-player you can't get resurrected (obviously) so, instead, you have a certain amount of lives. Die and you can't use that character anymore and this continues until you run out of characters (i.e. lives).\n\nNow, on the other hand, Monaco has more than enough content and some missions should take you over 30 minutes to finish. They can certainly be fun while playing with  a group of friends.\n\nThis little review does make it look like I hate it, but I really don't. I truly like this game, I just wish it was better on certain fronts, or maybe a bit more open to get rid of the chaos entirely.\nMake sure you give it a spin if you have a group of friends who you can communicate with, that should certainly help.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","May 6, 2013","true","15.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095141770/recommended/113020/","76561198095141770","KingHorseFondler69","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095141770/","84 products in account","My only complaint about the game is that the classes are boring. Currently the classes you can play as are: a “locksmith,” a “pickpocket,” a “cleaner,” a “lookout,” a “mole,” a “gentleman,” a “hacker,” a “redhead,” and a “blonde.” Really? No WONDER so few finished the game. The people we played with are just boring. Cliches. Veritable “mehs.”\n\nBut it doesn’t have to stay this way. Pocketwatch Games can fix this by replacing these classes with cooler ones. Specifically these:\n\nWe can replace the “locksmith” with “Sasha Grey.” The Sasha Grey class makes money by taking many hard tasks simultaneously (often four at a time!). She takes them harder and faster than the other classes and, though they would cause other classes such vertigo that others would vomit, she, at her limits, would just gag and roll her eyes back and ask for more, and with profanities! This class is like a “tank,” and can take great punishment.\n\nAs for the “pickpocket,” how about “Jenna Haze”? Jenna Haze has an easy-going, perky personality. She’s the charmer of the group. She’s enthusiastic and energetic, bending over to do almost any task. She also has tan skin. This is useful.\n\nAs for “the cleaner,” that can be replaced by “Tori Black.” Not particularly good at anything but above average at everything, you can count on her to do basically anything. And I mean anything. Some of the others may resent her non-specialization—but the absolute value of her skills makes her a force to be watched.\n\nThe “lookout”? Let’s replace ‘im with “Lexi Belle.” Don’t let her quiet, high school girl demeanor make you think she’s not willing to do dirty deeds. She’s the innocent-looking one among this group, and you’re going to need her, because, well, everyone else in the group looks a little…suspicious? I think that’s the word. You’re going to need Lexi Belle to balance that look out.\n\nAnd the “mole.” How about “Jesse Jane”? Having grown up on military bases, this girl has the discipline and experience necessary to get almost any job done (wink wink). She’s a down-to-earth girl; not as sunshine and unicorns as Jenna, but not as hard as Sasha. And she has a mischievous facial expression none of the others have. You really want this girl on the team.\n\nWhat of the “gentleman”? Well, obviously: James Deen. With his boyish face, athletic physique, and blue eyes, he’s obviously a gentleman. Female guards will look at him and immediately become disarmed (of COURSE there are female guards in this game! Don’t be a sexist!). He has an incredible amount of experience for his age, and unlike many of the other male candidates for the job, well, he can play the “gentleman.” He’s also a good team player; he can work with the rest of the group all night long, and in many positions.\n\nSpeaking of which, let’s replace the “hacker” with “Stoya.” Graduating high school at age 16, and being versed in computers and games (plus being a writer), how could we NOT want her on the team? She’s the nerd, and the most rebellious of the group; the proper answer to “the hacker.” Being of Scottish and Serbian ethnicity, she also brings something exotic to the team. How many Scottish, Serbian Americans have you played with?\n\nNow, the “redhead.” Coming out of retirement, we have “Faye Reagan.” Retiring from “the industry” early due to drug problems, Faye in this game gets a second chance at life. She realizes that she just has to focus on being good at what she believes in, which is sharing the wealth that her mind and body are capable of with this team of stars.\n\nAnd as for the “blonde,” “Kayden Kross.” No longer a performer but rather a director, she will be the leader of our group. This Swedish American writes well (though not as well as Stoya) and, with her French husband and partner in crime Manuel Ferrara, we can expect her to sweep Monaco’s rich men. Or perhaps rich women? (Mr. Ferrera demands that she work only with women for some reason if she DOES have to perform) (we’ll have to keep her away from the James Deen I guess). Kayden also happens to be the most beautiful of the group. Beautiful in that she has an aura of leadership.\n\nAnd there you have it! Just imagine all these characters in some Monaco mansion, working together all at once! Oh what fun that would be! Pocketwatch games! Give us what we desire!","May 29, 2015","true","8.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

There are so many things to interact with like light barriers, vents, computers to hack in, the breaker box in the wine cellar and of course the guards that are animated sooo funny. If this wasn't enough, you get kind of a gangster movie soundtrack of the silent film age. It fits perfectly! Everything in this games fits. The multiplayer matches with friends are awesome. The best experience is sitting in a room and hear everybody screaming when the alarm at the museum you're robbing goes off. You have to buy this game and play it hard.

This is sadly a little bit hampered by the awkward private game creation system (x on the level for list of games, from there create, from there set to private, then send invites...).\nPerhaps the option for friendly A.I.s and a more streamlined private game with friends system would be of help.","January 1, 2015","true","34.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A quirky stealth action, you take the role of 4 characters, at the start, The Locksmith, The Pickpocket, The Lookout and The Cleaner. Each with their own abilities, and hidden abilities, to aid themselves, or their team. You play through and unlock more characters each with their own unique abilites and ways to aid. Honestly this game is best played MP where it can get out of hand and chaotic, which to be honest is where the most fun is. Running from guards desperatly trying to revive your teammates while being careful that dog doesn't get to you, it's really enjoyable. If you are a completionist then best avoid this as to 100% you have to get 4 trophies, they are as followed: completed in SP, completed in MP, completed without dying (or if doing on MP none of you can die) and finally cleaning out the level, which you must do for EVERY level. Some of the later levels get ridiculously hard.\nSo in summary I would definitly reccommend this game and you should buy it, especially because the Dev who made it is a really nice guy.","April 16, 2014","true","129.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great challenge when going solo, especially with the additional task of collecting all the loot. The game may look simple at first, but give it some time and you should find it interestingly challenging. Definitely for people who like to max out the levels. There are eight characters to choose from (4 during the first missions); each has its advantages and drawbacks, thus each of them requires a different approach and strategies, but in coop they complement each other. Time spent on each level can be compared with other players via the built-in leaderboards. Not to mention the great, full of twists story, the built-in map editor (steam workshop), good humour (guards' voices), good replay value, additional zombie mode and the free expansion which closes the story. There are a couple of flaws, but they are outnumbered by the sheer fun when playing this. It seems like the developers really loved creating this gem. At least that's what I felt while playing it.

Sadly if you tried this in real life you would risk going to prison, but fret no more because finally a game has come out where you can do just that (other than payday), without suffering the real life consequences of robbing a bank.\n\nSound 4/5\nArt 5/5\nGameplay 4/5\nStory 3/5\nOverall 16/20\n\nOn the sound spectrum i think I was rather generous as the music is not tremendous (purely my opinion), but there are no horrible sound effects that take away from the experience of the game. Where it really excels in this spectrum is the voice acting. while not much dialogue, the little there is is very funny.\n\nAt the quality AAA games are at in this day of age it is hard for small teams to get that same feel, so many go for the retro look. However, just because the graphics aren't of their era doesn't write them off the art category. Even though it may not look real it is still one of most beautifully presented games i have ever seen. they really pushed what they could do with the graphics they had\n\nThe gameplay is light, fun and a blast with friends. the high speed robbery is a great mechanic and can only be built on,and with so many different classes to choose from it can take a lot of planning until you and your friends have the perfect bank mugging dream team. you can also go solo if you wish and will still be challenged to a very fun and strategic game. Sometimes you can spend hours trying to get that top spot on the leaderboards and it is a game that suites that competitiveness completely. sadly, this game can get slightly repetitave after playing for a while and the replay value isnt great at this point\n\nThe story in this game is good but not great, it is quite simple and engaging but gets quite predictable and you sometimes just skip some dialogues before the level completely. However, the story gets the job done and really is not what this game is focused on. like many retro style games story is an afterthought and that definately shows in Monaco, but it is not bad to a point that it ruins the game\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who has any taste in games. with all the cookie-cutter fps games there are it is pleasant to see something  innovative and new. It is well worth the money and I think most people would have a good time with it","August 5, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kinda reminds me of Thief but top-down and more comical than the dark Thief. An absolute masterpiece and at a very cheap price (Free Weekend) and best of all, it is best played with your friends!\n\nWhat's mine is yours, and Monaco is mine!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

I expected kind of an action puzzle game but the game is far more than this. The whole setting is very atmospheric, prison break, bank heist, rescueing a fellow criminal from a mansion. There are so many things to interact with like light barriers, vents, computers to hack in, the breaker box in the wine cellar and of course the guards that are animated sooo funny. If this wasn't enough, you get kind of a gangster movie soundtrack of the silent film age. It fits perfectly! Everything in this games fits. The multiplayer matches with friends are awesome. The best experience is sitting in a room and hear everybody screaming when the alarm at the museum you're robbing goes off. You have to buy this game and play it hard.

And I've come to the conclusion it's a little bit of both.\n\nWhen you open the game, the menu itself moves very nicely, with graphics flowing in the background. Right off the bat, there are multiple gamemode options. I dove right into “Campaign” mode, and, like many other games, it showed me the first mission I could complete in color, and all the others were grayed out. However, what I really liked about playing Monaco's campaign, is that I could join/start a lobby, have up to three other people with me, and could stay in that lobby and keep selecting episodes instead of having to join a new lobby for each episode.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very nice. You start on the first episode by choosing one of four characters, each with their own perk. As you progress through levels, you gain more characters. The game loads very quickly, after you depart from the neat lobby menu of changing options (which is always fun). It is a top-down game, but there are obviously good reasons for that. On the top, directions will be given as to what you have to do, so that it's never confusing, and the goal is to sneak past the police/guards to get to the object the heist was started for and all the spare money along the way. There are weapons to pick up from time to time, but I found that running away from guards and hiding in a room for a few seconds keeps them off your scent.\n\nPros:\nMenus move very smoothly.\nThe graphics, being a top-down game, are pretty decent.\nThe objectives are always clear.\nYou can stay in the same lobby for as many levels as you choose.\nAll campaign levels can be completed in either singleplayer or multiplayer.\nThe controller support is amazing, and I actually prefer to use the controller.\nThere's Steam Workshop to download new levels to play.\nIt's local co-op too, so it's good for a party with friends if you have more than one controller.\n\nCons:\nGun reloading is very obnoxious. It shouldn't take 10 seconds for one bullet to reload.\nThe co-op community is not as large as I had hoped.\nGuards are almost too easy to get past.\n\nSo, basically, I had a lot of fun playing this game, though I would recommend getting it on sale.\n","June 20, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are over 30 levels to complete, and about halfway it starts to ramp up the difficulty.  Guards are everywhere, lasers are everywhere, trip lasers are everywhere, and then later all the lasers have shotguns on them (not kidding.)  Towards the end the difficulty is ramped up so high it's just brutal.\n\nBut it's a good kind of difficulty.  You can't just barrel your way through the game and then get mad when it punishes you.

I was wrong.\n\nThis game is one of the best buys I've made during my time on steam. The trailer's don't necessarily do the graphics justice, which have really clear visuals, and a minimalistic, but aesthetically pleasing neon art style. The soundtrack is also killer, capturing the perfect tone. The gameplay is fantastic, akin to pacman with stealth, guns, and laser-rigged security systems. There is little in the way of tutorial, so you are left to experiment for yourself,but that works well for this for this game, which has you balance careful planning, against quick thinking and resourcefulness for when things go wrong.\n\nThe plot was also pretty fresh, while nodding to tropes within the heist genre. The game offers a lot of replayability too, as though the single player is fun and carries the game by itself, the multiplayer enables you to play with others to try and try to grab everything and get out as fast as possible. In addition to this, the community is pretty good, and new levels are often being made.\n\nOf course, no game is perfect, and if I had to say something, it would be that though the plot was great, it was advanced sparingly from mission to mission. If story is what you look for in a game, this may not be the game for you. Also, although you don't have to collect every coin to "win" a mission, if the coins are ignored some missions lose a lot of challenge, especially as on some earlier missions the number of lives you have is fairly generous. However, there are a lot of levels (3 parallel campaigns, with a 4th coming out soon, as well as zombie mode), so this would only bother those exceptionally impatient people who can't wait to unlock the later levels, which are extraordinarily challenging, even if you don't collect the coins!\n\nI would definitely give this game a 10/10 as it stands, and am very excited to play the new content which is coming out this year","February 13, 2014","true","52.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which by the way, is easy to use.","July 25, 2013","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005217655/recommended/113020/","76561198005217655","QIj'ej Wov Ram","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005217655/","53 products in account","So earlier on in the spring, I purchased Monaco for 4 dollars because I needed a break from Skyrim. It is one of those rare indy games that comes around that realizes the best way to reward a player is by cleverness rather than trial and error. It's a game of actual skill and challenge rather than merely repetition and memorization. If I'd known how good it was going to be, I would have bought it at full price.\n\nMonaco is a stealth co-op game where you play a team of 8 thieves in vibrant colors. Together, they work to pull off a heist at Monte Carlo, the largest casino in the world. The world takes place in the actual city of Monaco, which has been stylized in a sort of retro look. Oddly enough, the game actually resembles the city at night. Just an interesting side note there. Anyway, each of the 8 thieves has particular talents which are used to work together with other players. The objective in each mission is varieties of rescuing a team member, collect a bunch of trophies, or just try to make a quick getaway in the van.\n\nTechnically, you do not need to play multiplayer to progress, but it's highly recommended for new players as Monaco is significantly easier with three extra pairs of hands. If you do desire to player it single player, I would recommend looking into some player made tutorial missions that'll tell you everything you need to know.\n\nIf there's any kind of nitpicking I could have about Monaco, it's that combat is just a major waste of time(unless you are playing in Zombie Mode). When you pick up a gun, you only get one shot and it takes ten coins to get one extra shot of ammo. Most floors in a level have 50 coins on average and there's about 2-3 floors per level. That means you're looking at maybe 10 shots at best...unless you're playing in multiplayer. Only then do things get really antagonistic as four thieves are competing for coins when cleaning out places.\n\nTo top that off, even if you do collect all the coins on your own, you'll often find yourself outnumbered and outgunned by guards and civilians and they can all resurrect each other...so there's no real point to the weapons except to buy for more time. For some people who like the option of blasting through everyone who gets in their way, this may be a bit of a turnoff. I don't personally mind it however, because combat is not the focus of Monaco. It's about the caper, the chase, the theft. If you are looking for mindless slaughtering, check out the Zombie Mode. Zombie Mode makes you get twice as much ammo for the coins you collect and even gives the cleaner an one hit kill sneak attack.\n\nComplaints about combat aside, what makes a stealth co-op game like Monaco fun is that you're not scored based on how carefully you stealth. The truth of the matter is security gets so beefed up in the late game that even if you were the greatest cat burglar in the world, you're still eventually going to get caught. But that's part of what makes it so exciting when four thieves are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, collecting all the coins, dodging guards and turret fire while desperately trying to resurrect one another. It's the chaotic elements they add that make it stand out as a stealth game and once you get used to the mechanics on hiding and sneaking, then the game just starts to challenge you.\n\nOne recommendation I would say if you choose to buy this is don't play this game for longer than 2 or 3 missions per day. Monaco is like a good wine--great for savouring but not so much for consuming. If you do power through it, the novelty will start to wear off fast and you'll just wind up burning out. There's enough enjoyment from getting 100% coins and no deaths with a competent team of friends in a single mission than teabagging every noob you see in a triple A shooter. It's a game that's all about quality over quantity.\n\nThese reasons are all that what makes Monaco a game that totally deserves your attention because it's the indy game of early 2014 that most deserves to be played. They just finished up the last patch on it and it's available on steam for 5 bucks. So stop reading this, go to the store and buy this already. In the meantime, I have more time to play as the Gentleman. :)","June 23, 2014","true","72.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lilleredel/recommended/113020/","lilleredel","SmoothOperator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lilleredel/","962 products in account","Monaco is an incredibly varied game with very simple game mechanism. It’s actually quite staggering with how much you can get done and nuanceful (that’s a real word I am sure) your game play can be with so few commands at your disposal. It’s nothing short of brilliant. It also makes its very approachable and in all probability resulted in 8 different character classes rather than one multitalented one and too, is very cool since it opens up a nice setting for very fun multiplayer games that rely heavily on co-op to get things done efficiently. And with a game play as smooth as Monaco's it really is a treat!\n\nSo what type of game is it? It’s a stealth action planning coop game where you collect treasure, whack out baddies and hide in the bushes. Occasionally when things go wrong and might have to put the shotgun on the table and some cleaning.\nThe game has a top down view, you have a field of vision (opponents too) and you can see most of the buildings layoutes once you have explored them. You move around with arrow keys and with the help of different character you can go through walls, pick locks or hack computers etc. Your goal is get through security and fine the "cake".\n\nFor me it’s the coop that really shines since you can have your buddies set up different scenarios or organize traps for the baddies and it’s just a lot of fun.  It’s also the type of game you can easily play with your girlfriend!\n\n9/10 in my book.\n","June 24, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thankfully online multiplayer is friendly and cooperative, though maybe that's because you can't complete the levels unless everyone is alive. Definitely fun when playing with friends, but also rewarding when playing alone, either in the normal mode or zombie mode.

Sadly if you tried this in real life you would risk going to prison, but fret no more because finally a game has come out where you can do just that (other than payday), without suffering the real life consequences of robbing a bank.\n\nSound 4/5\nArt 5/5\nGameplay 4/5\nStory 3/5\nOverall 16/20\n\nOn the sound spectrum i think I was rather generous as the music is not tremendous (purely my opinion), but there are no horrible sound effects that take away from the experience of the game. Where it really excels in this spectrum is the voice acting. while not much dialogue, the little there is is very funny.\n\nAt the quality AAA games are at in this day of age it is hard for small teams to get that same feel, so many go for the retro look. However, just because the graphics aren't of their era doesn't write them off the art category. Even though it may not look real it is still one of most beautifully presented games i have ever seen. they really pushed what they could do with the graphics they had\n\nThe gameplay is light, fun and a blast with friends. the high speed robbery is a great mechanic and can only be built on,and with so many different classes to choose from it can take a lot of planning until you and your friends have the perfect bank mugging dream team. you can also go solo if you wish and will still be challenged to a very fun and strategic game. Sometimes you can spend hours trying to get that top spot on the leaderboards and it is a game that suites that competitiveness completely. sadly, this game can get slightly repetitave after playing for a while and the replay value isnt great at this point\n\nThe story in this game is good but not great, it is quite simple and engaging but gets quite predictable and you sometimes just skip some dialogues before the level completely. However, the story gets the job done and really is not what this game is focused on. like many retro style games story is an afterthought and that definately shows in Monaco, but it is not bad to a point that it ruins the game\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who has any taste in games. with all the cookie-cutter fps games there are it is pleasant to see something  innovative and new. It is well worth the money and I think most people would have a good time with it","August 5, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each level in this game starts out as Ocean's Eleven, but can quickly turn into Boondock Saints.  Success depends upon a combination of coordination and improvisation, as well as clever use of the distinct characters and their unique abilities. Single-player can also provide its own challenges, as you have fewer "tools" with your team of one.\n\nAfter three years of development, this is an indie game that exhibits a lot of polish. From the intuitive implemenation of stealth to the clever level design to the fast-paced music, it's easy to see why Monaco won multiple awards at the Independent Games Festival in 2010. It plays well with a keyboard or controller and with Steam Workshop, there is an endless amount of content, from tutorials to PvP arenas.\n\nAlso: trading cards.","July 19, 2013","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Or maybe you could compare it favorably to Left 4 Dead. It's a great game.\n\nThere's no accumulation of loot like you find in MMOs or ARPGs, but this is a feature, not a flaw. Since everyone starts equally, it's easier to pull people into a game at any given time. You don't have to worry about whether your character is too high a level or too low a level, or whether you have the "proper" gear. You just get get up to 4 people together and just do it.\n\nIt has a forgiving "death" mode, much like Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, or Guild Wars 2. When playing with friends, if you are downed, you can be recovered by another player. As long as one person is still alive, the game continues!\n\nIt also has several different modes of success. You can just try to complete the level. You can try to clean it out entirely. Or you can try to do both of the above against the clock. For the hardcore, speedruns may be their thing. For the more casual player, survival might be the challenge. And there are different versions/difficulties of each of the levels, so unlocking those is another potential goal. And of course there are "cheevos" through Steam for doing other silly things. So there's a lot to aim for with this game.\n\nThe graphics are stylish, the music is perfect, and the dialogue witty. My only criticism is that it's a little hard to figure out the "ring" of indicators surrounding your character. Parsing that data is hard with all of the other visual distractions on the screen at any given time. But by the time you learn 'em, it's mostly moot. At that point you will probably have enough experience with the game not to need 'em too much.\n\nAnd the price? Cheap!

Anybody can join, beginners or advanced, so each time is different. But, it lacks challenge. A team-member can be reckless and set off all the guards and what not, or everyone can go off and do their own thing, and the mission can still be completed, I wish it could be more along the lines of, one wrong move and your entire mission will fail, hence forcing teamwork. Other than that, I'd give the game 4/5 stars.","April 6, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, what those people fail to realize is that, they didn't try hard enough.  This game is so boring and simple if you just run through, grab the objectives, and dodge bullets.  Now, on the other hand, if you actually go for the achievements, try sneaking through undetected, getting every coin, and not dying, it quickly becomes very difficult and fun.  Several people have stated it lacks challenge and strategizing, but that's probably because they played the first levels designed for newcomers, and didn't even try to do good.  My friend and I played through the entire game, getting every trophy and achievement, including a hidden one, and it was not easy at several points.  For example, in one level, guards spawn every 20 seconds, and form giant conga lines of destruction.  Now try sneaking past their unpredictable routes into a guarded room, knocking out the guards without getting seen, so that you can hack a computer and hope that everything works out to let you get through the other 2 rooms, past some lasers, and giving you enough time to grab the cash and get out.  My friend and I got rather good at the game and it took us about 30 tries to get lucky on that level.  This game has tons of gameplay, and even more replayability with the many character combinations and strategies you can use on each level.  I highly recommend this game to anyone.","February 14, 2014","true","128.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Try to imagine a stealth game like theif in a more retro setting, and then add three other players plus lots of awesomeness. While it can be played single player, this game thrives as a team stealth game.\n\nIn terms of content Monaco has more than enough to keep you busy for months. There are tons of levels, each taking anywhere from 10-20 min on average, and even after you beat all the levels you can try the levels with different character combinations. Each character having it's own unique ability that helps your team in it's own unique way.\n\nTruley an amazingly fun and challenging game, if you already have a group of friends you game with, this is definitly a game worth getting.\n\n","February 15, 2014","true","222.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can play as different escaped prisoners or people they free in the game. The Hacker is my favourite cause it can deactivate all the electronics for a short while where you walk close too. I Highly recommend to play this game with friends or people who know what they do with they Character and/or the level. You also see the spots like with a coloured perspective like in real life. I mean, when you have a closed door you can't see what's behind it even with the perspective. You can only see, what we also can see if we stand there. Also everyone can make hiding spots in the bushes on some maps to prevent that cops find them easily as they walk by. The weapon system and Equipment system is also a new sort of way to play, you get an extra item of the item you got by collecting money. In overall it's a game who wants to be sneaky, stealth, rich, demolishfull, a charmer or a codebreaker.","January 8, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(...)\n\nHow much content/replayability?\nThere is a vast amount of dev-made levels, including little text-based briefings. You can replay a level again and again, a different character selection most certainly leading to a entirely different game expierence. It is great fun to collect all coins scattered through the levels ("clean out"), which acts +/- as a optional sidequest.\n\nAdditional:\nAnd then there is the Steam workshop....\nAnd then there is Multiplayer, which is almost a game on its own, including 4-player support.\nAnd then there are gadgets, like shotguns, crossbows with tranquillizer darts, medikits, smoke bombs, C4 (...) which you obtain by collecting coins.\n\n\nSO: Buy this game if you like stealth, Co-Op action/voicechat chaos, good timing, tactical thinking and top-down games.\n\nI give it a 9/10.

Great challenge when going solo, especially with the additional task of collecting all the loot. The game may look simple at first, but give it some time and you should find it interestingly challenging. Definitely for people who like to max out the levels. There are eight characters to choose from (4 during the first missions); each has its advantages and drawbacks, thus each of them requires a different approach and strategies, but in coop they complement each other. Time spent on each level can be compared with other players via the built-in leaderboards. Not to mention the great, full of twists story, the built-in map editor (steam workshop), good humour (guards' voices), good replay value, additional zombie mode and the free expansion which closes the story. There are a couple of flaws, but they are outnumbered by the sheer fun when playing this. It seems like the developers really loved creating this gem. At least that's what I felt while playing it.

I didn't care about the co-op either, as I figured playing with random people wouldn't be great. Then I found myself playing it all weekend and absolutely loving it, and hugely enjoying co-op with random people as well.\n\nIt seems really simple at first, but the game has a lot of depth. You start to realise how many options you have for dealing with the levels, and the levels go from the trivial opening ones to incredibly difficult end ones. The middle levels are wonderful and the later levels are a huge challenge. A good co-op team can help but isn't required.\n\nThe people playing the game are properly into it and everyone seems to intuitively understand what each other is doing, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nHighly recommended!","April 29, 2013","true","56.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Main story points are made at the beginning of each level, so don't just skip straight past it on your first play through.\n\nThe gameplay is very good and it is well balanced between the Stealthy parts and the parts that may require a more brute force approach. There is also a wealth of tools for you to use whihc lets you customize your gameplay to whichever style you prefer.\n\nThe control scheme works very well, I have tested with a controller & keyboard/mouse. The levels in-game give a good explanation of how to use the controls.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of detail in the environments, given that it's a 2D top down pixel style. Worthy of note is the lighting algorithm, which limits your line of view depending on where you are in a level.\n\nThe sound and music involved are very good. Not too over the top, and it suits the stealth aspect of the game very well.\n\nThere is a wide array of workshop content, and included is a simple & easy to use level editor.\n\nI have not yet tested the multiplayer or the pvp aspect of the game, so I cannot comment on it.\n\nWhile playing this game I found no major bugs, or minor bugs for that matter.\n\nDefinitely try this game if you like platformers in the stealth genre. It should give you a few good hours of gameplay for the main gampaign acts, more if you try to get 100% completion on each level.","May 13, 2014","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's simple, yet complex at the same time- And each mission is unique, so you won't feel like you are repeating the same thing over and over again, and with each different class means a different way of finishing the mission! No matter your skill, It gets harder as you go along, so you're guaranteed to face a challenge at some point. As for faults, personally, if any, is going to have to be with Multiplayer. Anybody can join, beginners or advanced, so each time is different. But, it lacks challenge. A team-member can be reckless and set off all the guards and what not, or everyone can go off and do their own thing, and the mission can still be completed, I wish it could be more along the lines of, one wrong move and your entire mission will fail, hence forcing teamwork.

The stealth mechanics are well implemented and the different Thieves all have different playstyles and abilities. The stock story is really fun and even more when playing with friends. You can get a solid 30 hours out of the stock story without going for all trophies. After the regular story, you can play in zombie mode, where stealth isn't as big of a factor as on-the-fly decision making. Whether you are playing alone or with friends, I would recommend this game to you.","September 8, 2014","true","52.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved the story and the game also included many nerveracking and hard dilemmas.

It's a top down sneak game with a wide array of characters to choose from.  You play a few levels and it's really easy, and you think "oh, this'll be an easy 100%."\n\nWrong.  There are over 30 levels to complete, and about halfway it starts to ramp up the difficulty.  Guards are everywhere, lasers are everywhere, trip lasers are everywhere, and then later all the lasers have shotguns on them (not kidding.)  Towards the end the difficulty is ramped up so high it's just brutal.\n\nBut it's a good kind of difficulty.  You can't just barrel your way through the game and then get mad when it punishes you.  If you take things slow, plan out your course of action, then even the hardest levels are posssible.\n\n8/10\n\nThere are some sneak elements that're missing but overall a very satisfying game.","June 24, 2015","true","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other: guarding the wealth of some of the most powerful and famous people on the planet. Here are some useful guidelines to performing your job at the level of excellence and thoroughness that our customers have come to expect of us:\n\n- If you should face the possibility of dealing with an intruder, take a few seconds to make extra sure that it wasn't nothing. It was probably nothing.\n- If you are absolutely certain that you have spotted an intruder, but then lose track, don't feel too bad, somebody else has probably taken care of it.\n- If you should suddenly remember being in a firefight and losing sight of intruders mere moments ago - calm down. Go back to your post, and if you should see something again: remember rule #1.\n- Now for the most important rule: potted plants are sacred and must never be disturbed or looked at.\n- Do you think you saw somebody walk behind a potted plant? Maybe even four people? Do you think that you could find out for sure if you just, you know, looked at the plant? WELL TOUGH LUCK, DUMBASS, YOU HAD BETTER MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE FIRST SO GO BACK AND DO YOUR DUTY.\n- Somebody tried to hide behind a potted plant while you were in a firefight and you're absolutely 100% completely sure he is still there? FINE. SHOOT AT THE PLANT. See how you feel about it when we cut your paycheck, vacation and transfer you to guarding the basement toilets for the next 30 years, PLANTKILLER.\n- Also sacred? VENTS. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT MESS WITH THE VENTS. If an intruder is going inside a vent, DO NOT PURSUE. DO NOT SHOOT AT THE VENT. Do you know how to fix a vent? Cause I sure don't. SO DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING CAUSE ALL OF US TO SUFFOCATE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO.\n- Finally, if you happen to shoot an intruder, do. not. touch. the. body. You probably didn't attend any biology classes so allow me to break it down for you: dead bodies carry HORRIBLE TERRIBLE DISEASES. Leave them exactly where they drop and return to your station immediately. Somebody better equipped to handle the situation than your plant-killing vent-shooting ♥♥♥ is surely going to come and take care of it. We have found that bodies have a tendency to disappear more quickly when left unattended.\n\nWith these simple guidelines you should have a blast in your new job! In light of recent unexpected mortality spikes we hope that you understand that we had to revoke all life insurance policies for new employees."\n\n\n[[On a more serious note, if you have a bunch of friends to play then Monaco is a funny, challenging and surprisingly complex co-op heist game, featuring a nice soundtrack and multiple free expansions.]]","June 17, 2015","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can try to stay hidden the entire heist, or burst into a ball of flaming rage while you kill everyone on the level. Either way, it makes for a fun and fast-pased game with so many little "tricks", such as secret passages, unmentioned abilities, and even just the variation of time it take to collect a certain "loot container" (safe, jewelry case, ATM, stack of cash, etc.). The top-down perspective gives the game a very unique style, especially since this top-down format is being used with a game full of action and stealth. And even though the Guardarme are tough, every level is very possible to beat, as long as you take the right paths, hide in the right bushes, and have the perfect balance of secrecy and lethality.","June 17, 2015","true","91.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Amazing soundtrack that changes according to the current situation and has a great heist feel. The visuals are good, colours are nice but when things get hectic, it's pretty hard to see and usually things get a bit clutterd. But who cares about that in a game like this? It's dirt cheap on sales too.

This is one of the indie sensations like Fez and Bastion that were being talked about and were winning awards before the game was even released, so it would be CRIMINAL (pardon the pun) to ignore a game with as much accolades as Monaco.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around each level being a bit like a puzzle.  There are guards, security cameras, alarms, motion detectors, and other things that you have to bypass in order to get the gold, documents, or money and escape.  Each player gets to choose a different thief that specializes in different things; every thief can do everything necessary to beat a mission, but the Lockpick can pick locks and safes much faster, the Pickpocket can gather gold much more safely than others, the Mole can break through walls, and so on.  Choosing your specialist comes down to playstyle more than necessity, which is very nice since that means your team can be built around what everyone likes most instead of needing to play this or that character.  This really lets people get into the game by picking the burglar that they think is coolest or most fun.\n\nImportant note: By no means is this a game that depends on flawless execution.  The most fun is when the alarm inevitably goes off and you and your friends scramble trying to grab the money and still escape, with an army of guards chasing you the entire way.  These are the most enjoyable moments of the game, where everything has gone wrong and you're still desperately trying to get the money and escape while everyone is laughing and trying to hide and being shot at.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spyder638/recommended/113020/","spyder638","Spyder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spyder638/","507 products in account","Monaco takes the style of the classic pacman gameplay where you collect loot in a top down view and makes it 10 times more fun, involved, and frantic, wither you're playing alone, or with friends.\n\nThe goal of each level is to go through a series of "floors" of a location and collect all the trophies, then escape. However, this is quite easily done, and most if not all players will eventually decide to start clearing floors, which involves you collecting all the coins on each floor, as well as the trophies, before moving onto the next. Clearing a whole level is a fun challenge that rewards you with a harder version of that level.\n\nThe game plays quite differently on Singleplayer than it does on Multiplayer most of the time. If you're someone who loves stealth and likes to take it slowly and perfectly, then singleplayer is for you, where some obsticles will require a small plan if you want to get past it unnoticed. Multiplayer is more fast paced, with almost always something going wrong.  You'll quickly find 4 players running around the level hiding in bushes and reviving each other while being chased by dogs, helicopters, guards and more - it's a great laugh.\n\nThe game has a whole bunch of content to keep you going for hours - just look at my playtime - 100 hours (almost!). There's 3 campaigns, each of which can be played on a normal mode, and a zombie mode where even civillians try to kill you, then there's custom levels, which are made by you and other players alike. Custom levels means there's a level editor which will also keep you busy if that's your thing - its loads of fun to design a place to rob, believe me!\n\nAll in all, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play for an hour or two whenever you want. When you start out give it a few hours so you can get used to the art style, which can confuse a lot of people at first, and make sure you play more than the first few levels - they're mainly just tutorial levels!","November 26, 2013","true","112.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pedjathegamer/recommended/113020/","pedjathegamer","Ey,Don't Act Dumb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pedjathegamer/","138 products in account","Monaco is a unique take on the Heist genre and I applaud it.\n\nStory\n-There are a total of 49 story missions divided into 4 campaigns - Locksmith's Story(17 missions), Pickpocket's Story(16 missions), Origins(8 missions), Fin(8 missions). You can choose to do these missions in 3 different modes: Enhanced, Classic, Zombie. The Enhanced and Classic levels are practically the same except that some layout and AI changes have been made to the levels in Enhanced mode to make them easier.\n\n-The general story follows a group of thieves(The Locksmith, The Lookout, The Cleaner and The Pickpocket) as they finish various jobs for money or other things. As the story progresses, new members join the group, The Gentleman, The Hacker, The Mole, and the Redhead. The actual story is told by two members of the original cast - The Locksmith and the Pickpocket. They both share their versions of what they've done to an inspector. Those stories are very different in difficulty and actual narration.\n\nLocksmith's Story\n\n-Narrated mostly by the Locksmith. The "Easy" mode of this game if you ask me, and  the levels are similiar to the Pickpocket's story.\n\nPickpocket's Story\n\n-Mostly narrated by the Pickpocket. The "Hard" versions of the missions from the Locksmith's story. Levels are fairly similiar but there are still some major differences. It includes one of the greatest twists that I have ever seen. SPOILER ALERT:The first crew(Locksmith,Lookout,Pickpocket,Cleaner) are the same people as the the second crew(Gentleman,Mole,Hacker,Redhead). The original crew was made up by the Gentleman to avoid arrest.\n\nOrigins\n\n- Narrated by the Lookout talking to an Inspector.  Explains why the thieves started doing what they're doing. For them, the law doesn't apply until a "moral debt" is repaid to them. The Lookout, for example, does this because Haitian soldiers stole all her family's possessions.\n\nFin\n\n-The Finale.Narrated by two inspectors chasing the thieves. The missions are mostly cleaning up evidence from previous jobs and escaping police officers that are looking for you.\n\nGameplay\n-The gameplay mostly focuses on stealth - going in guns blazing is still possible but not\nrecommended. Unlike other top down view games, this game doesn't allow you to see around corners unless your character leaves cover. The game instead gives you a blueprint of parts of the map you've already been to but you can't see where guards, civilians, and other useful items are.\n\nYou are allowed to sneak and that will greatly reduce the distance from which guards and civilians spot you. Controls are very simple and most of the interactions require you to just walk into something and hold the same button until it's done.\n\nAt the beginning of each level, you are presented with backpacks that hold various items. The backpacks can hold shotguns, SMGs, smoke grenades, C4, EMP, Wrenches that complete any action instantly, and even a rocket launcher and many more. This equipment is not mandatory to complete the mission, but highly recommended. Collecting 10 coins grants one more "ammo". A somewhat unrealistic mechanic is in the game - you can hide in bushes to hide from guards, though you if you are spotted while entering it or they will attack you. Some enemies are overpowered, like the Shotgun SWAT and the RPG Soldiers but they only appear on maps where they are generally easy to avoid.\n\nIt's possible to beat this game in singleplayer, but co-op with a mic is highly recommended. Local co-op is also available, so that's a huge plus. Planning how to enter a building and how to disable an annoying laser to get the trophy with a friend feels amazing.\n\nThe game, if you haven't noticed, also has a workshop. Sadly, we are not allowed to create weapons or character skins or props(you can, however, modify these in the game files) but in exchange we can create maps. Oh yes, your custom heist. It's really easy to learn how to use the ingame editor so you'll find yourself making a complex mission after 5 minutes of practice.\n\nCharacters\n-The thieves in Monaco all have different special abilites, and that is, in my opinion, the greatest strength of the game. Though some are more powerful than others, each character has its usefulness.\n\n-Original Crew\n\n-The Locksmith: Can open locked doors, safes, ATMs and cash registers faster than any class\n-The Lookout: While sneaking, special icons represent enemies and civilians on the blueprint part of the map, allowing players to sense danger before it appears.\n-The Cleaner: Can knock guards and civilians unconscious and they remain in that state for a short period of time(~30 seconds).\n-The Pickpocket: His pet monkey follows him around and collects any coins that he misses.\n\n-New Members\n\n-The Gentleman: Can disguise himself while hidden allowing him to traverse areas that are normally off limits. Needs to stay away from guards and civilians or his cover will be blown almost instantly. (My favourite character.)\n-The Hacker: Can insert viruses into power outlets(crazy, right?) which allows him to disable security.\n-The Mole: Can dig through walls allowing you to get behind enemy lines.\n-The Redhead: Going near one guard,civilian(even female), or even a dog charms them and causes them to follow you around, allowing your team to get around easier.\n\nSpecial:\n\n-Blonde: The Redhead but when she was younger. Guards only attack when they get close. Only available in Redhead's origin mission and custom missions.\n\nFinal Verdict\nStory: 9/10 - Considering that it's not the main focus of the game(and it shouldn't be), it's surprisingly good including the twist at the end.\nGameplay: 10/10 - Read the Gameplay segment.\nCharacters: 10/10 - The game doesn't give little information, but at the same time doesn't overload us. The perfect middle.\n\nOverall:\n\n10/10","January 12","true","154.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

This is a great game for casual gamers like myself. With my short attention span for games nowadays, it's awesome to come across one that is so simple in concept that it is easy to pick up. Missions range from a few minutes to maybe 45 minutes, and it's just perfect.\n\nEven when you're done with the campaigns, there is a plethora of custom missions created by dedicated players. Of course, not all are winners, but there are definitely some very fun ones to play with friends.\n\nAnd of course, that brings me to the best aspect of this game: Co-op play. It's hard to find great co-op action these days, and Monaco delivers. I just love that you really have to work together to finish, period. If just one player is dead, you simply cannot progress. It's also fun to have to constantly be saving each other's asses...especially when you have a friend who likes to throw himself into the throes of danger just so he can shout "WHOOOOOOOOOOO!" And then he gets blasted in the face by shotguns.\n\nAs someone who doesn't even play games that much anymore, Monaco was a delightful surprise that will keep me playing as long as the custom missions keep coming out.","March 27, 2014","true","110.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
