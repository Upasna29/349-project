I'm so close to getting a joystick, just so I can play this stupid, annoying, yet really entertaining game.\nIf I have to hear this smug Admiral tell me one more time, how my "score isn't adequate" and how I'll "have to repeat the mission" I might snap.\n\nSo far I've "met" Sulu and Kirk, blown my ship to pieces a couple of times, really don't like my inadequate pilot. I mean come on, do I really need to tell you to avoid mines? Really? Isn't that like the first thing you learn in the academy, "don't hit stuff with your ship"? Also, what's up with my engineer? Telling me how I've lost shields like ever 10 seconds, but doesn't say anything about losing phasers? I mean there is a reason why I sacrificed the shields buddy, we're trying to shoot something with our phasers here. It's not like I'm asking you to bring the torpedos online, since they seem to be a random feature that didn't actually make in onboard my ship, I bet there is an empty torpedo bay, decorated with pretty notes saying "wish I could be there". Stupid torpedos.\nBut seriously guys, we're on the same team here. It's not just my life support that fails, it's our life support.\n\nSo to sum up this really awesome review; the controls are a mess, the textures take you back to 1992, losing sucks, will definitely play again (maybe with a joystick, if I can find a DeLorean to grab the one I bought in the nineties).\nThis game brings back all the memories of losing at star trek games in the previous centuries. But never was a win sweeter, than after being being told how you are "not adequate".\nWe'll see who's adequate Admiral. We'll see.\n\nGosh, I wish the Maquis existed, just so I could join them and show the stupid Admiral how "not adequate" I can be.","May 9, 2015","true","1.9"," 88 of 98 people (90%) found this review helpful 100 people found this review funny","90","88","98","100","5"

So fun to have it on steam, after all these years. It still is one of the best games on the genre, and a must for any star trek fan.\n\nPROS:\nGreat storyline, awesome production value with star trek actors on the cutscenes, lots of fights but also a lot of peaceful endings on missions. Great soundtrack/graphics (for the time this game was originally launched), and it makes you think on how to solve some missions problems.\n\nCONS:\nOnly cons I would list is the lack of optimization for new pc's (can't change resolution, which is fine for me but I know that some people would bother with) and steam overlay is buggy, when you shift+tab it freezes the game. Still, great game!","May 9, 2015","true","5.7"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","35","38","3","1"

You are a student captain attending classes in hopes of graduating and commanding your own starship. At the beginning of the game, you are given a crew that you have to manage while still accomplishing your missions. Each individual is in charge of a system and their view of you will determine their performance while on the ship.\n\nThe game is broken up into two sections the simulator missions and the academy where you interact with teachers and students. The academy is a bunch of videos with dialog choices. The simulator is where you will spend 90% of the game. For certain missions, you get to choose which ship you captain. This will determine the difficulty of that mission.\nIf you have never played a simulator game, the controls will be overly complicated. There are a lot of things you have control over which requires plenty of buttons. This is one of the many great features about this game. You control navigation, engineering, scans, combat, etc. Say you are in a fight and your shields are being depleted. You can switch to the engineering and increase power to shields by diverting other systems power. The game makes great use of the many features you see in the show and movies.\n\nSince this is an academy, the missions are not all combat and depending on how you deal with some of the scenarios, the outcomes will be different.\n\nThe voice acting is quite cheesy for today’s standards. Back then they were a little over the top. Other than that, the sounds for the starships and combat are decent. You can tell that they did not try to update the sounds from the original game. The background music is not intrusive and goes well with the game environment.\nGraphics…. Well, like I said, this is an optimized version of a 1997 game. The cut-scenes have been optimized for our larger displays but not updated to look any better (trust me, I am playing this on a 4k 55” TV). The 3D models are quite basic and are not very detailed.\n\nWith all that said, once you get used to the controls and are in the missions, you will easily overlook the outdated graphics and be concentrating on finishing of those cloaked Klingons that ambushed you while investigating that colony.\n\nThe game has its faults, but they are mostly due to how old the game is. Other than that, this is definitely a great game for any Star Trek fan who wants to feel what it is like to captain a starship. Just wish they also ported the expansion disk " Chekov's Lost Missions" to complete the experiance.\n\nAlso: if you kept a copy of your old game saves, they work perfectly in this version. You can load them up and visit your favorite missions or continue where you left off.","December 5, 2015","true","26.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

Certainly, it ended being a great game but did not end up meeting the hype and high expectations. Years ago, I bought the physical copy of Starfleet Academy but didn’t realize that a working joystick was essential and all the controls you had to memorize was overwhelming at the time so I gave up on the first mission.\n\nImagine my excitement when I picked it up on sale recently and now I finally get to give it a second chance. As a big Trek fan, I really enjoyed it. The basic story is you play as cadet on the command track who is working his way through Starfleet Academy by completing a bunch of simulations and at the same time, you must manage all the different personalities of your crew. The game does a good job with its FMV (full motion video) cutscenes which were common in so many 90s games though some of the acting needs improvement. Periodically during these cutscenes, you will have to make several choices which will change the direction of the story and affect your crew’s performance. William Shatner, George Takei and Walter Koenig do a fantastic job reprising their old roles from TOS.\n\nYou could tell the simulations/missions were TOS era “let’s blow them up” as they were really heavy on combat with a bit of diplomacy thrown in on the side. Actually too heavy on combat even for Kirk himself as some missions have you destroying several ships to complete your objective. I would have liked to see a better balance of diplomacy and action. The starships feel too fast but I know Bridge Commander refined what this game tried to do. I really enjoyed being able to play simulations of my favorite episodes/movies like Balance of Terror and The Wrath of Khan and even the infamous Kobayashi Maru scenario. Targeting subsystems was done very well. My main complaint with the simulations is that they do not give you a grade if you pass the mission so I have no idea how well I did (barely passed or aced it) and for a game called Starfleet Academy, grading should be really obvious.\n\nOverall I highly recommend Starfleet Academy to Star Trek fans especially if you are in the mood for starship combat in the TOS era. I would love to see Steam release the expansion Chekov’s Lost Missions and Klingon Academy next.\n","May 2","true","32.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You carry on with the mission only to get back to starbase and fail. This sucks a bit and on occasion I go play something else.\nBut after a while you learn exactly what to do and in what order, how to get through the mission quite fast (skip the talking and videos), so it is very much a learning process of "how to keep the game happy and pass the mission", not so much "being so good you can accomplish all missions without retrying"\nAlso sometimes the AI is very strong (suddenly hit by 2-4 torpedos and your Miranda is gone), sometimes the same AI (same mission) is very weak and you can manoeuvre in their blind spot out of weapons angle, so luck can play a part.\n\nStill very enjoyable, great to see the ST:TOS actors in the cut scenes, the cadet videos are not as fun as they were when I was 20 yrs old in 1998 though, there is some truly over the top aggressive bad mood acting, lol.\nOnly 1 crash (CTD) so far, which is much better than my WIn95 box on which SFA suffered frequent crashes!\nAbout half way through now, 8 hrs played on medium difficulty.\nI cant wait for KA if that gets re-released, just prey that have multiplayer for it :)\n\nFADM Evans\nIFF\n(lol)","January 5","true","12.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
