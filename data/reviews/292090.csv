Well this game might change your mind because for starters it is made by one of the former employees of LucasArts (Technically in the 80s & 90s) named David Fox a.k.a employee #3, David's influence for making this awesome game was Rube Goldberg's granddaughter Jennifer George, The puzzles feel original & fresh, The price is right & it is very educational to young or old so overall I highly suggest getting this game even though it only has 18 puzzles but keep your fingers crossed for the steam workshop so we can all make cool contraptions just like Rube did. (If you want more info about the godfather of contraptions then go to this website http://www.rubegoldberg.com for history lessons)","April 24, 2014","true","5.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

For the price this is a nice pickup and easy to recommend.  Artwork is well done, aesthetics are very nice.  Great casual game with some challenging mind benders for puzzles. Easy thumbs up. A lot of bang for you buck and high on entrainment values.","April 23, 2014","true","0.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

In this tablet port, you get to recreate 18 cartoons by the master of convoluted contraptions himself, Rube Goldberg. (Though the Brits among us will be waiting for a Heath Robinson sequel.)\n\nOn the surface, this looks like yet another "incredible machine", but  here the gameplay is less about sandbox-style experimentation and more about "how on earth are these parts supposed to fit together". Slice a turkey, and all you have is a rooster, a penguin, a sand dispenser, a see-saw, a chicken salad, a bucket, a fan, and some string. Yes, that makes sense. Eventually. And not only is it immensely satisfying to figure out, it also makes me smile.\n\nSuch is the effect of the inspired work of Mr. Goldberg himself, some of whose contraptions are by now over 80 years old. The game pays homage to him in the best way possible: by bringing some of his best creations to life, and by letting us puzzle over them (ample hints provided if you need them).","April 23, 2014","true","10.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/292090/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","A take on the contraption making genre which is simultaneously both classic and new. Where games like The Incredible Machine have a more open approach to designing any solution that works for a given problem, there is always a single correct solution to a puzzle in Rube Works: The one with the most complex steps. Incidentally, these are also the funniest solutions.\n\nThat's not to say that those are the only solutions worth finding, and I've been having a lot of fun finding the different shortcuts to the puzzles after completing the game. So even though there are only 18 levels, there is some replay value and I feel like the game is well worth its price. Hopefully it might also get a level editor and Steam Workshop integration in the future, as I'd love to solve more puzzles of this kind.","April 29, 2014","true","8.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/292090/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Rube Works is a short puzzle game, which is similiar to Incredible Machines games by idea, yet it has more of quest-like puzzles logic.\n\nIn 18 puzzles you are equired to build "Rube Goldberg"-style machines, which means "use as many items as possible in wacky way to solve a simple thing". Not only made of just mundane physics things, but you also get to use animals and some other unusual things. 12 of puzzles are based on real drawings of Rube Goldberg, so if you are 0.01% of all people who studied his works, then congratulations, you spoiled yourself. For other 99.99% of people it will be new stuff. The other 6 puzzles are completely new, made for this game, designed in same fashion.\n\nAs said, puzzles are designed to be more of quest-style one. There is pretty much no such thing as having to place stuff accurately, most often it gets automatically placed into right spot, unlike Incredible Machine style games, where some puzzles were all about accurate placement. And yes, I am talking about 'accurate' placing, as in, few-pixels off.\nIt doesn't follow same logic of introducing every elements and then using them for whole game. Doesn't make players to figure how to make machine work based on already well-known "bricks".\nInstead the game is all about figuring out what "bricks" do. It often gives you different sets of items to use. It does reuse some assets once or twice, but it sometimes gives them a new use once again. In this way it heavily reminds me more of non-sense puzzles from classic adventure games, where you had to do something unexpected or never before explained to you. For example, find out that sword can be sticked to the firework rocket. Placement of some items are a bit obious (only one spot where they fit, for example), and you have to use them all anyway to get the maximum rating.\n\nAnd yes, you can use as little items as possible and do ridiculously lame shortcuts, you will get to the next puzzles anyway. I would not recommend beating the game this way, not challenging or satificatory at all.\nAchievements are quite easy and you will naturally get most of them while beating the game.\n\nThe art also looks quite neat for a such small game, things look quite lovely and cartoonish. The physics look wacky, an animal dropped somewhere will be rolling like a ball, doing flying animation and whining. But there is so much you can do and need to do with them in such small game, so who cares. The lgiht humor is in the game too, explaining what is going on in the contraption. Even descriping when things don't go in the right way ("eggs don't hatch on fire, good thinking"). The only thing is that there is only one music in whole game, used for menu. Gameplay itself will be followed only by ambient sound effects, wind or rain or such. But hey, at least you will not feel annoyed by some ever-repeating soundtrack.\n\nSo yes. It's kinda like Incredible Machines but different. Will make you think like in quest games. And it's fun enough. This small game will not occupy you for too long, doesn't provide much of progression, more like collection of same-level puzzles, doesn't have much of replayblity. A small neat game.","April 5, 2015","true","8.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics are very good as well as the music both are very reminiscent of the style one would suspect rube goldberg may have utilized if he were still around creating cartoons today. This game both makes you think and is very amusing at the same time.

And if you didn't, you'll still enjoy it!\n\nI never knew of the mobile version, so I went in pretty new. I can see how it was a mobile game based on how the controls worked, but it wasn't too difficult using a mouse. The developer might be looking into options to make it a bit more mouse friendly, but it didn't take away any enjoyment from playing it.\n\nThe game can be addicting like chips, so you might go through it quickly just to get that "one more" puzzle done, so I try to play only 1 or 2 puzzles a day to extend my enjoyment from it.\n\nVery fun game to play at a great price and across three platforms.\n\nNow, excuse me, I have to find a cat, a rubber ball, some cheese, a hamster, wet socks, a plate, some string, and a scale...I seemed to have misplaced my keys.","April 29, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
