No other game offers the same level of insane chaos this game can muster.\n\nFrom the moment it began as a mod after being backward engineered by Trix it was obvious to many that the potential was huge. During the beta tests Just Cause 2 Multiplayer gained a cult following and developed a keen audience eager to play and experiment with others in a massively diverse and interesting game world.\n\nPersonally I have played Just Cause 2 Multiplayer in so many different ways it's astounding that it really is just one game. I've played with friends experimenting with the grapple and laughed my head off. I've arranged Destruction Derby that were so successful the developers made a gamemode out of it. I've participated in some of the biggest, most insane mass racing, skydiving and faction wars I've ever witnessed in a game. I've performed solo and combination stunts with friends while co-ordinating over voice chat. I've went on a kill spee with my trusty sniper rifle and noscpoe killed hundred of enemies (other players at the airport).\n\nIt truely is an amazing game with almost no limitations: the biggest is probably your imagination.\n\nIf you thought Just Cause 2 was good then you're gonna be blown away by the multiplayer with 100+ players on a server.

As of writing this up, Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod is still in BETA, but it is also released to the public. Get your key at: http://www.jc-mp.com/\n\nRight now there is no story, no structure, no rhyme or reason, other than pure chaos. If you don't want to just run around mindlessly, hopping in vehicles, flying around, blowing stuff up, shooting random strangers, and seeing all hell break loose in front of your eyes, then stay away. For everyone else, come join the fun! As of now, I only see 1 server. But it is listed as X/3000 players. Yes, it would seem up to 3,000 people can be on this server at a time. I mean, how stupid would it be with just 64 players? Panau is big. I mean REAL BIG! Luckily, you can transport to different places at will with easy commands. /tp + the name of an area will instantly teleport you. For example: /tp airport2 will take you to a military airport, where you can steal some airplanes. That is if you don't get mowed down by other players first. There also other commands, like /fp which will actually allow you to play in a first person mode. And oddly, it works pretty well.\n\nSadly, the community for the beta is pure garbage. The chat box will be flooded with spam pretty much 99% of the time. So ignore it like a normal person would. Don't expect any questions to be answered within the game.\n\nThis mod of course piggybacks off of Just Cause 2, and the download is extremely small, racking in at under 20mb. Just make sure you have Just Cause 2 installed first.\n\nAs of now there are no real gameplay modes, other than the ability to join races. Everything else is just one gigantic and enormous free for all.\n\nSee you all in game!\n\nThis is just a small impression, and not an actual review. I will be doing a full review after the mod is officially out of beta.","December 9, 2013","true","7.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","1"

Depending on the server, you can usually just roam around and explore Panau at your leisure. To be honest, I use the game as more of a chat room than a game these days.\n\nOverall, if you're into unique multiplayer experiences, or Just Cause in general, this is a must-have.","April 1","true","513.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You will have to purchase the full game in order to use this mod. What other gamers have done with this mod is take the Just Cause 2 gaming experience to a whole new level of multiplayer fun.\n\nPros    Hundreds of other players in one game world. Thousand players possible!\nServer commands like teleporting, first-person view, increasing vehicle speed, and much, much more.\nCustom game modes like racing, crafting, destruction derby, and tron all possible in one server.\nCustom shops that allow you to spawn vehicles, weapons, and server items for free or using the server currency.\nRoleplay servers.\nAlmost lag free on the most populated server.\nServer chat and admins.\nPassive mode if you don't want to be killed (but you can't kill anyone else.)\nCons\nIf there is lag between you and the other players, it will affect combat and some vehicle interaction.\nCombat between players is largely left to vehicles and snipers/rocket launchers.\nNot nearly as active as it was during beta testing or at release.\nThe map is so big that finding anyone outside of the main airport and some key locations may not be common enough.\nDonor only items and features on individual servers.\nNPCs may have been removed.\nConclusionI played for a few hours during the beta and then just now. A lot has improved since the beta but player count has predictably gone down. Still, it's hard not to have fun with this mod if you are looking to mess around with other people on a huge sandbox. I only visited one server during my play today--the largest one--but I'm sure the other servers can offer unique experiences of their own. Much of my time was spent playing the minigames like racing, tron game, and destruction derby. I also spent some time flying around using the speed boost console command (or key) to make cars fly and crash planes into other players.\n\nThe multiplayer that the base game needed is here in a very well done way.","January 23, 2015","true","16.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

A multiplayer mod for Just Cause 2. Now you can play with other people in Panau. Some servers have objectives, others don't. Gone are the missions, and all you're left with is a world to explore and wreak havoc on with other people. Here are a few reasons why you should get the MP mod.\n\n1. You're playing Just Cause 2 with other people. Honestly, if that isn't a good point, I don't know what is.\n2. It's free.\n3. The download size is like 30 MB (other than the space JC2 takes up). It won't take up much space and it's awesome.\n4. Some servers have some great stuff. AKA Boosts, which can make your vehicle go insanely fast, making boats fly and driving too much fun. Also, some servers have buy menus, where you can choose whatever item you want, whatever character model, which provides endless possiblities. Also, racing, manhunt matches, and teleporting to places in the map.\n\nThe MP mod is everything you love about JC2 but with people playing with you. The only "problems" with this is that it crashes like no tomorrow. It could be 5 minutes after launching the game, it could be 50. Crashes WILL happen, and the risk is heightened by boosting into walls and ♥♥♥♥, which I do a lot of. Also, the chats in the big servers are plagued with people arguing about alienware, so don't expect having a fun conversation. But seriously, if you have JC2, and you want to play it with friends, download this. This is basically an open-world romp you can play with friends until GTA Online comes out for the PC.\n","February 1, 2014","true","45.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","4"

The graphics are beyond good and are rendered pretty good. The unlimited possibilities in multiplayer mode allows for so much gameplay and the use of different types of vehicles in different terrains. The physics aren't to shabby and are actually pretty fun to watch your motorcycle fall from a cliff, plunge in an ocean,  or ram into the side of a building. You can practically drive a boat through land with boost of course. There isn't much storyline to the mod though but I have yet to get bored of the mod. Better than Just Cause 2 in my opinion. I'd recommend this game to those that want to screw around and ride fast through amazing sceneries. It's a favorite pastime of mine.\n8/10\n","October 26, 2014","true","33.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The multiplayer mod is all those things as well - however...\n\nThere are no NPCs. That means no civilians to hassle or cops to hassle you. At first I was annoyed by this (what's the point of a sandbox destruction game if there is no one to stop you?) but I realized that in the bigger servers, other players function just as well as civilians and cops. The server I was in had over a thousand people, and the max capacity of the server was apparently 10,000 - but who knows if that's really possible. Anyway, some of those 1,000 people will be jerks and try to kill you for no reason, some will just want to blow ♥♥♥♥ up with you. Still, lack of NPCs might hurt long-term enjoyment of the game and will definitely make private/smaller servers feel like you're in a very empty world.\n\nThere are no missions/quests. You can still run around the country blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and working towards 100%ing the map, but the story mode has been completely extricated from the game. This, plus the previous point, means its strictly a sandbox game now. Make your own fun. That sorta thing. If you played minecraft for ten minutes, said 'what's the point?' and uninstalled, you probably won't like this and that's fine!\n\nThat being said - if you're the type of person who can make their own fun, you'll love this. Lots of racing ranging from the serious to wacky (I finished 17th in a 25-man limousine race). PvP and car hijacking from other players enabled. I was cruising along in my tank when some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grappling hooked on top and yelled "GOGOGO" and then I drove us into a river. when we swam to the shore, he shot me right in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ face.\n\n"Why?" I asked.\n\n"we ride together we die together"\n\nget this ♥♥♥♥ing game RIGHT NOW\n","December 16, 2013","true","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And at the moment, this mod is in it's early stages.\nSince it's an early phase, you can expect a few issues (and I will list a few and explain);\n\n*Random Crashing\n*Online Lag (common of course)\n*Errors (I'll get to that later)\n\n=========Errors=========\nSome errors of the game are things like launching the game.\nI've had no problems whatsoever with launching but people do get errors of trying to launch the game like "Fatal Error" and the "DirectX Error". PcGamingWiki could have your solution  here. [pcgamingwiki.com]\nThe errors of the mod are easy to work around, some just can't do anything about it. Especially that it's only a mod, you can't expect it to be so good.\n\n=========Online Lag=========\nThen again, it's a mod. You can't expect it to be so good. The mod creators try to fix the game. But one common thing in most games will be Online Lag. The mod is not optimized at this point to be able to crush the Online Lag in this mod, and the creators might not be able to fix it (but have hope!).\n\n\n=========Random Crashing=========\nIt would be most likely you would happen to have crashed randomly during the mod. It's a bit devastating for the crash to happen as you were probably just doing something like vehicle surfing or just killing a friend for a bounty. The mod creators are most likely trying to fix this problem, and yet the mod is still in it's early stages.\n\nSo there are some flaws to this mod, but it's still in the premature period.\nI'd still give the game ago although as it is fun. Most servers (and I hope most servers) allow you to do such things as:\n*Change into a player model (let's say a Stripper? And I don't mean a female stripper...)\n*Buy Vehicles such as boats, cars & helicopters.\n*Run & Gun (to start a deathmatch?).\n*Drive Vehicles....\n*Grapple much?\n*Bounties\n*More driving...\n*TELEPORT!\n*Free-roam (of course).\n\nAnd these are the nice additions to the mod!\nOther servers will have other types of plugins for you to use...\nSo I'd reccomend giving the mod a go (in my opinion)!\nSo thanks for reading!","July 4, 2014","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

JC2:MP should be the reason you buy Just Cause 2.  It is similar to GTA 5 in the way that, you played the original for the single player but now with the new game, the multiplayer is the better part that everyone is buying the game for.  The multiplayer mod of JC2 lets you use almost any character model and weapon from JC2 so you get some pretty weird weird combos like, a tall, deformed colonel dual wielding bubble guns.  You can dual wield any weapon in this mod which is pretty overpowered at times.  I find that using the Baby Panay(JC2:MP's equivalent to Oddjob) with dual wielded AR's is the best combo if you are looking to go on a huge kill streak, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off everyone you kill.  There are also some servers where people make huge groups and go at war with each other.  It can be pretty fun to get your group of 20 people and go raid another group, seeing explosions and gunfire everywhere.  Long story short, this mod is way better than the actual game.","February 19, 2015","true","27.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This isn't due to the game being well-constructed for a multiplayer experience, as this game is a mod allowing a single player game to be played in groups. This isn't an MMO, this isn't a team-based game, and when playing the multiplayer mod I honestly feel there is no set of objectives to fulfill and no real purpose.\n\nAnd this is EXACTLY where this mod shines.\nYou don't need to have a purpose to mess around driving like crazy with some friends, moving from vehicle to vehicle at 100 MPH, or falling from 4500 feet up and landing by using a hookshot instead of a parachute.  As an open world multiplayer experience, Just Cause 2 Multiplayer is wonderful for just how crazy dumb it can get, in all the best of ways.\nThis is especially true in instances that have such things as buying vehicles for free and the boost function.\n\nTo sum it up :\nI flew a boat into the stratosphere.

And if you don't own Just Cause 2, you really should consider grabbing it! It's on sale frequently and even when it's not on sale it's absolutely worth it.\n\nBoth the Singleplayer and the Multiplayer are an absolute blast. In multiplayer it's just pure, complete chaos, and it's absolutely brilliant. Have you ever fantasized about spawning a boat in mid air, then proceed to accelerate up to 700 km/h and fly through the air while telling gravity to suck it? No? Well, either way you still can!\n\nMy favorite part of this mod is letting me pretend I'm a icecream salesman driving a Tuk Tuk-Laa vehicle fitted with a booster to make it go ridiculously fast. So fast, that I usually end up blowing the thing up within a minute. But that's okay, because it takes me just 2 seconds to spawn a new one and carry on!\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is: Get this game, and this mod.

Yes please!\n\nThis free add-on for Just Cause 2 turns the originally single-player only game into a massive multiplayer slugfest. Able to handle hundreds (or even thousands) of players simultaneously in the same game world, the mod thrusts players into a madcap symphony of combat and destruction.\n\nParachute into the Panau International Airport and marvel at the aerial acrobatics of would-be pilots and the antics of those on the ground who would foil their lofty plans. Jump into a race at the racetrack, or join the fray in a demolition derby in the iconic communication dish. Use the infamous grappling hook to throw a monkey wrench into the works.\n\nSummon weapons and vehicles to add your own mischief to the mix, and choose from a variety of character models & skins to customize your appearance.\n\nExtendable via Lua scripts on both the client and server, this mod brings an incredible multiplayer experience to a game nobody thought would ever have multiplayer at all.

I will admit that the majority of the servers have a very similar playstyle which consists mostly of "Go around and shoot stuff n' ♥♥♥♥...with your friends!" Though I suppose that can be very enjoyable in itself, the main fun I've had with this game are the servers that bring something special to the table:\n\nThere's a server where you can choose one of the three factions from the orignal singleplayer storyline and fight a massive battle to claim the island of Panau. There's a roleplay server where you can choose a civilian job such as a pilot, taxi, merchant, etc., join one of the three gang factions OR the Enforcers/Government faction, collaborate with one of said factions to complete missions and objectives, and, of course, roleplay. There's a server that's dedicated to having all types of races on many different set tracks all over Panau (and, in fact, is one of the least laggiest servers I've yet to play on). There's a server in development (http://www.jc-mp.com/forums/index.php/topic,4859.0.html) where you have to find resources and fight others to survive (I haven't actaully played on this one but it looks pretty cool). Granted, most of these servers are among the spotlighted ones on the serverlist, but I do believe they certainly deserve to be there.\n\nMy main complaint is that this is (normally) very laggy. I can easily get 40-60 FPS in the original JC2, but in this I have to turn down all of the graphical settings yet sometimes I struggle to even get 30. This can make already awkward, what with the way hits register and things, combat even more cumbersome. That said, I would still most definitely recommend playing this mod, or at least giving it a try, rather than leaving it in the dust with the rest of the un-installed tid bits in your Steam library.","June 22, 2014","true","88.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is so much fun when playing with friends and just as good on your own. The grappling hook is one of the best features of the game and allows for easy travel as well as some awesome stunts. All of this, however, would be no where near as good if there was not the option of scripts to mod the game to your will. You can travel at insanely high speeds, make Rico look like a male stripper or spawn in any vehicle, weapon or outfit that you desire and much, much more. It amazes me how this is a community made game, not made by the actual publishers of JC2. Truly spectacular. However, it is not perfect as there are some issues of lag, different players seeing different things and other minor bugs but in the grand scale of things, dont matter in the slightest. In conclusion: I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who wants to buy it as it provides hours of fun and some great laughs as well.

After playing this mod even for a few minutes you will realize why this won Mod DB's mod of 2013. It's simply astonishing watching literally hundreds of players messing around the Islands of Panau at once. The options are simply limitless. Wanna race around the map with your friends? Fight to the end in a deathmatch? Or even just try to blow your mates out of the air in a plane or attack helicopter? It can all be done. Unfortunetely, it all comes at a price of lag and frequent crashes yet hopefully this will be fixed with future patches and updates. For any fan of Just Cause 2 this is a no-brainer, so go out and go play with your friends for a multiplayer experience like no other.\n\nWelcome to the jungle.

Just Cause 2 is a great game on its own and by adding Multiplayer to it, in my opinion is the best idea ever. Though after hours of mindless shenangans, I started to see which parts of the mod are clearly unfinished.\n\nFirst off, the government of Panau give no f#@ks about me blowing up any of their installations. The swarms of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Panausian troops that use to chase me around after pulling down a statue of their height challenged dictator are no where to be found. I see that the mod plans on using chaos to generate Panauan dollars that can be used to buy items off the in game market, similar to the core game is not completed. Currently the items in the item shop doesn't cost anything to buy and can be accessed and obtained instantly anywhere on the islands. This can be annoying in cases where you shoot someone out of the sky only to have them free-fall into a brand new aircraft and fly away. I am looking forward to earning the credits to buy these items, adding a bit of a challenge to the PVP. I hope they add more unlocks such as the different parachute skins, special weapons and vehicles as well as possible boosts. I hope to see this mod eventually completed.","December 31, 2013","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Able to handle hundreds (or even thousands) of players simultaneously in the same game world, the mod thrusts players into a madcap symphony of combat and destruction.\n\nParachute into the Panau International Airport and marvel at the aerial acrobatics of would-be pilots and the antics of those on the ground who would foil their lofty plans. Jump into a race at the racetrack, or join the fray in a demolition derby in the iconic communication dish. Use the infamous grappling hook to throw a monkey wrench into the works.\n\nSummon weapons and vehicles to add your own mischief to the mix, and choose from a variety of character models & skins to customize your appearance.\n\nExtendable via Lua scripts on both the client and server, this mod brings an incredible multiplayer experience to a game nobody thought would ever have multiplayer at all.

It really manages to bring the original game experience into multiplayer almost flawlessly. If you own Just Cause 2, then you've probably already given it a try, if you haven't, do it now! However if you don't own Just Cause 2, I'd suggest buying it, it's really worth it, specially with this amazing mod. I've been to only one server, despite being filled with hundreds of players (though not actually full, since it can hold up to a thousand) there's a very low lag which you can live with, its only slightly annoying during PVP fights (which thrust me, you will get involved in them a LOT), but other than that, it's gorgeous.

If you play it alone, it might bore you after a few minutes. I play this, but I'm not sure if I would pay more the €5. It's a good thing it's free to play, the biggest downside is the lag.

Just Cause 2 is a great game on its own and by adding Multiplayer to it, in my opinion is the best idea ever. Though after hours of mindless shenangans, I started to see which parts of the mod are clearly unfinished.\n\nFirst off, the government of Panau give no f#@ks about me blowing up any of their installations. The swarms of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Panausian troops that use to chase me around after pulling down a statue of their height challenged dictator are no where to be found. I see that the mod plans on using chaos to generate Panauan dollars that can be used to buy items off the in game market, similar to the core game is not completed. Currently the items in the item shop doesn't cost anything to buy and can be accessed and obtained instantly anywhere on the islands. This can be annoying in cases where you shoot someone out of the sky only to have them free-fall into a brand new aircraft and fly away. I am looking forward to earning the credits to buy these items, adding a bit of a challenge to the PVP. I hope they add more unlocks such as the different parachute skins, special weapons and vehicles as well as possible boosts. I hope to see this mod eventually completed.","December 31, 2013","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just Cause 2 is a great game on its own and by adding Multiplayer to it, in my opinion is the best idea ever. Though after hours of mindless shenangans, I started to see which parts of the mod are clearly unfinished.\n\nFirst off, the government of Panau give no f#@ks about me blowing up any of their installations. The swarms of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Panausian troops that use to chase me around after pulling down a statue of their height challenged dictator are no where to be found. I see that the mod plans on using chaos to generate Panauan dollars that can be used to buy items off the in game market, similar to the core game is not completed. Currently the items in the item shop doesn't cost anything to buy and can be accessed and obtained instantly anywhere on the islands. This can be annoying in cases where you shoot someone out of the sky only to have them free-fall into a brand new aircraft and fly away. I am looking forward to earning the credits to buy these items, adding a bit of a challenge to the PVP. I hope they add more unlocks such as the different parachute skins, special weapons and vehicles as well as possible boosts. I hope to see this mod eventually completed.","December 31, 2013","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really manages to bring the original game experience into multiplayer almost flawlessly. If you own Just Cause 2, then you've probably already given it a try, if you haven't, do it now! However if you don't own Just Cause 2, I'd suggest buying it, it's really worth it, specially with this amazing mod. I've been to only one server, despite being filled with hundreds of players (though not actually full, since it can hold up to a thousand) there's a very low lag which you can live with, its only slightly annoying during PVP fights (which thrust me, you will get involved in them a LOT), but other than that, it's gorgeous. Btw, get ready to go into some damn anarchy 'cause that's all I found.\n\ntl;dr - PLAY IT!","December 19, 2013","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's so fun becuase of the possibilities. Jump on your friend' plane, crash your vechicles, have dogfights and so much more. You can spawn many vechicles, and in most servers they are free. If you play it alone, it might bore you after a few minutes. I play this, but I'm not sure if I would pay more the €5. It's a good thing it's free to play, the biggest downside is the lag.

Playing alone is about as interesting as watching grass grow. You may as well play the base game if you are going to do that.\nThere are far to many kids in the servers that try to ruin your good time. If you happend to mistype where you want to teleport to and it shows up in chat, the lonely hearts club starts showing up there like it is a free buffet of smarties for a bunch of fat kids and they just won't give you a break until you move on to soemwhere else.\n\nThe game will dump you for no reason and has a reporting system, so hope hopefully the developers pay attention to that. Once you get dumped a couple times in a row the game will run smooth.\n\nMy advice is get some freinds, get on Teamspeak or whatever you have and have laugh because it can be alot of fun.\n\n\n\n","April 1, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
