It's a call center simulator which has so many balls to juggle, that you'll no doubt need to restart a few times before you finally get the balance right. People answering the calls, computers exploding, walls cracking, contracts to fulfil... and while it's all a bit overwhelming and ridiculous at times, there's something about it that really makes me want to crack on and keep trying. Overcoming Smooth Operators is quite the achievement, and it's sort of refreshing to play a management game that wants to destroy you constantly, rather than hand you a victory on a platter.\n\nYou can watch my quick playthrough here: http://youtu.be/Zzs8LtsJf3I","June 11, 2014","true","1.3"," 56 of 66 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","56","66","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/01z/recommended/262900/","01z","ZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/01z/","495 products in account","At the moment I'm some 5.5 hours into the game. Turns out it's not really a "simulation" nor a "strategy" game (as implied by the Steam tags) but a "click-and-wait" game. Luckily I got it at a decent discount.\n\nThe premise is promising and could make for a very interesting game. Thus it's a real shame it's almost not a game at all. Your business runs on its own and you just have to keep adding new rooms and people when you have the money -- and usually you don't have the money, so most of your time is spent waiting for money to accumulate. There's also not much to stop the money from accumulating, except for the random message dialogs that randomly pop up and require you to click "OK". The game is literally unable to advance a single in-game day without you being present clicking something. Forget about SimCity and the like where you could leave the game to run for an hour and come back. This game runs a minute or two and after that it need you to click a button.\n\nBuilding a new room into your call center costs $3000 or more. At least in the beginning (for the first couple of hours) you won't make more than a few hundred dollars a day, so you wait. And wait. And wait. Occasionally someone quits and you need to replace him or her, and that of course takes away from the small pile of money you had accumulated.\n\nUpgrading rooms costs $5000 or more, so your money seems much more well spent just adding rooms than upgrading them. Or at least I think so. The game lacks proper statistics so it's difficult to get an overview of your situation. Sure, you can read the thoughts of all of your employees and you can see a list of your clients (up to a whopping number of two (2) within my first 5.5 hours, or two in-game months), and you can click on all of your rooms and get to know some stats about them. But there's no list of rooms, or heat maps of any kind. There is a list of employees, but it appears that you cannot sort it, and the filter system (for choosing which types of employees you want to see) is really clumsy, requiring multiple clicks on a different screen from the actual list! So while you can get the details of a detail, there's no real big picture available.\n\nTalking about your employees, you can hire different kind of people: inbound (IB) agents to receive calls, outbound (OB) agents to make calls, managers, janitors, etc. The different professions are very stereotypical. They might've been true in the 1960s or funny in the 1990s, but seriously, it's 2016 now. When a manager's work description is "putting fear in the agents" and you see him running around and shouting at people, I don't even. Similarly, a "Coach" turned out to be a cheerleader girl waving pom-poms. Seriously??\n\nYou can also educate your employees (just a click of a button and ta-dah, they are instantly smarter!). The education levels are very sketchy too, like a manager learning a class "Management By Fear" or another person learning "Lying 101".\n\nYet another profession is the Project Manager. They unlock new things for you to do. However, you cannot decide what, so most of the time they unlock the possibility of building an even taller building (10 floors, 15 floors, ..., 50 floors, ...) when your building is still less than 5 floors tall and you'd much rather have, say, some better education levels or some new room types. (Not that it'd matter, you wouldn't have the money to buy those things anyway, until after waiting for quite some time.)\n\nAll in all this game seems to waste its potential really badly. It's not a game that you play intensively, but a game that you put into the background or on your second screen while facebooking or something, and just check out occasionally to click "OK" on that dialog. I believe I'll still give this game a chance for a couple of more hours to see if the money would start pouring in a little faster and if that would make it funnier, but I have my doubts.","January 7","false","5.6"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","0"

The first people unlocked are entirely based on how many days have passed. You won't get the janitor until after the second day, which leaves the office dirty the entire second day and makes employees unhappy. You won't unlock the Coaches (Employees that make others happy) until happyness because a problem. When you finally unlock the employee that unlocks other items you'll find that even 5 offices full of them have a rediculously slow research speed.\n\nThis game has a very vague information system. An employee will quit, why? "My dog is lonely at home" or "My sports team wins when I watch them at home." Very rarely will you find an excuse related to something they might have actually hated, like elevator queue times or Managers dragging down their morale. There is no research time table for unlocking items, you will never know when the next item will be unlocked or if you need more researchers.\n\nStarting out in this game is very difficult. You are given a client without any option of choice and the number of calls they want done is realistically not possible. Even with 20k it is very hard to get the number of officies  and employees to take all the calls. If you spend all your money trying to make this happen you will not have enough money to buy the offices or Janitors and IT techs when you really need them. On top of this, you will not get an elevator upgrade for a very long time, this causes an unhappiness black hole and you will see employees quit left and right, causing more financial ruin. Janitors are the most laughable programming when they come to their job too. They will stop cleaning a desk to use the restroom, they then return to their home desk before returning to the desk they were cleaning.\n\nIf you want to play a game like this, just look up Corporate Inc. a free flash game which Smooth Operators was clearly based on and save yourself $3.","July 26, 2014","false","3.8"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","20","31","2","0"

I thought it'd be something I maybe fired up for ten minutes and then dropped; something I could mention off-hand to the guys at work who think it's hilarious that I have played more than 50 hours of Euro Truck Simulator. However, it was surprisingly engaging - my first 40 minute session felt like a third of that and I only stopped as I was interrupted, and to my surprise I've since returned to the game.\n\nIt's a fairly straightforward management game, but so far seems well-balanced, introducing mechanics over time and neither too challenging to feel like good results are attainable, nor so easy that you feel like you're just coasting.\n\nThe basic mechanic is building up your building to build up your business (a la Unholy Heights), combined with a very rough sort of worker management - you can hire and fire staff, assign rooms full of them to accounts, educate them and essentially add modifiers to their mood/productivity etc. by hiring other staff. There are a variety of roles covered, so balancing the ratios is the part of the game you'll have to think about the most.\n\nFull disclosure, you will spend a fair bit of time just waiting - I presume that will be reduced as the game progresses and you start earning more money, but I've reached a slightly uneventful plateau where I just have to wait a couple of days to add a new building, and that's a little tiresome even on the highest speed.\n\nI like the art style - it's nothing novel, but it's well executed, and you should be able to see at a glance whether the visuals are for you.\n\nThe music is a little cheesy, but I guess that's to be expected from a game about a call centre.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this as a cheap purchase (I got it in a bundle), but this price seems pretty fair anyway. Don't buy it expecting an immersive cinematic experience, but for the money, it's pretty good.","January 31, 2015","true","3.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You also have to provide service staff to fix all your computer issues and provide general maintenance.\n\nThis game isn't a cakewalk, however, as balancing your funds and prioritising is paramount. You will not always be able to achieve what you'd like, and there is always something that is requiring of your attention (and money). The pixel art is great and overall looks polished.

It'd be nice to have some metrics screens to help identify poorly performing employees, to be able to adjust schedules of several employees at once, to be able to see the previous day's performance again after you've closed the screen that comes up at midnight, and some way to more easily tell what hours you are over/under-staffed (especially with L2s!).\n\nThere seem to be odd algorithm issues that could be improved, such as when you have multiple flowtubes and employees sometimes take unnecessarily long routes or when your elevators are upgraded and people get stuck on them quite awhile because of how the floor stops get queued.  Still, if you're a fan of casual tycoon/sim games, none of these are serious enough to ruin the game.\n\nThe biggest obstacle I ran into was IT staff quitting frequently because of the poor performance of the elevators (I finally caved and built them their own elevator at the end of the IT wing of the building).","September 13, 2014","true","39.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I read in a guide that you had to put down one elevator per building segment, which is unrealistic and utterly lame. You get limited real estate after all on the horizontal. You can apparently add more elevator cars, but you have to wait for a project manager to unlock it after days of waiting. The wait kills me.\n\n- It makes sense that computers break down, but they seem to do so way too much. This is unbalanced and frustrating.\n\n- Workers quit way too often. Is call center turnover this bad in real life? Jesus.\n\n- Seems like way too much grinding.\n\n- You can't cancel contracts. Why is this bad? When you don't do enough of the tasks per day, you get penalized $100 per Inbound, Outbound, or Backoffice category. It's frustrating when turnover is so high and it's hard to get enough productivity out of your shifting work force. It doesn't help computers break all. the. damn. time!\n\n- It costs a down payment to recruit personnel. Coupled with high turnover and your revenue begins to dwindle.\n\n- Actor Pathfinding is kind of bad...\n\nRegardless, I'll play this some more.

With better controls for improved management, I might be able to better wait out the time needed to accrue money for improvements or offices due to the profit margin in-game being so slim.  I've been able to do this with so many other games, but not this one.  Due to the lack of variety in rooms or perhaps general gameplay compared to other tower-based games, the game has caused my curiosity to eventually die from bordeom, and move on to an afterlife of better simulation games.\n\nI would only recommend buying this on sale if you are hardcore into sim games and have lots of patience, OR have a very strong interest in call centers.

The building of units reminds me of Sim Tower. The game itself is very hard and even more difficult if playing with an erection. Its probably one of those games which could get boring if it was too easy, but the difficulty is also slightly decreasing my enjoyment and I am wondering if the game might be impossible as at just 4 levels of tower block the elevator gets jammed, without enough funds to build a new one and the R&D guys just want to keep allowing more floors rather than a much needed elevator upgrade, and building stairs is not an option (which could also be a fire risk). I was also hoping more people would use the Relax Room before quitting, but it seems very few people use it and the game gets to the stage where you are either contantly giving vacations or people are quitting. I'm also wondering if there is an optimum "only one way" of beating this game when it comes to placing rooms. Its a challenge and Ive already found myself starting a new game several times, trying things in different ways in order to try and crack it. For a few quid it is worth it, and had I had known about this before seeing it in a bundle, I would have bought it for a few quid as it is worth it.","November 22, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get clients who offer different contracts that you have to fullfill in order to make money. There's a lot of things to manage, eg. cleaning of your offices, overcrowded restrooms, too busy elevators, working hours, salaries, maintenance, IT support, vacations and most importantly you have to makse sure your employees are happy. Just having to wait for an elevator too long can upset your staff and cripple the business.\n\nThis isn't an easy game. You'll probably end up restarting the game for a few times before you get a hang of things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akimbo1986/recommended/262900/","akimbo1986","Audi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akimbo1986/","562 products in account","Smooth Operators is a business simulation game wherein the player takes on the role of a CEO of a contract-based call center.\n\nStory		N/A				Aesthetics		The graphics consist of pixelated sprites on pixelated backgrounds. The art is aesthetically pleasing and contains a good bit of detail. Trash will build up throughout the day, cracks will appear as the buildings deteriorate, and the objects in rooms change when rooms are upgraded. The graphics are also clear and easy to understand with each room and employee color-coded and easy to distinguish.				Gameplay		The gameplay consists of building new rooms and facilities for your employees, managing the hiring and firing of your employees, assigning job tasks, researching new upgrades, and acquiring new contracts for your company. The room building is done on a grid system and the game encourages you to build up (as in Sim Tower, for easy comparison). One aspect of the game that was rather grating for me is that there is no way to mass select your employees. Moving an employee to a different desk is a chore. For someone like me that likes things to be organized, shifting my workforce around to ensure that like employees were in the appropriate room involves selecting the first employee, issuing a move command, selecting a separate empty desk, selecting the second employee, issuing another move command, moving them to the correct vacant desk, and then doing the same to get the first employee to the appropriate desk. Also, at the end of each day, you are presented a summary report of the day's activity that will kick you out of any menu you have open at midnight each day.				Sound		The sound design is very minimal in the game. You have a few looped chiptune-esque songs in the background that is mostly covered by the sounds of phones ringing, elevators going up and down floors, and your IT staff "repairing" computers.				Closing Thoughts		This game is competently made and performs its functions without hiccup, however, the game is just not fun, in my opinion. The tech tree is incredibly shallow and the game offers no greater strategic depth other than finding out an optimal room structure and then hiring enough workers to cover the amount of work your have to do for your contracts. I found myself playing the game with the speed slider turned all the way up and the game still felt like a slog. The problem is that the progression in the game is too slow. Perhaps this is to compensate for the lack of depth, but I spent more time waiting for money to roll in so I could build a new room (which I couldn't actually afford employees for then) than I did actually doing any meaningful tasks in the game. Business simulations like Rollercoaster Tycoon, Theme Hospital, etc. have better pacing so that you're never sitting around for days in game waiting for enough funds to come in. Maybe this is a symptom of the game being ported/targeted for mobile platforms. Either way, the game just doesn't have enough meat, enough of that "wow" factor to recommend.

You are able to give your company a name that you desire. You have to complete jobs to earn some money. Completing some Challenge (achievements) will give you some extra bonus Cash. Slowly but truly you will expend and become a true hit. But more things will be unlocked and causes for trouble.\n\nDestroying a room will only give a little bit of money back.\nUpgradeable Rooms\nTutorial ingame.\nThere are not alot of music variety.\nThere is an option to change the volume of the Sound/Music with a slidebar\nAble to speed up time.\nThere are many Save slots.\n\nOther things.\nBirds are able to enter the office floors?\nEach day you get a \"tip of the day\" and able to save your game.\nReminds me of \"Sim Tower\"\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10","June 1","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Enjoy it you ♥♥♥♥s. Otherwised save your money for weaboo ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nLOOOOOOOOOOOONG Version.\nFirst things first before we begin another session of '♥♥♥♥ me i'm bored so lets write a review please go to the following website and play the following ♥♥♥♥ing game for at least 2 hours. Dont worry its addicting and you will somehow spend more than the requested time with the stupid game. Dont worry, the review can wait.\n\nhttp://armorgames.com/play/7348/corporation-inc\n\nDone? No? Go back you ♥♥♥♥ing idiot.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nDone for real? Good, lets get on with the ♥♥♥♥ing show.\n\n1.What the ♥♥♥♥ is [Insert game title here]\nEssentially its just a more improved version of that game i just forcefully shoved down your throat where the objective is to manage a call center [or a muffin button pushing company in that link i gave you.] and prevent the collapse by a number of highly subjective factors also note i use the word improved very loosely. On with the show please! *clap clap*\n\n2.Graphics\ncompare to the that link call center chaos has an extremely terrible looking graphics, actually its on par but its my opinion and i hate it but sure doesnt help that game is fun. Its 2D pixelated ♥♥♥♥♥ representing the everyday mundane object of an office enviroment but its a ♥♥♥♥ing lie because my old office dont have water cooler nor cute furry cats! It looks, feels and taste retro style but ♥♥♥♥ it i hate it.\n\n3.Sounds\nPeople with sound sensitivity beware, its annoying. Seriously, it buzzes all day long and most of the sounds kept on repeating due to how often your staff push their big fat finger onto the keyboard and invoking the *taptaptaptaptaptap* noise so prevalent in this game but ♥♥♥♥ it you need money. It sounds appropriate enough like a real office which is to say its ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. 10/10 SOTY. [SOUND OF THE ♥♥♥♥ING YEAR]\n\n4.Gameplay\nAnd here is where the game crash the most. Its good fun, addicting managing your little company to eventual stardom where you can build ♥♥♥♥ing  TELEPORTER  because the ♥♥♥♥ing lifts are not fast enough. You can micro manage the daily scedule of your minions and even build floors upon floors of bland offices and nasty smelling bathroom that only accomodate 4 people at a time unless people goes back HOME to ♥♥♥♥ which is ridiculous because i would have gotten fired for it. Speaking of which the micro section is the game's downfall for me, sure its fun setting schedule and giving them holidays but if only there was a damn option to disable em because i want my employee to just ♥♥♥♥ing be a MINION not human beings with feely feely feelings and needs and desires. ♥♥♥♥ that. Also for some strange reason essential items are locked behind the research section! The hell.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFOR those who enjoyed that damn link........... oh who am i kidding?! its Armorgames.com you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥s and yeah if you enjoy it then feel free to pick this gem of management chaos up. Cheers matey.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

As you build your ultimate call center you will rapidly wonder why the hell there isn't any possibility to apply day work schedule in bulk which seems obvious or apply salary policies also in bulk. The micro management brings nothing to the game but waste of time.You will notice then how unfnished this game was with the impossibility to cancel the customer contracts that you would nevener had signed. Finally the irrelvance of the few concepts of the game such as lifts rapidly overcrowded and making your employees so unhappy. The developpers built into artificial element to create the difficulty.

It's really hard to fail in this one, so the only thing you need to be prepared for is spend some time after building your first floor, and with every next one. This game looks nice, have some cool options BUT if this could be a little bit harder, a little bit advanced - it would for sure be more sucessful. At least it's cheap, so you don't feel like you have wasted money on simply game. Managing a call center sure is unique idea but in case of this game, it really feels like it could be done better.

The only major gripes i have is that it has a bit more boring micro managing than i like, having to upgrade each employee/room by hand after getting them with no option to buy them at the upper levels that have been unlocked. Doing so for 36 people and 9 rooms gets a bit tiring. Also, the difficulty of manuvering around the building without a minimap of some kind to get around quicker. Even the ability to save camera positions would be nice. Other than that its a decent game. Thou without more to do, once i finish my 100 days on my current game, i dont see myself returning for another playthrough anytime soon.

Unfortuantely, the game isn't very enjoyable though. Too many buildings and staff are locked at the beginning of the game, and you kinda need them beforehand. Also it took me 9 in-game days just to be able to get HR staff, 9! You cant change schedules of your employees or anything until day 9, then you have to have the money to build the building, then hire the staff, etc.\n\nThe game is a grind in a bad way, but perhaps that's intentional, perhaps it is meant to be a statement on how call centers are, and I guess mission accomplished if that was the goal. Still, I would have wanted something with more humor, satire, and freedom in the gameplay. Also the sound effects get REALLY annoying since they can stagger, I guess again it is probably intentional, but it makes for a better statement of the call center world than it does an enjoyable simulation game.","June 12, 2014","false","1.3"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

Many problems are found in the first 30 minutes of playing (e.g. "hire X person to enable upgrade feature". Hire that person, game still says "hire this person to enable this feature"). Controls are frustrating (Can't easily move people between desks, have to do 1 at a time, which becomes increasingly lengthy when your offices are jam packed. This includes other micro-managing such as schedules, very cumbersome and frustrating design), the reports are semi-pointless and unhelpful, many offer no useful information and they also don't link to in-game objects (can see a report of employee happiness, but cant click to view employee, you must remember their name and scourer through your offices trying to find them). This game lacks a lot, and while it could be an excellent sim with a great and fun concept, it is poorly designed and bites off more than it can chew.

The mechanics are linear and do not require much thought, placing this game firmly in the "Time burner" category as you sit and watch sprites run around the screen and moan about how poorly a job your janitors are doing at cleaning up after your other employees.\n\nI had some fun for a discounted price and if anything Ive said interests you, you probably will have fun for awhile too.","February 29","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gets even more annoying when you have to micro manage each and every staff using a very poorly designed UI. Staff quit for no reason (even after you have spent time training them), your clients will have very unrealistic expectations (daily targets) and penalise you daily for not fulfilling it. Overall a good time waster but lacks depth and becomes extremely repetitive after about 5 hours in. Skip it and save your money.","November 28, 2015","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even on the biggest speed the day takes just too long, which is really annoying. The other thing which sucks is that when you scroll the view with mouse and or buttons, the screen scroll speed is really slow and if you have a really big corporation then again - it gets annoying and that's about it.. I didn't really saw bugs or glitches, it is really simple game otherwise, I would say 2€ is a roof for its pricing.\n\nIf you wIll not concider those two things as a major problem and you are into strategy/simulation games, then you should be okay with it to try, of course if you will grab it for less than 3 euros.\n\nIt's a fun game, I just wish developer can at least give us an option menu for settings like scroll speed and would increase speed of day running.","November 21, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
