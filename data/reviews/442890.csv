The current one to get better times is great and all but a higher system than just 99k and lvl 10. New game+ could take it to level 200 and then some.\n\nSteam why cant you give me a neutral button. The graphics are great and so is the sound track. The game is fine in its tiny form but could be much better to suit the price tag on it.\n\nAt 5$ its a good price.","March 13","false","13.7"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","0"

It's a nice game to play, with great effect quality, and (definitely not leaving this out) AMAZING music! For a game with very little action, it has very good music that I found myself enjoying immensly!\n\nAs stated above, it's an extremely short game (although longer with the hard mode), but it's definitely one to look for when on sale. Heck, it's on sale for a dollar off, and while I wouldn't recommend it too strongly to others at that price, I'm definitely keeping this game.","March 11","true","2.6"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","0"

There's actually not much interactivity, it's  kind of like a slightly more interactive Progress Quest.\n\nGameplay is as follows: You send the main character, Pastel, in to the dungeon and she will automatically kill things and gather reagents as she travels down.  Whenever either of those actions occurs she gains RP, which can be spent on various skills from bonus damage to more health to bonuses against specific enemies.  Every 10 floors or so there will be a boss battle, which is basically just an enemy with more HP.\n\nThat's the whole game.  And you can max out and beat it fairly quickly, before getting all the Steam Cards even!  I thought it was cute and idly fun enough to be worth the price, but that is up to the individual.","March 11","true","2.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

You automatically proceed through the dungeon and only interact by purchasing new upgrades.\n\nSo far, the content seems a bit limited, I don't know if it's worth the full price. On sale, it may be a more palatable purchase.\n\nOne thing about this genre though is that there are often surprises. If I get a few hours in and find that it really opens up, I'll update this review accordingly.\n\nEdit:\n\nLooks to be about 2 hours of gameply. I don't have much desire to play it again. Maybe they'll improve it in the future.\n\nSomething little like a bonus perk every time you complete the game would go a looong way for replayability.","March 11","true","1.7"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Bought it, only to find out . . . they forgot to put any actual game into this. I didn't expect a whole lot from the trailer, but I expected more than nothing. This is the kind of thing you download on your phone out of curiosity when you have a few minutes to waste, only to prompty delete it and forget it ever existed.\n\nWaste of time. Waste of disc space. Waste of money. Its creators should be ashamed of charging money for it.","March 16","false","1.5"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

But as you come close to the finish, things inflate at an exponential rate (damages, healed HP etc) such that the earlier gameplay (and the balance) is lost.\n\nGood ideas executed with that "Japanese-y" cuteness. Good music as well. If you enjoyed Cookie Clicker and are a 'light' gamer (who don't expect a game to be played over & over and for countless hours), you will like this. Just be aware that it's a very short game.","April 9","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You don't really do anything aside from spend points to not have to start over as often. The game extends itself by putting in roadblocks to start you over if you haven't leveled up enough before them.\n\nThe music and character are good, but not for the $10 asking price. If it were on sale for a couple dollars, you might find it worth that.","March 20","false","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/442890/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: A cute "auto-adventure" game that's sort of a "casual min-maxer" (trust me).  The usual price may be a bit high unless you really want to delve into different play modes and achievements, but the easy-yet-challenging rules, clever streamlined presentation, and fun soundtrack make it worth keeping an eye on.\n\nMagic Potion Explorer's plot is simple - a young alchemist complains about her need to find ingredients, and a mysterious woman provides her a dungeon below her potion shop.  Armed with an alchemic squirtgun, our heroine Pastel, wanders into the dungeon.  There she harvests resources, battles monsters, and brews potions on her way to figure out what's up, and who's butt she has to kick to get this abomination removed from beneath her store.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple . . .  kind of.\n\nMagic Potion Explorer's adventuring is completely automated.  Pastel goes through the dungeon, find resources, and battles monsters.  Your goal as the player is to choose which potions she brews to affect her abilities.  That's where it gets a bit complex.\n\nMagic Potion Explorer is essentially a casual game for min/maxers who love to tweak abilities.  Some abilities add, some multiply, some affect capacity, some healing.  There's an entire screen just of the math behind the character.  Having to choose which potion to brew - or if to wait to gather enough resources to unlock others - is a core part of the game.\n\nDepending on difficulty, if Pastel is defeated she returns to her shop or she returns without any potions and starts over except for some bonus resources.  Fortunately the deeper you get the more the game accelerates easier levels, so you can keep delving in less and less time.\n\nThe game is also accompanied by a great, dynamic soundtrack; the frenetic auto-adventuring and the fast-paced music played during the game really set the mood, the incidental music for calmer moments is a nice contrast.  I'd say the soundtrack is a major strength of Magic Potion Explorer.\n\nIs this game worth it?  The game's two different play modes and multiple achievements will provide some challenge if you're up for them, though the deliberately limited and focused gameplay may not be for everyone.  At $9.99 it's something to think over - if it was cheaper I'd be a little freer to reccomend it.\n\nI bought it and had a ball.  It was a nice casual/intense mix that I was looking for at the time, and I always like to see games experiment.\n\nSo who should get Magic Potion Explorer.\n* Someone who wants a kind of casual/stats-raising mix.  It's a good evening game for someone so inclined.\n* Someone into streamlined games and games that play with modes.  As a study in creating an effective minimalist game, it's quite good.\n* If you're not sure and the game is on sale enough to make you sure.\n","March 19","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
